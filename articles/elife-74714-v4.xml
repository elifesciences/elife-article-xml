including neuromuscular and brain development. Nup358 interacts with the dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits the dynein machinery to position the nucleus. However, the molecular mechanisms of the Nup358/BicD2 interaction and the activation of transport remain poorly understood. Here for the first time, we show that a minimal Nup358 domain activates dynein/dynactin/BicD2 for processive motility on microtubules. Using nuclear magnetic resonance titration and chemical exchange saturation transfer, mutagenesis, and circular dichroism spectroscopy, a Nup358 α-helix encompassing residues 2162–2184 was identified, which transitioned from a random coil to an α-helical conformation upon BicD2 binding and formed the core of the Nup358-BicD2 interface. Mutations in this region of Nup358 decreased the Nup358/BicD2 interaction, resulting in decreased dynein recruitment and impaired motility. BicD2 thus recognizes Nup358 through a ‘cargo recognition α-helix,’ a structural feature that may stabilize BicD2 in its activated state and promote processive dynein motility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bidirectional transport</kwd><kwd>dynein</kwd><kwd>nuclear positioning</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>TIRF</kwd><kwd>BicD2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM144578</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>M Yusuf</given-names></name><name><surname>Solmaz</surname><given-names>Sozanne R</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chunyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA206592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chunyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG069039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chunyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15 GM128119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solmaz</surname><given-names>Sozanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chemistry Department and the Research Foundation of SUNY</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Solmaz</surname><given-names>Sozanne R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trybus</surname><given-names>Kathleen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R03 NS114115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ali</surname><given-names>M Yusuf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cargo recognition α-helix was identified in Nup358, which is required for activation of a dynein-dependent transport pathway that is essential for brain development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cytoplasmic dynein is the predominant motor responsible for minus-end-directed traffic on microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reck-Peterson et al., 2018</xref>), which facilitates a vast number of transport events that are critical for chromosome segregation, signal transmission at synapses, and brain and muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>;

Cargoes are required to activate BicD2 for dynein binding, which is a key regulatory step for dynein-dependent transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlager et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlager et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). In the absence of cargo adaptor/dynein adaptor complexes such as Nup358/BicD2, dynein and dynactin are autoinhibited and only show diffusive motion on microtubules. Furthermore, in the absence of cargoes, BicD2 assumes a looped, autoinhibited conformation, in which its N-terminal dynein/dynactin-binding site binds to the CTD and remains inaccessible. The CTD is required for autoinhibition as a truncated BicD2 without the CTD activates dynein/dynactin for processive motility. Binding of cargo to the CTD releases autoinhibition, likely resulting in an extended conformation that recruits dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlager et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlager et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). The crystal structures of the C-terminal cargo recognition domains of three BicD2 homologs have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noell et al., 2019</xref>). However, to date, there are no detailed structural studies of BicD2/cargo complexes and the structural mechanisms of BicD2-mediated cargo recognition and dynein activation remain poorly understood.</p><p>The binding partners for human BicD2 include Nup358 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>), Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>), and nesprin-2G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>). Nup358, also known as RanBP2, is a 358 kDa nuclear pore complex protein with multiple functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wu et al., 1995</xref>). During G2 phase, Nup358 engages in a pathway for positioning of the nucleus relative to the centrosome along microtubules by binding to BicD2, which in turn recruits dynein and dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>). This pathway is essential for apical nuclear migration during differentiation of radial glial progenitor cells, which give rise to the majority of neurons and glia cells of the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baffet et al., 2015</xref>). A second nuclear positioning pathway is facilitated by BicD2/dynein and nesprin-2G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>), a component of linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton (LINC) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fridolfsson et al., 2010</xref>), which is important for migration of post-mitotic neurons during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>). Apart from its roles in nuclear positioning, BicD2 is also involved in the transport of Golgi-derived and secretory vesicles. In this process, BicD2 and dynein are recruited by the vesicle-associated small GTPase Rab6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grigoriev et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, BicD2 plays important roles in faithful chromosome segregation, neurotransmission at synapses, as well as brain and muscle development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baffet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>).

Although IDRs and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) make up ~30% of eukaryotic proteins and have important physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward et al., 2004</xref>), they remain the most poorly characterized class of proteins in regards to their structure, dynamics, and interactions. IDRs play important roles in dynein biology. For example, an IDR in the dynein light intermediate chain 1 (LIC1) undergoes a coil-to-α-helix transition when it interacts with the N-terminal domain of BicD2, which is an important step in the activation of dynein for processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celestino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). A second, larger interface is formed between the N-terminal coiled coil of BicD2, the dynein tail, and dynactin, which promotes activation of dynein for processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlager et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, the mechanism of dynein activation by full length BicD2/cargo complexes is not well understood since much of the available information pertaining to dynein activation was derived from studies with isolated BicD2 fragments.</p><p>In addition to BicD2, Nup358 also recruits the opposite polarity motor kinesin-1 via the subunit kinesin-1 light chain 2 (KLC2), which binds to a W-acidic motif with the sequence LEWD in Nup358 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dodding et al., 2011</xref>). While dynein is the predominant motor in G2 phase, kinesin-1 is also actively involved in nuclear positioning in G2 phase, modulating overall motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>). Such bidirectional transport is also displayed by mitochondria, endosomes, viruses, phagosomes, secretory vesicles, and many vesicles in neuronal axons and growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolhy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morris and Hollenbeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dharan and Campbell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>). Opposite polarity motors such as BicD2/dynein and kinesin-1 often bind in close spatial proximity to adapter-binding proteins such as Nup358, but it is unknown how their overall motility is regulated, likely because their interactions remain poorly characterized by structural and biophysical methods.</p><p>Here, we have determined the structural properties of the interface of a minimal Nup358/BicD2 complex by a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mutagenesis, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. These results establish a structural basis for cargo recognition by BicD2 and suggest that Nup358 interacts with BicD2 through a ‘cargo recognition’ α-helix. Direct activation of BicD2 by Nup358 has not been shown before. Here, we use single-molecule-binding and processivity assays to show that a minimal dimerized Nup358 construct is sufficient to activate full-length dynein/dynactin/BicD2 complexes for processive motility. Mutations of the cargo recognition α-helix of Nup358 decreased the Nup358/BicD2 interaction and resulted in decreased dynein recruitment and impaired motility, shedding light on the important role of the cargo recognition α-helix for the activation of BicD2 and dynein motility. Intriguingly, our results also show that the binding site of BicD2 in Nup358 is spatially close to but does not overlap with the LEWD motif that acts as a kinesin-1-binding site, suggesting that the kinesin and dynein machineries may interact simultaneously via Nup358. Our results thus provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of bidirectional transport by adapter-binding proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ITC establishes a minimal complex for Nup358/BicD2 interaction</title><p>Previously, we have determined an X-ray structure of the CTD of human BicD2 (BicD2-CTD, residues 715–804), which contains the binding sites for cargoes, including human Nup358 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noell et al., 2019</xref>). A complex was reconstituted with BicD2-CTD and a minimal fragment of human Nup358 containing residues 2148–2240, which is called Nup358-min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Here, the affinity of the BicD2-CTD towards Nup358-min was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ITC thermogram fits well to a one-site-binding model (with a single-equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>). The number of sites was determined to be N = 1.0, which is consistent with a molar ratio of [Nup358]/[BicD2] of 1. This molar ratio is in agreement with our previously published molar masses obtained from size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), which showed that Nup358 and BicD2 form a 2:2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noell et al., 2018</xref>). The one-site-binding model and the 2:2 stoichiometry are in line with Nup358-min binding as a dimer to a single binding site on a BicD2 coiled-coil dimer, although we cannot exclude the possibility that two Nup358 monomers bind to two binding sites on BicD2, where both sites have the same dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>. We also attempted to fit models assuming multiple binding sites and K<sub>Ds</sub>, but those are not supported by the ITC thermogram. The equilibrium dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub> was determined to be 1.7 ± 0.9 μM, in a similar range as observed for other BicD2/cargo complexes as well as to the previously published affinity of 0.4 μM, obtained for BicD2-CTD towards a larger fragment of Nup358 (residues 2006–2443, with the GST-tag intact) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noell et al., 2018</xref>). An ITC titration of Nup358-min-GST (i.e., with the GST-tag intact, whereas the GST was cleaved off in the first experiment) with BicD2-CTD yielded a very similar affinity of 1.6 ± 1.0 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that the GST-tag does not affect the binding affinity. These ITC results confirm the mapped boundaries of the minimal binding site. The ITC analysis finally revealed that the Nup358-BicD2 interaction is driven by a favorable enthalpy change (ΔH = –19.2 ± 0.7 kcal/mol), which overcomes the unfavorable entropy change (ΔS = –38.2 ± 5.8 cal/mol/K).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The DD-BicD2-Nup358<sup>min</sup> complex moves processively on microtubules</title><p>Single-molecule reconstitutions were used to determine if the adaptor-binding protein Nup358<sup>min</sup> can bind and relieve BicD2 autoinhibition, which in turn allows dynein and dynactin (DD) to be recruited and activated for processive motion.

These motile properties of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> were compared with that of the DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complex (B<sup>CC1</sup>, the N-terminal coiled-coil 1 domain of BicD2), a well-established fully active complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e and f</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video3">Figure 2—video 3</xref>). The speed and run length of the DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complex were 0.53 ± 0.28 µm/s (n = 137) and 4.8 ± 0.14 µm (n = 137), respectively, which are significantly faster (p=0.0022) and longer (p&lt;0.0001 than that of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g and h</xref>). The number of processive events of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> on MTs is approximately half that of the active DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). Importantly, the directed motion of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> is very different from the autoinhibited DD complex, which shows only diffusive movement on MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>). The enhanced number of processive events only in the presence of both BicD2 and Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> suggests that Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> functionally relieves the autoinhibition of BicD2 so that DD can bind and move processively on MTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NMR titration mapped the BicD2-binding site to the N-terminal half of Nup358-min</title><p>Because our single-molecule processivity assays confirmed that the Nup358-min domain forms a DDBN complex that is activated for processive motility, we characterized the BicD2-binding site on Nup358-min, employing solution NMR, which can provide atomic resolution information for protein interactions in the native solution state. First, backbone assignment of Nup358-min was carried out using standard triple resonance experiments, 3D HNCO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kay et al., 1990</xref>), HNCACO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clubb et al., 1992</xref>), HNCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kay et al., 1990</xref>), HNCACB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grzesiek and Bax, 1992</xref>), and CBCACONH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grzesiek and Bax, 2002</xref>). 82 of the 89 total backbone amides were assigned in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The HSQC spectrum of the apo Nup358-min is characterized by a lack of dispersion, consistent with an IDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of backbone chemical shifts (CA, CB, CO, N, and HN) of Nup358-min by TALOS-N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shen and Bax, 2013</xref>) conclusively demonstrates that Nup358-min is a random coil in the apo state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although the addition of BicD2-CTD resulted in little peak movement in the HSQC, significant peak intensity changes were observed for the N-terminal half of Nup358-min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>).

Therefore, kinesin-1 and the dynein adaptor BicD2 may bind to separate but spatially close binding sites on the cargo Nup358.

To further characterize the BicD2/Nup358 interface with NMR, chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) experiments were performed. CEST has recently emerged as a powerful technique in solution NMR for measuring the chemical shifts of NMR invisible states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vallurupalli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlier et al., 2017</xref>), such as the BicD2-CTD-bound state of Nup358-min, whose resonances are absent from the <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). In CEST, when the invisible state is saturated by a weak and long radiofrequency (RF) pulse (B<sub>1</sub>), the saturation of the bound state will be transferred to the free state due to Nup358-min dissociating from the Nup358-min-BicD2 complex, causing a dip in peak intensity when B<sub>1</sub> is on resonance with the bound state chemical shift, generating the minor dip in the CEST curve. If the chemical shifts of bound and unbound state are significantly different, which is, for example, the case for interface residues or residues that undergo structural changes upon complex formation, this difference gives rise to a double-dip appearance in the CEST profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and d</xref>). The major dip in the profile will be observed at the chemical shift of the free or unbound state (when the B<sub>1</sub> matches the chemical shift of unbound resonance, the ‘visible state’). The second, smaller dip in the profile peak will be observed at the chemical shift of the bound state (due to saturation transfer from the ‘invisible state’). In contrast, residues that are not located at the complex interface or do not undergo structural changes upon complex formation will result in resonances without chemical exchange and the CEST profile will only show a single dip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>), corresponding to the chemical shift of the unbound state.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) maps chemical shifts of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-invisible, BicD2-bound state of Nup358.</title><p>In the CEST profile curve, E2194 and I2211 have only a single dip in <sup>15</sup>N-CEST (<bold>a</bold>) and <sup>13</sup>C′-CEST (<bold>b</bold>), respectively, due to little chemical shift perturbation upon BicD2-CTD binding. This suggests that E2194 is not at the binding interface and does not undergo conformational transition upon BicD2-CTD binding.

<sup>15</sup>N amide and the <sup>13</sup>C carbonyl (C′) resonances. In <sup>15</sup>N CEST NMR experiments, the following residues were identified as interface residues or residues that undergo structural transition because of the double-dip appearance in the CEST profile: A2163, A2164, K2165, L2166, I2167, K2178, and L2184 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For these residues, CEST indicates a significant chemical shift difference between their bound and unbound states. Using the program RING NMR Dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckwith et al., 2020</xref>), the CEST data were fit to obtain chemical shift difference between free and bound state (Δδ), the exchange rate (k<sub>ex</sub>), and the fractional minor population (P<sub>b</sub>) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1a and b</xref>). The weighted average of the <sup>15</sup>N CEST fit parameters resulted in k<sub>ex</sub> = 200 ± 70 s<sup>–1</sup>, consistent with slow to intermediate exchange (k<sub>ex</sub> &lt; Δω) on an NMR time scale. The weighted average of the minor population (P<sub>b</sub>) is 0.04 ± 0.01, which is consistent with our sample preparation at a molar ratio of 1:20 for BicD2-CTD:<sup>15</sup>N-Nup358-min. Many peaks in the <sup>15</sup>N-CEST suffered from low signal-to-noise ratio and resonance overlap common in IDPs, preventing the determination of additional chemical shifts of invisible states. To overcome this problem, we further carried out <sup>13</sup>C′-CEST experiments based on HNCO, which correlates amides (HN) with the carbonyl (CO) of the <italic>preceding</italic> residue. Here, the saturation pulse B<sub>1</sub> is on the carbonyl, and the intensity change due to saturation is still reported in an <sup>15</sup>N-HSQC-like 2D spectrum. This method provided additional data for residues missed with the <sup>15</sup>N CEST due to resonance overlap or low signal-to-noise ratio. For example, the F2183 peak in <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC was overlapped. However, the L2184 peak, a well-resolved signal with high S/N, showed a CEST effect from the saturation of the F2183 carbonyl in HNCO-based <sup>13</sup>C′-CEST. With the <sup>13</sup>C HNCO-CEST experiment, we were able to observe minor states in the following residues: R2162, A2164, K2165, L2166, R2169, E2171, E2172, L2177, K2181, F2183, and L2184 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1c</xref>). Thus, with CEST, we were able to further map the binding region to residues 2162–2184 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>). Fitting of HNCO-CEST profiles with RING Dynamics resulted in a global exchange rate of 270 ± 50 s<sup>–1</sup>, in reasonable agreement with the value of k<sub>ex</sub> from <sup>15</sup>N CEST. k<sub>ex</sub> obtained here is much slower in time scale than the rate of coil-to-α-helix transition in model peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that the k<sub>ex</sub> obtained by CEST include contributions from other events, such as binding and oligomerization, in addition to coil-to-α-helix transition, consistent with similar observations for other binding studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlier et al., 2017</xref>). The weighted average of the minor population (P<sub>b</sub>) is 0.06 ± 0.01, which is again consistent with the ratio in which we mixed the two proteins for the NMR sample. The 18 CEST profiles with double-dip appearance all resulted in chemical shift changes in the direction and magnitude as expected for a coil-to-α-helix transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wishart, 2011</xref>) (typically the chemical shift for <sup>15</sup>N becomes lower in the helical conformation, and higher for <sup>13</sup>C, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The CEST results suggest that residues 2162–2184 of Nup358 undergo coil-to-α-helix transition upon binding to BicD2, revealing that BicD2 recognizes Nup358 through a short ‘cargo recognition α-helix,’ which is embedded in an IDP domain.</p><p>To provide further evidence for the coil-to-α-helix transition<bold>,</bold> CD spectroscopy was carried out.

First, we reconstituted a minimal Nup358-min/BicD2-CTD complex with μM affinity. Single-molecule processivity assays revealed that a dimerized Nup358-min domain forms a complex with dynein/dynactin/BicD2 (DDBN) that shows robust processive motility on microtubules. Similarly, the small GTPase Rab6a<sup>GTP</sup> that links BicD2 to membranous cargo promotes processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huynh and Vale, 2017</xref>), suggesting that both adaptor-binding proteins act to release the autoinhibition of BicD2. Dimerization of Nup358-min enhances interaction with BicD2 and with the DDB complex, suggesting that activation is linked to oligomerization, which for Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> could occur by clustering on the vesicular membrane.</p><p>NMR titration of BicD2-CTD into <sup>15</sup>N labeled Nup358-min mapped the binding region to the N-terminal half of Nup358-min. Furthermore, we obtained chemical shifts for the CA and CB atoms for the apo state of Nup358-min, which confirm that the apo state is intrinsically disordered. Due to slow chemical exchange on the NMR time scale and fast relaxation in the BicD2-bound state of Nup358-min, this state cannot be directly observed in standard NMR experiments, and thus a powerful solution NMR technique termed CEST was applied to map the chemical shifts of the ‘invisible state.’ This approach not only identified key residues at the Nup358/BicD2 interface, but also showed that chemical shift changes upon binding are consistent with a coil-to-α-helix transition in Nup358-min. Notably, the coil-to-α-helix conformational change is supported by our results from CD spectroscopy and SAXS, and the BicD2/Nup358 interface was validated by mutagenesis. The observed time scale is also in line with other proteins undergoing coil-to-α-helix transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlier et al., 2017</xref>). However, it should be noted that in order to obtain higher-resolution structural information, the chemical shifts for the CA and CB atoms of Nup358-min in the bound state remain to be determined in the future. Notably, our functional assays highlight the important role of the interaction between Nup358 and BicD2 in dynein activation. Single-molecule-binding assays showed that mutagenesis of the Nup358 cargo recognition α-helix diminished the interaction of Nup358-min with full-length BicD2 and decreased the formation of dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 complexes (DDBN). Furthermore, the mutant DDBN complexes that were formed exhibited reduced run length and speed reflecting formation of a less stable complex. Our data highlight the important role of dynein activating-adaptor/adaptor-binding protein interactions in activating and fine-tuning dynein motility.</p><p>Our data establish that BicD2 recognizes its cargo-binding protein Nup358 through an α-helix of ~28 residues. Coil-to-α-helix transitions and folding upon binding, as shown here, have been observed in many studies of IDP/IDR interactions and recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celestino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlier et al., 2017</xref>). We propose that the dynein activating-adaptor BicD2 recognizes its cargoes through a ‘cargo recognition α-helix’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is conceivable that the cargo adaptors Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> and nesprin-2G are also recognized by similar short α-helices, although this needs to be confirmed by future experiments. Rab6<sup>GTP</sup> binds to BicD2 with 10-fold higher affinity compared to Rab6<sup>GDP</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergbrede et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Saez et al., 2006</xref>) and associated structural changes are found in the Switch I and Switch II regions of Rab6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garcia-Saez et al., 2006</xref>), which include short α-helices and intrinsically disordered domains and are possibly candidates for the BicD2-binding site. The mapped nesprin-2G-binding domain for BicD2 is also predicted to be largely intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Our data thus suggest a structural basis for cargo recognition by BicD2 and will enable further studies aimed at identifying cell cycle-specific regulatory mechanisms for distinct transport pathways that are facilitated by BicD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gonçalves et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Matanis et al., 2002</xref>). For example, our Nup358 mutants that selectively target the interaction with BicD2 can be used to dissect biological roles of the Nup358/BicD2, Rab6/BicD2, and nesprin 2G/BicD2 pathways in distinct stages of brain development.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>We propose that BicD2 recognizes its cargo through a short ‘cargo recognition α-helix,’ which may also be a structural feature that stabilizes the activated state of BicD2 for the recruitment of dynein and dynactin.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cutaway view of half of an NPC. Each of the eight spokes of the NPC contains four molecules of Nup358 on the cytoplasmic side (i.e., 32 in total), which provide binding sites for dynein (via BicD2) and kinesin-1 (via KLC2). Nup358 makes up most of the mass of the cytoplasmic filaments of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">von Appen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ori et al., 2013</xref>).

Apo-Nup358 contains many intrinsically disordered regions (IDR), including the BicD2-binding region. Upon binding of Nup358 to BicD2, a short α-helix is formed at the Nup358/BicD2 interface, which is a structural feature that stabilizes BicD2 in the active state. Binding of Nup358 to BicD2 likely promotes loop opening, which activates BicD2 for dynein/dynactin recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>).

We and others have recently proposed that cargo binding activates BicD2 for dynein recruitment by inducing a coiled-coil registry shift in BicD2 (i.e., a vertical displacement of the two α-helices against each other by one helical turn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Terawaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of cargo, BicD2 forms an autoinhibited state that cannot recruit dynein, with the CTD masking the N-terminal dynein/dynactin-binding site (NTD). When cargo is loaded, BicD2 can directly link dynein with its activator dynactin, which is required to activate dynein for processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Splinter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schlager et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schlager et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2020</xref>). We recently showed that an F684I mutant of the <italic>Drosophila (Dm</italic>) homolog BicD can activate dynein/dynactin for processive motility in the absence of cargo. X-ray structures of the WT and F684I mutant as well as molecular dynamics simulations suggest that this activating mutation causes a coiled-coil registry shift in the <italic>Dm</italic> BicD-CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Noell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2020</xref>). It is tempting to hypothesize that the cargo recognition helix of Nup358 intercalates into the coiled-coil of the BicD2-CTD to stabilize a coiled-coil registry shift in the Nup358/BicD2 complex, resulting in activation of BicD2 for dynein recruitment. This hypothesis remains to be experimentally confirmed.</p><p>Nup358-min binds more strongly to the dynein/dynactin/BicD2 complex compared to full-length BicD2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). This observation supports the proposed loop-opening activation mechanism of BicD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoogenraad et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b and c</xref>). In the full-length dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 (DDBN) complex, once Nup358 binding displaces the autoinhibited loop, dynein and dynactin bind and prevent its reformation. This is not true in the full-length BicD2/Nup358 complex, resulting in a lower apparent affinity than in the full complex. It is also possible that additional weak interfaces further stabilize the DDBN complex compared to Nup358/BicD2 or the DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complex. Here, we observed a direct interaction of Nup358 with DD that could contribute to enhanced affinity. It has been shown for several cargo adaptors that they interact weakly with the dynein light chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tai et al., 1999</xref>) and the dynein LIC1 forms a small interface with the so-called CC1 box of BicD2, which is required for the activation of processive motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celestino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sweeney and Holzbaur, 2018</xref>). Cargoes and adaptors often interact through multiple interfaces with motors, and these additional interfaces in many cases enhance overall motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Urnavicius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Celestino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sanger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blasius et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The affinity of the monomeric cargo Nup358-min for BicD2 is enhanced by dimerization by a leucine zipper, similar to what was previously observed for binding of the cargo Egalitarian for <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McClintock et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is conceivable that a Nup358-min dimer binds to a BicD2 dimer, which is also in line with our ITC results, which reveal a single K<sub>D</sub>. While Nup358-min is a monomer on its own, it oligomerizes to form 2:2 complexes with either the BicD2-CTD or the KLC2, and also forms a ternary complex with both BicD2-CTD and KLC2 with 2:2:2 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Noell et al., 2018</xref>). We thus propose that cargo adaptor-induced dimerization may potentially be a universal feature of the activation mechanism since BicD2 and KLC2 both form dimers in active dynein and kinesin-1 motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McKenney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Urnavicius et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cockburn et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, NMR titration showed that BicD2 binding has no effect on the NMR signal of the LEWD motif of Nup358 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which can interact directly with KLC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). These data further suggest that the Nup358-min domain is potentially capable of recruiting both dynein and kinesin-1 machineries for bidirectional positioning of the nucleus, although this remains to be confirmed in the context of full-length proteins and intact motors. Intriguingly, our NMR data show that the BicD2-binding site is only separated by 30 residues from the LEWD motif that acts as KLC2-binding site. The proximity of these binding sites may play a role in coordinating motility for bidirectional transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fu and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hendricks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wilson and Holzbaur, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Splinter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Soppina et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Encalada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belyy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gross et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Derr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ally et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kendrick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Furuta et al., 2013</xref>). Another intriguing possibility is that if kinesin binding dimerizes Nup358, this may be the key initial step leading to BicD2 activation and recruitment of DD to form a bidirectional complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The ternary Nup358/BicD2/KLC2 complex may be a model for other transport modules, in which opposite polarity motors such as dynein and kinesin-1 act together.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our data, we propose a structural basis for cargo recognition through the dynein adaptor BicD2. Our results establish that BicD2 recognizes its cargo Nup358 through a small ‘cargo recognition α-helix’ that is embedded in an IDR. This region undergoes a structural transition from a random coil to an α-helix upon binding to BicD2. In single-molecule TIRF assays, four single-point mutations within the cargo recognition helix significantly inhibited the interaction between BicD2 and Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup>, and impaired run length and speed of the mutant DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> complexes on microtubules. Our results may facilitate the identification of regulatory mechanisms for BicD2-dependent transport pathways, which are important for cell cycle control, brain and muscle development, and vesicle transport.</p><p>Activation of BicD2 is a key regulatory step for transport as it is required to activate dynein for processive motility. The cargo recognition α-helix may be a structural feature that stabilizes BicD2 in its activated state. We propose that binding of cargo induces a coiled-coil registry shift in BicD2, which promotes loop opening and activates BicD2 for dynein/dynactin binding. Notably, Nup358 interacts more strongly with the dynein/dynactin/BicD2 complex compared to BicD2 alone, which supports the loop-opening mechanism for activation. We also show that BicD2 and KLC2 bind to spatially close, but nonoverlapping binding sites on Nup358, supporting the hypothesis that Nup358 is capable of simultaneously recruiting dynein and kinesin-1 machineries to the nucleus for bidirectional transport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

For ITC experiments, BicD2-CTD was placed in the cell of a calorimeter (MicroCal Auto-iTC200, GE Healthcare) and titrated with Nup358-min (either without the GST-tag <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or with the GST-tag intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) at 25°C. As controls, titrations of Nup358-min (with or without the GST-tag) into buffer were carried out, which resulted in a flat line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b and c</xref>). The corrected ITC curves were analyzed using a nonlinear least-squares minimization method in Origin 7.0 and fitted with the one-site model to determine the number of sites N, the equilibrium binding constant K, the change in entropy ∆S, and the change in enthalpy ∆H.

The second attempt was run from 116 to 124 ppm. The DCEST was performed to cover the whole spectral width for amides, with a 10 Hz saturation and a 700 Hz spectral width, and a 20 Hz saturation pulse with a 600 Hz spectral width. <sup>13</sup>C′ HNCO-CEST NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Charlier et al., 2017</xref>) was performed with a 0.6 mM sample and a 1:20 ratio of BicD2-CTD:Nup358-Min at 20°C and pH of 6.5.

Purified Nup358-min and BicD2-CTD were dialyzed against the following buffer: 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 0.5 mM TCEP. The dialysis buffer was used as buffer match for SAXS experiments as well as for dilutions. The following protein concentrations were used: Nup358-min 4 mg/ml, BicD2-CTD 1 mg/ml. To assemble the complex, Nup358-min and BicD2-CTD were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and incubated for 30 min on ice, with a final concentration of 1.3 mg BicD2-CTD and 1.3 mg Nup358-min. The affinity of BicD2-CTD towards Nup358-min is 1.7 ± 0.9 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); therefore, this protein concentration is sufficient for complex formation. To assure monodispersity, SAXS data were collected for at least three protein concentrations for each sample, and we also collected data of a Nup358-min/BicD2-CTD complex that was further purified by gel filtration, with comparable results (data not shown). Prior to data collection, samples were thawed, filtered (pore size 0.2 μm), and centrifuged (30 min, 21,700 × <italic>g</italic>, 4°C).

Quartz capillary with a path length of 1.6 mm was used as the sample cell (OD = 1.5 mm, wall thickness = 10 μm).

To form the dynein-dynactin-BicD2-Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> (DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup>) complex, BicD2 and Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> were mixed with 525 nm and 655 nm streptavidin Qdots (Invitrogen, CA), respectively, at a 1:1 molar ratio in separate tubes and incubated for 15 min on ice. To block excess binding sites on streptavidin Qdots, 5 µM biotin was added to both tubes. Labeled BicD2 and Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> were then mixed with preformed DD complex at a molar ratio of 1:1:2:2 (250 nM dynein, 250 nM dynactin, 500 nM BicD2, and 500 nM Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup>) and incubated on ice for 30 min in motility buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM DTT). The dynein-dynactin-Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> (DDN<sup>min-zip</sup>) complex contained Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> that was labeled with a 655 nm Qdot. In the dynein-dynactin-BicD2<sup>CC1</sup> (DDB<sup>CC1</sup>) complex, BicD2<sup>CC1</sup> was labeled with a 525 nm streptavidin Qdot. The DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup>, DDN<sup>min-zip</sup>, and DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complexes were diluted in motility buffer (30 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM potassium acetate, 2 mM magnesium acetate, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgATP, 20 mM DTT, 8 mg/ml BSA, 0.5 mg/ml kappa-casein, 0.5% pluronic F68, 10 mM paclitaxel, and an oxygen scavenger system) to a final concentration of 1.25–2.50 nM dynein for observing motion on microtubules. The oxygen-scavenging system consisted of 5.8 mg/ml glucose, 0.045 mg/ml catalase, and 0.067 mg/ml glucose oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). To analyze the motion of the complexes without any ambiguity, oxygen scavengers were not used in two-color experiments so that the microtubules would photo bleach. Purified tubulin was mixed with rhodamine-labeled tubulin at a molar ratio of 10:1 and polymerized as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>).

Motion of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup>, DDN<sup>min-zip</sup>, and DDB<sup>CC1</sup> were observed using TIRF microscope as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sladewski et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Microscopy and data analysis</title><p>To detect the motion of Qdot-labeled DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> and DDB<sup>CC1</sup> complexes on microtubules, TIRF microscopy was used. The TIRF microscope system is operated by the Nikon NIS Elements software, and single-molecule images were acquired on a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti microscope equipped with objective-type TIRF. The laser lines 488 and 561 nm were used to illuminate 525 nm and 655 nm Qdots and rhodamine-labeled microtubules. Typically, 300–600 frames were captured at 100 or 200 ms intervals (10 or 5 frames/s) using two Andor EMCCD cameras (Andor Technology USA, South Windsor, CT). Individual Qdots were tracked using the ImageJ MtrackJ plugin for run length and speed measurements of single complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meijering et al., 2012</xref>). Run length is defined as the total travel distance by individual complexes, and speed was calculated by dividing the run length by the total time. To determine the characteristic run length, data were plotted as 1-cumulative probability distribution (1-CDF) with GraphPad Prism Software and fit to a one-phase exponential decay equation p(x) = Ae<sup>-<italic>x</italic>/<italic>λ</italic></sup>, where p(x) is the relative frequency, x is the travel distance along a microtubule track, and A is the amplitude. Speed was reported as mean ± SD, and run length reported as mean ± standard error (SE). The number of processive events was calculated by counting the number of moving dual-color Qdots per time per μm microtubule. The number of dual-color Qdots (DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup>) was counted on 18–32 microtubules in each case. For measuring the formation of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> and BN<sup>min-zip</sup> complexes containing WT or mutant Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup>, the number of dual-color and single-color (green or red) Qdots was counted on multiple 512 × 512 pixel fields. The DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> and BN<sup>min-zip</sup> complexes were bound to the glass surfaces nonspecifically. The percentage of colocalization was calculated from the total number of dual-color Qdots divided by all dual- and single-color Qdots. Statistical significance for two sets of run length data was determined by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, a nonparametric distribution. For speed data comparison, an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was performed. For three or more datasets of run length or speed, statistical significance was calculated using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test. Statistical differences for binding frequency of DDBN<sup>min-zip</sup> containing WT or mutant Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-74714-transrepform1-v4.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Protein backbone assignments have been deposited in the BMRB under accession code 5182.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Elisar J Barbar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have cannot invite revisions of the manuscript at this stage. The reviewers agreed that the main finding of the paper is novel and potentially of interest to <italic>eLife</italic>'s readership, i.e. that a peptide from Nup358 can form a helix that activates BicD2 in the same way as the small G-protein Rab6. However, at this stage they had a number of experimental concerns including: the need for control TIRF experiments to show a direct comparison of the effect on dynein motility of BICD2 alone and BICD2+Nup358, negative controls for ITC experiments and some extra NMR experiments. Addressing these issues would be required if you want to submit the paper again to <italic>eLife</italic>. In addition, the reviewers all felt that the structural aspects of the paper would be strengthened by data mapping where on BICD2 the Nup358 binds.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Gibson et al. explore the mechanisms underpinning Nup358 recognition by the dynein adaptor BicD2 using a combination of structural and biochemical techniques. Nup358 is a nuclear pore protein and has previously been shown to recruit the dynein machinery via BicD2 for nuclear positioning during G2 phase. The authors perform elegant in vitro motility assays to demonstrate that binding to Nup358 activates BicD2 for dynein recruitment. They also show that the interaction between Nup358 and BicD2 is enhanced in the presence of dynein and dynactin, which is consistent with published models of BicD2 activation. They then move on to investigate the structural basis for the Nup358-BicD2 interaction using multiple structural and biophysical methods, including NMR spectroscopy. They find that Nup358 contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) which undergoes a coil-to-helix transition upon binding to BicD2. This observation is supported by mutagenesis experiments which highlight the importance of helix interface residue in BicD2 binding and dynein activation. Interestingly, the authors show that Nup358 harbours non-overlapping binding sites for BicD2 and kinesin-1, hinting that opposite polarity motors may be simultaneously recruited to the nuclear pore for nuclear positioning. These data provide important mechanistic insight on how BicD2 recognizes its cargo for dynein-based transport and represents a significant contribution to the field. While the experiments described in this manuscript are overall convincing, there are a few concerns regarding the in vitro motility studies.</p><p>1) It is not clear how the authors are quantifying the percentage of DDBN complexes in Figures 2b-d. Is this solely based on the colocalization of Nup358 and BicD2 or are other factors taken to account (e.g. binding to microtubules, motility)? If the former is true, this is not the most elegant way to prove that all the components are coming together, since the authors have shown that Nup358 and BicD2 can form a complex independently of dynein and dynactin (although with lower affinity). A better way of quantifying DDBN complexes is showing the percentage of complexes that contain both of Nup358 and BicD2 and are motile rather than static.</p><p>2) Figure 2 shows in vitro motility data for DDBCC1, DDNmin-zip and DDBNmin-zip complexes, but not for dynein/dynactin/full-length BicD2 (DDB) complexes in the absence of Nup358min-zip. The latter control is critical to be able to accurately quantify the activating effect of Nup358min-zip on BicD2 and needs to be included in the final version of the manuscript. We refer the authors to previous work by Huynh and Vale (2017) which suggests that DDB complexes are not fully static but exhibit some background motility. A DDB control is also important to interpret the differences in speed and run length shown in Figures 2h-2i.</p><p>3) In the introduction, the expression dynein adaptor is used to describe proteins that activate dynein motility, while cargo adaptor refers to proteins that bind dynein adaptors to connect them to cargoes. However, in the literature the terms dynein adaptor and cargo adaptor are often used interchangeably to describe activating adaptors such as Hook3 and Bicd2. Therefore, the distinction made by the authors could be confusing for readers in the field. We suggest that the authors use the term adaptor-binding protein to refer to Nup358, as well as Rab6 and nesprin 2-G.</p><p>4) In the introduction, the discussion on the LIC1 and BICD2 interaction could be shortened, as it is not directly relevant to the scope of the paper.</p><p>5) It would be helpful to show the data in support of the author's statement: &quot;unlike the DDNmin-zip complex, Nup358min-zip alone does not bind to microtubules&quot;</p><p>7) The findings by Huynh and Vale (2017), which show BICD2 activation by Rab6 in TIRF motility assays, should be cited and discussed by the authors.</p><p>8) In Figure 8, the authors should show the percentage of motile complexes for DDBN with wild-type and mutant Nup358min.</p><p>9) In the discussion, the authors should briefly discuss the evidence in support of their statement &quot;It is conceivable that the cargo adaptors Rab6GTP and nesprin-2G are also recognized by similar short α-helices, although this needs to be confirmed by future experiments&quot;. For example, are the BICD2-binding domains of Rab6 and/or nesprin 2-G known to contain α-helices or IDRs that could transition into α-helices upon interaction with BICD2?</p><p>10) The authors should clarify and more critically discuss their finding that &quot;Nup358min-zip binds BicD2 alone poorly&quot;. The readout for the mutagenesis experiment shown in Figure 7 is based on the interaction between Nup358min-zip and BICD2, which seems convincingly solid. Furthermore, the dissociation constant shown in Figure 1d suggests a moderate affinity.</p><p>11) The findings from Liu et al. (2013), which shed light on the mechanisms of BicD cargo recognition and autoinhibition, are relevant to this study and should be cited and discussed in the introduction and/or discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors investigate the interaction of the nuclear pore protein Nup358 with the dynein-dynactin-BicD2 transport complex and localize the interaction site on Nup358 to a short region that transitions between a random coil conformation in the unbound state to an α-helix in the bound state. The residues on one side of the helix that interact with BicD2 are mapped both through structural and functional assays. This work expands our knowledge of how a cargo protein, Nup358 on the nucleus, activates a dynein activating protein, BicD2, which is normally in an inhibited state when not bound to cargo.</p><p>The strength of this work is that a number of biochemical, structural, and functional assays are used to pick apart the details of an important interaction between a cargo adapter protein, Nup358 and a dynein activating protein, BicD2. It is known that activator proteins like BicD2, hook, spindly, and others are necessary to fully activate the dynein-dynactin complex. BicD2 is itself regulated, however, because it normally exists in a folded and auto-inhibited form. Thus, understanding cargo transport requires understanding both what are the cargo adapters, as well as how they disinhibit the dynein activators to turn on motility. The interesting part of the current study is that the domain on Nup358 transitions from a random coil conformation in the apo state to an α helix when bound to BicD2. This transition and the subsequent tight binding is what transitions BicD2 out of its autoinhibited conformation, and allows it to activate dynein. It is nice to fully document this interaction, as the details of dynein activation and cargo interaction are still being discovered, and it is possible that this disordered to ordered transition is a common feature. The data are laid out well for the most part and detailed extensively. The text is somewhat verbose, and the authors emphasize the techniques quite a lot at the expense of clearly laying out the questions and hypotheses. Also, the cell biological impact of what we learn about bidirectional cargo transport by dynein and kinesin is limited, as this is more of a technical paper detailing a structural interaction.</p><p>The authors bring together a nice suite of tools to study a very focused question regarding the interaction of the cargo binding protein Nup358 with the dynein activating protein BicD2. That these proteins interact, and that this interaction underlies nuclear transport by dynein has been established, and this current work focuses on the details of this interaction. The focus and detail of the paper were strengths, as was the combination of structure, biochemistry, and functional assays. The work doesn't challenge any paradigms and in the end is much more of a biochemical investigation than one that impact cell biology. That would be just fine for JBC, but limits the general audience, which is generally what is expected of an <italic>eLife</italic> paper. I found only minimal technical problems, which are documented below. I think the paper could be improved by more focused writing, as well as by a a great emphasis of the specific questions being asked and the broader implications of the work.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>I appreciated the thorough background that the introduction provided. However, the authors should do a better job of defining the specific questions being addressed here, and the specific things not known that this study is addressing. Also, I thought the last paragraph was too much advertising (e.g. interdisciplinary) and emphasized the &quot;how&quot; of the study rather than the &quot;what did we learn&quot;.</p><p>Since one key point is to show that Nup358 min and min-zip activate DDB, then a negative control showing that complex is not active in absence of Nup358 is important to show. This would complement the positive control of BicD2-cc.</p><p>For the Figure 2 data, please define &quot;% complex formation&quot; more clearly; also, there is no need to give numbers for % complex in legend (it's in the text). For 2i, I suggest a 1-cdf plot and fit the exponential to that, which eliminates problems with binning.</p><p>The first paragraph of discussion is much too excessive summary of the findings – it should be distilled to the results, not a recap of the methods and technical details.</p><p>I know that acronyms streamline things, but they put off readers who often have to go back and check what they mean. It seems like there must be a better way than a sentence like on page 19: &quot;In the BN complex, the NTD of BicD2 competes with Nup358 for binding to the CTD, likely resulting in a lower apparent affinity than in the DDBN complex, where the NTD interacts with dynein and dynactin and prevents reassociation of the NTD with the CTD.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>A summary of what the authors were trying to achieve.</p><p>– Identify the molecular details of the Nup358/BicD2 interaction by determining the minimum Nup358 domain needed for binding</p><p>– Determine a structural mechanism of BicD2-mediated cargo recognition</p><p>– Provide mechanistic insight on dynein activation</p><p>An account of the major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– The combination of techniques and organization of results is done well and is easy to follow</p><p>– Emphasizing the larger picture of a dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 complex is impactful and helpful to readers to keep in mind the bigger picture implications of the work.</p><p>– Techniques are well explained as far as data interpretation</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>– Some of the data (ITC &amp; CEST) are fit to a simple model without much discussion about that the binding involves a coiled coil dimer.</p><p>– The random coil to helix transition would be better supported by CA &amp; CB chemical shifts.

This should be corrected in multiple places.</p><p>– The NMR titration is not a true titration as only a 1:1 molar ratio is shown. It is also unclear if peak intensities are taken from peak height or volume and a discussion of error bar calculation is needed to convince of the significance of the measurements.</p><p>– To say that &quot;Nup358 relieves the auto-inhibition of BicD2 so that dynein-dynactin can bind and move processivity on MTs&quot; would perhaps be better stated as &quot;functionally relieves auto-inhibition&quot; since results are clearly not the same as when BicD2 is truncated and auto-inhibition is truly absent. (page 7)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Gibson and colleagues provides new insights into the structural and molecular basis for Nup358 binding to the dynein activating adaptor BicD2 and its implications in dynein's motility. In line with their previous publication (Noell et al., 2018), the authors show that the small fragment in Nup358 drives binding to BicD2. The authors quantitatively characterize the interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and confirm a binding stoichiometry of a Nup358 dimer to a BicD2 dimer. By using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, pull-downs and SAXS experiments, they demonstrate that BicD2 recognizes Nup358 through a short &quot;cargo recognition α-helix&quot;, which transitioned from a random coil to an α-helix upon BicD2 binding. Finally, the authors present evidence that the interaction between BicD2 and Nup358 is important for the formation of dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 motor complex, as well as the processive motility of the motor complex in vitro. Overall, the conclusions are well supported by the data and the findings clarify previously reported results. The solution NMR and in vitro motility data add significantly to the understanding of how cargo binding to activating adaptors may promote the processive motility of the motor complex.</p><p>Pending points below, I think this manuscript merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. ITC experiments.</p><p>a) In ITC experiments, the titration of protein (placed in the syringe) into the buffer (placed in the calorimetric cell) is lacking as a negative control. The control experiment is particularly important as the protein placed in the syringe is expected to be dimeric in solution (I assume Nup358 is placed in the syringe). The stepwise addition of the solution in the syringe into the cell might trigger the dissociation reaction of the Nup358 homodimer, leading to the detection of the heat.</p><p>b) Please provide the experimental details on the ITC experiments.</p><p>c) Please provide the concentrations of the proteins used in ITC experiments in the cell and the syringe.</p><p>2.

This is not specified in the text and is not deducible from the source data provided. To make the claim that Nup358 activates DDB, it is necessary to show that DDBN consistently displays higher motility than DDB in 3 replicates (for each condition). Also, the source data provided by the authors for this experiment is somewhat unhelpful to the reviewers. For the sake of transparency, the authors should provide access to the source movies for this experiment.</p><p>2) The second sentence in the abstract &quot;Nup358 binds and activates the auto-inhibited dynein adaptor Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits and activates the dynein machinery to position the nucleus&quot; implies that activation of BICD2 by Nup358 had been shown previously. To my knowledge, direct activation of BICD2 by Nup358 had not been formally shown before (although we knew that Nup358 recruits dynein via BICD2). The ability of Nup358 to relieve BICD2 from its autoinhibited state in in vitro assays is one of the key discoveries of this manuscript and should be emphasized in the abstract/introduction.</p><p>3) The introduction is poorly written and could be improved.</p><p>– The first paragraph of the introduction could be rearranged to better emphasize what is known (i.e. that cargo binding to the CTD frees up the NTD for interaction with dynein/dynactin) and what is unknown (i.e. what are the structural basis of cargo recognition and how does this lead to structural changes in BICD2 conformation). For example, the authors first state that &quot;Cargoes are required to activate BicD2 for dynein binding, which is a key regulatory step for dynein-dependent transport but the underlying mechanism is unknown&quot; but later provide a detailed explanation of how BICD2 is autoinhibited &quot;in the absence of cargoes, BicD2 assumes a looped, auto-inhibited conformation, in which its N- terminal dynein/dynactin binding site binds to the CTD and remains inaccessible. The CTD is required for auto-inhibition, as a truncated BicD2 without the CTD activates dynein/dynactin for processive motility. Binding of dynein adaptors/cargo to the CTD releases auto-inhibition, likely resulting in an extended conformation&quot;, which is somewhat confusing.</p><p>– The sentence &quot;Finally, Rab6GTP recruits BicD2/dynein for the transport of Golgi-derived secretory vesicles&quot; does not fit well with the rest of the paragraph in its current form.

Nup358 is a nuclear pore protein and has previously been shown to recruit the dynein machinery via BicD2 for nuclear positioning during G2 phase. The authors perform elegant in vitro motility assays to demonstrate that binding to Nup358 activates BicD2 for dynein recruitment. They also show that the interaction between Nup358 and BicD2 is enhanced in the presence of dynein and dynactin, which is consistent with published models of BicD2 activation. They then move on to investigate the structural basis for the Nup358-BicD2 interaction using multiple structural and biophysical methods, including NMR spectroscopy. They find that Nup358 contains an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) which undergoes a coil-to-helix transition upon binding to BicD2. This observation is supported by mutagenesis experiments which highlight the importance of helix interface residue in BicD2 binding and dynein activation. Interestingly, the authors show that Nup358 harbours non-overlapping binding sites for BicD2 and kinesin-1, hinting that opposite polarity motors may be simultaneously recruited to the nuclear pore for nuclear positioning. These data provide important mechanistic insight on how BicD2 recognizes its cargo for dynein-based transport and represents a significant contribution to the field. While the experiments described in this manuscript are overall convincing, there are a few concerns regarding the in vitro motility studies.</p><p>1) It is not clear how the authors are quantifying the percentage of DDBN complexes in Figures 2b-d. Is this solely based on the colocalization of Nup358 and BicD2 or are other factors taken to account (e.g. binding to microtubules, motility)? If the former is true, this is not the most elegant way to prove that all the components are coming together, since the authors have shown that Nup358 and BicD2 can form a complex independently of dynein and dynactin (although with lower affinity). A better way of quantifying DDBN complexes is showing the percentage of complexes that contain both of Nup358 and BicD2 and are motile rather than static.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have now quantified the number of moving complexes (processive events per min per micrometer MT) of DDBN, and as controls DDB<sup>CC1</sup>, DDB and DDN in Figure 2f.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 2 shows in vitro motility data for DDBCC1, DDNmin-zip and DDBNmin-zip complexes, but not for dynein/dynactin/full-length BicD2 (DDB) complexes in the absence of Nup358min-zip. The latter control is critical to be able to accurately quantify the activating effect of Nup358min-zip on BicD2 and needs to be included in the final version of the manuscript. We refer the authors to previous work by Huynh and Vale (2017) which suggests that DDB complexes are not fully static but exhibit some background motility. A DDB control is also important to interpret the differences in speed and run length shown in Figures 2h-2i.</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the number of processive events of DDB which is ~10 times lower than that of DDBN. Because the number of processive events is so small (which is the key observation), we did not display the speed and run length of these infrequent events in Figure 2g or 2h. We have only 7 data points for DDB. The mean speed and run length of these data were 0.16 ± 0.08 µm/s and 1.5±0.3 µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the introduction, the expression dynein adaptor is used to describe proteins that activate dynein motility, while cargo adaptor refers to proteins that bind dynein adaptors to connect them to cargoes. However, in the literature the terms dynein adaptor and cargo adaptor are often used interchangeably to describe activating adaptors such as Hook3 and Bicd2. Therefore, the distinction made by the authors could be confusing for readers in the field. We suggest that the authors use the term adaptor-binding protein to refer to Nup358, as well as Rab6 and nesprin 2-G.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced the term cargo adapter with the terms adapter-binding protein, cargo or interacting partner (depending on the context) throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the introduction, the discussion on the LIC1 and BICD2 interaction could be shortened, as it is not directly relevant to the scope of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed that point by shortening the description in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be helpful to show the data in support of the author's statement: &quot;unlike the DDNmin-zip complex, Nup358min-zip alone does not bind to microtubules&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We show in Figure S2(d) that the Nup358<sup>min-zip</sup> alone does not bind to microtubules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The findings by Huynh and Vale (2017), which show BICD2 activation by Rab6 in TIRF motility assays, should be cited and discussed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>The findings of Huynh and Vale (2017) is now included in the Discussion (first paragraph):</p><p>“Single-molecule processivity assays revealed that a dimerized Nup358-min domain forms a complex with dynein/dynactin/BicD2 (DDBN) that shows robust processive motility on microtubules.

For example, are the BICD2-binding domains of Rab6 and/or nesprin 2-G known to contain α-helices or IDRs that could transition into α-helices upon interaction with BICD2?</p></disp-quote><p>We added this point to the discussion.</p><p>“Rab6GTP binds to BicD2 with 10-fold higher affinity compared to Rab6GDP, and associated structural changes are found in the Switch I and Switch 2 regions of Rab6, which include short α-helices and intrinsically disordered domains and are possibly candidates for the BicD2-binding site. The mapped nesprin-2G binding domain for BicD2 is also predicted to be to a large degree intrinsically disordered. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors should clarify and more critically discuss their finding that &quot;Nup358min-zip binds BicD2 alone poorly&quot;. The readout for the mutagenesis experiment shown in Figure 7 is based on the interaction between Nup358min-zip and BICD2, which seems convincingly solid. Furthermore, the dissociation constant shown in Figure 1d suggests a moderate affinity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the term “poorly” is misleading, and we edited this sentence accordingly:</p><p>“Nup358min-zip binds to BicD2 alone with lower affinity compared to the complex that also contained dynein and dynactin, and the percentage of BN was reduced for four Nup358min-zip mutants (Figure 8b).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The findings from Liu et al. (2013), which shed light on the mechanisms of BicD cargo recognition and autoinhibition, are relevant to this study and should be cited and discussed in the introduction and/or discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

These results establish a structural basis for cargo recognition by BicD2 and suggest that Nup358 interacts with BicD2 through a “cargo recognition” α-helix. This work is further enhanced by singlemolecule binding and processivity assays, which show that the minimal dimerized Nup358 construct is sufficient to activate full-length dynein/dynactin/BicD2 complexes for processive motility. Mutations of the cargo-recognition α-helix of Nup358 decreased the Nup358/BicD2 interaction and resulted in decreased dynein recruitment and impaired motility, shedding light on the important role of the cargo-recognition α-helix for the activation of BicD2 and dynein motility. Intriguingly, our results also show that the binding site of BicD2 in Nup358 is spatially close to but does not overlap with the LEWD motif that acts as a kinesin-1 binding site, suggesting that the kinesin and dynein machineries may interact simultaneously via Nup358. Our results thus provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of bi-directional transport by adapter binding proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since one key point is to show that Nup358 min and min-zip activate DDB, then a negative control showing that complex is not active in absence of Nup358 is important to show.

The number of sites was determined to be N = 1.0, which is consistent with a molar ratio of [Nup358]/[BicD2] of 1. This molar ratio is in agreement with our previously published molar masses obtained from size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS), which showed that Nup358 and BicD2 form a 2:2 complex<sup>50</sup>, while apo-BicD2 forms a dimer<sup>50</sup> and apoNup358-min forms a monomer. The ITC thermogram, the one-site binding model and the 2:2 stoichiometry are in line with Nup358-min forming a dimer as an intermediate that then binds to a single binding site on a BicD2 coiled-coil dimer, although we cannot exclude the possibility that two Nup358 monomers bind to two binding sites on BicD2, where both sites have the same dissociation constant K<sub>D</sub>. We also attempted to fit models assuming multiple binding sites and K<sub>Ds</sub> but those are not supported by the ITC thermogram.</p><p>Revised Discussion section:</p><p>The affinity of the monomeric cargo adaptor Nup358-min for BicD2 is enhanced by dimerization by a leucine zipper, similar to what was previously observed for binding of the cargo adaptor Egalitarian for <italic>Drosophila</italic> BicD<sup>24,25</sup>. Thus, it is conceivable that a Nup358-min dimer binds to a BicD2 dimer, which is also in line with our ITC results, which reveal a single K<sub>D</sub>. While Nup358-min is a monomer on its own, it oligomerizes to form 2:2 complexes with either the BicD2-CTD or the KLC2, and also forms a ternary complex with both BicD2-CTD and KLC2 with 2:2:2 stoichiometry <sup>47,50</sup>. We thus propose that cargo adaptor-induced dimerization may potentially be a universal feature of the activation mechanism, since BicD2 and KLC2 both form dimers in active dynein and kinesin-1 motors21,22,47,68.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The random coil to helix transition would be better supported by CA &amp; CB chemical shifts.

Thus, all selected interface residues have a signal to noise ratio of 3 or more. In addition, for a residue to be an interface residue the binding ratio had to be lowered to at least 87% of the wild-type binding ratio. It should also be noted that residue 2169 and 2181 were identified as interface residues both by mutagenesis and in CEST, validating them further. In addition, residue 2172 was identified as an interface residue by CEST experiments. We decided not to select it as an interface residue for mutagenesis because the binding ratio was only 7% lower compared to the WT.

In line with their previous publication (Noell et al., 2018), the authors show that the small fragment in Nup358 drives binding to BicD2. The authors quantitatively characterize the interaction using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and confirm a binding stoichiometry of a Nup358 dimer to a BicD2 dimer. By using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy, pull-downs and SAXS experiments, they demonstrate that BicD2 recognizes Nup358 through a short &quot;cargo recognition α-helix&quot;, which transitioned from a random coil to an α-helix upon BicD2 binding. Finally, the authors present evidence that the interaction between BicD2 and Nup358 is important for the formation of dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 motor complex, as well as the processive motility of the motor complex in vitro. Overall, the conclusions are well supported by the data and the findings clarify previously reported results. The solution NMR and in vitro motility data add significantly to the understanding of how cargo binding to activating adaptors may promote the processive motility of the motor complex.</p><p>Pending points below, I think this manuscript merits publication in eLife.</p><p>1. ITC experiments.</p><p>a) In ITC experiments, the titration of protein (placed in the syringe) into the buffer (placed in the calorimetric cell) is lacking as a negative control. The control experiment is particularly important as the protein placed in the syringe is expected to be dimeric in solution (I assume Nup358 is placed in the syringe). The stepwise addition of the solution in the syringe into the cell might trigger the dissociation reaction of the Nup358 homodimer, leading to the detection of the heat.</p></disp-quote><p>We did perform the control titration of Nup358-min and GST-tagged Nup358-min (which was placed in the syringe) into the buffer (which was placed in the cell), and these controls were performed at the same time as the ITC titrations that are shown in the paper. These control titrations without BicD2-CTD resulted in a flat response characteristic of heat of dilution, which is not surprising, because apo Nup358-min is a monomer, which is confirmed by our previously published SEC-MALS analysis (Cui, <italic>et al.</italic>, 2019, Biochemistry 58: 5085).

The method section for the ITC experiments was added to the manuscript:</p><p>“Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC)</p><p>ITC experiments were performed as previously described<sup>50</sup>. For ITC experiments, BicD2-CTD was placed in the cell of a calorimeter (GE Microcal ITC200) and titrated with Nup358-min either without the GST-tag (Figure 1) or with the GST-tag intact (Figure S1) at 25 °C. As a control, a second titration curve of Nup358-min (with or without the GST-tag) into buffer was recorded, which resulted in a flat line (Figure S1 a, b). The curve was fitted with the one-site model to determine the number of sites N, the equilibrium binding constant K, the change in entropy ∆S and the change in enthalpy ∆H. The affinity (dissociation constant Kd) was calculated as the inverse of K. Data was analyzed with the Origin software (OriginLab). For the titration of Nup358-min + BicD2CTD, the protein concentrations were 0.27 mM (Nup358-min) and 0.019 mM (BicD2CTD), respectively.

NMR experiments.</p><p>a) HSQC titration experiments (Figure 3 and Figure S2) are not very convincing as there are several mis-labeled (T2159 in Figure 3, A2440, T2143, G2146 in Figure S2 and so on) or unlabeled peaks.

We have also changed the section title for CEST from “CEST revealed a coil-to-a-helix transition at BicD2-Nup358 interface” to “CEST suggests a coil-to-a-helix transition at the BicD2-Nup358 interface”. Furthermore, we added the caveats mentioned by reviewer 2 to the discussion:</p><p>Edited discussion about CEST NMR:</p><p>“The NMR titration of the BicD2-CTD into <sup>15</sup>N labeled Nup358-min narrowed the binding region to the N-terminal half of Nup358-min. Furthermore, we obtained chemical shifts for the CA and CB atoms for the apo state of Nup358-min, which confirm that the apo-state is intrinsically disordered (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3). Due to slow chemical exchange on the NMR time scale and fast relaxation in the bound state, the BicD2-bound state of Nup358-min cannot be directly observed in NMR, and thus a powerful solution NMR technique, CEST, was applied to map the chemical shifts of the “invisible state”. This approach not only identified key residues at the Nup358/BicD2 interface, but also showed that chemical shift changes upon binding correspond to that of a coil-to-a-helix transition in Nup358-min. Notably, a conformational change from coil-to-a-helix was consistent with our results from CD spectroscopy and SAXS, and the BicD2/Nup358 interface was validated by mutagenesis. The observed time scale is also in line with other proteins undergoing coil-to-a-helix transitions (Charlier et al.). However, it should be noted, that in order to obtain higher-resolution structural information, the chemical shifts for the CA and CB atoms of Nup358-min in the bound state remain to be determined in the future. Notably, our functional assays highlight the important role of the interaction between Nup358 and BicD2 in dynein activation. Single molecule binding assays showed that mutagenesis of the Nup358 cargo-recognition a-helix diminished the interaction of Nup358-min with full-length BicD2 and decreased the formation of dynein/dynactin/BicD2/Nup358 complexes (DDBN). Furthermore, the mutant DDBN complexes that were formed exhibited reduced run length and speed in single-molecule processivity assays on microtubules reflecting formation of a less stable complex. Our data highlight the important role of dynein-activating-adaptor/adaptor-binding protein interactions in activating and fine-tuning dynein motility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Regarding Figure 2f, did the authors perform 3 replicates for each condition? This is not specified in the text and is not deducible from the source data provided. To make the claim that Nup358 activates DDB, it is necessary to show that DDBN consistently displays higher motility than DDB in 3 replicates (for each condition). Also, the source data provided by the authors for this experiment is somewhat unhelpful to the reviewers. For the sake of transparency, the authors should provide access to the source movies for this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2f now shows data from 3 total experiments for each condition and each time DDBN displayed higher motility than DDB.

To my knowledge, direct activation of BICD2 by Nup358 had not been formally shown before (although we knew that Nup358 recruits dynein via BICD2). The ability of Nup358 to relieve BICD2 from its autoinhibited state in in vitro assays is one of the key discoveries of this manuscript and should be emphasized in the abstract/introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion.

For example, the authors first state that &quot;Cargoes are required to activate BicD2 for dynein binding, which is a key regulatory step for dynein-dependent transport but the underlying mechanism is unknown&quot; but later provide a detailed explanation of how BICD2 is autoinhibited &quot;in the absence of cargoes, BicD2 assumes a looped, auto-inhibited conformation, in which its N- terminal dynein/dynactin binding site binds to the CTD and remains inaccessible. The CTD is required for auto-inhibition, as a truncated BicD2 without the CTD activates dynein/dynactin for processive motility. Binding of dynein adaptors/cargo to the CTD releases auto-inhibition, likely resulting in an extended conformation&quot;, which is somewhat confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Coil to a-helix transitions in model peptides are typically much faster in time scale than events characterized by the CEST method, as shown by Charlier et al.
