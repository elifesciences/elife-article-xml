Systemic factors like humoral and neuronal signals, oscillations in body temperature, and food intake align physiological circadian rhythms with external time. Thyroid hormones (THs) are major regulators of circadian clock target processes such as energy metabolism, but little is known about how fluctuations in TH levels affect the circadian coordination of tissue physiology. In this study, a high triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) state was induced in mice by supplementing T<sub>3</sub> in the drinking water, which affected body temperature, and oxygen consumption in a time-of-day-dependent manner. A 24-hr transcriptome profiling of liver tissue identified 37 robustly and time independently T<sub>3</sub>-associated transcripts as potential TH state markers in the liver. Such genes participated in xenobiotic transport, lipid and xenobiotic metabolism. We also identified 10–15% of the liver transcriptome as rhythmic in control and T<sub>3</sub> groups, but only 4% of the liver transcriptome (1033 genes) were rhythmic across both conditions – amongst these, several core clock genes. In-depth rhythm analyses showed that most changes in transcript rhythms were related to mesor (50%), followed by amplitude (10%), and phase (10%). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed TH state-dependent reorganization of metabolic processes such as lipid and glucose metabolism. At high T<sub>3</sub> levels, we observed weakening or loss of rhythmicity for transcripts associated with glucose and fatty acid metabolism, suggesting increased hepatic energy turnover. In summary, we provide evidence that tonic changes in T<sub>3</sub> levels restructure the diurnal liver metabolic transcriptome independent of local molecular circadian clocks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many environmental conditions, including light and temperature, vary with a daily rhythm that affects how animals interact with their surroundings. Indeed, most species have developed so-called circadian clocks: internal molecular timers that cycle approximately every 24 hours and regulate many bodily functions, including digestion, energy metabolism and sleep.</p><p>The energy metabolism of the liver – the chemical reactions that occur in the organ to produce energy from nutrients – is controlled both by the circadian clock system, and by the hormones produced by a gland in the neck called the thyroid. However, the interaction between these two regulators is poorly understood. To address this question, de Assis, Harder et al. elevated the levels of thyroid hormones in mice by adding these hormones to their drinking water.</p><p>Studying these mice showed that, although thyroid hormone levels were good indicators of how much energy mice burn in a day, they do not reflect daily fluctuations in metabolic rate faithfully. Additionally, de Assis, Harder et al. showed that elevating T<sub>3</sub>, the active form of thyroid hormone, led to a rewiring of the daily rhythms at which genes were turned on and off in the liver, affecting the daily timing of processes including fat and cholesterol metabolism. This occurred without changing the circadian clock of the liver directly.</p><p>De Assis, Harder et al.’s results indicate that time-of-day critically affects the action of thyroid hormones in the liver. This suggests that patients with hypothyroidism, who produce low levels of thyroid hormones, may benefit from considering time-of-day as a factor in disease diagnosis, therapy and, potentially, prevention. Further data on the rhythmic regulation of thyroid action in humans, including in patients with hypothyroidism, are needed to further develop this approach.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thyroid hormones</kwd><kwd>liver</kwd><kwd>hyperthyroidism</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>circadian clock</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>353-10/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oster</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC-296 &quot;LocoTact&quot; (TP14).</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mittag</surname><given-names>Jens</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK-1957</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oster</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC-296 &quot;LocoTact&quot;</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oster</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>High triiodothyronine levels lead to a broad rewiring of the liver transcriptome, which mostly occurs downstream of the liver clock machinery itself, thus suggesting that daytime critically affects thyroid hormone action in the liver.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian clocks play an essential role in regulating systemic homeostasis by controlling, in a time-dependent manner, numerous biological processes that require alignment with rhythms in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gerhart-Hines and Lazar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">West and Bechtold, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Assis and Oster, 2021</xref>). At the molecular level, the clock machinery is comprised of several genes that are organized in interlocked transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs). The negative TTFL regulators, <italic>Period</italic> (<italic>Per1-3</italic>) and <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> (<italic>Cry1-2</italic>), are transcribed after activation by circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1 or ARNTL) in the subjective day. Towards the subjective night, PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize and, in the nucleus, inhibit BMAL1/CLOCK activity. This core TTFL is further stabilized by two accessory loops comprised of nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group D member 1–2 (NR1D1-2, also known as REV-ERBα-β) and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group F member 1–3 (NR1F1-3, also known as ROR<italic>α-γ</italic>), and DBP (albumin D-site binding protein) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Takahashi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pilorz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Assis and Oster, 2021</xref>). Upon degradation of PER/CRY, towards the end of the night, BMAL1/CLOCK are disinhibited, and a new cycle starts.</p><p>How the molecular clocks in different tissues and downstream physiological rhythms are coordinated has been the subject of increasing scientific interest in recent years. Environmental light is detected by a nonvisual retinal photoreceptive system that innervates the central circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Golombek and Rosenstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hughes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ksendzovsky et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Foster et al., 2020</xref>). The SCN distributes temporal information to other brain regions and across all organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Husse et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Assis and Oster, 2021</xref>) through partially redundant pathways, including nervous stimuli, hormones, feeding-fasting, and body temperature cycles. Despite an ongoing discussion about the organization of systemic circadian coordination, all models share the need for robustly rhythmic systemic time cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Assis and Oster, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The thyroid hormones (THs), triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) and thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>), are major regulators of energy metabolism. In the liver, THs regulate cholesterol and carbohydrate metabolism, lipogenesis, and fatty acid (FA) ß-oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ritter et al., 2020</xref>). While circadian regulation of the upstream thyroid regulator thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) has been described, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> rhythms in the circulation show relatively modest amplitudes in mammals, probably due to their long half-life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weeke and Laurberg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Russell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Philippe and Dibner, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, in hyperthyroid patients, nonrhythmic TSH secretion patterns are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ikegami et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated how a high T<sub>3</sub> state in mice affects diurnal transcriptome organization in the liver. Our data show that tonic endocrine state changes rewire the liver transcriptome in a time-dependent manner independent of the liver molecular clock. The main targets of TH signaling are the genes associated with lipid, glucose, and cholesterol metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of high T<sub>3</sub> on behavioral and metabolic diurnal rhythms</title><p>We used an experimental mouse model of hyperthyroidism by supplementing the drinking water with T<sub>3</sub> (0.5 mg/L in 0.01% BSA).

T<sub>3</sub>-supplemented mice showed ca. fivefold increased T<sub>3</sub> levels compared to CON mice with no significant diurnal rhythm. However, T<sub>3</sub> levels showed a temporal variation (ANOVA, p=0.006), which was classified as ultradian by JTK_CYCLE (12 hr period length, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, p=0.01) in the T<sub>3</sub>-treated group.

These data suggest that the higher EE of T<sub>3</sub> mice is not only a consequence of increased body weight, but also arises from a higher metabolic state. In T<sub>3</sub> mice, RQ was slightly higher in the second half of the dark and the beginning of the light phase, indicating higher carbohydrate utilization during this period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1l</xref>).

TH levels and metabolic parameters, however, did not correlate across daytime.

In summary, our data suggest that T<sub>3</sub> levels are valid predictors of baseline metabolic state but fail to mirror diurnal changes in metabolic activity at, both, physiological and high T<sub>3</sub> states.

However, high T<sub>3</sub> levels resulted in a marked increase in amplitude and mesor, thus arguing for a pronounced TAG biosynthesis in the light phase, followed by a stronger reduction in the dark phase, which points to higher TAG consumption. Interestingly, in serum, TAG levels were reduced only in the night phase, likely as a result of the higher energy demands of T<sub>3</sub> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).

Our data argue that T<sub>3</sub> is a marker for time-independent metabolic output that is subject to distinct temporal (i.e., diurnal) modulation. At the transcriptome level, T<sub>3</sub> induction led to metabolic pathway rewiring associated with only a minor impact on the circadian clock machinery of the liver.</p><p>In the human hyperthyroidism condition, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> serum levels are both elevated while TSH levels are reduced as part of the inhibitory feedback mechanism of T<sub>3</sub> on TSH secretion. In our experimental model, providing T<sub>3</sub> levels in the drinking water resulted in the activation of TH effects in the liver, but T<sub>4</sub> levels – and, likely, TSH – were reduced, as had previously been reported for this experimental model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johann et al., 2019</xref>). Again, this effect is easily explained by the negative feedback of T<sub>3</sub> on TSH – and, subsequently, T<sub>4</sub> – regulation. Based on this, we refer to our model as ‘T<sub>3</sub> high’ instead of hyperthyroid.</p><p>Another difference between our experimental model and human hyperthyroidism is an increase in body weight in response to T<sub>3</sub> treatment. In fact, some discrepancies between clinical features of hypo- and hyperthyroidism with mouse experimental model for these conditions have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaspari et al., 2020</xref>). In the hypothyroid mouse model, decreased food intake associated with increased EE to maintain core body temperature results in a leaner phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaspari et al., 2020</xref>). For the hyperthyroidism model, although no experimental study has evaluated this discrepancy, it was argued that T<sub>3</sub> increases growth hormone biosynthesis promoting higher body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bargi-Souza et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Upon analyzing the diurnal metabolic effects of T<sub>3</sub>, we identified a reduction in core body temperature amplitude due to an elevation in the light phase. Conversely, T<sub>3</sub> mice showed a higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption amplitude due to increased respiratory activity in the dark phase. Day vs. night analyses confirmed that during the light phase T<sub>3</sub> mice have increase metabolic output, which become higher during the dark phase. The absence of an effect in locomotor activity between the groups reinforces the fact of T<sub>3</sub> as a strong activator of energy metabolism in our study, which is support by experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanni et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cioffi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jonas et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, one could suggest that several adaptive mechanisms must happen to increase basal metabolic rate. In this line, increased energy output shown by T<sub>3</sub> mice seems to rely on a slightly increased glucose (higher RQ quotient) consumption both at light and dark phases. In the liver, our transcriptome analyses revealed important changes in gene expression reflecting increased metabolic output, which will be discussed below.</p><p>Although daytime-specific effects in metabolic outputs were observed, no clear correlation between TH levels and metabolic outputs was found, thus ruling out that T<sub>3</sub> or T<sub>4</sub> are useful <italic>temporal</italic> markers for metabolic output. On the other hand, as a <italic>state</italic> marker, that is, when seen from a longer perspective, T<sub>3</sub> served as a robust predictor of metabolic output. For T<sub>4</sub>, a lack of temporal correlation is easily explained by the absence of diurnal rhythmicity in both normal and high T<sub>3</sub> conditions. Conversely, T<sub>3</sub> levels were circadian in CON mice.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that serum T<sub>3</sub> shows lack of rhythmicity or, if it is present, displays rhythms of small amplitude in humans and/or mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Weeke and Laurberg, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Russell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Philippe and Dibner, 2015</xref>). In our experimental conditions, CON mice displayed a stable diurnal rhythm of T<sub>3</sub>, albeit with a low amplitude. It should be mentioned, however, that T<sub>3</sub> levels showed a temporal variation by ANOVA, with a period of around 12 hr.</p><p>Nonetheless, different sets of genes were differentially expressed at different times of the day, thus suggesting time-dependent effects of T<sub>3</sub> in the liver. This is suggestive of additional underlying mechanisms that are not dependent on the oscillatory T<sub>3</sub> serum levels. We hypothesized that the liver could display increased sensitivity to T<sub>3</sub> effects likely via rhythmicity in TH transporters, <italic>Dio1</italic>, and TH receptors expression and/or activity. To illustrate this concept, our transcriptome analyses showed that the liver diurnal transcriptome has 2336 robustly regulated genes (ca. 10% of the transcriptome). Previous studies from the early 2000s using microarrays identified about 2–5% as T<sub>3</sub>-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Flores-Morales et al., 2002</xref>). Experimental differences such as different T<sub>3</sub> levels associated with differences in statistical and significance threshold levels contribute to the differences found between our data and the previous studies. Enrichment analyses showed that elevated levels of T<sub>3</sub> were associated with oxidation-reduction and immune system-related genes, whereas a negative association was found for glucose and FA metabolism.</p><p>Focusing on comprehending time-of-day-dependent effects in the liver, we focused on the DEGs per timepoint. We identified several hundreds of DEGs across time in T<sub>3</sub> mice, thus arguing for a time-dependent effect of T<sub>3</sub> in the liver. <italic>Dio1</italic> expression is classically associated with liver thyroid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zavacki et al., 2005</xref>). In our dataset, <italic>Dio1</italic> was differently expressed in all ZTs, except for ZT 22, an effect caused by increased variation in the CON group. This finding may reflect an increased need for T<sub>3</sub> metabolization in the liver by DIO1. Although we did not measure DIO1 activity, one could suggest that the observed <italic>Dio1</italic> mRNA upregulation reflects sensitization to a scenario where T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> are down- and upregulated, respectively. Indeed, DIO1’s contribution to thyroid state in the liver is critical while it has little effect on systemic TH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Streckfuss et al., 2005</xref>). Remarkably, 37 genes were identified as time-independent DEGs, that is, displayed stable T<sub>3</sub> state-dependent expression across all timepoints, of which were 22 up- and 15 downregulated in T<sub>3</sub> mice. These genes participate in several biological processes such as xenobiotic transport/metabolism, lipid, FA metabolism, amongst others. From a translational view, we suggest that these genes could be used to evaluate the thyroid state of the liver at any given time in experimental studies. Moreover, these genes could be used to create a signature of thyroid state in the liver in different conditions and diseases.</p><p>While tonic transcriptional targets of T<sub>3</sub> have been described in tissues such as the liver, at the same time, robust diurnal regulation of modulators of TH action such as TH transporters, deiodinases, and TH receptors can be observed from high-resolution circadian studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://circadiomics.igb.uci.edu">http://circadiomics.igb.uci.edu</ext-link>). This prompted us to study how T<sub>3</sub> may affect the transcriptional outputs across the day using established circadian biology methods. Circadian evaluation of CON and T<sub>3</sub> livers revealed 10–15% of the liver transcriptome as rhythmic under both experimental conditions, which is in line with previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greco et al., 2021</xref>). A total of 1032 genes (ca. 5% of the liver transcriptome) were robustly rhythmic under both T<sub>3</sub> conditions. Overall, the elevation of T<sub>3</sub> had a slight phase-delaying effect on these rhythmic genes, which is similar to the effects found in core circadian clock genes. In fact, the similarity in the phase delay between clock gene rhythms and those of robustly rhythmic genes suggests that the latter may indeed involve control through the liver clock. One potential mechanism could involve direct regulation of clock gene transcription by THRB. THRB binding sites are found in the promoter region of several clock genes such as <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Rev-erbα/β, Cry1/2</italic>, and <italic>Per1-3</italic> (GeneCards website, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Safran et al., 2010</xref>). Further experimental studies are required to test this interaction of TH and clock function.</p><p>mRNA expression of TH transporter genes, <italic>Slc16a2</italic> (<italic>Mct8</italic>), <italic>Slc7a8</italic> (<italic>Lat2</italic>), and <italic>Slc10a1</italic> (<italic>Ntcp</italic>), showed a loss of rhythmicity while no gain of rhythmicity was found for T<sub>3</sub> mice. Such loss of rhythmicity in TH transporters could represent a compensatory mechanism for the higher T<sub>3</sub> levels found across the day. The transcriptional response in TH regulators suggests a desensitization mechanism in the liver of T<sub>3</sub> mice with a downregulation of TH receptors but increased baseline expression of <italic>Dio1</italic>, <italic>Slc16a10</italic>, and <italic>Slc7a8</italic>. Collectively, these data suggest a compensatory mechanism of decreased signal responses, elevated transport, and metabolization of T<sub>3</sub> under high T<sub>3</sub> conditions at the mRNA level. However, one must consider the potential diurnal regulation of TH receptor protein levels as well as DIO1 and transporter activity to fully confirm this putative compensatory mechanism.</p><p>Regarding diurnal changes, we observed a strong effect of T<sub>3</sub> on mesor, followed by changes in amplitude and phase. Interestingly, while circadian parameter analysis revealed a strong effect of T<sub>3</sub> on liver transcriptome rhythms, this was mostly without affecting the molecular clock machinery itself. Therefore, T<sub>3</sub> effects in the liver seem to act downstream of the molecular clock through a still elusive mechanism. Considering the broad range of changes found in our study, we focused our efforts on comprehending T<sub>3</sub> effects on metabolic pathways. Our data reveal a strong T<sub>3</sub>-mediated diurnal regulation of energy metabolism, mainly related to glucose and FAs, on the mRNA level. Transcripts associated with both processes lost their rhythmicity under high T<sub>3</sub> conditions, thus becoming constant across the day. Interestingly, we found evidence that T<sub>3</sub> leads to a shift towards FA ß-oxidation over glucose utilization in the liver. T<sub>3</sub> effects in FA biosynthesis showed a preferential effect on the synthesis and oxidation of long-chain FA on the mRNA level. Confirming our predictions, livers from T<sub>3</sub> mice had higher levels of TAG during the light phase compared to CON, thus suggesting a higher TAG synthesis during the rest phase. However, during the dark phase a marked reduction in TAG serum and liver levels was observed, which suggests an important role of FA ß-oxidation as an energy source to meet the higher energetic demands imposed by T<sub>3</sub>. Indeed, such changes can be associated with higher energetic demands (higher VO<sub>2</sub>) both during the light and dark phases in T<sub>3</sub> mice. It is a known fact that T<sub>3</sub> increases TAG synthesis in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>), but our data provide an interesting time of day dependency on T<sub>3</sub> effects. Interestingly, no marked alteration in protein catabolism was found, thus suggesting preferential effects of T<sub>3</sub> for glucose and FA-related energy sources, at least in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our bioinformatic analyses predicted a higher pool of acetyl-CoA in the liver of T<sub>3</sub> mice as a consequence of higher FA ß-oxidation, which we hypothesized to be associated with a putative increased cholesterol biosynthesis. However, no differences were observed in liver cholesterol between the groups, but a marked reduction in serum cholesterol levels was identified in T<sub>3</sub> mice. In face of no differences in cholesterol levels in the liver, but associated with a marked reduction in serum cholesterol, we suggest a cholesterol higher uptake and conversion into bile acid. Indeed, such mechanism is supported by our transcriptomic data as well as the literature as T<sub>3</sub> is known to increase cholesterol secretion via bile acids or non-esterified cholesterol in the feces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mullur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinha et al., 2018</xref>). Such marked diurnal alterations in the liver transcriptome, especially with regard to metabolic pathways, led us to speculate on the overall consequences of high T<sub>3</sub> on organismal rhythms. Loss or weakening of rhythmicity in relevant metabolic processes in other organs, such as the pancreas, white and brown adipose tissue, and other organs, may also take place in the high T<sub>3</sub> condition, which could explain the higher energetic demands induced by elevated T<sub>3</sub> levels. It is still elusive how T<sub>3</sub> affects other metabolic and nonmetabolic organs in a circadian way. Such knowledge will prove useful in designing therapeutic strategies for TH-related diseases such as hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marjot et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Considering the effects seen in the liver circadian transcriptome, associated with the metabolic data provided, we suggest that T<sub>3</sub> may act as a rewiring factor of metabolic rhythms. In this sense, T<sub>3</sub> leads to reduction in rhythmicity of major metabolic pathways to sustain higher energy demands across the day. Such pronounced effects are not reflected in marked alterations in the liver clock. From a chronobiological perspective, T<sub>3</sub> may be considered a disruptor that uncouples the circadian clock from its outputs, thus promoting a state of chronodisruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Potter et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Assis and Oster, 2021</xref>). This duality of T<sub>3</sub> effects warrants further investigation.</p><p>An exciting concept that arises from our data is the concept of chronomodulated regimes for thyroid-related diseases such as hypo- and hyperthyroidism. We suggest evidence that the liver and presumably other organs may show temporal windows in which treatment can be more effective. Based on our diurnal transcriptome data, no optimal time could be suggested due to the lack of rhythmicity for <italic>Dio1</italic>, <italic>Thrb</italic>, and other TH regulator genes. Nonetheless, time-dependent effects in other genes and/or biological processes were identified and could be explored for chronotherapeutic drug intervention.</p><p>Taken altogether, our study shows that T<sub>3</sub> displays time-of-day-dependent effects in metabolism output and liver transcriptome despite the presence of a strong T<sub>3</sub> diurnal rhythm. With regard to metabolism, T<sub>3</sub> acts as a <italic>state</italic> marker but fails to reflect temporal regulation of metabolic output. Metabolic changes induced by T<sub>3</sub> resulted in a higher overall activation and loss of rhythmicity of genes involved in glucose and FA metabolism, concomitant with higher metabolic turnover, and independent of the liver circadian clock. Our findings reveal a novel layer of regulation of TH action in the liver, and, potentially, in other tissues. As we have shown that high T<sub>3</sub> disrupts the rhythmicity of important metabolic processes, this implies that the time of assessment of metabolic parameters in hyperthyroid (and, similarly, hypothyroid) patients should be taken into consideration. Another novel aspect of our findings is the role of liver circadian rhythms in modulating local TH action itself. Such circadian gating might explain variances in the outcomes of T<sub>3</sub> treatment if temporal aspects are not taken into consideration. Our data strongly argue for more temporal control in TH studies. Finally, considering that THs are major regulators of metabolism in the liver, therapies of metabolic pathologies could benefit from chronomodulated regimes. Modulation of TH action has been proposed for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>), and our data may assist in the design of a time-of-day-dependent drug regime for this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marjot et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>One limitation of our finding is the lack of data on the diurnal regulation of T<sub>3</sub> effects at the protein level and on enzymatic regulation. It is not unlikely that these represent additional ways by which circadian rhythms and TH action can interact. Our conclusions arise from gene expression data and, therefore, may not fully account for the full spectrum of diurnal modulation of TH action in the livers. Collectively, our data suggest a novel layer of diurnal regulation of liver metabolism that can bear fruits for future treatments of thyroid-related diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Charna Dibner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim on lines 118-121 that control mice show diurnal regulation of T3 levels in Figure 1 A. Furthermore, the authors claim T3 supplemented mice show no diurnal regulation. Figure 1A shows in fact that control mice show low T3 levels with no diurnal regulation while T3 supplemented mice show robust diurnal levels of T3. The data do not support the authors' claims and this needs to be addressed.</p><p>2) In Figure 1G-O the authors try to determine if there is a correlation between T3 levels and metabolic parameters. They claim that T3 levels were strongly associated with body temperature and V02 (Figure 1H-I). However, when actual T3 levels were correlated with metabolic parameters (Figure 1J-O) there are no correlations that exist. Once again, the author's claims do not seem to be supported by the data presented. This needs to be clarified how their interpretation of this data was derived.</p><p>3) The author's claim to &quot;Comparing the liver transcriptome across times of day and T3 treatment conditions&quot;. However, the volcano plot in Figure 2A does not represent a continuum of time. It only shows genes up or down in response to T3 treatment. The time of day that was analyzed is needed for clarification for this figure.</p><p>4) In clinical hyperthyroidism, both T3 and T4 are elevated along with decreased TSH levels. It might be helpful to bring up in the Discussion chapter the feedback inhibition of TSH and T4 production upon T3 treatment in the mouse model. Given that T4 is converted into T3 mainly in the liver, the decrease in the substrate (T4) may impact the converting enzyme system (notably, Dio1) in the liver. Did the authors observe these changes in the Deiodinases transcript levels? This point also might be included in the discussion.</p><p>5) In Figure 3, There is a weak phase shift in clock gene expression by T3. However, the effect of such change was not observed in other parameters. What is the significance of such changes? The authors should address this within the results or discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors do an elegant job of assessing their goals through comprehensive metabolic and transcriptional profiling. While the authors provide novel insight into the role of T3 in modulating circadian metabolism, both major and minor points arose during the review of this manuscript described below:</p><p>1. The authors provide a rich interpretation of their data within the discussion. However, the physiological and clinical relevance of their studies needs to be enhanced. I still have not garnered the importance of these studies and how the field of thyroid disorders is enhanced. This needs to be addressed within the discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79405.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim on lines 118-121 that control mice show diurnal regulation of T3 levels in Figure 1 A.

Indeed, in CON group, T<sub>3</sub> levels are rhythmic (with a period of 24 h), but with a small amplitude. On the other hand, in the T<sub>3</sub>-treated group, T<sub>3</sub> levels show variations over the course of the day, but with two peaks (around the early morning and early night). Therefore, they are not classified as circadian (i.e., with a period of ca. 24 h), but are considered ultradian according to JTK cycle (Table S1, period of 12h, p = 0.01). In the revised version, a new scaling was introduced, and graphs were double plotted to facilitate visualization. The temporal variations in T<sub>3</sub> levels were acknowledged.</p><p>Line 121 – 124: “However, T3 levels showed a temporal variation (ANOVA, p = 0.006), which classified as ultradian by JTK cycle (12 h period length, Supplementary File 1, p = 0.01) in the T3 treated group. T4 levels were non-rhythmic in all groups (Figure 1A – B, Supplementary File 1).”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1G-O the authors try to determine if there is a correlation between T3 levels and metabolic parameters. They claim that T3 levels were strongly associated with body temperature and V02 (Figure 1H-I). However, when actual T3 levels were correlated with metabolic parameters (Figure 1J-O) there are no correlations that exist. Once again, the author's claims do not seem to be supported by the data presented. This needs to be clarified how their interpretation of this data was derived.</p></disp-quote><p>Our goal was to distinguish to which extent T<sub>3</sub> could serve as long-term marker (<italic>trait effect</italic>) and as an acute (“temporal”) marker (<italic>state effect</italic>) of energy metabolism. For the first approach, we compared activity, temperature, and VO<sub>2</sub> data between the two different T3 conditions. These data indicate that elevation of T3 levels correlates with increased energy turnover in the long run. For the temporal comparison we correlated T3 levels and metabolic parameters at different times of day. To make these differences comparable across the two treatment groups (i.e., to account for trait effects), we normalized all data (T3 and metabolic parameters) to the daily average. Here, all correlative effects are lost. Thus, T3 levels do not predict metabolic activity at any specific time of the day. In other words, T3 is not a <italic>temporal metabolic marker</italic> (Table S2). We think this distinction is very relevant for the field.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s criticism and in this revised version, the average graphs were removed. We now plot T3 average levels against the metabolic outputs and then a linear regression is performed. In this approach, we could see that average T3 levels correlate with body temperature and VO2.</p><p>Line 152 – 156: “Correlating the average levels of T3 against activity, body temperature, and VO2, revealed that body temperature and VO2 were positively correlated with T3 levels (Figure 1G – I). TH levels and metabolic parameters, however, did not correlate across daytime. Therefore, neither T3 nor T4 qualified as markers for diurnal variations in energy metabolism (Figure 1J – O, Supplementary File 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The author's claim to &quot;Comparing the liver transcriptome across times of day and T3 treatment conditions&quot;. However, the volcano plot in Figure 2A does not represent a continuum of time. It only shows genes up or down in response to T3 treatment. The time of day that was analyzed is needed for clarification for this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original version, this sentence was meant to indicate that we combined all timepoints and made a global analysis of the DEGs. We have amended the sentence in the revision.</p><p>Line 165 – 167: “Comparing the liver transcriptome, without taking into consideration the sampling time, 2,343 differentially expressed probe sets (2,336 genes – DEGs) were identified (± 1.5-fold change; FDR &lt; 0.1; Figure 2A, Supplementary File 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In clinical hyperthyroidism, both T3 and T4 are elevated along with decreased TSH levels. It might be helpful to bring up in the Discussion chapter the feedback inhibition of TSH and T4 production upon T3 treatment in the mouse model. Given that T4 is converted into T3 mainly in the liver, the decrease in the substrate (T4) may impact the converting enzyme system (notably, Dio1) in the liver. Did the authors observe these changes in the Deiodinases transcript levels? This point also might be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Although T<sub>3</sub>-treated mice show classical effects of hyperthyroidism, the T<sub>4</sub> levels are severely downregulated. This marked reduction on T<sub>4</sub> level is known to happen in this experimental model and is fully acknowledged in our manuscript. Because of this, we avoided to call T<sub>3</sub> mie hyperthyroid, but rather we addressed them as T<sub>3</sub> high.</p><p><italic>Dio1</italic> expression was markedly increased by T<sub>3</sub> and is among the top 15 highly expressed genes in the global DEGs analysis (Table S3) and it was differentially expressed in every ZT, except in ZT 22 due to a technical variation (Table S4). We did not measure DIO activity, but it is conceivable that the upregulation of Dio1 expression reflects sensitization of the DIO system in the absence of T4. We acknowledged in the manuscript that, although we may see an upregulation of <italic>Dio1</italic>, it is known that this enzyme does not contribute to systemic levels of thyroid hormones, but rather displays an important local role in the liver.</p><p>Please find below the new incorporations made into the manuscript.</p><p>Line 321 – 327: “In the human hyperthyroidism condition, T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> serum levels are both elevated while TSH levels are reduced as part of the inhibitory feedback mechanism of T<sub>3</sub> on TSH secretion. In our experimental model, providing T<sub>3</sub> levels in the drinking water resulted in the activation of TH effects in the liver, but T<sub>4</sub> levels – and, likely, TSH – were reduced, as had previously been reported for this experimental model (Johann et al., 2019). Again, this effect is easily explained by the negative feedback of T<sub>3</sub> on TSH – and, subsequently, T<sub>4</sub> – regulation. Based on this, we refer to our model as “T<sub>3</sub> high” instead of hyperthyroid.”</p><p>Line 382 – 386: “This finding may reflect an increased need for T<sub>3</sub> metabolization in the liver by DIO1. Although, we did not measure DIO1 activity, one could suggest that the observed <italic>Dio1</italic> mRNA upregulation reflects sensitization to a scenario where T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> are down- and upregulated, respectively. Indeed, DIO1’s contribution to thyroid state in the liver is critical while it has little effect on systemic thyroid hormone levels (Streckfuss et al., 2005).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3, There is a weak phase shift in clock gene expression by T3. However, the effect of such change was not observed in other parameters. What is the significance of such changes? The authors should address this within the results or discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We suggest that T<sub>3</sub> has a slight, but consistent phase delay on the clock genes. A similar phase delay is found for the robustly rhythmic genes shared between CON and T<sub>3</sub> groups. The similarity between the phase delay averages might suggest that this is indeed a clock-regulated process. However, it would go beyond the scope of this paper to functionally test this assumption.</p><p>We have a statement in the discussion part.</p><p>Line 404 – 410: “In fact, the similarity in the phase delay between clock gene rhythms and those of robustly rhythmic genes suggests that the latter may indeed involve control through the liver clock. One potential mechanism could involve direct regulation of clock gene transcription by THRB. THRB binding sites are found in the promoter region of several clock genes such as <italic>Bmal1</italic>, <italic>Rev-erbα/β, Cry1/2</italic>, and <italic>Per1-3</italic> (GeneCards website, (Safran et al., 2010)). Further experimental studies are required to test this interaction of TH and clock function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors do an elegant job of assessing their goals through comprehensive metabolic and transcriptional profiling. While the authors provide novel insight into the role of T3 in modulating circadian metabolism, both major and minor points arose during the review of this manuscript described below:</p><p>1. The authors provide a rich interpretation of their data within the discussion. However, the physiological and clinical relevance of their studies needs to be enhanced. I still have not garnered the importance of these studies and how the field of thyroid disorders is enhanced. This needs to be addressed within the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have improved this section in the manuscript.</p><p>Lines 481 – 493: “Our findings reveal a novel layer of regulation of TH action in the liver – and, potentially, in other tissues. As we have shown that high T3 disrupts the rhythmicity of important metabolic processes, this implies that the time of assessment of metabolic parameters in hyperthyroid (and, similarly, hypothyroid) patients should be taken into consideration. Another novel aspect of our findings is the role of liver circadian rhythms in modulating local thyroid hormone action itself. Such circadian gating might explain variances in the outcomes of T3 treatment if temporal aspects are not taken into consideration. Our data strongly argue for more temporal control in TH studies. Finally, considering that THs are major regulators of metabolism in the liver, therapies of metabolic pathologies could benefit from chronomodulated regimes. Modulation of TH action has been proposed for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) treatment (Kowalik et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2022), and our data may assist in the design of a time-of-day dependent drug regime for this approach (Marjot et al., 2022).</p></body></sub-article></article>
