Granulomas are often characterized as a way for the immune system to contain an infection and prevent its dissemination. We recently established a mouse infection model where <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> induces the innate immune system to form granulomas in the liver. This response successfully eradicates the bacteria and returns the liver to homeostasis. Here, we sought to characterize the chemokines involved in directing immune cells to form the distinct layers of a granuloma. We use spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatial and temporal expression of all CC and CXC chemokines and their receptors within this granuloma response. The expression profiles change dynamically over space and time as the granuloma matures and then resolves. To investigate the importance of monocyte-derived macrophages in this immune response, we studied the role of CCR2 during <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection. <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice had negligible numbers of macrophages, but large numbers of neutrophils, in the <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-infected lesions. In addition, lesions had abnormal architecture resulting in loss of bacterial containment. Without CCR2, bacteria disseminated and the mice succumbed to the infection. This indicates that macrophages are critical to form a successful innate granuloma in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic></kwd><kwd>granuloma</kwd><kwd>chemokines</kwd><kwd>CCR2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI139304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI136920</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI175078</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI133236-04S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harvest</surname><given-names>Carissa K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A successful innate granuloma requires CCR2 to organize the macrophage ring, and without CCR2, mice succumb to <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> infection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Granulomas are organized aggregates of immune cells defined by the presence of macrophages, with a variety of other features (i.e. necrosis and fibrosis) being more variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Warren, 1976</xref>). The evolved function of the granuloma response is thought to be a protective mechanism by which immune cells sequester a foreign body or pathogen, walling-off the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>). Some pathogens are not successfully eliminated, however, leading to chronic granulomas that persist for months or sometimes even years. New in vivo models are needed to study the complicated mechanisms that coordinate the formation of protective granulomas, in order to understand the events that lead to the successful clearance of pathogens that initiate this response.</p><p>We seek to identify environmental pathogens that have immense virulence capacity but are defeated by the innate immune system. <italic>Chromobacterium violaceum</italic> is one such pathogen that invades host cells and replicates in the intracellular niche, but only causes morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised animals or individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Macher, 1982</xref>). We discovered that during infection, wildtype (WT) C57BL/6 mice develop necrotic liver granulomas in response to this ubiquitous soil microbe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maltez et al., 2015</xref>). As soon as 1 day post-infection (1 DPI), liver microabscesses can be macroscopically visualized. These lesions are composed primarily of neutrophils until approximately 3–5 DPI, when, importantly, monocytes traffic into the area and form a mature granuloma starting at 5 DPI. Once the resulting macrophage zone surrounds the infected lesion, bacterial burdens begin to decrease, suggesting that granuloma macrophages are an important cell type for the clearance of <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. By 21 DPI, virtually all mice clear the infection and resolve the granuloma pathology, leaving small collagen scars in place of lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). Though we identified neutrophils and macrophages as the key immune players in this model, much remains to be learned about the cellular mechanisms that initiate formation of the granuloma in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, and what signals instruct immune cells to organize within the granuloma architecture. Indeed, by studying the granuloma response that successfully clears <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, we hope to identify critical cellular mechanisms that underlie the basic biology of the granuloma response.</p><p>Within the granuloma response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, neutrophils and then macrophages migrate and assemble in an organized manner. Cellular movement, or chemotaxis, must be carefully regulated during tissue development, homeostasis, and inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes and Nibbs, 2018</xref>). Chemotaxis is controlled by small, secreted proteins called chemokines that signal through transmembrane chemokine receptors. Since their discovery in the 1980s, approximately 50 chemokines are now appreciated for their role in cellular chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2012</xref>). The temporal and spatial expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors dictate cellular trafficking, and dysregulation of these systems is linked to many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Turner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As more chemokines have been identified, there have been multiple revisions to their nomenclature, and now a systematic naming of chemokines and their receptors is in wide use. Chemokines have conserved cysteine residues, and the current naming system categorizes four subfamilies based on the arrangement of these N-terminal cysteines: CXC, CC, XC, and CX<sub>3</sub>C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zlotnik and Yoshie, 2000</xref>). Though there are exceptions, most chemokines fit into one of these four subfamilies. Similarly, chemokine receptors fall into four subfamilies based on their chemokine ligand. The naming scheme has become complicated due to promiscuous ligand–receptor interactions, reassigning of mouse and human homologs after syntenic analysis, and divergent evolution of ligands in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nomiyama et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the detailed description of many chemokines and their receptors has been accomplished in both species. Herein, we focus on the mouse chemokines and their role in the <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-induced murine granuloma.</p><p>Inflammatory chemokines are those that are rapidly upregulated in the presence of infection or other inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">David and Kubes, 2019</xref>). Several cell types can upregulate chemokines, creating a gradient of ligand that diffuses away from the point of infection. Still other cell types can respond to this gradient if/when they express the appropriate receptor. Furthermore, activated cells that migrate to the area can also upregulate expression of chemokines, creating a feed-forward loop to enhance cell recruitment. In addition to mediating chemotaxis, chemokines can induce a variety of other cellular responses including proliferation, oxidative burst, and even degranulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hughes and Nibbs, 2018</xref>). Lastly, it is now appreciated that chemokines also contribute to wound healing and resolution of inflammation, with coordinated efforts between neutrophils and macrophages to clean up debris and halt immune cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soehnlein and Lindbom, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to identify key genes that are upregulated in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, and assess the importance of CCR2-dependent monocyte trafficking to the site of infection in the liver.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatial transcriptomics of an innate granuloma</title><p>In our initial characterization of the granuloma response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, we used spatial transcriptomics (10x Genomics, Visium Platform) to identify genes that are upregulated at critical timepoints during infection, including 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 DPI (note: we excluded the 7 DPI timepoint from analysis because the granuloma in this capture area was not representative of typical 7 DPI granulomas histologically). A major advantage of this technology is the ability to conserve the spatial location of expression data by overlapping cDNA output with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each capture area can collect nearly 5000 barcoded spots, each spot being 55 µm in diameter. Though this is not single-cell resolution, the dataset successfully identified 16 unique clusters with differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), representing cell types (e.g. hepatocytes and endothelial cells), and also representing spatial elements (e.g. necrotic core center, etc.). We further characterized the clusters by assigning appropriate cell types based on each cluster’s gene expression profile and its location within the granuloma (original characterization performed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>, annotation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). Our previous analysis revealed that the clusters on the left of the UMAP (5: necrotic core center, 11: necrotic core-periphery, 9: coagulative necrosis, 0: macrophage, 8: coagulative necrosis-macrophage1, 6: coagulative necrosis-macrophage2, and 15: outside granuloma) all expressed varying levels of CD45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, the clusters on the right of the UMAP lacked CD45 but expressed higher levels of albumin. Though these hepatocyte clusters were abundantly present at each timepoint (not shown), the CD45-positive clusters were present to varying degrees. 10 DPI was the most enriched timepoint with all seven non-hepatocyte clusters present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The sequencing depth varied between clusters, with areas of necrosis displaying relatively lower counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Cluster 0, which we previously identified as a macrophage-rich cluster, also had relatively lower counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Nevertheless, sufficient reads were obtained to reveal upregulated genes in these clusters, and the sctransform method was used to normalize the data such that biological heterogeneity was highlighted while minimizing technical variation associated with low counts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial transcriptomics dataset reveals 16 unique clusters during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SpatialDimPlots showing hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and cluster overlay of spatial transcriptomics data corresponding to various days post-infection (DPI).

Specifically, we were interested in the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors that could be involved in the recruitment of key cell types, namely neutrophils and monocytes, to the site of infection within the liver. Indeed, immune cell trafficking is required for granuloma formation in various infectious and non-infectious models, and chemokines are the obvious candidates for facilitating this chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chensue, 2013</xref>).</p><p>To investigate various chemokines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and chemokine receptors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), we used the Seurat package in RStudio to analyze gene expression over time and space. We used the SpatialFeaturePlot to assess relative gene expression within the granuloma at each timepoint (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). For example, <italic>Pf4</italic> (the murine homolog of <italic>CXCL4</italic>) is highly expressed at 10 DPI, corresponding with clusters 0, 6, 9, 11, and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Though chemokines and chemokine receptors are key facilitators of chemotaxis, other pro-inflammatory molecules such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) also direct cells to sites of inflammation. In fact, neutrophils respond to chemotactic molecules in a hierarchical manner, integrating a variety of signals and prioritizing end-target molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">David and Kubes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Further demonstrating the complexity of chemotaxis, various adhesion molecules are also required for transmigration of cells out of the blood and into tissues. Indeed, we saw significant upregulation of a number of these genes in this model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), with many chemokines, chemokine receptors, and adhesion molecules appearing in the top twenty upregulated genes in several clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Though these chemoattractive and adhesion molecules are likely involved and could be explored in future studies, in this paper we focus on the chemokines and their receptors.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Expression level of chemokine ligands during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>.</title><p>Expression was visually ranked as absent, low, medium, or high based on SpatialFeaturePlots.

For all of these ligands, expression is absent by 21 DPI, which correlates with the time at which the majority of mice clear the infection.

The relative expression of various chemokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>) was much greater than the relative expression of their receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">6</xref>), which is expected because large quantities of chemokines are needed to create gradients in tissues, but comparatively low expression of chemokine receptors is sufficient to enable trafficking of cells that express the receptors.

For example, CCL3, which is highly upregulated during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, can bind to CCR1 (along with several other chemokines), and CCL3 can also bind to CCR5 (again, along with several other chemokines). This promiscuity often makes it challenging to determine what unique or redundant roles each chemokine and chemokine receptor are playing. In order to simplify and graphically depict ligand and receptor interactions that seem relevant to the <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-induced granuloma, we listed the ligands that bind to the receptors that were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). We colored each respective ligand based on its maximum expression ranking, regardless of the timepoint. This visualization allows for easier generation of hypotheses from this complex dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Weakly expressed chemokines suggest that certain immune cells are dispensable</title><p>The chemokines that are not present or are only weakly expressed can also be informative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). Two chemokines that are important for migration to the lung, <italic>Cxcl15</italic> and <italic>Cxcl17</italic>, are both absent (as expected). Still other chemokines that are important for migration to the skin, lymph nodes, and mucosal tissues are also absent, namely <italic>Ccl17</italic>, <italic>Ccl27b</italic>, <italic>Ccl21b-c</italic>, and <italic>Ccl28</italic>, respectively (also as expected). Such negative data provide stronger confidence in the positive expression data for other chemokines.</p><p>In our previous studies, we showed that the adaptive immune response is dispensable to successfully form granulomas around, and then to eradicate, <italic>C. violaceum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). In agreement with those findings, several chemokines involved in T cell trafficking are absent or only expressed at low levels (i.e. <italic>Cxcl11</italic>, <italic>Ccl1</italic>, <italic>Ccl22</italic>, and <italic>Ccl25</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>). On the other hand, other chemokines involved in T cell trafficking such as <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> are highly expressed during the first few days of infection, as is their receptor <italic>Cxcr3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). During primary infection, T cell recruitment is not essential for clearance and we found that T cells are not recruited in large numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). However, <italic>Cxcl9</italic> and <italic>Cxcl10</italic> could play a more important role during a secondary infection that involves the adaptive immune response. It is a curious observation that T cells are dispensable during primary infection because in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>-induced granulomas, CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper type 1 (Th1) cells are required to stimulate the antibacterial activity of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pagán and Ramakrishnan, 2018</xref>). A key difference between granuloma formation in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic> compared to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> could be that <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> is able to intracellularly infect macrophages, whereas <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is unable to circumvent pyroptosis of macrophages.</p><p>We did not observe basophils or eosinophils histologically during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, and this was again supported by the absence or low expression of chemokines involved in trafficking of these cell types (i.e. <italic>Ccl11</italic>, <italic>Ccl24</italic>, and <italic>Ccl26</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). CCR3, which is expressed mainly by eosinophils, plays a major role in the granuloma response to parasitic <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic> eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chensue, 2013</xref>). During infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, however, <italic>Ccr3</italic> is not expressed at any timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), further supporting that eosinophils are not involved in the granuloma response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. Furthermore, granulomas that form in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> often contain follicular dendritic cells which secrete CXCL13 to recruit B cells via CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Domingo-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>Cxcl13</italic> is expressed at low levels, and <italic>Cxcr5</italic> is absent in the <italic>C. violaceum</italic> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, C</xref>). These examples reveal chemokines that are likely dispensable in the context of <italic>C. violaceum</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Comparison of neutrophil- and monocyte-recruiting chemokines</title><p>To compare chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment or monocyte recruitment, we further characterized <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). When comparing their SpatialFeaturePlots, <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> had unique expression profiles corresponding to different cluster identities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). To more easily visualize these differences in expression, we generated UMAP plots and violin plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Though there is some overlap, suggesting that some clusters express both <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic>, there are also some clusters that appear to express only one or the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>). For example, cluster 14 (a cluster enriched for hepatocytes) expressed high levels of <italic>Cxcl1</italic> but only low levels of <italic>Ccl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>).

Though gene expression does not necessarily correlate with the timing and intensity of protein expression, we expect CXCL1 and CCL2 protein levels to accumulate over time, which would allow proper chemokine gradients to form.

However, there are many challenges when studying chemokines. As previously mentioned, ligands and receptors often show promiscuity in that one receptor may bind multiple ligands, which makes it difficult to completely abrogate chemotaxis through inhibiting a single ligand. Furthermore, although chemokine-specific antibodies exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mollica Poeta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vales et al., 2023</xref>), neutralizing such large quantities of ligand can be challenging. Therefore, instead of attempting to block chemokine ligands, we chose to target chemokine receptors. In fact, the promiscuity of ligands and receptors means that targeting one chemokine receptor has the potential to impact more than one ligand of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Nevertheless, targeting receptors is also challenging due to poor solubility of many receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>During infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, neutrophils appear in the liver within 1 DPI. However, it is still unclear what signals initiate their migration into the liver. Though a large number of neutrophils are already present in the blood during homeostasis, additional neutrophils expressing CXCR2 exit the bone marrow in response to endothelial cell-derived CXCL1 and CXCL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">David and Kubes, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, tissue-resident macrophages can also express CXCL1, CXCL2, and various leukotrienes in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soehnlein and Lindbom, 2010</xref>). Though <italic>Cxcr2</italic> knockout mice exist, they have abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cacalano et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, to assess the role of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and CXCL5 in neutrophil trafficking during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, we used a CXCR2 inhibitor. Reparixin is an allosteric inhibitor of CXCR1 and CXCR2 that has been shown to inhibit neutrophil trafficking during ischemia–reperfusion injury and acid-induced acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zarbock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hosoki and Sur, 2018</xref>). We pre-treated mice with reparixin or saline (PBS) 1 day before infection, then infected mice with <italic>C. violaceum</italic> followed by daily treatment with reparixin or PBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then harvested livers and spleens at 3 DPI to assess bacterial burdens. Though there was no difference in CFU for the liver, a few CFU were recovered from the spleens of two reparixin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which, though this was not statistically significant, is unusual for WT mice. Based on these results, we hypothesized that reparixin would have a stronger effect at 1 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), before the infection causes excessive damage to the liver. At 1 DPI, we again saw no difference in bacterial burdens in the liver of reparixin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To verify that reparixin affected neutrophil numbers in the liver and spleen, we used flow cytometry to quantify Ly6G<sup>+</sup> neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We observed differences in the number of neutrophils between PBS-treated female and male mice, so data were analyzed disaggregated for sex. Though reparixin might have caused a subtle decrease in neutrophil numbers in the liver and spleen at 1 DPI, the results were variable between mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). In our hands, reparixin was poorly soluble in PBS, which could account for some of the variability. Because monocytes also express CXCR2, albeit to a much lesser extent than neutrophils, we also stained for CD68. There was no marked difference in macrophage numbers in the liver or spleen between PBS- and reparixin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H, I</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, it is clear that reparixin was not a successful inhibitor of neutrophil recruitment during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. The role of CXCR1/2 and their ligands could be further studied using knockout mice. Regardless, other chemoattractants likely contribute to neutrophil recruitment as well. Indeed, neutrophils migrate in response to a variety of pro-inflammatory DAMPs and PAMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Importantly, formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) such as FPR2 promote neutrophil migration in response to bacterial infection in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). In support of this, FPRs are upregulated in this model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CCR2 is essential for monocyte trafficking and defense against <italic>C. violaceum</italic></title><p>Previously, we noticed that the appearance of organized macrophages at approximately 5 DPI correlates with a subsequent decrease in bacterial burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). We also observed that <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, which lack the ability to express inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), succumb to infection beginning at 7 DPI, a timepoint when the granuloma matures with a thicker macrophage ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). Though neutrophils can also express iNOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saini and Singh, 2018</xref>), these data suggested that macrophages are playing a critical protective role. We therefore hypothesized that monocyte trafficking to the site of infection is a key event in clearing the infection. There are several candidate chemokines that could attract monocytes to the site of infection, and these chemokines bind to several different receptors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). We chose to focus on the chemokine receptor CCR2 because of its known role in monocyte migration out of the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>). Importantly, <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice have intact tissue-resident macrophage populations but are unable to recruit additional monocytes in the event of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kurihara et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of monocyte trafficking to lesions in the liver<italic>,</italic> we infected <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. Strikingly, <italic>Ccr2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice were highly susceptible and succumbed to infection beginning at 5 DPI, with all mice dying by 9 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which is more severe than the phenotype in <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>).

Importantly, without distinct coagulative necrosis or macrophage zones, <italic>C. violaceum</italic> staining extends well outside the center of each lesion. In fact, numerous bacteria were identified in immune cells immediately adjacent to the healthy hepatocyte layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Importantly, we also observed these key differences through immunofluorescence, including larger necrotic cores with increased Ly6G staining, loss of organized macrophage zones, and bacterial staining directly adjacent to healthy hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Furthermore, immunofluorescent staining of CCL2 revealed diffuse quantities in both WT and <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, with <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice producing higher amounts of CCL2 in the liver and serum compared to WT mice at 3 DPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). This indicates that, especially in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, the immune system is continuously calling for monocyte mobilization in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection. Taken together, the tissue staining, along with the elevated CFU burdens, suggests that monocyte recruitment fails without CCR2, and the lack of a macrophage zone leads to loss of bacterial containment. Despite the excessive number of neutrophils in the liver, spleen, and blood of <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, I, K</xref>), these mice are unable to clear the infection and ultimately succumb.</p><p>Previously, we observed abnormal lesion architecture in <italic>Casp1::Casp11</italic> DKO and <italic>Gsdmd</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice with budding morphology and loss of bacterial containment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>) that is remarkably similar to the architecture observed in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). However, the <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice survive a few days longer and thus develop even larger lesions over time. Together, these data suggest that macrophage recruitment and pyroptosis are both essential in defense against, and containment of, <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. In addition, because the <italic>Ccr2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice succumb in a timeframe similar to that seen with <italic>Nos2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, this supports our hypothesis that it is nitric oxide derived from granuloma macrophages that is specifically required for bacterial clearance. Altogether, these data indicate that without monocytes trafficking to the site of infection, <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is able to replicate and spread into adjacent hepatocytes, resulting in ever-expanding lesions. These in vivo data support the transcriptomics dataset and provide proof-of-concept that upregulated genes, specifically chemokines, are critical to the formation of the granuloma.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we demonstrate that macrophages are essential for clearance of <italic>C. violaceum</italic> from the infected liver, and for protection against dissemination into the spleen. Loss of CCR2-dependent monocyte trafficking results in a loss of bacterial containment, ultimately leading to uncontrolled bacterial replication in the liver, evidenced by elevated CFU burdens and increased lesion size.</p><p>There are many questions that still remain about the individual and coordinated efforts of neutrophils and macrophages during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. It is likely that the tissue-resident Kupffer cells and infected hepatocytes are the first cells to sound the alarm, calling for neutrophils. The initial recruitment of neutrophils likely involves chemokines (i.e. CXCL1 and CXCL2) redundantly with other chemoattractants such as formylated peptides and leukotrienes. However, these neutrophils are unable to clear the infection despite being recruited in large numbers.</p><p>Based on our data, CCR2 is an essential chemokine receptor for monocyte trafficking in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, but we have not yet determined which ligand(s) mediate this response. CCL2 and CCL7 can both bind to CCR2 to induce monocyte trafficking. Importantly, pro-inflammatory cytokines and PAMPs can induce CCL2 expression by most cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi and Pamer, 2011</xref>). In agreement, we see upregulation of <italic>Ccl2</italic> in several clusters and deposition of CCL2 protein in wide areas around granulomas, further suggesting that CCL2 may be a critical chemokine that promotes monocyte recruitment in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. In contrast, <italic>Ccl7</italic> is expressed by fewer clusters, and to a lesser degree, and its expression is slightly delayed compared to <italic>Ccl2</italic>. Deletion of either ligand partially diminished monocyte trafficking in response to <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> infection, but the individual role of each ligand was unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jia et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies using <italic>C. violaceum</italic> could further elucidate the unique or redundant roles of CCL2 and CCL7. Lastly, adoptive transfer experiments in the context of <italic>Listeria</italic> infection showed that <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> monocytes are still able to traffic to the site of infection in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serbina and Pamer, 2006</xref>) and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shi et al., 2010</xref>). During <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection, we have not yet determined whether CCR2 is required for migration once monocytes have left the bone marrow, as CCR2 is required for this initial egress. We saw a subtle increase in the number of macrophages in the liver of infected <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Though macrophage numbers in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> tissues remain considerably lower than seen in WT mice, there are two explanations for the subtle increase: (1) loss of CCR2 may not completely abrogate monocyte recruitment, as monocytes could be migrating via other chemokine receptors, or (2) tissue-resident macrophages, or even tissue-resident hematopoietic stem cells, could undergo emergency hematopoiesis and proliferate in response to infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boettcher and Manz, 2017</xref>). More studies are needed to assess the origin of this small population of macrophages in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Regardless, this small population of macrophages is not sufficient to protect against infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>.</p><p>In other granuloma models, the role of CCR2 is less clear. Loss of CCR2-dependent monocyte trafficking enhances clearance of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), which is a surprising result as typically macrophages would be expected to be important to clear infections. The role of CCR2 during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection is strain-dependent, and also varies depending on the dose and route of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunlap et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scott and Flynn, 2002</xref>). Though there are similarities between these infection models and <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, there are numerous differences. For example, expression of specific chemokines in response to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> differs from those we observe in response to <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, especially chemokines that attract T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). A key concept in the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> field is that a delicate balance exists between cellular recruitment to control infection, and excess inflammation that causes disease symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Monin and Khader, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, excess recruitment of monocytes to <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>-induced granulomas leads to increased bacterial replication due to the ability of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> to inhibit degradation within phagosomes in which it resides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Domingo-Gonzalez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Slight and Khader, 2013</xref>). In contrast, <italic>C. violaceum</italic> appears to lack sufficient virulence factors to enable it to replicate within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Batista and da Silva Neto, 2017</xref>). Importantly, while <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> bacterial burdens plateau at 21 DPI, almost all mice clear <italic>C. violaceum</italic> by this timepoint. Though decades of research have been dedicated to investigating <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, fewer studies involving other granuloma-inducing pathogens have been performed. As we continue to study the cellular mechanisms that allow for successful granuloma formation and clearance of <italic>C. violaceum</italic>, it will be interesting to compare the two pathogens, as future studies could shed light on key differences that result in successful pathogen clearance.</p><p>In WT mice, neutrophil recruitment wanes as the granuloma matures, which coincides with clearance of <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. However, in the <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, we see elevated neutrophil numbers at 5 DPI, suggesting that neutrophils are continuously recruited in the absence of macrophages. Under normal circumstances, endocytosis of chemokines by endothelial cells helps to diminish chemokine gradients, limiting prolonged neutrophil recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolaczkowska and Kubes, 2013</xref>). Future studies could investigate the various signals that diminish neutrophil recruitment in WT mice during clearance, and why this fails in <italic>Ccr2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. Another interesting component of the granuloma response is the spatial arrangement of neutrophils and macrophages within the granuloma. In vitro studies found that CCR1 and CCR5 differentially affected monocyte localization within a transwell system, implying that a system exists for fine-tuning the exact location of macrophages within inflamed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shi and Pamer, 2011</xref>). These receptors are highly upregulated in the <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-induced granuloma and are thus good candidates for balancing the localization of macrophages between the coagulative necrosis zone and healthy tissue outside the granuloma.</p><p>Lastly, this dataset inspires a number of new hypotheses related to granuloma resolution and tissue repair after bacterial clearance. Chemokines undergo a variety of post-translational modifications, such as glycosylation, nitration, citrullination, and proteolytic cleavage, which can either enhance or abrogate their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vanheule et al., 2018</xref>). For example, nitration of CCL2 and CCL3 by peroxynitrite was shown to reduce monocyte and neutrophil chemotaxis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sato et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sato et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, binding to atypical receptors can also affect chemokine availability, representing another mechanism to resolve inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hansell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ulvmar et al., 2011</xref>). Of particular interest is the implication of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in regulating chemokine functions. MMPs can not only directly cleave chemokines, they can also cleave various chemokine-binding proteins that help establish the chemokine gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Parks et al., 2004</xref>). Several studies have found that MMPs can cleave chemokines to alter their function, either increasing or decreasing their receptor binding activity. For example, MMP-2 cleaves both CXCL12 and CCL7, abolishing their ability to induce chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McQuibban et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McQuibban et al., 2001</xref>); importantly, all three of these genes are upregulated during <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Furthermore, MMP-2 and MMP-9 have been extensively studied in the context of lung inflammation, both of which are important to limit tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Greenlee et al., 2006</xref>). MMP-9 has also been shown to promote or inhibit liver fibrosis and wound repair, depending on the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2018</xref>). An unsolved mystery during infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is how the chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes is abrogated when the infection is cleared, and how wound repair and resolution is initiated. Future studies could characterize the role of MMPs during resolution, especially MMP-9 and its various targets in relation to wound repair.</p><p>Analysis of a spatial transcriptomics dataset revealed the upregulation of many chemokines and their receptors during murine infection with <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. Here, we show that CCR2 is an essential chemokine receptor for monocyte trafficking, which enables the formation of mature granulomas with organized macrophage zones. Importantly, loss of organized macrophages leads to loss of bacterial containment. This work has given new insight into the function of chemokines during granuloma formation, and this model of <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-induced granuloma formation will be useful in exploring the unique and redundant roles of chemokines during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Spatial data were generated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref> using the 10X Genomics Visium Platform. We were most interested in the immune cells present within the distinct zones of each lesion, and the adjacent healthy hepatocytes. Therefore, we used Loupe Browser v7.0 to visualize the H&amp;E-stained tissues and manually select spots of interest. We deselected spots that were distant from infected lesions, while selecting the lesions and surrounding healthy hepatocytes. To account for cell-to-cell variation, especially across tissues, pre-processing included normalization using sctransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). To further analyze the spatial transcriptomics dataset of the selected spots, we used the Seurat package in RStudio to analyze gene expression over time and space. UMAP plots, SpatialDimPlots, SpatialFeaturePlots, ggplots, and Violin plots were all used to visualize normalized gene expression data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ethics statement and mouse studies</title><p>All mice were housed in groups of two to five according to IACUC guidelines at Duke University (under protocols A018-23-01 and A043-20-02).

Briefly, spleens were placed in a 2-ml homogenizer tube with 1 large metal bead and 1 ml sterile PBS, and whole livers were placed in a 7-ml homogenizer tube with 1 large metal bead and 3 ml sterile PBS. Tube weights were recorded before and after tissue harvest to normalize CFUs/volume/tissue. After homogenizing, 1:5 serial dilutions were performed in sterile PBS, and dilutions were plated on BHI in triplicate or quadruplicate. The following day, bacterial colonies were counted and CFU burdens calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>At the indicated DPI, mice were euthanized and the spleen, liver, and whole blood were harvested for flow cytometry as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>). For experiments involving whole blood, cardiac puncture was used to collect 100 µl whole blood prior to perfusion with PBS through the vena cava as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mendoza et al., 2022</xref>. Briefly, whole livers were minced on ice using scissors and incubated in digestion buffer (100 U/ml Collagenase Type IV in DMEM supplemented with 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) for 40 min in a 37°C water bath with intermittent vortexing. Digested livers were homogenized through a 40-µm cell strainer, followed by washing with RPMI (supplemented with 1× Pen/Strep and 1% FBS) and centrifugation at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 8 min. Leukocytes from the liver were further isolated using a Percoll gradient where samples were resuspended in 45% Percoll with an 80% Percoll underlay, and spun at 800 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min with no brake. For spleens, tissues were mechanically homogenized through a 70-µm strainer, followed by washing and centrifugation at 300 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. Red blood cells were lysed with 1× RBC Lysis Buffer according to product manual (note: whole blood was stained with Ly6G at room temperature prior to RBC lysis. Blood samples were treated identically to liver and spleen samples thereafter). Liver and spleen samples were counted using trypan blue, and 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per tissue per mouse were stained for various cell markers: Mouse BD Fc Block (1 µg), rat anti-mouse Ly6G in BV421 (1:300), rat anti-mouse CD68 in FITC (1:300) for 30 min. For CD68, staining was performed using Intracellular Fixation &amp; Permeabilization Buffer according to product manual. For each sample, 10,000 events were acquired on a BD LSRFortessa X-20 Cell Analyzer at the Duke Flow Cytometry Core Facility. Samples were analyzed using FlowJo (for Windows, version 10.7.1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>ELISA</title><p>At 3 DPI, mice were euthanized and whole blood (about 500 µl) and a piece of liver were harvested for ELISA.

The research core performed tissue embedding, serial sectioning, slide mounting, and staining of H&amp;E samples. For IHC, serial sections were then processed and stained as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harvest et al., 2023</xref>. Washes were performed in 1× TBS-T. Primary antibodies were diluted in SignalStain antibody diluent, and included: rabbit anti-<italic>C. violaceum</italic> (1:2000), rat anti-Ly6G (1:300), and rat anti-CD68 (1:200). Slides were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4°C in a humidity chamber. Prior to staining with secondary antibody, endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Slides were incubated in secondary antibody (SignalStain Boost HRP anti-rabbit or ImmPRESS HRP anti-rat) at room temperature for 30 min. Incubation with DAB Substrate Kit was performed for 30 s to 2 min, depending on the intensity of signal. Slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin for 5 s to 1 min, depending on the intensity of the DAB, and then dipped in bluing reagent for 1 min.

As a result of their spatial transcriptomic analysis, the authors narrow in on the contribution of neutrophil-and monocyte-recruiting pathways to host response. This results in the observation that monocyte recruitment is critical for granuloma formation and infection control, while neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 may be dispensable.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Since <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is a self-limiting granulomatous infection, it makes an excellent case study for 'successful' granulomatous inflammation. This stands in contrast to chronic, unproductive granulomas that can occur during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, sarcoidosis, and other granulomatous conditions, infectious or otherwise. Given the short duration of <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection, this study specifically highlights the importance of innate immune responses in granulomas.</p><p>Another strength of this study is the temporal analysis. This proves to be important when considering the spatial distribution and timing of cellular recruitment. For example, the authors observe that the intensity and distribution of neutrophil and monocyte recruiting chemokines vary substantially across infection time and correlate well with their previous study of cellular dynamics in <italic>C. violaceum</italic> granulomas.</p><p>The intervention studies done in the last part of the paper bolster the relevance of the authors' focus on chemokines. The authors provide important negative data demonstrating the null effect of CXCR1/2 inhibition on neutrophil recruitment during <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection. That said, the authors' difficulty with solubilizing reparixin in PBS is an important technical consideration given the negative result. On the other hand, monocyte recruitment via CCR2 proves to be indispensable for granuloma formation and infection control.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several shortcomings that limit the impact of this study. The first is that the cohort size is very limited. While the transcriptomic data is rich, the authors analyze just one tissue from one animal per timepoint. This assumes that the selected individual will have a representative lesion and prevents any analysis of inter-individual variability. Granulomas in other infectious diseases, such as schistosomiasis and tuberculosis, are very heterogeneous. The authors do assert that in <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection granulomas are very consistent in their composition and kinetics, alleviating, in part, this concern.</p><p>Another caveat to these data is the limited or incompletely informative data analysis. This dataset has been previously published with more extensive and broad characterization. Here, the authors use Visium in a more targeted manner to interrogate certain chemokines and cytokines. While this is a great biological avenue, key findings rely on qualitative inspection of gene expression overlaid on to images or data that has been qualitatively binned or thresholded. Upon revision the authors did supplement their analyses with important information, such as the top expressed genes in each Visium cluster and the dynamic range of RNA counts retrieved across clusters.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors are underutilizing the spatial information provided by Visium with no spatial analysis conducted to quantify the patterning of expression patterns or spatial correlation between factors. The authors acknowledge the challenge of conducting this analysis given the variable size and geometry of the granulomas. In future studies, this can be overcome through size- or distance-based normalization or spatial clustering approaches that evaluate local neighborhood composition across different scales.</p><p>Impact:</p><p>The author's analysis helps highlight the chemokine profiles of protective, yet host protective granulomas. As that authors comment on in their discussion, these findings have important similarities and differences with other notable granulomatous conditions, such as tuberculosis. Beyond the relevance to <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection, these data can help inform studies of other types of granulomas and hone candidate strategies for host-directed therapy strategies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96425.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Amason</surname><given-names>Megan E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Duke University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beatty</surname><given-names>Cole J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Duke University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Harvest</surname><given-names>Carissa K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0130frc33</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chapel Hill</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saban</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Duke University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Edward A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00py81415</institution-id><institution>Duke University</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Durham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Amason et al. investigated the formation of granulomas in response to Chromobacterium violaceum infection, aiming to uncover the cellular mechanisms governing the granuloma response.

The manual selection of regions of granulomas for analysis could use additional context - was the rest of the liver not sequenced, or excluded for other reasons? Including a healthy liver in the analysis could serve as a control for any lasting effects at the final time point of 21 days.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the text in the methods section to include additional information about manual selection of regions. The entire tissue section was sequenced, but using H&amp;E as a guide, we manually selected each representative lesion and a surrounding layer of healthy hepatocytes at each timepoint. We agree that an uninfected control could be useful, however we did not include an uninfected mouse in the experiment because we were most interested in the cells that make up the granuloma, not hepatocytes outside the lesion. Additionally, we find that in the 21 DPI timepoint the surrounding hepatocytes appear to have returned to a homeostatic transcriptional state; at 21 DPI the majority of mice have undetectable CFU burdens.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Providing more context for the scalebars throughout the spatial analyses, such as whether the data are raw counts or normalized based on the number of reads per spatial spot, would be helpful for interpretation, as changes in expression could signal changes in the numbers of cells or changes in the gene expression of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The scalebars for the SpatialFeaturePlots display the normalized gene expression values. The data are normalized based on the number of reads per spatial spot, using the sctransform method published in (Hafemeister &amp; Satija, 2019). We agree that the changes in expression could result from changes in cell numbers and/or changes in gene expression on a per cell basis. However, the sctransform method is designed to preserve biological variation while minimizing technical effects observed in transcriptomics platforms. Regardless of the heterogeneity of sequencing depth, it is clear from these plots that gene expression changes dynamically over time and space, which was the focus of our analysis. We have updated the figure legends to clarify scalebar units, and revised the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, qualitative measurements are valuable, but having an idea of the raw data for a few of the pursued chemokines/receptors would aid interpretation</p></disp-quote><p>All of the SpatialFeaturePlots utilized to generate Figure 4 have been included in the manuscript, either in the main figures or in the supplemental figures.

Different clusters do show variability in the relative change in expression. To better show these data, we have included an additional graphic that summarizes the top twenty upregulated genes for each cluster, many of which include chemokines (new Table 4). The average log2FC values for each of these genes can be found in Table 4 – source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 5E and F would benefit from clarification regarding the x-axis units and whether the expression levels are summed across all clusters for each time point</p></disp-quote><p>Figures 5E and 5F display the normalized gene expression values for all spots (independent of cluster identity) at each timepoint. We have updated the figure legend to reflect this clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, information on the sequencing depth of the samples would be helpful, particularly as shallow sequencing of RNA can result in poor capture of low-expression transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that sequencing depth is an additional factor to take into consideration. We have included an additional supplemental figure (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-B) to display raw counts spatially at the various timepoints, and within each cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the conclusion of the essentiality of macrophages in granuloma formation, it may be prudent to further investigate the role of macrophages versus CCR2. Consideration of experiments deleting macrophages directly, instead of CCR2, could provide more definitive evidence of the necessity of macrophage migration in containing infections.</p></disp-quote><p>While CCR2 is expressed on a number of other cells besides monocytes, it is well-documented that loss of CCR2 results in accumulation of monocytes in the bone marrow and a significant reduction in the blood-monocyte population. As a result, monocytes are not recruited to the site of infection in numerous prior publications in the field; we confirm this as shown by flow cytometry and IHC. Nonetheless, future studies will aim to rescue <italic>Ccr2</italic>–/– mice via adoptive transfer of monocytes to further show that monocyte-derived macrophages are essential for defense against infection. We also intend to perform clodronate depletion experiments at various timepoints, however, clodronate will also deplete Kupffer cells and has off-target effects on neutrophils. Overall, the established importance of CCR2 for monocyte egress from the bone marrow and our observation that the macrophage ring fails to form give us sufficient confidence to conclude that monocyte-derived macrophages are essential for this innate granuloma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Analyzing total cell counts in the liver after infection could provide insight into whether the decrease in the fraction of macrophages is due to decreased numbers or infiltration of other cell types...</p></disp-quote><p>Our flow data suggest that the decrease in macrophages in <italic>Ccr2</italic>–/– mice is due to both a decrease in macrophage number and an increase in the infiltration of other cell types (namely neutrophils). To better illustrate this, we now include an additional quantification of the total cell counts in the liver and spleen (new Figure 6 – figure supplement 1), which supports our conclusion that <italic>Ccr2</italic>–/– mice have a defect in granuloma macrophage numbers. We have also repeated the experiment to reach sufficient numbers to perform statistical analysis (revised Figure 6F–K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Amason et al employ spatial transcriptomics and intervention studies to probe the spatial and temporal dynamics of chemokines and their receptors and their influence on cellular dynamics in <italic>C. violaceum</italic> granulomas. As a result of their spatial transcriptomic analysis, the authors narrow in on the contribution of neutrophil- and monocyte-recruiting pathways to host response. This results in the observation that monocyte recruitment is critical for granuloma formation and infection control, while neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 may be dispensable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughtful comments and suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>Since <italic>C. violaceum</italic> is a self-limiting granulomatous infection, it makes an excellent case study for 'successful' granulomatous inflammation. This stands in contrast to chronic, unproductive granulomas that can occur during <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> infection, sarcoidosis, and other granulomatous conditions, infectious or otherwise. Given the short duration of <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection, this study specifically highlights the importance of innate immune responses in granulomas.</p><p>Another strength of this study is the temporal analysis. This proves to be important when considering the spatial distribution and timing of cellular recruitment. For example, the authors observe that the intensity and distribution of neutrophil- and monocyte-recruiting chemokines vary substantially across infection time and correlate well with their previous study of cellular dynamics in <italic>C. violaceum</italic> granulomas.</p><p>The intervention studies done in the last part of the paper bolster the relevance of the authors' focus on chemokines. The authors provide important negative data demonstrating the null effect of CXCR1/2 inhibition on neutrophil recruitment during <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection. That said, the authors' difficulty with solubilizing reparixin in PBS is an important technical consideration given the negative result...</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and the limited solubility of reparixin and other chemokine-receptor inhibitors is a major caveat of this study and others in the field. In future studies, there are several other inhibitors that could be used to further assess the role of CXCR1/2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, monocyte recruitment via CCR2 proves to be indispensable for granuloma formation and infection control. I would hesitate to agree with the authors' interpretation that their data proves macrophages are serving as a physical barrier from the uninvolved liver. It is possible and likely that they are contributing to bacterial control through direct immunological activity and not simply as a structural barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that macrophages do not form a physical or structural barrier, a word that implies epithelial-like function. Instead, we agree that macrophages mostly act immunologically. We revised the text to remove the term barrier.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several shortcomings that limit the impact of this study. The first is that the cohort size is very limited. While the transcriptomic data is rich, the authors analyze just one tissue from one animal per time point. This assumes that the selected individual will have a representative lesion and prevents any analysis of inter-individual variability.</p><p>Granulomas in other infectious diseases, such as schistosomiasis and tuberculosis, are very heterogeneous, both between and within individuals. It will be difficult to assert how broadly generalizable the transcriptomic features are to other <italic>C. violaceum</italic> granulomas...</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this key difference between granulomas in other infectious diseases, and granulomas induced by <italic>C. violaceum</italic>. Based on many prior experiments, we observe that <italic>C. violaceum</italic>-induced granulomas are very reproducible between and within individuals (highlighted in our previous publication). As this is a major advantage of this model system, we chose specific timepoints based on key events that consistently occur in the majority of lesions assessed at each timepoint, allowing us to be confident in the selection of representative granulomas. However, it is worth noting that granulomas within an individual mouse are seeded and resolved somewhat asynchronously. This did indeed affect our spatial transcriptomic data, as the 7 DPI timepoint was not histologically representative of a typical 7 DPI granuloma. Therefore, we excluded the 7 DPI timepoint from our analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, this undermines any opportunity for statistical testing of features between time points, limiting the potential value of the temporal data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there is much more characterization and quantification that can be done. As demonstrated by the abundance of spatial and temporal data for the chemokine family alone, the spatial transcriptomics dataset is rich and will likely supply us with many years of analyses and investigations. Our current approach is to use the spatial transcriptomics dataset as a hypothesis-generating tool, followed by in vivo studies that seek to uncover physiological relevance for our observations. In the current paper, the strength of the spatial transcriptomic data for CCL2, CCL7 and their receptor CCR2 prompted us to study <italic>Ccr2</italic>–/– mice. These mice then prove the relevance of the spatial transcriptomic data. In regard to conclusions about temporal changes in chemokine expression, in this manuscript we do not make conclusions that CCL2 is important at one timepoint but not another. We are characterizing the broad temporal trends of expression in order to cast a broad net to inform future in vivo studies. There is much work for us to do to explore all the induced chemokines and their receptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another caveat to these data is the limited or incompletely informative data analysis. The authors use Visium in a more targeted manner to interrogate certain chemokines and cytokines. While this is a great biological avenue, it would be beneficial to see more general analyses considering Visum captures the entire transcriptome. Some important questions that are left unanswered from this study are:</p><p>What major genes defined each spatial cluster?...</p></disp-quote><p>The initial characterization of each spatial cluster was performed in Harvest et al., 2023. In brief, we used a mixture of published single-cell sequencing data, histological-based parameters, and ImmGen to define each cluster. We have not re-stated those methods in the current manuscript, but instead reference our prior paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What were the top differentially expressed genes across time points of infection?...</p></disp-quote><p>Though the top differentially expressed genes for each cluster can be informative in some situations, we chose a more targeted approach because of the obvious importance of chemokines. Nonetheless, we have included an additional graphic that summarizes the top twenty upregulated genes for each cluster (new Table 4). The average log2FC values for each of these genes can be found in Table 4 – source data 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors choose to focus on chemokines/receptors purely from a hypothesis perspective or did chemokines represent a major signature in the transcriptomic differences across time points?</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to focus on chemokines because of their obvious importance for recruitment of immune cells. They were also among the highest induced genes in the spatial transcriptome (new Table 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the absence of deep characterization of the spatial transcriptomic data, the study lacks sufficient quantitative analysis to back up the authors' qualitative assessments...</p></disp-quote><p>See above comment regarding statistical comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors are underutilizing the spatial information provided by Visium with no spatial analysis conducted to quantify the patterning of expression patterns or spatial correlation between factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Several factors make quantification challenging. Lesions grow considerably in size in the first few days of infection, and then shrink in size in the latter days. This makes quantification challenging between timepoints. Radial quantification is also challenging due to the irregular shapes of each granuloma (see comment below for further discussion). Most importantly, the key next experiments are to validate the importance of each chemokine and receptor in vivo. Once we know which ones are the most important, this will justify putting more effort into spatial quantitative analysis and patterning of expression for those chemokines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Impact:</p><p>The author's analysis helps highlight the chemokine profiles of protective, yet host protective granulomas. As the authors comment on in their discussion, these findings have important similarities and differences with other notable granulomatous conditions, such as tuberculosis. Beyond the relevance to <italic>C. violaceum</italic> infection, these data can help inform studies of other types of granulomas and hone candidate strategies for host-directed therapy strategies.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The Visium analysis would be strengthened by</p><p>(1) Showing several histology examples of granulomas at each timepoint to help aid the reader in seeing how 'representative' each Visium sample is...</p></disp-quote><p>These histological analyses are performed in our previous manuscript, and indeed were a crucial aspect of the initial characterization of the spatial transcriptomics dataset, which was performed in Harvest et al., 2023. Full liver sections are shown in that paper at each timepoint, and readers can see that the architecture is highly reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Validating their results in other tissues, either with Visium or with more targeted assays for their study's key molecules, such as immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on the importance of validation studies and have plans to perform single-cell RNA sequencing experiments to further enhance resolution. With key genes in mind, we then plan to perform more in vivo studies to assess physiological relevance of upregulated genes in specific cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At the very least it would be important to validate the expression of CXCL1 and CXCL2 in other tissues and at the protein level, given the importance of those findings</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the reviewer is asking us to validate that CXCL1 and CXCL2 are actually expressed given the negative reparixin data. However, if we do prove that they are expressed, this will not resolve whether they have critical roles in neutrophil recruitment. To prove this, we would need either a better CXCR2 inhibitor or <italic>Cxcr2</italic> knockout mice. Therefore, we are saving further exploration for the future. Regarding validating other chemokines, we establish that CCR2 is critical, and we now show by immunofluorescence and ELISA (new Figure 7 – figure supplement 4) that CCL2 is highly expressed in WT mice, and <italic>Ccr2</italic>–/– mice actually have strongly elevated CCL2 expression at 3 DPI compared to WT mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1B, the UMAP here is largely uninformative. To display the clusters, the authors should instead show a heatmap or equivalent visualization of which genes defined each cluster. It would be helpful for the authors to also write out the full name of each cluster before using the abbreviations shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our previous comment about the initial characterization of clusters performed in Harvest et al., 2023, which details the characteristic genes for each cluster. We have written the full names of each cluster in the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1C the authors, use a binary representation of whether a cluster is present or not at a particular time point. However, the spot size is arbitrary, and the colors of the dots are the same as the cluster color code. It is not clear what threshold the authors (or SpatialDimPlots) use to declare a given cluster is present at a given time point. Therefore, this chart does not give any sense of the extent of each cluster's presence at each time. The authors should revisualize these data to display the abundance of each cluster at each timepoint. This could simply be done by adjusting the size of the circle or using a more traditional heatmap.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now updated this graphic to display the extent of a cluster’s presence, with the size of each dot corresponding to the abundance of each cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2 and 3 the authors describe the kinetics of each chemokine by cluster. While the dynamic expression is evident in the images, it is challenging to determine which clusters are driving expression in the absence of cluster annotation in those figures. The authors should support their visual findings with quantification of each factor in each cluster across time points.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5, violin plots are shown for <italic>Cxcl1</italic> and <italic>Ccl2</italic> that depict gene expression by each cluster. However, because each capture area is approximately 50 µm in diameter, the data do not achieve single-cell resolution and are not as informative as one would hope. Therefore, violin plots for each chemokine were not shown, though we have generated these graphics. We did not add these graphics to the revision because we did not think readers would generally want to see several pages of violin plots in the supplement. As mentioned, we plan to do single-cell RNA sequencing to further assess chemokine expression by each cell type present within the granulomas at key timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to the lack of spatial analysis, the authors describe certain transcript signals (ie. peripheral region versus central region of the granuloma) across each lesion. To back up these qualitative assertions, the authors could use line profiles from the center of each granuloma to the outside to plot the variation in expression of each transcript over radial space. This would provide a more direct way to determine the spatial coordination between various transcripts.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered using line profiles to quantify spatial variation within each lesion at each timepoint. However, this was exceptionally challenging due to the asymmetrical nature of some lesions, and the size discrepancy at different timepoints as the granulomas grow (during infection) and shrink (during resolution). When attempting to decide where to draw the line profiles, we determined that this approach did not enhance our analyses beyond using the cluster overlay and H&amp;E to identify and interrogate different clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data visualization in Figure 4 seems unnecessarily confusing. The authors put the transcriptomic signal into categories of 'absent', 'low', 'medium', and 'high.' Why not simply use a continuous scale? The data would also benefit from hierarchical clustering of the heatmap rows to highlight chemokines and their receptors with similar expression patterns across time.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered using a continuous scale as suggested by the reviewer. However, we chose not to create a continuous scale because quantitation is challenging due to the size changes in the lesions over time, such that larger lesions have greater inclusion of surrounding hepatocytes as well as necrotic cores, which would dilute the signal if averaged with the active immunologic granuloma zones. Figure 4 was intended to simplify the entirety of the SpatialFeaturePlots in an easy-to-digest manner, to aid in hypothesis generation as we consider the potential function of each chemokine and receptor in this model. We chose to organize each chemokine ligand based on family, maintaining a numerical order to allow Figure 4 to serve as a quick reference for anyone who is interested in a particular chemokine ligand or receptor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors feel confident in the transcriptomic signal coming from regions of necrosis? Given that many of their bright signals are coming from within clusters annotated as necrosis or necrosis-adjacent this raises an important technical consideration. Can the authors use the H&amp;E image to estimate the cellular density (based on nuclear counts) in each region annotated by Visium? Are there any studies supporting the accurate performance of spatial transcriptomic methods in necrosis? Necrosis can be a source of non-specific binding during in situ hybridization assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point. A defining characteristic of the areas of necrosis is the lack of defined cell borders, with faded or absent nuclei. In these regions, it is impossible to estimate cellular density. Given these concerns, we have included an additional figure (new Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-B) to display raw counts in each cluster across all timepoints. Though regions of necrosis do display lower read quantity compared to other areas, we are still confident in the positive transcriptomic signal coming from adjacent regions because there are plenty of negative examples in which expression is not detected. In other words, temporal and spatial upregulation of key genes is still observed in the tissues, and future experiments will aim to interrogate the physiological relevance of each gene, while validating the spatial transcriptomics data with other methodologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The methods should include a much more detailed description of the tissue preparation and collection for the Visium experiment. The section on the computational analysis of the Visium data is also extremely limited. At a minimum, the authors should include details on how they performed clustering of the Visium regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The detailed description of tissue preparation, computational analysis, and clustering is in our previous manuscript, from which this dataset originates. We can add a direct quote of the methodology if the reviewer requests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cluster labels in Figure 5 A-B are very difficult to see. Furthermore, it would help if the authors displayed the annotated cluster names (ie. Those shown in 5C) instead of their numerical coding for a more direct interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have updated this figure with annotated cluster names.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The scale bars in Figure 7 are very difficult to see.</p></disp-quote><p>The scale bars in histology images were kept small intentionally so as not to occlude data, and eLife is an online-only, digital media platform which allows readers to sufficiently zoom on high-resolution histology images. We have increased the DPI resolution for histology images to further aid in visualization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The information presented in Tables 2 and 3 is greatly appreciated and will really help guide the reader through the analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We assembled this information for our own learning about chemokines and hope that it is useful for the reader.</p></body></sub-article></article>
