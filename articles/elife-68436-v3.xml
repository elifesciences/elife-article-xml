It remains unclear whether a unique cell type is responsible for multiple hormones secreting. In this work, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing to three different anatomic tumor tissues and one peritumoral tissue based on a rare case with ectopic ACTH&amp;CRH-secreting pheochromocytoma. And in addition to that, three adrenal tumor specimens from common pheochromocytoma and adrenocortical adenomas were also involved in the comparison of tumor cellular heterogeneity. A total of 16 cell types in the tumor microenvironment were identified by unbiased cell clustering of single-cell transcriptomic profiles from all specimens. Notably, we identified a novel multi-functionally chromaffin-like cell type with high expression of both POMC (the precursor of ACTH) and CRH, called ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte. We hypothesized that the molecular mechanism of the rare case harbor Cushing’s syndrome is due to the identified novel tumor cell type, that is, the secretion of ACTH had a direct effect on the adrenal gland to produce cortisol, while the secretion of CRH can indirectly stimulate the secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary. Besides, a new potential marker (GAL) co-expressed with ACTH and CRH might be involved in the regulation of ACTH secretion. The immunohistochemistry results confirmed its multi-functionally chromaffin-like properties with positive staining for CRH, POMC, ACTH, GAL, TH, and CgA. Our findings also proved to some extent the heterogeneity of endothelial and immune microenvironment in different adrenal tumor subtypes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ectopic ACTH</kwd><kwd>cushing syndrome</kwd><kwd>adrenal tumor</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>CRH secreting pheochromocytoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005150</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-I2M-1-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Hanzhong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005150</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Taijiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005150</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-I2M-1-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Taijiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel multi-hormones secreting chromaffin-like cell type was identified using single-cell RNA sequencing, suggesting the molecular mechanism of ectopic ACTH and CRH pheochromocytoma associated with Cushing’s syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is a rare disorder caused by long-term exposure to excessive glucocorticoids, with an annual incidence of about 0.2–5.0 per million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lacroix et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Newell-Price et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindholm et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Steffensen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bolland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valassi et al., 2011</xref>). About 80% of CS cases are due to ACTH secretion by a pituitary adenoma, about 20% are due to ACTH secretion by nonpituitary tumors (ectopic ACTH syndrome [EAS]), and 1% are caused by corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-secreting tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandraki and Grossman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ejaz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballav et al., 2012</xref>). Most EAS tumors (~60%) are more common intrathoracic tumors, only 2.5–5% of all EAS are caused by a pheochromocytoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexandraki and Grossman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Isidori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aniszewski et al., 2001</xref>). Pheochromocytoma, a catecholamine-producing tumor, becomes even rarer when it is capable of both secreting ACTH and CRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lenders et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zelinka et al., 2007</xref>). By 2020, only two cases with pheochromocytoma secreted both ACTH and CRH were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O’Brien et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessop et al., 1987</xref>). As one of the largest adrenal tumor treatment centers in China, our hospital, Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) receives more than 500 adrenal surgery performed per year, with almost 100 cases undergoing pheochromocytoma surgery. But so far, we have encountered only one case of pheochromocytoma secreting both ACTH and CRH, which was first reported in this study.</p><p>Since the combination of dual ACTH/CRH secreting pheochromocytoma with CS is extremely rare, there is limited knowledge about the diagnosis and management of this disease. Ectopic secretion hormones ACTH and CRH may complicate the presentation of pheochromocytoma, and this tumor usually leads to CS, which can be fatal if not properly diagnosed and managed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballav et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ilias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lenders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lase et al., 2020</xref>). Surgical resection of the pheochromocytoma is the primary treatment option. Although previous studies have reported ectopic ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytomas, it was unclear whether a unique cell type that produces multiple hormones influences CS. The concept of ‘one cell, one hormone, and one neuron one transmitter,’ which is known as Dale’s Principle (Dale in 1934; for detailed discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnstock, 1976</xref>), has dominated the understanding of neurotransmission for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnstock, 1976</xref>). Currently, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can examine the expression profiles of a single cell and is recognized as the gold standard for defining cell states and phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tammela and Sage, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kolodziejczyk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Patel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tirosh et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tirosh et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Puram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Venteicher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Young et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Segerstolpe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reichert and Rustgi, 2011</xref>). It can reveal the presence of rare and novel unique cell types, such as CFTR-expressing pulmonary ionocytes on lung airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Montoro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plasschaert et al., 2018</xref>). It also provides an unbiased method to better understand the diversity of immune cells in the complex tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Papalexi and Satija, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stubbington et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we reported a rare case of CRH/ACTH-secreting pheochromocytoma infiltrating the kidney and psoas muscle tissue. scRNA-seq identified a unique chromaffin-like cell type, called ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, with both high expression of POMC (precursor for ACTH) and CRH pheochromocyte as well as TH (tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme for catecholamine synthesization). Immunocytochemical and immunofluorescence staining showed all for these markers, which confirmed the tumor capable of multiple hormones secreting characteristics. We determined that the expression of POMC directly causes the secretion of ACTH, and the expression of CRH indirectly promotes the secretion of ACTH hormone, which ultimately leads to CS. After the tumor resection, clinical manifestations also showed complete remission of CS. For comparison, other adrenal tumor subtypes were also collected and studied, namely, a common pheochromocytoma (without ectopic ACTH or CRH secretion function) and two adrenocortical adenomas. We used a scRNA-seq approach to obtain transcriptomic profiles for all collected samples and identified a list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) through cell clustering and markers finding. Notably, GAL, co-expressed with ACTH and CRH, could be a new candidate marker to detect the rare ectopic ACTH+&amp;CRH + secreting pheochromocytes by comparing ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte with common pheochromocyte and cortical cell clusters. It suggested that GAL, which encodes small neuroendocrine peptides, may be locally involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell profiling and unbiased clustering of collecting specimens</title><p>We applied scRNA-seq methods to perform large-scale transcriptome profiling of seven prospectively collected samples from tumors and peritumoral tissue of three adrenal tumor patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Case 1 suffered from a rare pheochromocytoma with typical Cushingoid features. The laboratory results showed high levels of cortisol, ACTH, and catecholamines. The abdominal contrast-enhanced computer tomography scanning revealed bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and irregular tumor within the left adrenal. After the resection, we collected three dissected tumor specimens (esPHEO_T1, esPHEO_T2, and esPHEO_T3) from different anatomic sites of the tumor and an adrenal tissue adjacent to the tumor (esPHEO_Adj). For comparison, we also collected other adrenal tumors, namely, a common pheochromocytoma (PHEO_T) from Case 2 and two adrenocortical adenomas (ACA_T1 and ACA_T2) from Case 3. Case 2 showed elevated catecholamines and normal levels of cortisol and ACTH. Case 3 showed a high level of cortisol, a low level of ACTH, and an intermediate level of catecholamines. The detailed clinical information for the three cases was summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>. To investigate the difference of the secretory function, we performed the immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of selected markers, CgA (chromogranin A) and ACTH in esPHEO_T1, PHEO_T, and esPHEO_Adj samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed that CgA positive cells were present in both pheochromocytomas (esPHEO_T1 and PHEO_T), but ACTH positive cells were only observed in the rare pheochromocytoma (esPHEO_T1) with the ACTH-secreting cellular characteristics. As expected, there were no CgA and ACTH positive cells in the adjacent sample (esPHEO_Adj). Thus, at the clinical stage, our histopathology results conﬁrmed that Case 1 was a rare ectopic ACTH secreting pheochromocytoma which stained positively for both ACTH and CgA.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clinical sample collection of adrenal tumor and adjacent specimen for scRNA-seq analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) scRNA-seq workflow for three tumor specimens (esPHEO_T1, esPHEO_T2, and esPHEO_T3) and one adjacent specimen (esPHEO_Adj) from the rare pheochromocytoma with ectopic ACTH and CRH secretion (Case 1), 1 tumor specimen (PHEO_T) from common pheochromocytoma (Case 2), and two tumor specimens (ACA_T1, ACA_T2) from adrenocortical adenoma (Case 3).

The tissues after resection were rapidly digested into a single-cell suspension, and the 3′-scRNA-seq protocol (Chromium Single Cell 3′ v2 Libraries) was performed for each sample unbiasedly. After quality control filtering to remove cells with low gene detection, high mitochondrial gene coverage, and doublets filtration, we compiled a unified cells-by-genes expression matrix of a total of 44,511 individual cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Then the SCT-transformed normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), was employed to perform unsupervised dimensionality reduction. Then, the cells were clustered based on the graph-based clustering analysis, and visualized in the distinguished diagram using the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method. The marker genes were calculated to identify each cell cluster by performing differential gene expression analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the distinct cell clusters were identified and the conventional cell lineage gene markers were employed to annotate the clusters, such as CHGA and CHGB for adrenal chromaffin cell, cytochrome P450 superfamily for adrenocortical cell, S100B for sustentacular cell, GNLY for NK cell, MS4A1 for B cell, CD8A for CD8+ T cell, and IL7R for CD4+ T cell. Based on the expression of gene markers, we recognized a total of 16 main cell groups: ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, pheochromocyte, adrenocortical, sustentacular, erythroblast/granulosa, endothelial, fibroblast, neutrophil, monocyte, macrophage, plasma, B, NK, CD8+ T&amp;NKT, CD8+ T, and CD4+ T, among which the endothelial cell group was composed of four endothelial cell subgroups. The heatmap showed the expression levels of specific cluster markers for each cell phenotype that we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For this analysis, we specifically focused on the four types of adrenal cells and showed their markers in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Additionally, we detected the transcription factors alongside their candidate target genes, which are jointly called regulons. The analysis scored the activity of regulon for each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4A</xref>) and yielded specific regulons for each cellular cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, different sources of specimens represented distinct cell type compositions. Notably, although the size of the cell clusters of the adrenal gland was relatively small, four distinct subtypes of adrenal cells were observed, including ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, pheochromocyte, adrenocortical cells, and sustentacular cells. The ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocytoma cell subtype was specific to three tumor samples, esPHEO_T1, esPHEO_T2, and esPHEO_T3 from Case 1, but was not observed in the peritumoral sample (esPHEO_Adj) and other adrenal tumor samples from Case 2 (PHEO_T) and Case 3 (ACA_T1 and ACA_T2). This result was consistent with the clinical symptoms in our earlier reports that ACTH was only over-secreted in pheochromocytoma of Case 1. The cell cluster of ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte was supported by the specific expression of the markers POMC (proopiomelanocortin) and CRH (corticotropin-releasing hormone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). POMC is a precursor of ACTH, and CRH is the most important regulator of ACTH secretion. We also detected another specific expression signal, GAL, for the cell cluster of ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). GAL encodes small neuroendocrine peptides and can regulate diverse physiologic functions, including growth hormone, insulin release, and adrenal secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ottlecz et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McKnight et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murakami et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hooi et al., 1990</xref>). A study found that GAL and ACTH were co-expressed in human pituitary and pituitary adenomas, and suggested that GAL may be locally involved in the regulation of the HPA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsu et al., 1991</xref>). We demonstrated that GAL was expressed in the ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and might participate in the regulation ATCH secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Then we examined the known adrenal chromaffin cell markers (CHGA and CHGB) and the markers for catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes (TH and PNMT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These known markers and another new candidate marker CARTPT were observed in both ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and pheochromocyte cell subtypes. The CYP17A1 and CYP21A2, the typical markers of the adrenal cortical cell subtype, were also investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). They are members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, encoding key enzymes, and maybe the precursors of cortisol in the adrenal glucocorticoids biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auchus et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petrunak et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, a subtype of cells with positive expression of S100B was identified, called sustentacular cells. Sustentacular cells were found near chromaffin cells and nerve terminations. Several studies have shown that sustentacular cells exhibit stem-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fitzgerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scriba et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A unique tumor cell type was revealed by the composition analysis of cell types in each sample.</title><p>The results validated an ectopic ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytoma.

The overexpression of TH and PNMT was responsible for the excessive secretion of catecholamines in the ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and pheochromocyte cell subtypes. Tumor samples (esPHEO_T1, esPHEO_T2, and esPHEO_T3) from Case 1 and PHEO_T from Case 2 were demonstrated to have the function of producing catecholamine. These genes related to catecholamine secretion were all negative for adrenocortical cell subtypes because the catecholamine-producing pheochromocytomas originated from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla rather than the adrenal cortex. Our laboratory tests were consistent with these results, that is, both Case 1 and Case 2 had a high level of catecholamines in plasma and 24 hr urine while Case 3 had a normal level. We also found CARTPT was similar to PNMT and can be used as a marker for ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and pheochromocyte. Chromaffin cell markers CHGA and CHGB were mainly characterized in PHEO_T and three tumor samples from Case 1. Adrenocortical cell clusters mainly existed in ACA_T1 and ACA_T2, but a few existed in esPHEO_Adj. S100B was specifically identified in PHEO_T. An absence of S100-positive sustentacular cells has been previously confirmed in most malignant adrenal pheochromocytomas, and the locally aggressive or recurrent group usually contains a large number of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Unger et al., 1991</xref>). It suggests that PHEO_T from Case 2 might be a locally aggressive case, while Case 1 is the opposite. To validate this finding, we performed additional IHC staining experiments on paraffin-embedded serial slices with similar tissue regions from the tumor specimen esPHEO_T3 using antibodies against CgA, ACTH, POMC, CRH, TH, and GAL. We did ﬁnd that these markers were all positive in the tumor tissue, which further indicated that the special rare pheochromocytoma exhibited multiple hormone-secreting characteristics, including ACTH, CRH, and catecholamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig8">Appendix 1—figure 8</xref>). We also prepared two serial slices for immunofluorescence co-staining for POMC&amp;CRH and POMC&amp;TH. The legible co-localization signals were observed, where the green signal was for POMC, and the red signal was for CRH and TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figure 9</xref>). This result confirmed the ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytoma from Case 1 contained a unique multi-functional chromaffin-like cell type, which was consistent with the analysis result by scRNA-seq.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differential expression genes show adrenal tumor cell-type specificity</title><p>Next, we analyzed the DEGs between ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and the other two subtypes of adrenal tumor cells (pheochromocyte and adrenocortical cells). It is worth noting that many genes were dramatically upregulated specifically in ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte when compared with the other tumor cell types, such as GAL, POMC, PNMT, and CARTPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using these upregulated or downregulated genes, we performed functional enrichment analysis based on gene ontology (GO) annotation to further characterize the molecular characteristics of different tumor cell types. In comparison with adrenocortical cell types, the highly upregulated genes of ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte were mainly enriched in the neuropeptide signaling pathway, hormone secretion, and transport, while the downregulated genes were mostly enriched in the pathway of adrenocortical hormones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Comparing the two types of pheochromocyte, GO functional enrichment analysis for the biology process (BP) revealed that the upregulated genes for ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte were also enriched in the neuropeptide signaling pathway, while the enrichment of the downregulated genes from the GO functional result hardly reach statistical significance. Interestingly, compared with adrenocortical cells, a total of 248 upregulated and 198 downregulated genes were detected in ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, while only 95 upregulated and 111 downregulated genes were detected in ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte when compared with pheochromocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which suggested that the difference between ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and pheochromocyte was relatively small. The known adrenal chromaffin cell markers (CHGA and CHGB) were differential expressed significantly between ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte and adrenocortical cells, but not observed significant difference between two subtypes of pheochromocytes. Besides, the co-upregulated genes, such as CARTPT, PNMT, POMC, GAL, and CRH, were responsible for the production of a variety of hormones and involved in neuropeptide signaling pathways. Of which, the product of PNMT catalyzes the last step of the catecholamine biosynthesis pathway, methylating norepinephrine to form epinephrine. The overexpression of PNMT was responsible for the signiﬁcantly elevated epinephrine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) of the rare Case 1 with ectopic ACTH and CRH secretory pheochromocytoma. The elevated plasma ACTH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>) of the rare Case 1 could be explained by specific high expression signals of GAL, POMC, and CRH. In details, POMC is the precursor of ACTH; CRH is the most important regulator of ACTH secretion; and GAL was co-expressed in the ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, which might be locally involved in the regulation of the HPA axis. Therefore, we concluded that the tumor cell type of ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte from Case 1 had multiple hormone secretion functions, namely, CRH secretion function, ACTH secretion function, and catecholamine secretion function. Furthermore, we believed that the rare Case 1 harbor the ACTH-dependent CS is due to the presence of the identified novel tumor cell type of ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte, which secretes both ACTH and CRH. The secretion of ACTH had a direct effect on the adrenal gland to produce cortisol, while the secretion of CRH can indirectly stimulate the secretion of ACTH from the anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Altered functions in POMC+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte revealed by differential gene expression analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Volcano plot of changes in gene expression between POMC+&amp;CRH + pheochromocytes and other adrenal cell types (pheochromocytes and adrenocortical cells).

Previously study had observed unspliced transcripts were enriched in genes involved in DNA binding and RNA processing in hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bowman et al., 2006</xref>). For the high proportions of unspliced/spliced transcripts, stem-like characteristics of sustentacular cells were supported. There were more spliced transcripts proportions in POMC+&amp;CRH + pheochromocytes than in pheochromocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Then, we estimated pseudotime grounded on transcriptional dynamics and generated velocity streamlines that account for speed and direction of motion. As observed in the pseudotime of four adrenal cell subtypes, medullary cells are earlier than cortical cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). From velocity streamlines, we found the four adrenal cell subtypes, that is, POMC+&amp;CRH + pheochromocytes, pheochromocytes adrenocortical cells, and sustentacular cells, were independent respectively and not directed toward other cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In this study, we reported an extremely rare patient (Case 1) with ATCH-dependent CS due to an ectopic ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma. Surgery is the most common treatment strategy for this type of tumor. After the operation, our clinical manifestations of Case 1 showed the complete remission of CS. The IHC of the dissected tumor confirmed the diagnosis with positive staining for CRH and ACTH. In this study, scRNA-seq was used for the first time to identify the rare ACTH+&amp;CRH + pheochromocyte cell subset. Compared with other subtypes of adrenal tumors, the common pheochromocytoma (from Case 2) and adrenal cortical cells (from Case 3), the DEGs in Case 1 were further characterized. Case 2 was examined to have normal levels of cortisol and ACTH, but Case 3 showed a Cushingoid appearance. The molecular mechanism of CS in Case 3 was different, which was attributed to two cortical adenomas on the left adrenal, showing ACTH-independent hypercortisolemia. In addition, to investigate the genetic driver for Case 1, we supplemented whole-exome sequencing experiments for all rest specimens, that is, tumors (esPHEO_T2 and esPHEO_T3) and controls (esPHEO_Adj and esPHEO_Blood) from the rare case with ectopic ACTH&amp;CRH-secreting pheochromocytoma. Filtered germline and somatic mutations were listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref> including detailed annotations. Genetic mutations of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma are mainly classified into two major clusters, that is, pseudo hypoxic pathway and kinase signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pillai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nölting and Grossman, 2012</xref>). We did not find any gene mutations that were related to these two major clusters. We only identified one shared somatic variant of <italic>ACAN</italic> (c.5951T &gt; A:p.L1984Q) comparing variants in tumor samples to controls but Sanger sequencing only confirmed the presence in esPHEO_T3 which was not observed in esPHEO_T2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig7">Appendix 1—figure 7</xref>). <italic>ACAN</italic>, encoding a major component of the extracellular matrix, is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. Mutations of <italic>ACAN</italic> were reported related to steroid levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yousri et al., 2018</xref>). It is well-established that circulating steroid levels are linked to inflammation diseases such as arthritis, because arthritis as well as most autoimmune disorders results from a combination of several predisposing factors including the stress response system such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cutolo et al., 2003</xref>). But no direct evidence related to <italic>ACAN</italic> to phaeochromocytoma. Therefore, no obvious genetic driver was found to explain the rare case of ACTH/CRH-secreting phaeochromocytoma. Further investigations would be needed to uncover the relation between <italic>ACAN</italic> and phaeochromocytoma.</p><p>For many years, the understanding of neurotransmission has been dominated by the concept of ‘one cell, one hormone, and one neuron one transmitter,’ which is known as Dale’s Principle (Dale in 1934; for detailed discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnstock, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnstock, 1976</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakuma et al., 2016</xref> reported an ectopic ACTH pheochromocytoma case and proved that ACTH and catecholamine were produced by two functionally distinct chromaffin-like tumor cell types through immunohistochemical analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakuma et al., 2016</xref>. However, more and more evidence has emerged that Dale’s principle is incorrect because existing studies have shown that these cells are multi-messenger systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hakanson and Sundler, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apergis-Schoute et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Svensson et al., 2018</xref>). Based on scRNA-seq results, we concluded that the tumor cells from Case 1 had multiple hormone secretion functions, namely, CRH secretion function, ACTH secretion function, and catecholamine secretion function. CRH is the most important regulator of ACTH secretion. Therefore, we believed that the secretion of both CRH and ACTH of this tumor led to ACTH-dependent CS. Besides, the secretion of ACTH had a direct impact on the adrenal gland to produce cortisol, and the secretion of CRH indirectly stimulated the secretion of ACTH by the anterior pituitary. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessop et al., 1987</xref> also draw the same conclusion in their report in 1987. However, in the reported case, the histological immunostained result was shown only for the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF-41), but not for ACTH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jessop et al., 1987</xref>).</p><p>Adrenal glands are composed of two main tissue types, namely, the cortex and the medulla, which are responsible for producing steroid and catecholamine hormones, respectively. The inner medulla is derived from neuroectodermal cells of neural crest origin, while the outer cortex is derived from the intermediate mesoderm. In the adrenal pheochromocytomas, a third cell type with the positive expression of S100B was identified, called ‘sustentacular’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Suzuki and Kachi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lloyd et al., 1985</xref>). By evaluating 17 malignant and recurrent or locally aggressive adrenal pheochromocytomas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Unger et al., 1991</xref> found that sustentacular cells were absent in most malignant cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Unger et al., 1991</xref>). Because there are no sustentacular cells in ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma, ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma is more serious than the common pheochromocytoma. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that sustentacular cells exhibit stem-like characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pardal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fitzgerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Scriba et al., 2020</xref>). A unique case of a tumor originating from S100-positive sustentacular cells was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lau et al., 2006</xref>). The RNA velocity estimation and pseudo-time analysis of different adrenal cell subtypes supported the sustentacular cells exhibiting stem-like properties. Although pheochromocyte was prior to ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocyte in pseudotime order, the RNA velocity prediction of POMC+&amp;CRH+ pheochromocytes might be under-estimated because the transcripts of POMC and CRH were all predicted as spliced ones. Based on the spliced versus unspliced phase for CHGA, CHGB, and TH, it showed a clear more dynamics expression in POMC+&amp;CRH+ pheochromocytes than in pheochromocytes. We assumed that ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocyte have more hormone-producing functions, retain stem- and endocrine-diﬀerentiation ability. But further experiments are needed to validate our hypothesis.</p><p>There are bidirectional communications between the immune system and the neuroendocrine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blalock, 1989</xref>).

The activation of naive T cells through the antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) can initiate transcriptional programs that can drive the differentiation of lineage-specific effector functions. CD4+ T cells secrete cytokines to recruit and activate other immune cells, while CD8+ T cells have cytotoxic functions and can directly kill infected or tumor cells. Recent studies have shown that the composition of the T cell subset is related to the specific tissue locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carpenter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thome et al., 2014</xref>). scRNA-seq can be used to deconvolve the immune system heterogeneity with high resolution. Compared with adrenocortical adenomas which were in CD4+ (with the expression of cytokine receptors, such as the IL-7R) state, T cells in pheochromocytoma, especially T cells in the ectopic ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma were inactivated CD8+ state, suggesting different tumor microenvironments between adrenocortical adenomas and pheochromocytoma. Previous studies have shown that signaling through IL-7R is essential in the developmental process and regulation of lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kondrack et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lenz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Seddon et al., 2003</xref>), and disruption of the IL-7R signaling pathway may lead to skewed T cell distribution and cause immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maraskovsky et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaech et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carini et al., 1994</xref>). Our results indicated the heterogeneity of the immune system between different samples, and CD4+ T cells with the high expression level of IL-7R might be related to adrenal tumor progression, apoptosis, or factors influencing progression such as immune activation. Although we have shown the heterogeneity of immune cell types in different adrenal tumor subtypes, it is unclear how T cells influence different markers, including effector states and interferon-response states. In addition to composition differences, a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between adrenal tumor tissues and immune systems is a key issue in neuroendocrine tumor research.</p><p>Overall, we reported a rare case in which ectopic ACTH&amp;CRH-secreting pheochromocytoma on the left adrenal that infiltrated around the kidney and psoas major tissues. We applied scRNA-seq to identify this rare and special adrenal tumor cell. Thus, the majority of our analysis focused on the validation of novel tumor cell type and their multiple hormones-secreting functions, namely, CRH secretion function, ACTH secretion function, and catecholamine secretion function. Also, GAL could be a candidate marker to detect the rare ectopic ACTH+&amp;CRH + secreting pheochromocytes. For future studies, on one hand, we are very concerned about similar suspicious cases in the clinic. On the other hand, we are going for following research for further downstream experiments to validate the molecular mechanism for secreting multiple hormones.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Clinical specimens collection</title><p>Our study included three adrenal tumor patients, that is, pheochromocytoma with ectopic ACTH and CRH secretion, common pheochromocytoma, and adrenocortical adenoma. All three patients had signed the consent forms at the General Surgery Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH). The enhanced CT scanning images and laboratory test (ACTH, 24 hr urine-free cortisol, Catecholamines) of relevant patients are listed in Appendix 1. Fresh tumor specimens were collected during surgical resection. For the case of ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytoma, we performed the surgical resection of the tumor at left adrenal (esPHEO_T1) and its infiltrating tissues located in the kidney (esPHEO_T3) and masses (esPHEO_T2), and obtained three tumor specimens. The peritumor sample (esPHEO_Adj) was collected from the left adrenal tissue under the supervision of a qualified pathologist. The other two patients underwent left adrenalectomy and provided the other three tumor specimens. In details, one tumor specimen was obtained from the patient with common pheochromocytoma and two tumor specimens were obtained from the patient with adrenocortical adenoma. A total of seven specimens were carefully dissected under the microscope and confirmed by a qualified pathologist.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Single-cell transcriptome library preparation and sequencing</title><p>After the resection, tissue specimens were rapidly processed for single-cell RNA sequencing.</p><p>Single-cell suspensions were prepared according to the protocol of Chromium Single Cell 3′ Solution (V2 chemistry). All specimens were washed two times with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Haemocytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate cell viability rates. Then, we used Countess (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to count the concentration of single-cell suspension, and adjust the concentration to 1000 cells/μl. Samples that were lower than the required cell concentration defined in the user guide (i.e., &lt;400 cells/µl) were pelleted and re-suspended in a reduced volume; and then the concentration of the new solution was counted again. Finally, the cells of the sample were loaded, and the libraries were constructed using a Chromium Single-Cell Kit (version 2). Single-cell libraries were submitted to 150 bp paired-end sequencing on the Illumina NavoSeq platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq data pre-processing and quality control</title><p>After obtaining the paired-end raw reads, we used CellRanger (10× Genomics, v3.1.0) to pre-process the single-cell RNA-seq data. Cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) of the library were extracted from read1. Then, the reads were split according to their cell (barcode) IDs, and the UMI sequences from read2 were simultaneously recorded for each cell. Quality control on these raw readings was subsequently performed to eliminate adapter contamination, duplicates, and low-quality bases. After filtering barcodes and low-quality readings that were not related to cells, we used STAR (version 2.5.1b) to map the cleaned readings to the human genome (hg19) and retained the uniquely mapped readings for UMIs counts. Next, we estimated the accurate molecular counts and generated a UMI count matrix for each cell by counting UMIs for each sample. Finally, we generated a gene-barcode matrix that showed the barcoded cells and gene expression counts.</p><p>Based on the number of total reads, the number of detected gene features, and the percentage of mitochondrial genes, we performed quality control filtering through Seurat (v3.1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) to discard low-quality cells. Briefly, mitochondrial genes inside one cell were calculated lower than 20%, and total reads in one cell were below 40,000. Also, the cells were further filtered according to the following criteria: PHEO, ACA, and esPHEO samples with no more than 5000, 3000, and 2500 genes were detected, respectively, and at least 200 genes were detected per cell in any sample. Low-quality cells and outliers were discarded, and the single cells that passed the QC criteria were used for downstream analyses. Doublets were predicted by DoubletFinder (v2.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) and DoubletDecon (v1.1.6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DePasquale et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Clustering analysis and cell phenotype recognition</title><p>Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) software package was used to perform cell clustering analysis to identify major cell types. All Seurat objects constructed from the filtered UMI-based gene expression matrixes of given samples were merged. We first applied ‘SCTransform’ function to implement normalization, variance stabilization, and feature selection through a regularized negative binomial model. Then, we reduced dimensionality through PCA. According to standard steps implemented in Seurat, highly variable numbers of principal components (PCs) 1–20 were selected and used for clustering using the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding method (t-SNE). We identified cell types of these groups based on the expression of canonic cell type markers or inferred by CellMarker database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, the four groups of endothelial cells were combined to a larger endothelial cell cluster for downstream analysis. Cellular cluster statistics were added in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, which presented cell counts for each cellular cluster in different samples and top 10 gene markers.

For heatmap and violin plots, the SCT-transformed data from Seurat pipeline were used. Using the Seurat ‘FindMarkers’ function, we found the DEGs between two cell types. We also used R package of clusterProfiler with default parameters to identify gene sets that exhibited significant and consistent differences between two given biological states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA velocity estimation</title><p>We used the velocyto python package (v0.17.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>) for distinguishing transcripts as spliced or unspliced mRNAs based on the presence or absence of intronic regions in the transcript. We took aligned reads of BAM file for each sample as input. After per sample abundance estimation, it generated a LOOM file with the loompy package. Then, we used the scVelo (v0.2.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>) to combine each sample abundance data as well as cell cluster information from the Seurat object. We showed the proportions of abundances for each sample using scvelo.pl.proportions function. The RNA velocity was estimated for each cell for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced transcript. RNA velocity graph was visualized on a UMAP plot, with vector fields representing the averaged velocity of nearby cells. We also visualized some marker genes dynamics portraits with scv.pl.velocity to examine their spliced versus unspliced phase in different cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pseudotime analysis</title><p>The Monocle2 packages (v2.14.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) for R were used to determine the pseudotimes of the differentiation of four different cell subtypes, that is, POMC+/CRH + pheochromocytoma, pheochromocytoma, adrenocortical, and sustentacular cells. We converted a Seurat3 integrated object into a Monocle cds object and distributed the composed cell clusters to the Monocle cds partitions. Then, we used Monocle2 to perform trajectory graph learning and pseudotemporal sorting analysis by specifying the sustentacular cells as the root nodes. To identify genes that are significantly regulated as the cells differentiate along the cell-to-cell distance trajectory, we used the differentialGeneTest() function implemented in Monocle2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, we selected the genes that were differentially expressed on different paths through the trajectory and plotted the pseudotime_heatmap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene regulatory network (regulon) analysis</title><p>We used R package SCENIC (v1.1.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) for gene regulatory network inference. Normalized log counts were used as input to identify co-expression modules by the GRNBoost2 algorithm. Following which, regulons were derived by identifying the direct-binding TF target genes while pruning others based on motif enrichment around transcription start site (TSS) with cisTarget databases. Using aucell, the regulon activity score was measured as the area under the recovery curve (AUC). Additionally, regulon specificity score (RSS) was used for the detection of the cell-type-specific regulons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell-cell communication analysis</title><p>Given the diverse immune and endothelial cell types in the tumor microenvironment, we performed cell-cell communication analysis using CellPhoneDB Python package (2.1.7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Efremova et al., 2020</xref>).

The cleaned reads were aligned to the human reference genome sequence NCBI Build 38 (hg38) using Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (v0.7.17) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). All aligned BAM were then performed through the same bioinformatics pipeline according to GATK Best Practices (v4.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKenna et al., 2010</xref>). We obtained germline variants shared by all tumors and control samples based on variant calling from GATK-HaplotypeCaller. We then used GATK-MuTect2 to call somatic variants in tumors and obtained a high-confidence mutation set after rigorous filtering by GATK-FilterMutectCalls. All variants were annotated using ANNOVAR (v2018Apr16) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The criteria for filtering variants were as follows: (1) only retained variants located on exon or splice site, and excluded synonymous variants; (2) retained rare variants with minor allele frequencies &lt;5% in any ancestry population groups from public databases (1000 Genomes, ESP6500, ExAC, or the GnomAD); (3) For germline variants, excluded common variants in dbSNP (Build 138) and predicted benign missense variants by SIFT, Polyphen2, and Mutation Taster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunocytochemistry and Immunofluorescence</title><p>Immunocytochemical and immunofluorescent staining experiments were conducted according to standard protocols using antibodies against malinﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens.

description</title><p>Case 1: A 39-year-old lady underwent laparoscopic left adrenal tumor resection in July 2012 at a local hospital. She had a 2-year history of headache, generalized swelling, and palpitations. She was noted to have hypertensive (BP 240/120 mmHg) and typical Cushingoid characteristics, including asthenia, supraclavicular fat deposits, bruises, purple striae, proximal myopathy, and hyperpigmentation. Histopathology conﬁrmed an adrenomedullary chromafﬁn tumor. During tumor immunostaining, the tumor stained positively for ACTH. After the adrenal surgery, her Cushingoid characteristics, hypokalemia, and hypertension were all relieved.</p><p>However, the patient experienced recurrence of symptoms and signs in January 2019 and was admitted to our hospital. It was found that urine and plasma metanephrine were signiﬁcantly elevated, and plasma ACTH was also high. Enhanced CT scanning of the abdomen revealed bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia and multiple masses in the left adrenal and around the left kidney. The largest mass lesion was 2.3×1.6 cm<sup>2</sup>, which invaded upper pole of left kidney. But the I123-MIBG scintigraphy was negative. We performed a surgery to remove left adrenal, kidney, and masses. After the surgery, the patient’s clinical features and symptoms were improved, and the excessive hypercortisolemia and catecholamine eventually returned to normal. IHC revealed positive staining for chromogranin A, ACTH, and CRH, confirming the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma secreting both ACTH and CRH.</p><p>Case 2: A 42-year-old male with a 3-year history of headache and palpitations, and a 6-month history of hypertension was admitted to our hospital. Laboratory tests showed that the plasma and urine catecholamines and their metabolites were elevated, and cortisol and ACTH were at the normal level. Enhanced CT showed a 67×70 mm<sup>2</sup> left adrenal tumor, and I123-MIBG scintigraphy exhibited positive. We performed a surgery to remove the left adrenal gland. After the surgery, the patient’s clinical features and symptoms were relieved. IHC confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.</p><p>Case 3: A 50-year-old female came to our hospital with hypertension, hyperkalemia, and Cushingoid symptoms (moon face and central obesity). Enhanced CT scanning revealed a 19×36 mm<sup>2</sup> irregular mass in left adrenal gland. The laboratory tests showed ACTH-independent hypercortisolemia. The left adrenal gland was removed, and Cushing’s syndrome was relieved. Resected specimen revealed two tumors in the left adrenal gland, and IHC confirmed the diagnosis of adrenal adenoma.</p><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of laboratory test for three cases.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Laboratory test</th><th align="left" valign="top">Case 1</th><th align="left" valign="top">Case 2</th><th align="left" valign="top">Case 3</th><th align="left" colspan="2" valign="top">Reference range</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">ACTH</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">519.0</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">24.0</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;5</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="top">0–46.0 pg/ml</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">24 hr urine-free cortisol</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">2024.4</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="char" char="." valign="top">332.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">12.3–103.5 μg/24 hr</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Catecholamines</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Plasma metanephrines</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Normetanephrine</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3.28</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">10.81</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.4</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;0.9 nmol/L</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Metanephrine</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">3.44</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">11.55</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">0.2</td><td align="left" valign="top">&lt;0.5 nmol/L</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">24 hr urine</td><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Epinephrine</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">397.63</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">56.23</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1.92</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.74–6.42 μg/24 hr</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Norepinephrine</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">475.43</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">82.29</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">26.17</td><td align="left" valign="top">16.69–40.65 μg/24 hr</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dopamine</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">432.21</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">301.71</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">240.5</td><td align="left" valign="top">120.93–330.5 μg/24 hr</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enhanced CT scanning image for three cases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enhanced CT scanning for Case 1 with pheochromocytoma secreting both ACTH and CRH.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors identified an extremely rare case of ATCH-dependent Cushing syndrome due to ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma. They retrieved sugically resected samples from the tumor and subjected them to scRNA-seq, which led them to identify a group of cells that are double-positive for ACTH&amp;CRH. They then performed a series of expriments to confirm that the cells are indeed present in the tissue, and attempted to identify genes that may lie upstream of the process.</p><p>Perhaps the most important point of the study is the identification of the double-positive (DP) cells from the patient. However, evidence supporting this observation is relatively scarce other than showing a cell cluster that express POMC, CRH etc (as displayed in Figure 3A, C). Gene expression pattern shown in Figure 3C supports that the DP cells share molecular characteristics with those of pheochromocytes. But in the t-SNE plot, these cells are located far from pheochromocytes in PHEO_T. Rather, the DP cell cluster seems to be branched out from immune cells. If I didn't read the t-SNP plot wrong, I wonder why the identity of DP cells is closer to the immune cells. Also, it needs to be clarified if the DP cells could be doublets? The authors did not show basic statistics and QA/QC data of the scRNA-seq experiment (as supplementary data for example). They should show that the DP cells are not technical doublet cells.</p><p>Another critical question would be what is the genetic driver that induces expression of both hormones in the DP cells? They propose GAL, but the evidence supporting its direct role is not strong and remains speculative.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Overall, this study requires more carefully designed expriments and interpretation. Otherwise, it remains as a descriptive study with vague conclusions, leaving the uniqueness of the sample being the only strength of the study.</p><p>1. Colors in Figure 3A are confusing.</p><p>2. Figure 5 does not add much to the molecular mechanism. Rather it merely describes physiological consequences by the presence of DP cells. Please consider strengthen or remove it.</p><p>3. Isn't Figure 7B a duplication of Figure 3B?</p><p>4. IHC data in Figure 3E, F lack negative controls. And the readers need additional markers to be guided of its anatomical location.</p><p>5. Figure 4 compared DEGs between DP cells and other tumor cells. Since the cell groups that were being compared are too different, observing such dramatic differences is not unexpected and hard to coin physiological relevance. Wouldn't it be more meaningful to compare them to pheochromocytes?</p><p>6. The pseudotime analysis in Figure 6 does not answer the question of how the DP cells originated. It should be performed in a such way to suggest genes that marks critical points during the pseudotime branching or proceeding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Zhang et al. generated single cell RNA sequencing data for the adrenal gland tumors including extremely rare type of tumor, ACTH &amp; CRH-secreting pheochromocytoma. Unbiased clustering analysis discovered a unique tumor cell type that expresses multiple hormones unlike normal adrenal gland cells and other tumor cell types that produce a single hormone. By comparing with other type of tumor cells, they identified specific marker genes of the novel tumor cell type. They also revealed the distinct immune and endothelial cell populations in the microenvironment of different tumor samples.</p><p>Although the gene expression profiles of novel cell type can be utilized to reveal the molecular mechanism of this rare tumor associated with Cushing's syndrome, the data was generated from only a single patient and have not validated in other samples. In addition, the results only provide the list of genes that were specifically expressed in the novel tumor cell type and their potentially related biological pathways, but not detail molecular and cellular characters of the cells. The single cell gene expression profiling data are definitely useful for the researches.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>I have several concerns and suggestions, which if addressed would improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. The major finding of this manuscript is the presence of multi-functional tumor cell type which produce multiple hormones such as POMC, the precursor of ACTH and CRH. But, this finding was only derived from a single sample and experimentally validated using the same tissue. I understand the sample is very rare, but could the authors validate the result in different tumor samples at least using IHC or IF? If sample is not available, the limitation of the study should be mentioned.</p><p>2. Please consider providing full list of marker genes that were used for cell type annotation.</p><p>3. Figure 3C does not seem to support the statement &quot;We demonstrated that GAL was expressed in the ACTH<sup>+</sup>&amp;CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocyte and 'regulated the secretion of ACTH'&quot;.</p><p>4. The authors identified a unique and important multi-functional cell type but current analyses (differentially expressed genes identification and gene ontology analysis) seem insufficient to characterize molecular feature of ACTH<sup>+</sup>&amp;CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocyte. The authors could perform additional comprehensive analysis such as SCENIC analysis in order to identify the master transcription regulator of the cell type.</p><p>5. The pseudo-time analysis indicated that sustentacular cells transform to ACTH<sup>+</sup>&amp;CRH<sup>+</sup> pehochromocytes and then to pheochromocyte. The authors utilized Monocle3 in which user has to define the starting points. The authors can validate the result using RNA velocity analysis which also predicts cell transition without the need of prior knowledge about starting point cell type.</p><p>6. Given the diverse immune and endothelial cell type in the tumor microenvironment, it would be interesting to perform the cell-cell interaction analysis using the programs such as CellPhoneDB to see if they have distinct regulatory role in different tumor microenvironment.</p><p>7. How did the authors define the four subclusters of endothelial cells? Please consider providing list of marker genes.</p><p>8. In the method part, how did the authors determine different criteria for the maximum number of genes (no more than 5000, 3000, and 2500 genes for PHEO, ACA, and esPHEO samples, respectively)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Zhang et al. perform single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) of one rare ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH-secreting phenochromocytoma (3 anatomically distinct sites from the tumor and one peritumoral site), one typical pheochromocytoma, and two typical adrenocortical adenomas.</p><p>Their main findings are as follows: (1) They identify a unique cell type, which they term ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocyte, which appears to be the tumor cell present in the rare ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> tumor (2) Marker gene analysis reveals that while known adrenal chromaffin markers (CHGA, PNMT) are present in both pheochromocytes and ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocyte, the latter has some unique markers such as GAL and POMC. They validate the marker genes with IHC. (3) Profiling of the non-tumor populations reveals distinct immune microenvironment profile and endothelial cell profile to the rare tumor compared with classical pheochromocytoma and adrenalocortical adenoma.</p><p>The main strength of this manuscript is that it involves single-cell profiling of an exceptionally rare tumor type and a distinction from the more common adrenal tumors (pheochromocytoma and adrenocortical adenoma). The broader implication of the authors' findings is with respect to Dale's principle, which states that a given neuron releases only one type of neurotransmitter. However, in the case of this tumor, single cell analysis clearly shows that ACTH, CRH, and chatacholemines are being released from the same cell. This is quite interesting and significant. The data will also potentially be valuable to others in the field for analysis in future studies.</p><p>There remain some unanswered questions – namely:</p><p>(1) What is the cell in normal physiology that gives rise to this ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocytoma?</p><p>(2) Do conventional phenochromocytomas differ from the ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocytoma in terms of the cell of origin that is transformed, or in the spectrum of genetic alterations that result in transformation?</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Overall, I think this study is of broad interest given the rarity of this tumor type. My comments to the authors to improve the manuscript are as follows:</p><p>1. Given how rare the ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocytoma is, I think the study would be substantially strengthened if the authors could perform DNA sequencing (WGS or WES) and describe how, if at all, the genomic landscape differs from conventional pheochromocytoma.</p><p>2. Can the authors comment on whether the hypothesis is whether the ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocytoma originates from a rare progenitor cell that is distinct from the chromaffin cell giving rise to pheochromocytoma? If so, can the authors stain a panel of normal adrenal glands with some of their marker genes to try and identify this cell in normal tissues?</p><p>3. While the tumor type is interesting for its rarity, the analysis performed is quite standard and comes across as a bit superficial in parts. Although it is understandable that the authors have only one ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> sample I think they can do more with the data and this would significantly strengthen the manuscript. For example, it would be interesting if the authors can point to specific master regulatory factors that drive the distinct programs in pheochromocytes vs. ACTH<sup>+</sup>CRH<sup>+</sup> pheochromocytes. The immune microenvironment analysis, while inherently descriptive, is also somewhat superficial.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your revised article &quot;Single-cell transcriptome analysis identifies a unique tumor cell type producing multiple hormones in ectopic ACTH and CRH secreting pheochromocytoma&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

They have generally addressed my technical concerns from the prior review. I maintain that the analysis remains somewhat superficial and descriptive in parts and this may be somewhat of a missed opportunity to more deeply explore the underlying biology of this unique case, understanding the caveats of its rarity. Nonetheless, I think a description of this tumor at single-cell resolution and availability of the dataset is of value to the scientific community.</p><p>However, I would like to see a more careful analysis of the WES data prior to publication. I do not see any basic metrics (mutation rate etc.), description of pathogenicity filtering/annotation, or copy number analysis. The mutations shown are primarily missense and I do not really see any obvious driver genes – how many of these are putative driver vs. passenger mutations? ACAN is mentioned, but what is its significance, if any? The somatic landscape should be discussed in comparison to typical phenochromocytomas and adrenocortical carcinomas, which have been more extensively sequenced. If there is no obvious genetic driver of this ACTH/CRH-secreting phenochromocytoma, that should be stated. If the claim is that ACAN alterations are somehow related to this tumor type, that needs to be substantiated. Or if the implication is that ACAN is a passenger alteration, that needs to be stated explicitly also.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68436.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors identified an extremely rare case of ATCH-dependent Cushing syndrome due to ACTH&amp;CRH secreting pheochromocytoma.

However, evidence supporting this observation is relatively scarce other than showing a cell cluster that express POMC, CRH etc (as displayed in Figure 3A, C). Gene expression pattern shown in Figure 3C supports that the DP cells share molecular characteristics with those of pheochromocytes. But in the t-SNE plot, these cells are located far from pheochromocytes in PHEO_T. Rather, the DP cell cluster seems to be branched out from immune cells. If I didn't read the t-SNP plot wrong, I wonder why the identity of DP cells is closer to the immune cells. Also, it needs to be clarified if the DP cells could be doublets? The authors did not show basic statistics and QA/QC data of the scRNA-seq experiment (as supplementary data for example). They should show that the DP cells are not technical doublet cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising the concerns and providing these helpful suggestions. First, we updated the colors mapped to 16 cellular clusters in Figure 2A and Figure 3A to enhance the color difference between doublet-positive (DP) cells and immune cells. Then, the new analysis based on RNA velocity was performed in the revision, and the results showed that DP cluster was isolated and not branched out from other cell types (including immune cells) from velocity streamlines (Figure 5F). In addition, we added the raw data QC and doublet prediction results of the scRNA-seq experiment as shown in Appendix 1—figure 2 and Supplementary File 1. From the doublets predicted by DoubletFinder and DoubletDecon, it is clarified that almost noDP cells were defined as doublets. Cellular cluster statistics were shown in Supplementary File 2, which presented cell counts for each cellular cluster in different samples and top10 gene markers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another critical question would be what is the genetic driver that induces expression of both hormones in the DP cells?

Nonetheless, I think a description of this tumor at single-cell resolution and availability of the dataset is of value to the scientific community.</p><p>However, I would like to see a more careful analysis of the WES data prior to publication. I do not see any basic metrics (mutation rate etc.), description of pathogenicity filtering/annotation, or copy number analysis. The mutations shown are primarily missense and I do not really see any obvious driver genes – how many of these are putative driver vs. passenger mutations? ACAN is mentioned, but what is its significance, if any? The somatic landscape should be discussed in comparison to typical phenochromocytomas and adrenocortical carcinomas, which have been more extensively sequenced. If there is no obvious genetic driver of this ACTH/CRH-secreting phenochromocytoma, that should be stated. If the claim is that ACAN alterations are somehow related to this tumor type, that needs to be substantiated. Or if the implication is that ACAN is a passenger alteration, that needs to be stated explicitly also.</p></disp-quote><p>(Page 13 line 359-378; Page 21 line 587-597; Supplementary File 4) We thank the reviewer for carefully reviewing and raising concerns about our WES analysis.</p><p>We supplemented the variants filtering criteria in Page 21 line 587-597, and further discussed the WES results in Page 13 line 359-378. Besides, the germline and somatic mutations were listed in Supplementary File 4 including detailed annotations.</p><p>Genetic mutations of phaeochromocytoma and paraganglioma are mainly classified into two major clusters, that is, pseudo hypoxic pathway and kinase signaling pathways [3-4]. We did not find any gene mutations or copy number variations that were related to these two major clusters. We only identified 1 shared somatic variant of <italic>ACAN</italic> mutation (c.5951T&gt;A:p.L1984Q) comparing variants in tumor samples to controls. <italic>ACAN</italic>, encoding a major component of the extracellular matrix, is a member of the aggrecan/versican proteoglycan family. Mutations of <italic>ACAN</italic> were reported related to steroid levels [5]. It is well-established that circulating steroid levels are linked to inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, because arthritis as well as most autoimmune disorders result from a combination of several predisposing factors including the stress response system such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis [6]. But no direct evidence related to <italic>ACAN</italic> for phaeochromocytoma. Therefore, no obvious genetic driver was found to explain the rare case of ACTH/CRH-secreting phaeochromocytoma. Further investigations would be needed to uncover the relation between <italic>ACAN</italic> to phaeochromocytoma.</p><p>References:</p><p>[1].
