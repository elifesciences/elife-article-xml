involved in modulation of pain, fear, addiction, and ischemia-induced neuronal injury. We report isolation and characterization of alpaca-derived nanobodies (Nbs) that specifically target human ASIC1a. Cryo-electron microscopy of the human ASIC1a channel at pH 7.4 in complex with one of these, Nb.C1, yielded a structure at 2.9 Å resolution. It is revealed that Nb.C1 binds to a site overlapping with that of the Texas coral snake toxin (MitTx1) and the black mamba venom Mambalgin-1; however, the Nb.C1-binding site does not overlap with that of the inhibitory tarantula toxin psalmotoxin-1 (PcTx1). Fusion of Nb.C1 with PcTx1 in a single polypeptide markedly enhances the potency of PcTx1, whereas competition of Nb.C1 and MitTx1 for binding reduces channel activation by the toxin. Thus, Nb.C1 is a molecular tool for biochemical and structural studies of hASIC1a; a potential antidote to the pain-inducing component of coral snake bite; and a candidate to potentiate PcTx1-mediated inhibition of hASIC1a in vivo for therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ASIC1</kwd><kwd>nanobody</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>Pctx1 potentiation</kwd><kwd>MitTx antagonism</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013790</institution-id><institution>Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structural Biology, Tsinghua University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canessa</surname><given-names>Cecilia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 MH10107466402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Canessa</surname><given-names>Cecilia M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1 NS021501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigworth</surname><given-names>Fred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Development of specific and high-affinity nanobodies to probe the structure of human acid sensing ion channel-1a and as binding modifiers of the toxins PcTx and MitTx1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ASICs are proton-activated sodium channels present in most neurons of the central and peripheral nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krishtal and Pidoplichko, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>). There are four ASIC genes (<italic>ASIC1-4</italic>) and six isoforms in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kellenberger and Schild, 2002</xref>). The most abundant and broadly expressed subunit is ASIC1a; its deletion in the mouse genome eliminates most of the proton-induced currents mediated by ASICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>). Association of three pore-forming subunits, either as homotrimers or heterotrimers, forms functional channels. All ASIC isoforms share a common structure consisting of two transmembrane domains (TMDs) (TM1 and TM2), cytosolic amino- and carboxy-termini with the amino-terminus forming a reentrant loop into the lower pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>), and a large extracellular domain (ECD) that adopts a fist-like conformation with distinct subdomains. These structural features were unveiled by the first crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>), which was obtained from chicken ASIC (cASIC1) in the desensitized conformation at low pH. Subsequently, structures of cASIC1 in the open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>), closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>), desensitized at high and low pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>), and in complex with various toxins have been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, structures of a human ASIC subunit, hASIC1a, have been obtained alone and in complex with Mambalgin-1 toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>ASICs are the target of many polypeptide toxins that induce significant functional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cristofori-Armstrong and Rash, 2017</xref>). Of the three most studied, two are antagonists and one is an activator of ASIC channels. PcTx1 is a 40-residue peptide from the venom of the tarantula <italic>Psalmopoeus cambridgei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Escoubas et al., 2000</xref>) that inhibits hASIC1a (IC<sub>50</sub> ~3 nM when conditioned at pH 7.2). It has been investigated as an analgesic and neuroprotective agent from ischemic injury of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mazzuca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>). Mambalgin-1 is a 78-residue three-finger toxin from the venom of the black mamba snake <italic>Dendroaspis polypepsis</italic> that rapidly and reversibly inhibits ASIC1a in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diochot et al., 2012</xref>). Because Mambalgin-1 exhibits strong analgesic effects, it has raised interest as a potential treatment for chronic pain and as an alternative to opioids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diochot et al., 2016</xref>). Third, the toxin MitTx, found in the venom of the Texas coral snake <italic>Micrurus tener tener</italic>, functions as a potent, persistent, and selective agonist for ASICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2011</xref>). It is a heterodimer of an α-subunit (60 a.a.) and β-subunit (119 a.a.).</p><p>These toxins bind primarily to the thumb domain of the ECD of ASICs. Structures of each of these toxins in complex with cASIC1 have been solved, and in the recent study of hASIC1a by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2020</xref> a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hASIC1a bound to Mambalgin-1 at pH 7.4 was solved at 3.9 Å resolution.</p><p>To address present challenges in analysis of hASIC1a, we have developed nanobodies (Nbs) with high specificity and affinity to human ASIC1a.

Sera collected post-immunization contained conventional IgG1 and single-domain IgG2/3 antibodies that bind to hASIC1a, as analyzed by ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). A phage display library was constructed from mRNA isolated from peripheral lymphocytes (titer of approximately 10<sup>9</sup> independent clones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pardon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). To select Nbs that recognize hASIC1a in native conformation and to minimize isolation of nonspecific binders, three successive panning protocols were used: the first panning was conducted on <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes injected with hASIC1a cRNA while the second and third used recombinant hASIC1a protein bound to agarose and magnetic beads, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Phagemids recovered from the third panning were used for expression and isolation of Nbs: 600 were tested by ELISA. We considered a clone to be positive if the ELISA intensity was above a threshold that eliminated about two-thirds of the clones. Representative ELISA results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>. Approximately 200 clones were selected for sequencing of DNA. The sequencing result indicated that many of ELISA positive clones were identical or had one or two amino acid differences, which is consistent with efficient enrichment for high affinity clones obtained by our screening strategy. DNA sequences of final candidates separated into three main groups, as shown in a phylogeny tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and in the protein alignment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. All these clones were further examined by immunofluorescence of cells transfected with hASIC1a. From all the Nbs tested, the group consisting of C1-4-5, D10, and H10 produced strong signals and low background. A different group (1A-B1, 2B-D4, and 2B-E60) required permeabilization of cells for labeling, suggesting that the recognized epitopes are intracellular; this was confirmed in immunocytochemistry of permeabilized cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of nanobodies (Nbs) specific to hASIC1a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fractionation of IgG (immunoglobulin G) classes from serum after completion of immunization schedule of alpaca. (<bold>B</bold>) Each fraction was tested for antibodies against hASIC1a by ELISA.

Although it shares approximately 89% sequence identity with hASIC1a, the chicken isoform differs in functional properties and response to toxins and other compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Saez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic and Kellenberger, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Smith and Gonzales, 2014</xref>). Thus, when considering the development of therapeutics, the structure of the human channel is preferred. In the past, challenges working with hASIC1a arose from the tendency of hASIC1a to give low yields and to aggregate, making it difficult to obtain high-quality protein preparations suitable for structural analysis.</p><p>One of the goals of this work was to explore whether an Nb with high affinity to hASIC1a would overcome these problems. Among the best binders initially screened, Nb.C1was selected on the basis of high-affinity, low background, and absence of modification of channel function. Subsequently, Nb.C1 was added to large-scale preparations of crude membranes from 293 F cells expressing an affinity-tagged construct (functional hASIC1a comprising amino acids 12–478 with a Strep Tag II in the N-terminus) prior to solubilization with DDM detergent. After affinity purification, the hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex was pure and monodispersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This contrasts with the protein aggregates observed in size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of solubilized hASIC1a alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the complex, proteins from the peak of the SEC separated by gel electrophoresis showed bands for hASIC1a and Nb.C1 consistent with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The solubilized hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex at 3.8 mg/mL was used to make cryo-EM samples. Images were obtained on a Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using an energy filter and electron-counting camera.

The most noticeable structural difference between hASIC1a and cASIC1 is in this long loop that extends down from the α4-helix to the tip of the thumb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The loop is longer and more twisted in hASIC1a because it has two extra amino acids D298 and L299 (DL) that are absent in cASIC1 and in all other known ASIC isoforms. These two amino acids are essential for binding of Nb.C1 as their deletion from hASIC1a eliminates the signal in immunofluorescence microscopy. Channels that do not encode those two residues such as cASIC1, mASIC1a, mASIC2a, and mASIC3 are also not recognized by Nb.C1 in IF experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The residues involved in interactions with Nb.C1 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. Two Asp residues in the extended loop of the thumb are involved: D296 interacts with Nb-Y108, and D298 with Nb-R35 and Nb R105. In addition, R317 at the end of α4 interacts with Nb-F58. None of these interactions would be possible in cASIC1. The loop in the hASIC1a structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2020</xref> is poorly resolved, but in the current structure is well defined likely because of stabilization provided by Nb.C1, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>.</p><p>Of note, extensive functional analysis of hASIC1a bound to Nb.C1 showed that Nb binding did not change the channel’s properties. The average magnitude of current, rate of desensitization, midpoint pH of activation (pH<sub>50a</sub>), and of steady-state desensitization (pH<sub>50ssd</sub>) were all unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). The presence of the DL motif itself, however, affects the pH dependence of activation and desensitization. DL lies within a five-amino-acid stretch of hASIC1a which, when mutated, confers the altered pH sensitivity of the mouse isoform on hASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sherwood and Askwith, 2008</xref>). Further, we compared the effects of the DL motif on hASIC1a and cASIC1. Deletion of DL in hASIC1a produces a small but significant left shift of the pH<sub>50ssd</sub> (from 7.11±0.02 to 7.18±0.02), while insertion of DL into cASIC1 produces the opposite effect (from 7.45±0.01 to 7.38±0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5C–D</xref>).</p><p>To visualize the binding sites of MitTx, PcTx1, and Mambalgin-1 and compare them to the binding site of Nb.C1, our structure of the hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex was superimposed on chicken or human subunits bound to each of the three toxins, and shown in orthogonal views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The superimposition of cASIC1-MitTx1 in the open conformation shows the α-subunit of the toxin interacting with the tip of the thumb close to the membrane bilayer, and with the extended chain that connects α5 to the β10 strand. Meanwhile, the β-subunit forms contacts with α4 and α5 of the thumb, extensively overlapping with the binding site of PcTx1 but not with that of Nb.C1. Though the binding sites of Nb.C1 and MitTx subunits are different, the bulky scaffold of the Nb produces steric hindrance to binding of the α-subunit, marked in the figure by a dashed square. In contrast, Nb.C1 and PcTx1 bind at distinct and well-separated sites, preventing mutual interference when both peptides bind simultaneously to the surface of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structural comparison of hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex to toxin-bound ASICs.</title><p>Two side, top and bottom views of superimposed structures of hASIC1a-NbC1 complex (red) with (<bold>A</bold>) MitTx-bound to chicken ASIC1 (4ntw) in open conformation (orange).

We hypothesized that slowing the recovery from inhibition would be advantageous for in vivo applications of PcTx1 either as a potential pain suppressor or for protecting neurons from ischemia of the brain. That aim could be achieved by fusing Nb.C1 to PcTx1 in a single polypeptide provided that the Nb exhibits slower dissociation than the toxin and that the fusion does not interfere with binding to hASIC1a. To verify binding we first used SH-SY5Y cells, which are derived from a human neuroblastoma and express endogenous hASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xiong et al., 2012</xref>). An Nb.C1-PcTx1 fusion construct produced a fluorescence signal that decorated the plasma membrane of SH-SY5Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–G</xref>).</p><p>The time course of dissociation of Nb.C1 from hASIC1a was followed in transfected HEK293 cells using the following protocol.

At each of the four time points, a group of cells was fixed and processed for IF or washed again until the next time point.

Oocytes not exposed to any peptide served as control for spontaneous decay of the currents after multiple consecutive stimuli. Cells pre-incubated with PcTx1 recovered current faster (τ<sub>off</sub>220 s) and more completely (90 ± 16%) than those pre-incubated with the fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I–J</xref>). Cells exposed to Nb.C1-Flex-PcTx recovered only a small fraction of the initial current after 25 min (0.16) even though the calculated τ<sub>off</sub> (355 s) was not much slower than that of toxin alone whereas Nb.C1-Rigid-PcTx reached a lower plateau level (0.14) and slower rate of recovery (τ<sub>off</sub> = 882 s) compared to the flexible linker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata3">Source data 3</xref>). The partial recovery may be attributed to the presence of some free toxin from cleavage of the fusion proteins and was observed most prominently with the flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Together these experiments indicate that PcTx1 tethered to Nb.C1 significantly potentiates the action of the toxin.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Notwithstanding the extensive progress achieved in the elucidation of the structure and functions of ASICs in recent years, important challenges still remain, underscoring the need to develop new tools to further our understanding of these channels. To that end, we sought to develop Nbs specific to hASIC1a. This strategy exploits the capacity of the immune system to produce a large variety of small polypeptides against a single target, each with unique properties that can be selected for specific applications.</p><p>Here, we show that one Nb (Nb.C1) isolated from a phage display library prevents aggregation and stabilizes hASIC1a, markedly improving the quality of the sample preparation for cryo-EM studies. We obtained the structure of hASIC1-Nb.C1 complex in the closed conformation at 2.9 Å resolution, indicating that the Nb has potential toward attaining high-resolution structural information of hASIC1a in additional conformations. The growing use of Nbs in structural biology stems from the fact that they can stabilize native conformations of proteins, in particular membrane proteins, facilitating structural analysis by crystallization or cryo-EM.</p><p>The Nb also constitutes a new tool to accelerate the development of therapeutic agents targeted to hASIC1a. The cryo-EM structure of the hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex reveals that Nb.C1 binds to the thumb domain of hASIC1a to an epitope in the extended loop of the thumb that contains two extra amino acids (D298 and L299) unique to hASIC1a. These residues determine the high specificity toward hASIC1a and their absence explains the lack of reactivity with other species or isoforms (cASIC1, mASIC1, ASIC2, or ASIC3). Nb.C1 binding also spans to the end of the α4-helix. This is a region on the surface of the ECD that is also recognized by various toxin polypeptides with functional activity toward many ASIC isoforms. Specifically, it overlaps with the binding site of Mambalgin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2020</xref>) and the binding site of the α-subunit of MitTx. This last toxin is the component of the Texas coral snake venom that produces severe pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Greene et al., 2020</xref>) by activating hASIC1a in peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohlen et al., 2011</xref>). In these two instances, most of the binding interference with the Nb is due to steric hindrance produced by the scaffold of the Nb, which is large (16.28 kDa) compared to the size of Mambalgin-1 (6.55 kDa) and MitTx α-subunit (7 kDa). Therefore, Nb.C1 could serve as a competitive antagonist to MitTx and as a potential antidote for the pain-producing component of the snake bite. Nbs offer practical advantages over currently available antivenoms usually raised in sheep or horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) because Nbs can be produced in bacteria in large amounts and at low cost.</p><p>The Nb.C1-binding site is distinct from that of the inhibitory toxin PcTx. The lack of competition for binding sites and steric interference but yet close proximity of the two binding sites offers the possibility of using Nb.C1 as a carrier for PcTx1 to increase potency and decrease off-target effects of the toxin. While the effect of PcTx1 alone is rapidly reversible, a fusion protein incorporating Nb.C1 achieves inhibition of ~84–87% that persists for more than 30 min in functional studies and remains bound for more than 4 hr on the surface of live cells according to IF assays. The changes in toxin kinetics are consistent with the Nb having a much slower k<sub>off</sub> rate than that of the toxin. Further optimization of the sequence of the linker, mainly to minimize or eliminate cleavage, could increase even more the fractional current inhibited by the Nb.C1-PctX fusion peptide. Tethering of PcTx to the Nb also would direct the toxin to bind preferentially to the subunit ASIC1a increasing specificity, which is beneficial for in vivo applications such as the amelioration of ischemic damage to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCarthy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Why does Nb.C1 bind to sites overlapping with those of toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) but itself does not alter channel function? We note that Nb.C1 does not interact with the α5-helix of the thumb, while the three toxins in consideration all bind to α5 and these interactions change the conformation of α5 in a toxin-specific manner. Many lines of evidence support the notion that displacement of α5 is an essential component of channel gating. Mutations in α5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>), formation of cysteine bonds that restrain movement of helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yoder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), and binding of polypeptides that produce small but significant displacements are maneuvers that alter gating by lowering pH<sub>50a</sub>, abolishing currents, inducing desensitization or causing channel opening. We posit that the absence of Nb.C1 contacts with α5 is the most likely explanation of why Nb.C1 does not change function of hASIC1a. Interactions of Nb.C1 are limited to a short segment of the extended loop of the thumb that projects down to TM1 and a segment of the α4-helix of the thumb. Comparison of our structure with the hASIC1a structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2020</xref> shows that Nb.C1 binding produces a very small movement of α4 and negligible perturbation of α5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show examples of uses of Nb.C1 isolated from an hASIC1a-specific phage display library to advance structural and functional studies of the human channel, and as means to increase or attenuate effects of ASIC-specific toxins with potential therapeutic applications.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The construct was expressed in HEK293F cells (Invitrogen) cultured in suspension. Expression level of hASIC1a was estimated 48–72 hr post-transfection by immunofluorescence using StrepII tag monoclonal (Abcam). One liter of cell culture was routinely used for isolation of hASIC1a. Crude membrane pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). For hASIC1a-Nb complex purification, crude membranes were first incubated with 3–4 mg of purified Nbs, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) under slow agitation at 4°C for 3 hr to allow binding of the Nb. The suspension was then treated with 1% DDM (Anatrace). After clarifying the homogenate by ultracentrifugation, hASIC1a was affinity-purified with Strep Tactin XT agarose beads (IBA) to achieve high degree of purity and to remove free Nbs. Elution was conducted with the addition of 50 mM D-biotin, samples were concentrated to a volume of 0.8 mL using a 50 kDa cutoff Centricon (Millipore). Samples were injected to a size exclusion column (Superdex 200 Increase 10/200 GL, GE Healthcare).

Mycoplasma infection was ruled out by a commercial PCR assay (EZ-PCR Mycoplasma detection kit from Biological Industries, #20-700-20). Cells seeded onto glass coverslips treated with poly-L-lysine were either non-transfected or transfected with hASIC1a in pCDNA3.1 vector with Lipofectamine. For surface labeling of hASIC1a, 18–20 hr post-transfection, anti-hASIC1a Nbs were added to the culture medium in a concentration of 1 nM and cells were placed on ice to inhibit endocytosis. After 1 hr of incubation, cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in PBS for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were further permeabilized with buffer containing 1%Triton-X100 for 30 min. Mouse anti-Flag (Sigma) primary antibodies were added for 1 hr at RT. After three washes, Alexa Flour goat 594 and/or Alexa Flour 488 (Invitrogen) were added for 1 hr. Both primary and secondary antibody incubations were conducted in the presence of 5% normal goat serum to decrease background. DAPI was added to visualize nuclei. In chase experiments, Nb.C1 (1 nM) was incubated for 30 min, washed three times with PBS followed by a chase of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 hr at RT.

specific antibody that marks human ASIC1a. The authors generate a nanobody specific to the extracellular part of human ASIC1a, which they use to obtain a high-resolution structure of the channel and modulate the binding of toxins to nearby sites on the channel. The nanobody will be a valuable tool for the structural, functional, and physiological characterization of ASIC1a, and is a launch point for the development of therapeutics that target pathologies of ASIC1a, including pain.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structure and analysis of nanobody binding to the human ASIC1a ion channel&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David M Maclean (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors should evaluate the current quality of the model (bonds, angles, C-β deviations, etc), perhaps use web servers like MolProbity for inspection. It is important to carry out these analyses until satisfactory model statistics are obtained. In addition, the authors should provide a detailed table of statistics of data collection and model refinement, as it provides one simple reference that readers can easily access. The table also serves as a guide for readers to assess the limitations of the presented data.</p><p>2) The current coordinate file is of one protomer with no symmetry operators to generate the other two protomers around the three-fold axis of symmetry. The authors described that RELION was used for 3D classification and refinement (C3 symmetry). Please provide symmetry operators.</p><p>3) For the parts of the manuscript where molecular interactions at the nanobody/channel interface are described, the authors should show maps, at least as a figure supplement.</p><p>4) For the data described in Table 1: some example raw traces and pH-response curves should be shown. In addition, some description should be provided of for variance in replicate measurements of pH dependence or the Hill coefficient.</p><p>5) All reviewers agreed that it would be helpful to the narrative of the manuscript to compare and contrast the binding sites for Nb.C1, MitTX, and PcTx1, perhaps by adding an additional figure. It would be helpful to add some discussion providing a structural rationalization of why Nb.C1 can bind hASIC1a in an overlapping binding site, but not alter function.</p><p>6) Data is not shown for certain assertions, such as that the signal for the hASIC1 with a deletion is decreased in ELISA assays (this was shown in immunofluorescence microscopy), or that the mouse ASIC1a shows weak interactions with the nanobody. Lines 139 and 189 refers to rat and mouse ASIC1a but that data is not shown.</p><p>7) Although recovery from the PcTx1 toxin is described as being more rapid than recovery from the fusion protein, the time constants of these processes are within 2-fold of each other (Figure 4K). The main difference between the recoveries is the plateau. One possible interpretation of this is that some of the fusion protein has been proteolyzed so that the recovery represents the behavior of two sub-populations: one of toxin without fused nanobody, and one with the fusion protein. Perhaps in agreement with this, the gel from the purification has lower molecular weight bands that may correspond to nanobody or toxin alone. The authors should discuss this possibility, and comment on whether any experiments were done to control for this.</p><p>8) The authors do not indicate whether the PcTx1-nanobody fusion is from multiple biochemical preparations or just a single protein prep. It is important to reproduce these results for toxin-fusions from multiple biochemical preps in order to understand the prep-to-prep reproducibility for measurements like the recovery plateau.</p><p>9) The authors focus on the C1 nanobody, but also mention results obtained with other nanobodies (the ones in the tree in Figure 1E). The authors state &quot;Nb.C1 was selected on the basis of high-affinity, absence of modification of channel function and a profile of monodisperse hASIC1a protein in size exclusion…. (lines 106-108)&quot;. This suggests other nanobodies were screened for affinity, channel modification and peak dispersion. Also, lines 91-93, the authors mention other nanobodies which required permeabilization to bind. The data relating to affinity, channel modulation, SEC and immuno from other nanobodies should be included, not simply mentioned but never shown.</p><p>10) The authors should describe what criteria they use to identify nanobody Nb.C1 as &quot;high affinity.&quot; Reporting a Kd value would be useful.</p><p>11) Lines 102-104, the authors mention hASIC1a tends to give low yields and aggregates, thus making cryo em sample prep difficult. The C1 nanobody is presented as a solution to this. The authors should include some data of hASIC1a alone (gels, chromatographs, etc.) to illustrate that this was a problem. As it stands, the nanobody is a solution to a problem we never actually see. Also, it is unclear how the Sun 2020 hASIC1a structure paper was able to overcome this without the benefit of nanobodies. Do the authors have thoughts on this?</p><p>12) The authors noted that SH-SY5Y was used for imaging as it contains endogenous hASIC1a. A figure is shown (Figure 4G) to demonstrate an inward current is elicited upon application of pH 6.0. Is this current amiloride-sensitive?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The strengths of the manuscript are: This is the highest-resolution structure of human ASIC1 described to date. Often, nanobodies are selected and used for structural characterization without additional functional analysis; the focus on the functional consequences of this nanobody is refreshing, and the proposed applications of this nanobody are intriguing.</p><p>The weaknesses of the manuscript are:</p><p>Some data might require additional Table 1 does not indicate the variance in replicate measurements of pH dependence or the Hill coefficient for the channel. Data is not shown for certain assertions, such as that the signal for the hASIC1 with a deletion is decreased in ELISA assays (although this was shown in immunofluorescence miscroscopy), or that the mouse ASIC1a shows weak interactions with the nanobody. Although the nanobody is described as high-affinity, the authors do not report a Kd value. Given that the foundation of this manuscript is characterization of nanobody-channel interactions, this seems like an important piece of information.</p><p>Although recovery from the PcTx1 toxin is describes as being more rapid than recovery from the fusion protein, the time constants of these processes are within 2-fold of each other (Figure 4K). The main difference between the recoveries is the plateau. The authors do not speculate about what this might mean, mechanistically. One possibility is that some of the fusion protein has been proteolyzed so that the recovery represents the behavior of two sub-populations: one of toxin without fused nanobody, and one with the fusion protein. Perhaps in agreement with this, the gel from the purification has lower molecular weight bands that may correspond to nanobody or toxin alone. Related to this, the authors do not indicate whether the PcTx1-nanobody fusion is from multiple biochemical preparations or just a single protein prep. It is important to reproduce these results for toxin-fusions from multiple biochemical preps in order to understand the prep-to-prep reproducibility for measurements like the recovery plateau.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the creation and characterization of a nanobody directed at the human ASIC1a extracellular domain. A nanobody library was generated by injecting an alpaca with cells expressing human ASIC1a (hASIC1a) then extracting mRNA from peripheral lymphocytes and using this to create a phage display library. The phage display library went through three different rounds of screening to arrive at a pool of about 20 promising clones. One of these was selected for further detailed characterization. This particular nanobody (C1) was able to stabilize trimeric hASIC1a in size exclusion, enabling the authors to obtain high resolution cryo-EM structures of nanobody-bound hASIC1a. This structure indicates the nanobody binds to an extracellular loop which in hASIC1a contains an added two amino acids compared to other ASIC1 variants, providing a mechanism for specificity. The evidence for specificity is largely provided by immunofluorescence data with either a control nanobody or modified ASIC subunits as controls. Interestingly, the C1 nanobody does not appear to alter hASIC1a function but does compete with the peptide MitTx, which binds nearby. Conjugating the nanobody to an ASIC-selective toxin can considerably prolong the toxins dissociation. The properties of this specific nanobody hold promise as a useful tool in the field.</p><p>The major advance is isolating this hASIC1a specific nanobody. Based on the authors data, this nanobody is specific due to two amino acids added to an extracellular loop in hASIC1a which are not present in chicken ASIC1 or other ASICs. As stated by the authors, this nanobody could then be used to help structural and biochemical investigation of hASIC1a, or potentially for therapeutic purposes in the future. A limitation or weakness of this nanobody is it only seems to work for hASIC1a, not mouse or rat ASIC1a. Nonetheless, the approach is strong, the data appear clear and support the major claims of the paper. There are a number of occasions where more detail is warranted, or where additional controls would increase overall quality but nothing that threatens the core findings of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Wu et al. identify a novel alpaca-derived nanobody (Nb.C1) that binds specifically and with high affinity for human acid-sensing ion channel 1a (hASIC1a) and does not alter the functional properties of the channel. The authors use a combination of cryo-EM, electrophysiology, and fluorescence-based imaging to probe the hASIC1a-Nb.C1 complex. The authors demonstrate that by using Nb.C1, they were able to overcome biochemical challenges related to isolation of hASIC1a and were able to obtain a 3D map at 3.15 Å, a marked improvement from a previous cryo-EM structure of hASIC1a resolved at 3.9 Å by Sun et al. (2020). The resulting map shows hASIC1a in complex with three Nb.C1 in the closed, resting state. Interestingly, Nb.C1 binding site overlaps with that of MitTx and Mambalgin-1, toxins that stabilized the open and closed states of ASIC1a, respectively, but not that of PcTx1. The authors probe the interactions of Nb.C1 with hASIC1a using MitTx as a functional marker as it activates ASIC1a at physiological pH by electrophysiology, and the functional results support the structure. Application of both Nb.C1 and MitTx reduces the effects of the toxin. Wu et al. also investigated the effects of the Nb.C1 fused with PcTx1 and found that the fusion resulted prolonged effects of PcTx1-mediated inhibition. Altogether, the authors conclude that Nb.C1 is a powerful tool with multiple applications serving both structural-based and therapeutic-based studies. Indeed, the conclusion of the work described are largely supported by the data presented, but there are multiple sections in the manuscript that authors can expand on, clarify, and thoroughly inspected for consistency to strengthen the work.</p><p>1) A table of statistics relating to data collection and model refinement would be greatly appreciated as it provides one simple reference that readers can easily access. The table also serves as guidance for readers in order to assess the limitations of the presented data.</p><p>2) It is striking that the Nb.C1 binding site overlaps those of MitTx and Mambalgin-1 but the nanobody does not demonstrate either activating or inhibiting effects on the functional properties of hASIC1a. Authors should expand on the similarities and differences between the binding sites of Nb.C1 and toxins as this highlights the utility of Nb.C1 for different applications, as the authors suggest. Furthermore, the binding site differences might shed light into how Nb.C1 can specifically bind to hASIC1a without altering its function, unlike the binding of toxins.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Structure and analysis of nanobody binding to the human ASIC1a ion channel&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. In Figure 5K, the datapoints obtained from the two constructs (rigid and flexible linker) should not be combined, since the reader cannot evaluate whether the constructs behave similarly. These should be shown as separate datasets in Figure 5K.</p><p>2. Performing a second biochemical purification of the nanobody/toxin fusion is important to evaluate the prep-to-prep reproducibility of the quantitative values reported for Figure 5J and 5K (point #8 in the original review). It needs to be established whether the fraction of current that is recovered is something that is consistent (and may be a property of the chimeric molecule being tested), or variable from prep-to-prep (and may be due to contaminating toxin not covalently linked to monobody). Related to point #1, separating the data obtained from the rigid and flexible linker could help address whether similar time constants and plateaus are observed for toxin-nanobody chimeras that have been prepared in independent batches (with the caveat that the constructs are not exactly the same). As an alternative, these data could be removed from the manuscript.</p><p>3. The newly presented Biacore data for the binding of the nanobody to the channels (shown in Figure 5-S1) is not well fit by the two-site binding model that is used. This fit leads to an exceptionally low 1 pM binding affinity, which is likely an overestimate of the binding affinity. (As a frame of reference, &quot;tight&quot; antibody-antigen complexes are usually closer to 1 nM binding affinity, with some as low as 100 pM). These data should not be used to estimate a Kd value if issues with protein quality make these curves unfittable by plausible binding models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67115.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors should evaluate the current quality of the model (bonds, angles, C-β deviations, etc), perhaps use web servers like MolProbity for inspection.

The main difference between the recoveries is the plateau. One possible interpretation of this is that some of the fusion protein has been proteolyzed so that the recovery represents the behavior of two sub-populations: one of toxin without fused nanobody, and one with the fusion protein. Perhaps in agreement with this, the gel from the purification has lower molecular weight bands that may correspond to nanobody or toxin alone. The authors should discuss this possibility, and comment on whether any experiments were done to control for this.</p></disp-quote><p>The interpretation provided by the reviewers is very likely. In addition, it is possible that a fraction of PcTx is not well folded i.e., pairing of the six cysteines is incorrect diminishing toxin binding affinity of the fusion protein. We have added an explanation to the text starting at line 224.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors do not indicate whether the PcTx1-nanobody fusion is from multiple biochemical preparations or just a single protein prep. It is important to reproduce these results for toxin-fusions from multiple biochemical preps in order to understand the prep-to-prep reproducibility for measurements like the recovery plateau.</p></disp-quote><p>We were aware of this problem. Because our limited resources, the purification of each fusion protein was conducted only once. The amount of purified fusion proteins was sufficient for the functional experiments. This caveat is mentioned in the legend of Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors focus on the C1 nanobody, but also mention results obtained with other nanobodies (the ones in the tree in Figure 1E). The authors state &quot;Nb.C1 was selected on the basis of high-affinity, absence of modification of channel function and a profile of monodisperse hASIC1a protein in size exclusion…. (lines 106-108)&quot;. This suggests other nanobodies were screened for affinity, channel modification and peak dispersion. Also, lines 91-93, the authors mention other nanobodies which required permeabilization to bind. The data relating to affinity, channel modulation, SEC and immuno from other nanobodies should be included, not simply mentioned but never shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we did not screen all isolated clones by all the criteria listed above, that approach would have taken a lot of time and resources.</p><p>After the third panning, we used ELISA to identify the strongest positive phages. As indicated in Figure 1D, an arbitrary threshold was set to examine only phages with high intensity signal, others were not considered for the next step. Several dozens of clones highly positive in ELISA were selected for DNA sequencing. Most of the sequenced clones were repeats or they had very similar sequences; i.e., there were not dozens of different clones rather a few clones repeated many times. This result is expected and represents a successful selection by our panning strategy of high affinity clones versus weak binders. Some of the sequenced clones were eliminated because they did not produce high amount of protein. The finalist clones are shown in Figure 1E. We next used IF to select clones with reactivity to hASIC1a and low background. The group in blue gave the cleanest signal. The group in green was also very clean but because the epitope(s) is intracellular we did not pursue further characterization in this study. If one looks at the sequences of the blue group (Figure 1 supp 2), they are almost identical, they differ by only one or two residues. Members of this group were tested on channels expressed in cells by TEVC. We used first C1 and later D10 in hASIC1a purification. Both Nbs were very good for this task, so we settled for C1 for the rest of the study.</p><p>The original sentence has been modified to convey a correct summary of the criteria that finally selected Nb.C1 though is not an exact sequence of events in the selection process:</p><p>“Among the best binders initially screened, Nb.C1 was selected on the basis of high-affinity, low background, and absence of modification of channel function. Subsequently, Nb.C1 was added to large scale preparations of crude membranes…”</p><p>It is entirely possible, indeed very likely, that the library contains more ‘good nanobodies’ for other purposes; they could be isolated by modifying the panning strategy.</p><p>Regarding Nbs in the green group, we are pursuing other applications, but for this publication is irrelevant. For the moment the library remains in the freezer until we obtain funds to continue the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors should describe what criteria they use to identify nanobody Nb.C1 as &quot;high affinity.&quot; Reporting a Kd value would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the answer to the previous question, a good strategy for screening the phage library is the best way to isolate high affinity and specific binders. We have conducted measurements of binding kinetics of Nb.C1 using SPR with a Biacore instrument (Figure 5-supplement 1)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Lines 102-104, the authors mention hASIC1a tends to give low yields and aggregates, thus making cryo em sample prep difficult. The C1 nanobody is presented as a solution to this. The authors should include some data of hASIC1a alone (gels, chromatographs, etc.) to illustrate that this was a problem. As it stands, the nanobody is a solution to a problem we never actually see. Also, it is unclear how the Sun 2020 hASIC1a structure paper was able to overcome this without the benefit of nanobodies. Do the authors have thoughts on this?</p></disp-quote><p>In our hands, purification of high quality hASIC1a expressed in HEK293F cells was challenging owing to aggregation, and when placed on grids, displayed strong orientation bias. Nb.C1 solve both problems. Representative examples of SEC profiles using 1% DDM or 1% Fos-choline14 are shown, along with a Western blot of hASIC1a protein from the three peaks as Figure 2—figure supplement 1. In the figure legend we note the differences between a well-behaved protein of Sun et al. and our protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors noted that SH-SY5Y was used for imaging as it contains endogenous hASIC1a. A figure is shown (Figure 4G) to demonstrate an inward current is elicited upon application of pH 6.0. Is this current amiloride-sensitive?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Noted in the figure legend.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. In Figure 5K, the datapoints obtained from the two constructs (rigid and flexible linker) should not be combined, since the reader cannot evaluate whether the constructs behave similarly. These should be shown as separate datasets in Figure 5K.</p><p>2. Performing a second biochemical purification of the nanobody/toxin fusion is important to evaluate the prep-to-prep reproducibility of the quantitative values reported for Figure 5J and 5K (point #8 in the original review). It needs to be established whether the fraction of current that is recovered is something that is consistent (and may be a property of the chimeric molecule being tested), or variable from prep-to-prep (and may be due to contaminating toxin not covalently linked to monobody). Related to point #1, separating the data obtained from the rigid and flexible linker could help address whether similar time constants and plateaus are observed for toxin-nanobody chimeras that have been prepared in independent batches (with the caveat that the constructs are not exactly the same). As an alternative, these data could be removed from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Answer to the above two comments. We made new preparations of fusion proteins (Nb.C1-FlexLinker-PcTx and Nb.C1-RigidLinker-PcTx) and repeated the k<sub>off</sub> measurements in oocytes with TEVC. The new data are presented in Figure 5K-L. There is a difference in the maximal inhibition (16% and 14%) between the two constructs. The Coomassie blue SDS-PAGE shows (Figure 5J) a small fraction of cleaved protein -more prominent in the flexible linker fusion- that we believe may account for the more rapid than expected koff, as it generates free toxin. Though we optimized the purification protocol for these preps (lower temperature during induction, shorter incubation, addition of protease inhibitors and small concentration of reducing agents, indicated in methods), the cleavage was not completely eliminated. This issue could be solved by trying different sequences of linkers resistant to proteolysis, though at the expense of significant additional time. We provide here stronger evidence that the fusions potentiate the effect of PcTx1 by producing a large non-recovering fraction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The newly presented Biacore data for the binding of the nanobody to the channels (shown in Figure 5-S1) is not well fit by the two-site binding model that is used. This fit leads to an exceptionally low 1 pM binding affinity, which is likely an overestimate of the binding affinity. (As a frame of reference, &quot;tight&quot; antibody-antigen complexes are usually closer to 1 nM binding affinity, with some as low as 100 pM). These data should not be used to estimate a Kd value if issues with protein quality make these curves unfittable by plausible binding models.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the figure of the Biacore binding kinetics of Nb.C1, as we agree that the fit to the unbinding time-course is very unreliable. The following paragraph has been added describing how we derived a rough estimate of the K<sub>D</sub> value of Nb.C1 (lines 214-222):</p><p>“To estimate the nanobody binding affinity, we first measured binding of Nb.1C to immobilized, detergent-solubilized hASIC1a protein using surface plasmon resonance. From experiments with two different Nb and hASIC1a protein preparations, global fits to association time courses with nanobody concentrations from 0.4 to 100nM yielded association rate constants k<sub>on</sub> ranging from 6.8x10<sup>4</sup> to 2.2x10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. […] Taking the smallest k<sub>on</sub> value as a lower bound on association rate yields the equilibrium constant K<sub>d</sub> ≲ 0.2 nM.”</p><p>This value is in the range of llama monomeric nanobodies (doi.org/10.1038/s42586-021-03676-z).</p></body></sub-article></article>
