RNAs (sRNAs), many of which exhibit homologies to rRNA from <italic>E. coli</italic>. The expression status and integration of these short RNAs into ribosomes remains unclear and direct evidence for active ribosomes within apicomplexan mitochondria is still lacking. In this study, we conducted small RNA sequencing on the apicomplexan <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> to investigate the occurrence and function of mitochondrial sRNAs. To enhance the analysis of sRNA sequencing outcomes, we also re-sequenced the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial genome using an improved organelle enrichment protocol and Nanopore sequencing. It has been established previously that the <italic>T. gondii</italic> genome comprises 21 sequence blocks that undergo recombination among themselves but that their order is not entirely random. The enhanced coverage of the mitochondrial genome allowed us to characterize block combinations at increased resolution. Employing this refined genome for sRNA mapping, we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks. Surprisingly, such block border sRNAs were incorporated into polysomes together with canonical rRNA fragments and mRNAs. In conclusion, apicomplexan ribosomes are active within polysomes and are indeed assembled through the integration of sRNAs, including previously undetected sRNAs with merged mRNA-rRNA sequences. Our findings lead to the hypothesis that <italic>T. gondii’s</italic> block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, potentially establishing a link between the regulation of rRNA and mRNA expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rribosome</kwd><kwd>rRNA</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic></kwd><kwd>polysomes</kwd><kwd>mitogenome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IRTG2290-B01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmitz-Linneweber</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequences at mitochondrial genome recombination sites are dually used as mRNAs and as rRNAs in actively translating mitoribosomes of <italic>T. gondii</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Apicomplexan parasites are a group of intracellular protozoan pathogens that can cause infectious diseases, including malaria and toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is caused by <italic>Toxoplasma gondii,</italic> one of the most widespread human parasites, with a seroprevalence of more than one-quarter of humans worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Molan et al., 2019</xref>). For many experimental questions, <italic>T. gondii</italic> remains an ideal model system for studying the molecular biology of Apicomplexa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szabo and Finney, 2017</xref>). Given the economic and clinical impact of <italic>T. gondii</italic> and its apicomplexan relatives, there is continuous interest in distinctive biochemical and cellular features as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Apicomplexan cells possess a single mitochondrion that is respirationally active and essential for parasite survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacRae et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seeber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vercesi et al., 1998</xref>). With only three exceptions, all mitochondrial proteins are nuclear-encoded and these nuclear genes contribute strongly to <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> cell fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bushell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sidik et al., 2016</xref>). Dozens of apicomplexan mitochondrial genomes have been sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berná et al., 2021b</xref>). These sequences showcase the extreme reductive evolution in apicomplexan mitochondria, setting records for the smallest mitochondrial genomes known to date, ranging in length from 6 to 11 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hikosaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oborník and Lukeš, 2015</xref>). Mitochondrial genome organization is evolutionarily very variable, with some species having a linear, monomeric genome (<italic>Babesia</italic> spp.), while others have concatenated arrays of genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hikosaka et al., 2013</xref>). The <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial genome is composed of 21 repetitive sequence blocks that are organized on multiple DNA molecules of varying lengths and non-random combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berná et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). Apicomplexan mitogenomes code only for three proteins (COB, COX1, COXIII) and have highly fragmented genes for rRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feagin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seeber et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 34 genes for rRNA fragments are scattered across the mitochondrial DNA on both strands of the genome without any linear representation of the full-length large or small subunit rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feagin et al., 2012</xref>). How the multitude of rRNA fragments are assembled into functional mitoribosomes in <italic>T. gondii</italic> remains unknown.</p><p>Since the electron transport chain in mitochondria is essential for the survival of apicomplexans, the expression of mitochondrial genes is likely to be essential as well. In fact, a nuclear-encoded RNA polymerase targeted to mitochondria has been shown to be essential in the blood stages of <italic>Plasmodium spp</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suplick et al., 1990</xref>). Two mitochondrially localized RNA binding proteins from the RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in apicomplexans) family are also essential for the survival of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, although their role in RNA metabolism has not yet been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hollin et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the depletion of nuclear-encoded mitoribosomal proteins of <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shikha et al., 2022</xref>) and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ke et al., 2018</xref>) led to defects in the assembly of ETC complexes and in parasite proliferation, suggesting that mitochondrial translation is important for parasite survival. Resistance to the antimalarial drug atovaquone in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> has been linked to mutations in the <italic>cob</italic> (<italic>cytB</italic>) gene of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McFadden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Srivastava et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Syafruddin et al., 1999</xref>), further supporting the idea of active, essential translation in apicomplexan mitochondria.</p><p>Despite the clear importance of mitogenome expression in Apicomplexa, we lack a comprehensive catalog of transcripts and processing events. Genome-length, polycistronic transcripts are produced in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> that encompass all three open reading frames (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 1996</xref>). The existence of full-length mRNAs was further confirmed by cDNA amplifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>) and long-read sequencing of mRNAs in both <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). There is no evidence of dedicated transcription initiation for individual protein-coding genes, and it is assumed that mRNAs are processed from the polycistronic precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feagin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillebrand et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rehkopf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suplick et al., 1990</xref>), but the mechanism of processing and the required machinery are unknown. Similarly, the production of rRNA fragments is achieved post-transcriptionally by processing long precursor RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ji et al., 1996</xref>). A catalog of small RNAs, mostly rRNA fragments, was described for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> based on small RNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillebrand et al., 2018</xref>), but in other apicomplexans, including <italic>T. gondii</italic>, our understanding of rRNA species is limited, and mostly based on predictions through sequence comparisons with <italic>Plasmodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feagin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We used a slightly modified protocol of mitochondria enrichment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esseiva et al., 2004</xref>) to investigate the structure of the mitochondrial genome through long-read sequencing at an unprecedented depth. In parallel, we conducted high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs (&lt;150 nt) and demonstrated that they are incorporated into polysomes. The combination of DNA sequencing results and transcriptome analysis also allowed us to identify previously undetected transcripts, many of which originate from block boundaries and represent fusions of coding and noncoding regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>T. gondii</italic> organellar nucleic acids are enriched by a combination of selective membrane disruption and degradation of nucleo-cytosolic DNA and RNA</title><p>The <italic>T. gondii</italic> nuclear genome contains many insertions of mitochondrial DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gjerde, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Namasivayam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ossorio et al., 1991</xref>). To better distinguish between NUMTs (nuclear DNA sequences that originated from mitochondria) and true mitochondrial sequences, it is helpful to enrich mitochondrial DNA. We modified a cell fractionation method that takes advantage of the differential sterol content in plasma membranes and organellar membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esseiva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Subczynski et al., 2017</xref>). We incubated cells with the detergent digitonin, which selectively permeabilizes sterol-rich membranes, leaving mitochondria and other organelles intact. We used a <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain that constitutively expresses GFP localized to the mitochondrial matrix to track the mitochondria during the purification process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After permeabilizing the plasma membrane with digitonin, we treated the cells with benzonase to degrade nucleo-cytosolic nucleic acids. Following the inactivation of the benzonase, we lysed the mitochondria with high concentrations of detergents to release the soluble content.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An experimental pipeline to enrich <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> mitochondrial RNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>T. gondii</italic> tachyzoites were harvested and incubated in a buffer with digitonin for plasma membrane permeabilization.

Soluble nucleic acids were separated by centrifugation and extracted from the supernatant.

GFP was tracked by immunoblotting (5% volume of each fraction was analyzed). The GFP signal remained in the pellet and only shifted into the supernatant after the lysis step. In contrast, much of the cytosolic HSP70 is removed during the procedure, indicating specific enrichment of mitochondria. (<bold>C</bold>) RNA extracted from selected fractions of the organelle enrichment protocol was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. (<bold>D</bold>) RNA extracted from selected fractions of the organelle enrichment protocol was analyzed on a denaturing 10% PAGE gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane. Radiolabeled DNA oligonucleotide probes were used to detect the mitochondrial rRNA fragments SSUD (from the small subunit of the ribosome) and LSUF (large subunit of the ribosome). Both fragments were found in pellet fractions after digitonin treatment, where they were protected from benzonase digestion. They only shifted to the supernatant after lysis. This demonstrates that the mitochondria stay intact during the procedure.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw gel and blot images.</title><p>Uncropped blots and gels accompanied by images indicating the areas shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref> with a red rectangle.

This suggests that the enrichment procedure generates cytosolic rRNA fragments that are co-purified, for example from partially digested, ER-membrane bound ribosomes. This pattern was observed for all cytosolic rRNAs (not shown). Since the benzonase does not degrade the cytosolic components entirely but creates a large number of smaller fragments, more reads for cytosolic rRNA were eventually found in the enriched RNA library than in the input library.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95407-fig1-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>We observed that mitochondrial GFP remained in the pellet fraction (P in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) with only a minor signal in the supernatant, indicating that the mitochondria remained largely intact.

Upon lysis of the mitochondria using Triton X-100 (‘Lysis’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the GFP signal was predominantly recovered in the supernatant, demonstrating efficient lysis of the mitochondria and release of soluble components. This fraction still contains HSP70, but slight contamination with cytosol is expected. We also found that cytosolic 18 S and 26 S rRNA were almost completely degraded, indicating the high efficacy of the benzonase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In summary, our enhanced protocol for organellar enrichment effectively depletes cytosolic protein and RNA components and enriches mitochondrial macromolecules.</p><p>To assess the integrity of mitochondrial RNA following our protocol, we utilized small RNA gel blot hybridization for two known mitochondrial rRNA fragments, SSUD and LSUF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>).

In contrast, we observed clear bands for both SSUD and LSUF, indicating their protection from benzonase degradation. Notably, we also detected signals for both rRNA fragments in the supernatant of the lysis fraction, confirming successful mitochondrial lysis and recovery of mitochondrial rRNA fragments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Long-read sequencing of DNA from enriched mitochondrial fractions identifies prevalent sequence block combinations</title><p>For the analysis of mitochondrial sRNAs, we needed a reference mitochondrial genome that would represent the existing sequence block combinations. A previous sequencing study used Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology (ONT) to identify combinations of sequence blocks in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). To improve read depth, we performed ONT sequencing on DNA gained from our improved organelle enrichment protocol. After filtering against the nuclear genome, we found 86,761 reads that had similarities to the published mitochondrial genome sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). This corresponds to 78.5 Mbp, which accounts for 9.2% of the total sequences that we attribute to the nucleus and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This is a 42-fold increase in the sequencing depth of the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial genome compared to previous attempts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which can be attributed to the effectiveness of the purification process. The length of mitochondrial reads ranged from 87 nt to 17,424 nt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The GC content of these reads, on average 36.4%, further supports their mitochondrial origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berná et al., 2021a</xref>). We annotated the reads using published sequence block information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>) and confirmed the previously described 21 sequence blocks, designated by letters from A-V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). We searched the sequencing data for repeated sequence elements but found no additional blocks, suggesting that the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial genome is fully covered. We compared our reads with published ONT reads for the <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berná et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). While smaller reads of our dataset are found in full within longer reads in the published datasets, we do not find any examples for reads that would be full matches between the datasets. This suggests that while the block content is identical between the different sequencing results, the actual block order was reshuffled by recombination, indicating the rapidity of mitogenome evolution in <italic>T. gondii,</italic> thus corroborating at a deeper sequencing coverage conclusions so far gained from a more limited read set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berná et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The depth of our sequencing enabled us to quantify the genome block combinations. We first asked whether there is a bias in sequential block succession. We observed that the rate of occurrence of blocks varies dramatically in our dataset, with the most frequent block, J, occurring 45,849 times and the least frequent, C, occurring 3138 times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This suggests that differences in block combinations can be expected. After counting block combinations, we found that only a small fraction of all possible block combinations are prevalent within the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), confirming block combinations observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>) and adding combination frequencies based on higher read numbers. For example, the most frequent block combination is J-B, which occurs 19,622 times in our reads. In total we identified 84 combinations of which 52 occur less than 50 times and make up less than 0.06% of the total number of combinations found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Fourteen blocks (R, N, M, F, L, U, I, C, K, D, H, E, T) are always found with the same preceding and following block. The direction of the blocks in these combinations is fixed (for example, the 3’-end of the L block is always fused to the 5’-end of the J block, never to the 3’-end of the J-block). This indicates that the genome’s flexibility is limited and that not all block combinations are realized (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). Variability in genome structure is caused primarily by blocks S, O, Q, B, and P, which have up to three possible neighbors, and by blocks Fp, Kp, V, A, and J, which have more than three possible neighbors. All combinations are well covered in our ONT results and helped to refine block borders relative to previous annotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Using the 32 high-frequency block combinations we found, we generated a map centered on the protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We will later show that all blocks not encoding proteins express rRNA fragments and are thus called rRNA blocks here. The map is not designed to represent physically existing DNA molecules, since the sequencing technology used cannot detect branched or circular DNAs, nor are the blocks drawn to scale. However, it helps to indicate the complexity of the nonrandom recombination events shaping the genome. For example, when considering the positioning of the three protein-coding genes within this map, it is conspicuous that their three 5'-ends are always flanked by blocks also encoding a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), although it is unclear whether this is of functional relevance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Long-read sequencing shows a specific system of block combinations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology (ONT) DNA sequencing results were analyzed for the number of block occurrences.

This may be adequate for the expression of the encoded proteins; however, we cannot currently exclude the possibility of genomic or post-transcriptional block shuffling that could lead to more complete open reading frames (as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berná et al., 2021b</xref>). We next applied approaches established previously to represent biased recombination events based on alternative block combinations (see Figure S12 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>) to our improved ONT read set.

We used Illumina-based small RNA sequencing of <italic>T. gondii</italic> to identify mitochondrial rRNA fragments. We sequenced both the mitochondria-enriched fraction and the input fractions described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In the enriched fraction, we mostly retrieved reads for cytosolic rRNA degradation products and poor coverage of mitochondrial sequences (not shown). This is likely caused by the benzonase step in the protocol, which generates an abundance of small degradation products of cytosolic rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the input samples, intact full-length rRNAs are removed by selecting small RNAs during library preparation, resulting in less prevalent cytosolic rRNA reads. We bioinformatically removed the remaining cytosolic rRNA reads as well as any reads shorter than 20 nt. Poly-A stretches at the 3’-ends were clipped as well. Finally, we mapped the remaining reads against the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) using the block combinations identified here by ONT sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The results of our mapping study show that the 5'-termini of mitochondrial small RNAs are clearly defined, making it easy to identify their transcript ends (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In agreement with findings from previous studies on small RNAs from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hillebrand et al., 2018</xref>), we found that the 3'-ends of many transcripts were more variable (as seen in the example of RNA17 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified a total of 34 small RNAs that accumulate in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Among these, 11 correspond to previously predicted rRNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>). Our sequencing data confirmed that these sequences are expressed and allowed us to refine the exact rRNA fragment ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Additionally, our small RNA sequencing revealed some larger differences compared to previous transcript predictions. This included a reassignment of SSUF to the opposite strand and also affected the four rRNA fragments LSUF, LSUG, LSUD, and LSUE, which had been predicted as separate transcripts of the large subunit (LSU) of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Namasivayam et al., 2021</xref>).

Using block combinations for mapping analysis, we identified 15 transcripts that span two blocks, i.e., there are sRNAs at almost half of all 31 block borders. Often, we find sRNAs that share a block border sequence at one end, but differ at the other end depending on the block combination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, orange boxes). An example of sequences shared at the 5'-end is represented by the pair RNA8 and RNA31, which both start in block Fp but end in different blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). An example of block sharing at the 3'-end is the RNA pair RNA1/RNA2.

However, a comprehensive catalog of mitoribosomal constituents is missing, and the extent to which rRNA fragments are part of mitoribosomes remains unanswered, nor have polysomes been identified as a direct readout for active ribosomes. To ascertain the presence of sRNAs within high-molecular weight complexes, we fractionated enriched organellar preparations using sucrose gradient analysis. We employed conditions known to preserve mitochondrial ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waltz et al., 2021a</xref>) conditions established to dissociate ribosomes (10 mM EDTA, no MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 300 mM KCl).

The paucity of detectable signals aligns with the expected degradation of abundant cytosolic rRNAs during preparation with benzonase. Notably, only the top fractions of the gradient (fractions 1–6) displayed bands, while the deeper fractions showed no discernible signals, reaffirming the effectiveness of the organellar preparation in eliminating cytosolic contaminants. The observed bands in the top fractions may represent degradation products of prevalent rRNA species, released from ribosomes by benzonase but persisting in the organellar preparation due to their abundance. Subsequent to gel electrophoresis, we transferred the RNA onto membranes and hybridized them with probes targeting seven specific sRNA species.

Second, all tested sRNAs were found to also migrate into the deepest gradient fractions 12–14. Collectively, these observations strongly indicate that the sRNAs in question are predominantly part of high molecular weight complexes. To evaluate the influence of ribosome-dissociative conditions on the fractionation of sRNAs in sucrose gradients, we quantified the sRNA signals in the deeper fractions (10–14) compared to the peak fractions (7–9 for LSU rRNAs and 6–9 for SSU rRNAs). For all sRNAs examined, a shift was observed from the deeper to the earlier fractions under dissociative conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This shift indicates that the large molecular weight complexes, with which these sRNAs are associated, are susceptible to ribosome-dissociative conditions. The most parsimonious conclusion is that all sRNAs tested are rRNAs.</p><p>We then asked whether rRNA fragments with homology to <italic>E. coli</italic> 23 S versus those with homology to 16 S rRNA exhibit differential signal distribution. We found that rRNAs presumed to be small subunit rRNAs, namely SSUA and RNA 19, displayed signals in fraction 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and G</xref>), a pattern not observed or less pronounced in presumed LSU rRNAs such as LSUD/E, LSUF/G, RNA1 +2, and RNA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C, E and F</xref>). The SSU-specific signal in fraction 6 persisted under both standard and dissociative conditions, implying that it represents free SSU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and G</xref>). We quantified the signals in all fractions under dissociative conditions and compared the profiles of sRNA signals across the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This shows that under dissociative conditions, the distribution and peaks differ markedly between the four predicted LSU rRNAs and the two SSU sRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The distinct distribution patterns for rRNAs with homology to LSU versus SSU rRNA suggest the gradient allows to assign individual rRNA fragments to the two subunits of the ribosome. Indeed, the previously unclassified RNA29 exhibited a distribution pattern very similar to LSU rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). It showed significantly less signal in fraction 6 than SSUA and a distribution across the gradient similar to LSUF/G and LSUD/E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This pattern indicates that RNA29 likely belongs to the LSU category. Unlike most other rRNAs, RNA29 also showed strong signals in the low molecular weight fractions 1–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>), hinting at a proportion of unassembled RNA29 in our preparation. Such un-assembled rRNA was also observed for RNA2, while the cognate RNA1 was barely detected in lower molecular weight fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). It remains to be determined whether different assembly kinetics or degradation rates contribute to the RNA signals in the upper parts of the gradient. Both RNA1 and RNA2 demonstrated deep penetration into the gradient, and showed a gradient distribution consistent with the LSU distribution pattern. Both RNA1 and RNA2 are sensitive to EDTA treatment.

There are different explanations for this peculiar localization of small RNAs. One possibility is that these RNAs are involved in the DNA recombination and replication process that occurs at block borders. RNA molecules have been found to play important roles in DNA repair at double-stranded breaks of nuclear DNA, both as long and small RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ohle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wei et al., 2012</xref>). However, it is currently unclear whether RNA:DNA hybrids play a role in mitochondrial DNA recombination and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allkanjari and Baldock, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another possible explanation for the presence of small RNAs at block borders is that <italic>T. gondii</italic> simply utilizes all available genomic space for RNA production, including block borders. <italic>T. gondii</italic> appears to be as economical with its mitochondrial sequence space as other apicomplexans, and it does have hardly any unused noncoding sequences in its genome. In fact, the sequences at recombination sites could be regarded as an expansion of the mitochondrial genome sequence space, which is not available to other apicomplexans like the genus Plasmodium. There is evidence from recent polyA-sequencing efforts that long transcripts spanning several short RNAs are also produced in <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). This is reminiscent of the situation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, where both strands of the entire mitochondrial genome are transcribed into polycistronic precursor RNAs. Therefore, block borders in <italic>T. gondii</italic> are likely transcribed into RNA as well. The functionality of these block border RNAs is unclear, but the unique sequence combinations generated at the block borders give rise to sRNAs that are not found in other apicomplexans with a simpler genome organization.</p><p>The discovery of sRNAs sharing sequences with mRNAs or being antisense to mRNAs in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria is an unexpected finding of our study that was facilitated by our improved understanding of mitochondrial genome organization. Antisense RNA is typically removed in mitochondria from flies and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pajak et al., 2019</xref>). Similar antisense degradation mechanisms must be assumed in apicomplexans, as both strands of their genomes are transcribed in full (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rehkopf et al., 2000</xref>). The fact that three small antisense RNAs survive antisense RNA surveillance in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria is intriguing, and it remains to be established whether RNA:RNA interactions of these sRNAs with mRNAs occur in vivo and could be of regulatory impact.</p><p>Another potential regulatory link between mRNAs and sRNAs is represented by small RNAs that utilize coding regions. <italic>RNA19</italic> is of particular interest because it contains a piece of <italic>coxIII</italic> at the 5’-end and terminates close to the <italic>cob</italic> start codon, while also showing homology to rRNA.

Recently, compelling evidence has surfaced suggesting the existence of ribosome-sized particles, including ribosomal proteins. Using blue-native gel electrophoresis, it was demonstrated that tagged ribosomal proteins <italic>Tg</italic>mS35, <italic>Tg</italic>bL12m, <italic>Tg</italic>uL3m, and <italic>Tg</italic>uL24m migrate as constituents of a macromolecular complex within the size range of a ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shikha et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Tg</italic>mS35 and <italic>Tg</italic>uL24m coprecipitated with mitochondria-encoded rRNA. Knockdown of <italic>Tg</italic>mS35, <italic>Tg</italic>bL35m, <italic>Tg</italic>bL36m, and <italic>Tg</italic>bL28m resulted in a specific loss of activity of one respiratory complex, which is partially encoded in the mitochondrial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacombe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shikha et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, it remains to be determined whether these large complexes are actively involved in translation.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that sRNAs with homology to rRNA are part of polysomes. This conclusion is based on our finding that sRNAs, mRNAs, and the ribosomal protein <italic>Tg</italic>uL11m are all found in high-molecular weight complexes that are sensitive to ribosome-dissociative conditions. We, furthermore, observed a difference in the gradient distribution of sRNAs assigned to SSU and LSU, respectively. Based on a comparison with these two gradient distribution patterns, we were able to assign RNA29 to LSU. In sum, our findings strongly support the notion of active translation by mitochondrial ribosomes in tachyzoites of <italic>T. gondii</italic>, and demonstrate that most if not all mitochondrial small RNAs fragments are part of the apicomplexan mitochondrial ribosome. This includes sRNAs expressed from block borders like the mRNA sequence-containing RNA3 and RNA19. Also, block border RNAs RNA1 and RNA2 that share their 3’-end sequence, but differ in their 5’-part are both incorporated into ribosomes. RNA1 is of particular interest since it contains sequences homologous to two different parts of the LSU rRNA from <italic>E. coli</italic> and hence could occupy two positions within a single ribosome. RNA1 is almost exclusively found in ribosomes and polysomes, whereas RNA2 is also found free of ribosomes - similar to RNA29. This suggests that RNA2 and RNA29 might not integrate into ribosomes as effectively as other rRNA fragments, raising questions about the coordination of rRNA fragment assembly. The assembly of a ribosome with numerous short rRNA fragments and a comparable number of ribosomal proteins is undeniably complex. Notably, longer variants of RNA19 are not incorporated into ribosomes, unlike smaller isoforms, highlighting a connection between small RNA processing and ribosome assembly. In the case of RNA19, processing precedes integration, contrasting with plant chloroplast ribosomes where the 23 S rRNA is split endonucleolytically at two sites post-integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nishimura et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The analyses presented here mark a first step towards describing the assembly steps of the fascinating <italic>T. gondii</italic> ribosome.

It will also eventually require understanding the ribosome 3D structure.

The latter were proposed to be assembled from highly fragmented ribosomal RNAs, but whether rRNA fragments are expressed and used in ribosomes was unclear. We adapted a protocol to enrich <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Esseiva et al., 2004</xref>) and used Nanopore sequencing to comprehensively map the genome with its repeated sequence blocks. Small RNA sequencing identified fragmented ribosomal RNAs, including some RNAs spanning block boundaries, thus fusing protein-coding and rRNA sequences. Sucrose density gradient analysis showed that such rRNA fragments are in polysome-size complexes. This distribution mirrored the localization of the mitoribosomal protein L11 as well as mRNAs in sucrose gradients. sRNAs, L11, and mRNAs shift to lower molecular weight complexes upon treatment with ribosome-dissociative buffer. We conclude that most if not all mitochondrial sRNAs are components of active ribosomes that assemble into polysomes. <italic>T. gondii’s</italic> dynamic block-based genome organization leads to the usage of mitochondrial sequences in mRNA as well as rRNA contexts, potentially linking rRNA and mRNA expression regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cultivation of host cells and <italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites</title><p><italic>T. gondii</italic> parasites were cultured according to standard procedures ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacot and Soldati-Favre, 2020</xref>) unless otherwise indicated.

To address the reviewers' concerns, we have significantly enhanced the manuscript by adding extensive data. This new data is crucial for demonstrating that our polysome analysis can effectively differentiate between polysomes and monosomes. It strengthens our key conclusion that the mitochondrial sRNAs we detected by a combination of nanopore-based genome sequencing and small RNA sequencing are used in actively translating ribosomes. This is to date the most direct evidence for translation in apicomplexan mitochondria. Moreover, the small RNAs generated from genomic recombination sites that are fusions of mRNA and rRNA sequences are found in polysomes as well. As far as we know, the linking of rRNA production to genomic recombination sites has not been described before.</p><p>The data added are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We introduced an additional transgenic line of <italic>T. gondii</italic> that produces a tagged variant of the ribosomal protein L11.

Consequently, all three contributors are now coauthors of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1</p></disp-quote><p>Your appreciation of our work is greatly encouraging; thank you for analyzing our manuscript!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mitochondrial genomes of Apicomplexa parasites have undergone dramatic reductions during their evolution with genes for only three proteins remaining. In addition, ribosomal RNA genes are present in different, often species-specific gene arrangements. <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> exhibits massive variations in gene arrangement that are distributed over multiple copies. In this study the Schmitz-Linneweber lab not only re-analysed the mitochondrial genome of <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> using a novel protocol for enriching the organellar nucleic acid, allowing to sequence the mitochondrial genome at unprecedented depth, they also addressed an enigma regarding the expression status of mitochondrial ribosomes.</p><p>While indirect evidence of mitochondrial translation exists, no direct evidence for active mitoribosomes exist and their composition is still poorly understood. Here, using HTS or small RNAs the authors demonstrate that they are incorporated into polysomes. Furthermore, the authors developed the hypothesis that the block-based genome organization enables the dual utilization of mitochondrial sequences as both messenger RNAs and ribosomal RNAs.</p><p>Own opinion/Major comments</p><p>The mitochondria of the Apicomplexa are characterized by massive gene transfer into the cell nucleus, and sequence rearrangements, which has led to a single, questioned genome reorganization. The underlying mechanisms of gene transcription and translation are also poorly understood. In a previous study, the Kissinger lab demonstrate the unique organization of the mitochondrial genome that consists of minimally of 21 sequence blocks (SBs) totaling 5.9 kb that exist as nonrandom concatemers (Namasivayam et al. 2021).</p><p>In this study the authors optimized a new isolation technique of organellar content to sequence the mitochondrial genome. This new purification protocol appears to be very robust and allowed the sequencing of mitochondrial genome at unprecedented depth. The obtained data not only validate previous studies, but they also suggest several new features, such as (potentially) continuous reshuffling of DNA blocks, leading to independent block combinations.</p><p>The most important aspect of this study is the demonstration of polysomes and the presence of rRNAs within these complexes, taking previous studies (i.e. Lacombe et al., 2019) a step further.</p><p>Taking all these efforts and data into account it is a very nice and interesting study that will certainly be of interest for a broader readership. All the presented data and analysis appear to be solid and well controlled. However, it must be mentioned that this reviewer is not an expert when it comes to the analysis and comparison of huge genomic datasets and the opinion of a bioinformatician would be helpful in assessing this study in more detail.</p><p>All other data (organellar purification and analysis of polysomes) appear state of the art and no corrections are required.</p><p>Significance</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>Taking all these efforts and data into account it is a very nice and interesting study that will certainly be of interest for a broader readership.

Nevertheless, we would suggest a comparison of the proportion of mitochondrial DNA sequenced from a total DNA sample (Namasivayam et al.) versus DNA obtained from the organelle enrichment protocol (Supplementary file 1).

We refined the R code for analyzing the block combinations by also considering block directionality. Furthermore we removed combinations of blocks with gaps or overlaps between the respective annotated blocks larger than 10 nucleotides. This removed the majority of lowly abundant block combinations. The heatmap presenting the results is now differently labeled and includes a legend for distinguishing between block orientations. Mp was merged to fragment B since no independent B fragment was observed in the dataset. We added a sentence in the capture of Figure 2—figure supplement 2 explaining the reasoning behind merging block B and Mp.

In any case, they should consider performing a comparative analysis between the proposed protocol and existing ones to determine its relative effectiveness. It should be noted that the proposed protocol enriches in organelles (including the nucleus and apicoplast), but when sequencing DNA, mitochondrial DNA accounts for only 5% of the total reads, which may raise doubts about its overall efficacy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this protocol. Since we based our protocol on Esseiva et al., we will not cite Lacombe et al. here. The modified Esseiva protocol allowed a 42 fold better coverage of mitochondrial genome sequences over previous efforts, which is all we asked for. We do not intend to focus here on methods development and comparisons and clearly should not have stressed novelty as we did. The method is now appropriately described and referenced in abstract, introduction, and results. Please see also our answer to your point #2.</p><p>Benzonase is 60 kDa and will move into the nucleus. And yes, the apicoplast will be co-enriched with mitochondria, which is however not an issue given the good coverage we get for mitochondrial DNA (and we wrote “leaving mitochondria and other organelles intact”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some points related to Results section:</p><p>12. Lines 113-115: 'To distinguish between NUMTs (nuclear DNA sequences that originated from mitochondria) and true mitochondrial sequences, it is necessary to enrich mitochondrial DNA.' I disagree with this sentence. NUMTs, in general, consist of very short sequences. With long reads, it is relatively straightforward to differentiate mitochondrial sequences from those nuclear sequences that have small mitochondrial fractions. In my opinion, even many Illumina reads can be confidently identified as belonging solely to the mitochondria. I found this article that supports this argument, indicating that the majority of NUMTs are less than 100 nucleotides in length [Reference: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37293002/].</p></disp-quote><p>According to the paper you cite, there are hundreds of NUMTs that are longer than 100 nt and thus pose potential problems for mis-mapping of Illumina reads. We believe it is therefore helpful to increase sequencing depth using enrichment of mitochondria and long reads to say with high confidence that the sequences are of mitochondrial origin. We are however agreeing that toning down our statement is appropriate given that Illumina read alone are also already allowing analyses of mitochondrial DNA long read sequencing. The phase now reads like this (line 116-118):</p><p>“To better distinguish between NUMTs (nuclear DNA sequences that originated from mitochondria) and true mitochondrial sequences, it is helpful to enrich mitochondrial DNA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Lines 166-168: 'A previous sequencing study used Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology (ONT) to identify combinations of sequence blocks in <italic>T. gondii</italic> mitochondria (Namasivayam et al. 2021).' However, it's important to note that Namasivayam's group did not merely use ONT to identify combinations of blocks; rather, they discovered, identified, and defined these combinations based on sequencing with long reads.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in our reply to your comment #4 (see above), we have discussed this directly with an author from Namasivayam et al. (2021) and have adjusted all our statements to adequately reference their work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

Line 205: &quot;All combinations are well covered in our ONT results and helped to refine</p><p>block borders relative to previous annotations (Figure S2)&quot; In the supplementary materials the authors say: &quot;However, the blocks Fp, Kp, and Mp frequently occur separately in the mitochondrial genome We therefore treated Fp, Kp and Mp as separate blocks and have shortened the blocks F, K and M accordingly&quot;.</p><p>As far as I understand, for this very reason, Namasivayam and collaborators annotate them as partial fragments, which may appear in other regions but are, in turn, parts of larger F, K, and M fragments. To redefine the segments F, K, and M without the sequences corresponding to Fp, Kp, and Mp, as shown in Figure S2, these fragments should be distinct from the 'partials.' In other words, segments of the type (F minus Fp), (K minus Kp), and (M minus Mp) should appear in the reads, and should be distinguishable from Fp, Kp, and Mp. If this distinction is made, I am satisfied with the new definition. However, if such a separation is not evident, it seems important to clarify it in the text or to reconsider this new definition.</p></disp-quote><p>Implied in the concept of sequence blocks are active recombination sites. Thus, the occurrence of Fp, Kp and Mp in other combinations than with (F minus Fp), (K minus Kp) and (M minus Mp) requires their definition as single, distinct blocks. Consequently, the remaining sequences (F minus Fp), (K minus Kp) and (M minus Mp) are also blocks, on the other site of the recombination point. This is similar to many other blocks in the genome. For example, in the case of blocks P and I, block I also does not occur in other combinations than with block P in the genome whereas block P does (in combination with block H). This justifies having blocks P and I as separate blocks, rather than having a combined block &quot;PI&quot; or defining a block Ip and I. In sum, our new annotations harmonize block definitions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. Lines 221-223: &quot;This suggests that there is no need to postulate mechanisms of genomic or posttranscriptional block shuffling to arrive at full-length open reading frames.&quot;</p><p>The authors argue that invoking mechanisms of genomic or post-transcriptional block shuffling is unnecessary to explain the presence of full-length open reading frames, given that genes represent 2-3% of mitochondrial sequences. However, there is a missing estimate regarding the probability of encountering all three genes within a single molecule or mitochondrial genome, as well as the total number of sequenced mitochondria. Consequently, the statement appears overly assertive. In the absence of alternative mechanisms for generating complete genes, this would mean that at most only 1646 mitochondrial genomes would have been sequenced.</p><p>To comprehensively address this issue, the authors should consider discussing this scenario further. They should also provide information about how many reads they found containing all three genes and how many contained two of the genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not think that the three ORFs need to be on one molecule since many mitochondria genomes are fragmented. Stochastic inheritance of a multi-copy genome can work just like strict inheritance of defined chromosomes. To address this is clearly beyond the scope of our work and would need controls for mitochondrial integrity and number during preparation that we simply do not have. But the numbers shown demonstrate that there are full-length ORFs and thus that it is most parsimonious to assume that this suffices to support mitochondrial gene expression.</p><p>Regarding the exact numbers that the reviewer would like to see:</p><p>We found 18 reads containing all three ORFs and 369 containing two different ORFs at least once.

An assembly of a Holo-genome is however not possible. Based on all sequencing efforts to date, we would hypothesize that the genome is represented by multiple DNA fragments. Still you are right that we could have mapped the RNA reads to the entire set of reads / read clusters. We would have had to disable selection against multi mapping reads and we would have the problem that nanopore reads have many sequencing errors. Therefore, we decided the cleaner and faster method is to map against a set of all block combinations found. The results should not differ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21.

While the proposed explanations for the presence of sRNAs at the 'block borders' appear plausible, it's worth noting that the definition of these blocks is artificial rather than biological. I think it is interesting to discuss without the concept of block sequences, but of sequences existing in the mitochondrial genome. Therefore, it's important to discuss whether these sequences (the block borders) are consistently present in all mitochondrial genomes. The total cumulative length of the blocks is 5.9 Kb, which is relatively small and comparable to one of the smallest mitochondrial genomes on record. It is conceivable that recombination and the generation of new sequences play a role in expanding genomic space for encoding, such as RNAs.</p></disp-quote><p>The blocks are defined by recombination events that are implied by sequence combinations found. Therefore, the block definition by Namasivayam et al. 2021 is based on biological processes and not arbitrary / artificial. We agree however with the reviewer that recombination increases the genomic space, in particular when comparing with mitogenomes from relatives like <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species. To account for this interesting idea, we added the following sentence to the discussion:</p><p>line 592-595:</p><p>“In fact, the sequences at recombination sites could be regarded as an expansion of the mitochondrial genome sequence space, which is not available to other Apicomplexans like the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22.

Follow-up small RNA-sequencing made it then possible to confirm the expression of fragmented mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (mt-rRNAs) and to identify a dozen new RNA species of unknown function. The authors document not only multiple <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> mitochondrial genes that overlap one another-including rRNA and protein-coding genes, otherwise a rare occurrence-but also show that some fragmented rRNA genes recombine, effectively leading to multifunctional sequence segments, another rare feature and consequence of the peculiar architecture of the organism's mitochondrial genome. Lastly, the authors confirm that products of three genes presumed to encode pieces of the highly fragmented mitochondrial large subunit (mtLSU) rRNA do indeed assemble-presumably with additional components-into large molecular-weight complex(es).</p><p>Major comments</p><p>Key conclusions of the manuscript are that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>'s mitogenome encodes overlapping rRNA and protein-coding genes, divergent and chimeric rRNA pieces, and several small RNAs (sRNAs) of unknown function. Provided evidence is very solid for certain aspects of the study, but objectionable for the others as detailed below.</p><p>1. The extent of the presented analysis of rRNAs and unassigned sRNAs seems lacking. In several places of the manuscript, the authors wonder about potential implications of divergent rRNA sequences, but their analyses appear to have been limited to sequence similarity searches. Had modelling of secondary structure interactions been attempted, this conundrum could potentially be solved. Importantly, similarity searches (to conventional rRNAs) were performed using BLASTN, which is a rather crude tool for the purpose, instead of covariance models/HMMs. It is therefore not entirely surprising that some sRNAs remained unassigned. Admittedly, recognizing rRNA motifs in divergent RNAs is a challenging issue. However, it is important to not conflate similarity to conventional rRNA and the molecule's functionality as an rRNA, i.e., sequence divergence does not necessarily disqualify the unassigned sRNAs as potential rRNAs. Mitochondrial rRNA sequences are among the most divergent, often constrained only by base-pairing, if at all, as has shown the research on kinetoplastid and diplonemid mt-rRNAs, which contain very few conserved elements and very few base pairs (e.g., Ramrath,2018,Science &amp; Valach,2023,NAR). Even in generally less divergent cases such as green algae, the fragment encoding a highly divergent and derived 5S-like rRNA has only been recognized as such only after the mitoribosome structures were determined (Waltz,2021,Nature Comm &amp; Tobiasson,2022,Nature Comm). It would not be surprising if the same was the case for <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>'s fairly quickly evolving mitochondrial genome.</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly did not want to imply that lack of sequence similarity rules out inclusion into a ribosome. Regarding structural analyses and more refined tools to identify similarities to rRNAs: we agree with the reviewer that such bioinformatic tools can only give tentative hints, no answers. We therefore opted for providing experimental evidence that several of the unassigned small RNAs are found in ribosomes (see extended Figure 6, new figures 7 and 8). We furthermore modified a statement on sRNA:rRNA sequence similarity and incorporated the citations suggested by the reviewer:</p><p>Line 339-343:</p><p>“None of the three RNAs had detectable homologies to rRNA based on simple sequence searches, but structural conservation cannot be ruled out. Mitochondrial rRNA sequences from kinetoplastids and diplonemids show very little sequence conservation but are still part of the mitoribosome (Valach et al. 2023; Ramrath et al. 2018), suggesting that future analyses might uncover hidden rRNA similarities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The discovery of overlapping protein-coding and rRNA genes is intriguing, but the authors do not explain why it should be considered as fundamentally groundbreaking as the 'Abstract' and 'Discussion' make it sound. Gene overlaps are found in mitochondria of many organisms (e.g., fungi, animals, various protists), especially of tRNA and protein-coding genes. Even in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, a rather close relative of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> studied in the presented work, LSUB (rRNA) gene overlaps cob (protein) gene in the antisense orientation. Admittedly, the extent of the overlaps in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> does seem fairly high at a first glance, but it is necessary to provide more data and, importantly, broader context to make the case that <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> overlaps are in any way special. For instance, what is the average size of the overlaps? What is their cumulative size? How does their extent (i.e., the size of overlapping coding sequences compared to the total length of coding sequences) compare to gene overlaps in other (mitochondrial) genomes?</p><p>Certain additional aspects of the analysis and interpretation of protein- and/or rRNA-coding sequence overlaps are somewhat underdeveloped. For example, are the RNA-coding regions that overlap protein-coding sequences more divergent in those three conserved proteins compared to other organisms, i.e., does their function as rRNA take precedence, or is the converse the truth, i.e., are the rRNA sections more divergent? RNA19 (overlapping coxIII and cob) is the only example discussed in depth, but at least a short sentence summarizing the overall picture would be useful. As for the authors' interpretations, proposed formation of sRNA:mRNA hybrids, through which sRNAs could by implicated in facilitating mRNA recognition by the mitoribosome, is an interesting hypothesis, but a simpler scenario, which is given very little space, is that the genes happen to overlap by chance and that the overlaps are merely a consequence of genome compaction (a phenomenon that the authors rightly highlight). Without a comprehensive analysis, it is impossible to conclude which possibility is more likely. For instance, if both protein-coding and non-protein-coding sequences are divergent, this would indicate that there are few evolutionary constraints and so the fact that these sequences overlap means very little and might be just due to neutral drift, an effect of genome compaction without much consequence for the organism.</p><p>Lastly, considerable significance is attributed in the study to the presence of antisense overlaps, especially between rRNA- (or sRNA-) and protein-coding genes. Yet, the overall extent of sense and antisense overlaps in the <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> mitogenome is quite similar, which-again-seems to point to a neutral evolutionary process. Can the authors elaborate if this aspect of the genome architecture was taken into account and if they regard it as of lesser relevance (and why, if so)?</p></disp-quote><p>We are at a loss why the reviewer thinks that we mark the mRNA-sRNA overlap as “groundbreaking”. This is not our wording and this is not our main finding. In the abstract, we write “we find that many small RNAs originated from the junction sites between protein-coding blocks and rRNA sequence blocks.“ In the discussion we write: “A few cases of mRNA sequences overlapping in antisense orientation with rRNA have been described in mammals and yeast (Kermekchiev and Ivanova 2001; Coelho et al. 2002). Sequences homologous to rRNAs have been found in many coding regions in sense and antisense orientation (Mauro and Edelman 1997). It has been suggested that this could link ribosome production to other cellular processes by reciprocal inhibition of mRNA and rRNA expression (Coelho et al. 2002). It is possible that <italic>RNA19</italic> and ribosome production could be balanced with <italic>cob</italic> protein production by tuning the processing or RNA degradation of <italic>cob</italic> mRNA.” We honestly do not feel that we overstated anything here and in fact we cite prior ideas on this phenomenon.</p><p>What we think is outstanding and novel is that there are small RNAs made at recombination sites and that these are functional – incorporated into ribosomes. We show this in our revision for several more sRNA examples in response to the helpful remarks by this reviewer – see below. The further news is that the block border sRNAs fuse mRNA and non-mRNA sequence, which is discussed in the snippet above for RNA19. Maybe we are ignorant and missed something, but where has it been demonstrated that a short RNA from a genomic recombination site that fuses coding and noncoding sequences is incorporated into ribosomes?</p><p>In sum, we do not think that extending the manuscript by analyzing the overlaps in greater detail adds anything to our prime conclusion: sRNAs at block borders are incorporated into ribosomes. But for the reviewers’ sake: there are 9 sites in sRNAs with overlap to mRNAs and other sRNAs, average size of overlaps: 20 nt, cumulative size overlaps: 176 nt, longest overlap: 49 nt (RNA1/2), shortest: 8 nt (RNA17/13). We doubt however that these numbers are interesting for the readers and would rather not include them in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another controversial issue concerns prevalent sequence block combinations and their impact on mitochondrial gene expression regulation. The authors postulate that 5′-terminal blocks of protein-coding genes always occurring near other protein-coding blocks has some functional significance. However, concluding this from just two cases (even if out of two) is quite speculative and seems like reading too much into a pattern that could very well be due to chance alone. The authors argue that the fact that 5′ ends of coxI &amp; coxIII genes overlap is another indication of potential gene expression coordination. While it is possible to envisage such a regulation because of the 5′ termini proximity, the overlap between these genes means that their connection is hardwired into the genome, making it difficult to compare this particular case to the other sequence blocks. Arguably, it is tempting to speculate that an evolutionary pressure exists to coordinate protein expression and such a coordination does not indeed seem implausible, but the presented data and arguments are not convincing. The authors should at least expand on their ideas in the 'Discussion' and indicate potential experiments and/or which additional data could support (or refute) their speculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a speculation and that we would need to suggest an experiment to address this. Possibly, this could be tested by mutagenizing the linker regions between coding regions. e.g. with TALEN-based genome editors, and monitoring whether there are joined effects on the expression of adjacent genes. However, this is not established for Apicomplexan mitochondria. So, on second thought, we deleted this paragraph from the discussion since we really do not want to distract from our main findings on sRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. My last major point concerns the experimental examination of large-molecular weight complexes and the interpretation of its results. To prove incorporation of the sRNAs into the mitoribosome, i.e., confirm that they do indeed represent rRNAs, the authors opted to investigate their distribution across a sucrose velocity gradient. This is a relatively simple and powerful approach and although it does not provide an irrevocable proof, it can be used to gain very useful insights. However, the presented design has critical flaws: 1) all sRNAs selected for Northern blot were mtLSU components, so only the mtLSU would be detected;</p></disp-quote><p>We now included two SSU rRNAs</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) a single cytosolic LSU component was used as the control, so the distribution of cyto-SSU subunit, cyto-ribosome, and cyto-polysomes is actually unclear;</p></disp-quote><p>We now purified organelles including a benzonase step, which removes the cytosolic rRNAs. Besides, we focused on the mitochondrial ribosomes and can draw conclusions on their positioning based on added controls (see below) in the absence of information on cytosolic ribosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) the authors' interpretation relies on the assumption that both mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes preserve their association as polysomes, but no relevant control is provided for this. For example, in Figure 6, fractions 6-14 clearly contain cyto-LSU, but polysomes (e.g., disomes) might just as well start in fractions 12-14; without additional controls, or at least continuous monitoring of UV absorbance across the gradient (to show a typical polysomal pattern), it is not guaranteed that what was detected actually included cyto-polysomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We now analyzed a total of seven RNAs under ribosome-dissociative conditions and see a strong shift in the sRNA signals towards lower molecular weight fractions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main concern, however, is the migration of mitoribosomes. First, the authors presume that the fractions 7-8 contain the mitochondrial monosomes because they are the fractions closest to the gradient top. This is not guaranteed. In fact, based on the experience of our and our colleagues' labs and taking into consideration the conditions used for the described experiment (more precisely, the use of Triton and deoxycholate, which in many organisms lead to mitoribosome subunit dissociation), it seems quite likely that fractions 7-9 actually contain separated mtLSU, not monosomes. Fractions in higher sucrose concentration would then represent monosomes and possibly assembly intermediates, though perhaps also a minor polysomal fraction (if the interactions are preserved in the conditions used). In particular, if the assembly process in Apicomplexa is as complex as in Euglenozoa (e.g., see papers on kinetoplastid mitoribosomes Saurer,2019,Science &amp; Tobiasson,2021,EMBO Journal), which does not seem unlikely in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> given the necessity to incorporate ~15 distinct rRNA pieces per mitoribosomal subunit, then the assembly intermediates might form ribonucleoprotein complexes that migrate quite far into a sucrose gradient (e.g., as in kinetoplastid mtSSU, Maslov,2007,Mol Biol Parasit). Thus, while it can be reasonably well argued that the detected RNAs co-migrate with the mtLSU (and possibly mito-monosome), the claim that they associate with mito-polysomes is open to question. More critically, investigating only sRNAs that are clearly identifiable as rRNA pieces-and all from the mtLSU at that-does not automatically prove that all sRNAs associate with the mitoribosome.</p><p>To argue that the unassigned sRNAs are associated with mitoribosomes, northern blots of as many as possible (but at the very least one) unassigned sRNAs are absolutely necessary. However, I encourage the authors to consider performing additional experiments to address the issues raised in the preceding paragraph: for example, a western blot of mitochondrial ribosomal protein(s), a northern blot with at least one mtSSU rRNA fragment (since all three shown are from mtLSU), as well as a test that would examine the influence of detergents on mitoribosome stability (e.g., use milder detergents such as digitonin or dodecylmaltoside). Furthermore, if experimental conditions are identified allowing subunit dissociation, it would be possible to discern to which subunit which sRNA belongs and, importantly, whether the unassigned sRNAs are just &quot;disguised&quot; rRNAs (simplest explanation) or something completely different (speculative explanation seemingly favoured by the authors). All this would substantially boost the significance of the presented work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these thoughtful comments and the many helpful suggestions. Following the reviewer's advice, we have opted for analyzing a total of seven sRNAs, including two RNAs assigned to the small subunit and one RNA not described to share homology with <italic>E. coli</italic> rRNA. Importantly, we included an analysis using standard dissociative conditions (10mM EDTA, no Mg, 300 mM K) for all sRNAs. Finally, we also include an analysis of the three mRNAs and one mitoribosomal protein. We have furthermore used mitochondrial preparations as starting material, which has the advantage of fewer cross-hybridizations and better detectability of sRNAs in general.</p><p>This demonstrated:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>High molecular weight complexes deep in the gradient are sensitive to EDTA treatment.

Did the authors test other <italic>T. gondii</italic> strains? What about other apicomplexan species? Unless this has been done, there is no demonstration that the block order and block-joining frequencies documented here are (more or less) constant and that block order is under some kind of purifying selection. Hence, the conclusion that the block borders are not random is debatable. Arguably, it is not random in this particular experiment, but neither is it limited to specific blocks because most combinations have been detected (even if at low frequency; Figure S1).</p></disp-quote><p>After revisiting the analysis and excluding falsely identified block combinations separated by more than 10 un-annotated nucleotides, we arrive at a much clearer distribution of block combinations. This distribution is evidently non-random, confined to specific blocks. As depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, only a minority of block combinations appears more than 50 times in our dataset. Supplementary file 4, encompassing both infrequently occurring and potentially falsely identified combinations, further substantiates the notion that block combinations are not randomly distributed.</p><p>We also would like to stress that the two other attempts at sequencing the mitogenome of <italic>T. gondii</italic> found the same block combinations, although the composition of individual reads differed (Namasivayam et al. 2021; Berna et al. 2021). Thus, block combinations are not random.</p><p>A straightforward thought experiment underscores this point: in the case of random combinations, all 24 blocks would theoretically pair head-to-head, head-to-tail, and tail-to-tail with every other block, resulting in (24*2)<sup>2</sup> = 2304 unique two-block combinations. However, even without filtering, we identified only 84 different combinations (see Supplementary file 4), with 32 of these appearing only once and 52 appearing less than 50 times in a total of 284,679 pairs.</p><p>We adjusted statements in the manuscript based on our revised analysis:</p><p>Line 202-204:</p><p>“For example, the most frequent block combination is J-B, which occurs 19,622 times in our reads. In total we identified 84 combinations of which 52 occur less than fifty times and make up less than 0.06% of the total number of combinations found (Supplementary file 4).”</p><p>Furthermore we found a mistake in the number of high-frequency block combinations found and corrected it.</p><p>Line 213-214:</p><p>“Using the 32 high-frequency block combinations we found, we generated a map centered on the protein-coding genes (Figure 2B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l. 450: &quot;One intriguing finding is the obligate linkage of coding sequences&quot; – Presuming this sentence is about protein-coding sequences, this should be reformulated because it mis-represents the actual data.

Clearly, the discovery of the 15 sRNAs was facilitated by the recognition of block order, but the presented argument is a bit confusing: how does the organization into blocks provide an &quot;advantage&quot; and what kind of advantage do the authors mean? (An evolutionary advantage or an advantage related to gene expression regulation or an advantage for their sRNA-Seq data mapping?)</p></disp-quote><p>The idea of an advantage was raised since the block organization can lead to the expression of two alternative RNAs and thus could increase the number of RNA species and novel evolutionary options. However, since this is difficult to understand in this introductory sentence and will be explained below, we deleted the phrase:</p><p>Line 582:</p><p>Our small RNA sequencing results revealed that 15 small RNAs span block borders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l. 462-478: Multiple explanations are provided for the existence of sRNAs at block borders and what these sRNAs represent. While I agree that it is important to consider all options, even the more debatable ones, the authors seem to forget the simplest possibility: the identified unassigned sRNAs could well be rRNA pieces and them being encoded across block borders is not any more, nor any less surprising than the fact that protein-coding genes are encoded across (several) gene blocks.</p></disp-quote><p>There is a conceptual difference between a long mRNA spread across several blocks (and thus also block borders) and a biased distribution of short RNAs to block borders. The short RNAs could also have been positioned elsewhere – being short, they could all be located inside blocks, sense or antisense to coding regions or other non-coding RNAs. But almost half of all RNAs are positioned at block borders. This asks for an explanation, which we discuss here.</p><p>Regarding the idea that the sRNAs are rRNA fragments: yes, we agree and had not excluded that. We provide now experimental evidence that many sRNAs, including block-border sRNAs are part of ribosomes. We added the following sentence and discussed this in greater detail in the last chapter of the discussion.</p><p>Line 625-626:</p><p>“Regarding their function, many, if not all, of the sRNAs at block borders could be used in ribosomes as rRNA fragments, which is discussed in the next chapter.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>l. 485: &quot;antisense RNA surveillance&quot; – In contrast to the nuclei, the existence of a genuine antisense RNA &quot;surveillance&quot; mechanism in mitochondria is uncertain. Given what is known from mitochondria of other organisms (especially plants and kinetoplastids), it seems more likely that certain regions of sense and antisense transcripts are protected from exonucleases by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs such as PPR and related helix-turn-helix repeat proteins, e.g., <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>'s homologs HPRs discovered in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> [Hillebrand,2018,NAR]), leading to RNAs that partially overlap, but are actually protected from base-pairing by these RBPs. This is not taken into account in any presented explanation of the phenomenon of antisense gene overlaps.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no accumulation of RNA antisense to rRNAs and mRNAs.

However, being at a crossroad of genomics, evolution, and molecular biology, it has certain limitations in its current form, mainly because the evolutionary and molecular biology aspects would benefit from further development (see 'Major concerns'). The text is generally well written and accompanying figures well designed, but clarifications, broader context, and less speculative interpretation would be welcome (as detailed mostly in 'Minor concerns'). To justify publication in a journal with a broad readership, the authors should provide additional experimental evidence to strengthen their case and generalize their findings.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
