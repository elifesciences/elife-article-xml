The cystic fibrosis (CF) lung consists of a complex environment where microbes, living as polymicrobial biofilm-like communities, are associated with negative clinical outcomes for persons with CF (pwCF). However, the current lack of in vitro models integrating the microbial diversity observed in the CF airway hampers our understanding of why polymicrobial communities are recalcitrant to therapy in this disease. Here, integrating computational approaches informed by clinical data, we built a mixed community of clinical relevance to the CF lung composed of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella melaninogenica</italic>. We developed and validated this model biofilm community with multiple isolates of these four genera. When challenged with tobramycin, a front-line antimicrobial used to treat pwCF, the microorganisms in the polymicrobial community show altered sensitivity to this antibiotic compared to monospecies biofilms. We observed that wild-type <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is sensitized to tobramycin in a mixed community versus monoculture, and this observation holds across a range of community relative abundances. We also report that LasR loss-of-function, a variant frequently detected in the CF airway, drives tolerance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to tobramycin specifically in the mixed community. Our data suggest that the molecular basis of this community-specific recalcitrance to tobramycin for the <italic>P. aeruginosa lasR</italic> mutant is increased production of phenazines. Our work supports the importance of studying a clinically relevant model of polymicrobial biofilms to understand community-specific traits relevant to infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>polymicrobial interactions</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>antimicrobial tolerance</kwd><kwd>phenazines</kwd><kwd><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JEAN21F0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jean-Pierre</surname><given-names>Fabrice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI155424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Toole</surname><given-names>George A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-142466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Déziel</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5 P20 GM130454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HOGAN19G0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Deborah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-DK117469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Deborah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Research Development Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STANTO19R0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hogan</surname><given-names>Deborah A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome-informed in vitro polymicrobial system allows for a mechanistic understanding of community-specific tolerance of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> to a front-line CF antimicrobial.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The disconnect between in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and clinical response poses a significant threat to the eradication of mixed microbial communities observed in human infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lebeaux et al., 2014</xref>). That is, while minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays are widely used to guide clinical intervention by determining the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of pathogenic species, such approaches often fail to resolve chronic, polymicrobial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orazi and O’Toole, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waters et al., 2019</xref>). Studies published several decades ago documented that microbe-microbe interactions can drive shifts in antimicrobial susceptibility profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Linn and Szabo, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shahidi and Ellner, 1969</xref>). Thus, antibiotics effective at killing a single microorganism in vitro may be ineffective against the same microbe when grown in the context of a polymicrobial infection. More recent studies provide some insight as to the mechanisms driving resistance and tolerance (also referred to as recalcitrance or resilience) toward antimicrobials in the context of mixed-species infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaudoin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bottery et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Brien et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orazi and O’Toole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>). These mechanisms include (but are not limited to) the production of metabolites altering microbial physiology, horizontal gene transfer of genetic material, and passive protection by the production of shared ‘public goods’, such as β-lactamases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orazi and O’Toole, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vandeplassche et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, both culture-based and culture-independent studies have indicated that chronic cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections are characterized by the presence of numerous microbial taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">O’Sullivan and Freedman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O’Toole, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogers et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Surette, 2014</xref>). The clinical relevance of such mixed communities is highlighted by the observations that co-occurrence of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> alters the antimicrobial susceptibility of the latter organism and worsens CF lung disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orazi and O’Toole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Limoli et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, antibiotics effective against pathogens such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in classic in vitro MIC assays show limited clinical efficacy, as indicated by the inability of tobramycin to clear this microorganism from the CF airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ramsey et al., 1999</xref>). Indeed, a recent report recommends abandoning MIC testing for microorganisms isolated from CF airway infections as their predictive value for a positive treatment outcome is not supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waters et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The pathogenesis of mixed-species infections in the CF airway is still poorly understood, but it is now appreciated that distinct community types can impact clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Widder et al., 2022</xref>). However, one of the current missing links allowing for the translation of microbiome-informed studies back to the clinic is the establishment of in vitro mixed-community models that can be used to understand community function(s) of CF pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jean-Pierre et al., 2021</xref>). That is, although some CF-relevant model communities have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orazi and O’Toole, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orazi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Flynn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Flynn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vandeplassche et al., 2020</xref>), they (i) do not entirely reflect the polymicrobial nature of the CF airway and/or (ii) do not utilize in vitro conditions recapitulating the nutritional milieu and/or biofilm-like growth observed in the CF lung. Thus, there is a pressing need for the development of clinically informed, in vitro polymicrobial communities to probe the molecular mechanism(s) governing microbial interactions, particularly in regard to the responsiveness to antimicrobial agents.</p><p>The aims of this study were fourfold: (i) to leverage large, existing microbiome data sets and their associated clinical metadata to inform and develop a clinically relevant and tractable in vitro model of the polymicrobial communities found in the CF airway, (ii) to identify community-specific phenotypes, (iii) to test this in vitro model system against the most common front-line CF antimicrobial, tobramycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 2021</xref>), and (iv) to provide a mechanistic understanding whereby community composition can impact tobramycin responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Using computational approaches to identify community types found in the CF airway</title><p>We sought to exploit available 16S rRNA gene amplicon library sequencing data and associated clinical metadata to identify a representative set of microbial communities found in persons with CF (pwCF) that we could model in vitro. A recent study from our team using k-means to cluster 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing relative abundance values and another machine learning approach (e.g. the gap statistic) identified five microbial community clusters as the most parsimonious number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>). This same study revealed, following the analysis of a large cross-sectional 16S rRNA gene sequence data set and associated metadata, that the five community types explained 24% of variability in lung function, twice as high as any other factor or group of factors previously identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, two different approaches, using clinical data, identified five similar community types.</p><p>Of these five communities, two were dominated by a single microbial taxa: <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (designated the ‘Pa.D’ community) and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (Strep.D); these communities included 73/167 (~43%) of the analyzed samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>). Several <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-focused CF studies make it clear that specifically targeting this pathogen does not translate to positive clinical outcomes in pwCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heirali et al., 2017</xref>), and there has already been a substantial focus on the study of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in monoculture in the context of CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malhotra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, we deemed that in vitro modeling of a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-dominated community would not allow us to probe unknown/novel factors driving chronic CF lung disease. Furthermore, while the presence of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. may influence CF airway health, the clinical relevance of this microbe in CF is still a matter of active research, and this genus is associated with both worsened and improved clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scott and O’Toole, 2019</xref>). We identified a third cluster designated Oth.D, for ‘other’; this cluster was composed of samples from pwCF whose lung microbiota were dominated by less-common, individual genera including <italic>Stenotrophomonas</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, and <italic>Achromobacter</italic>. Based on these factors, we decided to focus on two community types identified in the study cited above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>), which are composed of various microbial taxa (Pa.M1/Pa.M2; which we refer to as ‘mixed’). The Pa.M1 and Pa.M2 mixed communities represented ~34% of the analyzed samples in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henson et al., 2019</xref>), we performed metabolic flux analyses of the various community types to identify the top predicted exchanged metabolites driving the abundances of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella melaninogenica</italic> by using their known relative 16S rRNA gene abundance detected in the Pa.M1/Pa.M2, Pa.D, and Strep.D communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Using this approach, we noted multiple similarities between the predicted metabolic fluxes of Pa.M1 and Pa.M2 that distinguished these communities from the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>- and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>-dominated communities, for example, the fluxes of ethanol, lactate, and acetate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, as the predicted metabolic fluxes between Pa.M1 and Pa.M2 were similar, we considered these two mixed communities as functionally similar and decided to focus on the development of a single ‘mixed’ community model.</p><p>Next, we sought to identify a limited number of community members to model as a tractable in vitro mixed community. We noted that 10 microbial taxa achieved relatively high abundance and prevalence across the five identified community types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). From among these taxa, we decided to focus on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. as members of our model mixed community for the following reasons: (i) <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. are important in shaping health outcomes in pwCF based on studies using culture-dependent and -independent approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Malhotra et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filkins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamoureux et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sibley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thornton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ulrich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waters and LiPuma, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zemanick et al., 2013</xref>). (ii) Additional studies provide evidence of the potential for two or more of these microorganisms found together in the CF airway to lead to worsened clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Limoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Limoli and Hoffman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sherrard et al., 2016</xref>). (iii) Imaging studies of sputum have shown evidence for a subset of these microbes being in close physical proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DePas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 2021</xref>). (iv) Assessing the fraction of 16S rRNA reads across the data sets analyzed by Hampton, O’Toole, and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella</italic> were among the top 10 microbial taxa detected in the CF airway with relative abundances of 35, 3, 20, and 13% and prevalence rates of 70, 50, 90, and 80%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, red box). (v) In 103 of the 167 (~62%) patient samples analyzed by Hampton, O’Toole, and colleagues, &gt;70% of 16S rRNA gene reads were assigned to <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and <italic>Prevotella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>); another 30 samples contained at least 50% of the reads assigned to these four genera. Including the next most abundant and prevalent genera such as <italic>Burkholderia</italic> or <italic>Achromobacter</italic> as a fifth member of the mixed community would only marginally increase (by ~6%) the number of patient samples covered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Furthermore, the average abundance of <italic>Burkholderia</italic> was skewed by a relatively small number of pwCF in our cohort that were dominated by this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>). (vi) Finally, work published by our group using metabolic modeling indicates that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> are top contributors of cross-fed metabolites in communities detected in the CF lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henson et al., 2019</xref>). That is, the abundance of these four genera in the CF airway could be explained by predicted metabolic cross-feeding among these four microorganisms.

First, the yield of monospecies biofilm populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> was higher than planktonically grown cells, while the opposite was observed for <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the observed productivity in the mixed planktonic community (denoted as ‘Mix (P) – Observed’) was lower than the theoretical productivity (i.e. assuming additivity of the CFU/mL yield counts of each species in the community, denoted as ‘Mix (P) – Theoretical’), suggesting antagonism among the different species grown in these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, examining the yield of the observed mixed biofilm and planktonic populations (both denoted as ‘Mix (P/B) – Observed’) revealed that the productivity of the mixed biofilm is higher than that of the planktonic community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). There was no statistically significant difference in the yield of observed and theoretical mixed biofilm communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, taking a closer look at the productivity of each species in the observed mixed community revealed that there is a trend wherein <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> have lower productivity in the mixed biofilm versus monoculture (p=0.67; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scott et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stoner et al., 2022</xref>), <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. showed decreased and increased growth, respectively, in the mixed community versus monoculture. While other studies have demonstrated that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-secreted exoproducts can eradicate <italic>S. aureus</italic> in co-culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Limoli et al., 2017</xref>), we could maintain <italic>S. aureus</italic> viability in the mixed community for up to 14 days under the CF-like conditions used here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6B</xref>). Thus, the observations in our polymicrobial community mirror the capacity of these two pathogens to co-exist in the CF airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Camus et al., 2021</xref>). Also, we ruled out the possibility of remaining oxygen in ASM negatively impacting the viability of <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> by reproducing our results using an anoxic chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). That is, we observed that <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> can robustly grow as a planktonic or biofilm monospecies community in a medium capable of sustaining its growth (PGM), while this microbe fails to grow in ASM in monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we argue that the mixed-community-specific growth of <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. we observed across several conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>) is not due to depletion of residual oxygen.</p><p>A major hurdle in the eradication of microbial communities detected in the CF airway is their resilience to front-line CF antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orazi and O’Toole, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vandeplassche et al., 2019</xref>). That is, while pathogens tested in monoculture demonstrate sensitivity to several antimicrobial classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orazi and O’Toole, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vandeplassche et al., 2019</xref>), these findings do not translate to improved outcomes in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heirali et al., 2017</xref>). For example, a recent report shows that current testing methods fail to predict outcomes in pwCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Waters et al., 2019</xref>). By modeling a polymicrobial community of six frequently encountered pathogens in the CF lung, Vandeplassche and colleagues compared the impact of several CF drugs on microbes grown as monocultures versus in a mixed community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vandeplassche et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, no shifts in sensitivities of any of the microorganisms were observed. These results could perhaps be explained by the differences in experimental conditions as Vandeplassche and colleagues used a rich medium, and incubations were performed under normoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vandeplassche et al., 2020</xref>). However, we acknowledge that the work of Vandeplassche and colleagues represents an important first step in tackling the impact of microbial interactions on antimicrobial susceptibility of CF pathogens.</p><p>Using more ‘CF-like’ experimental conditions informed by existing clinical data sets, we sought to test the hypothesis that growth in a mixed community would shift the sensitivity of CF microorganisms versus growth as monocultures. We focused on the front-line CF antimicrobial tobramycin as (i) this drug is the most heavily prescribed therapeutic to treat chronic CF lung infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, 2021</xref>) but (ii) often does not eradicate pathogens (especially <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>) from the airways of pwCF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). Using our system, we made several observations. First, almost all tested <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. strains were protected from tobramycin-mediated killing in the mixed community versus monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In a recently published study, Murray and colleagues observed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> can be protected from tobramycin eradication in the presence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murray et al., 2022</xref>), but this protection was abolished in the presence of a PQS operon inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murray et al., 2022</xref>). Inactivation of the MvfR regulator, which controls the expression of the PQS operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Déziel et al., 2005</xref>), did not sensitize <italic>S. aureus</italic> to tobramycin under our experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that other mechanisms might be driving this phenotype in our system. Furthermore, the observed increased tobramycin resilience of <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. in a polymicrobial environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) is in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Price et al., 2016</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to identify the community-specific recalcitrance mechanisms employed by <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp.</p><p>The decrease in the viability of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a tobramycin-treated community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>) was unexpected. Recent culture-independent studies investigating the impact of tobramycin in pwCF do not show any appreciable decrease in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> after extended exposure to this antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2020</xref>). These results prompted us to interrogate the molecular mechanisms driving this increased sensitivity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to tobramycin in the community. We observed biofilm-specific tolerance of a Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant grown in the mixed community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), a result repeated with two phenotypically LasR-defective CF clinical isolate variants (AMT0101-1-1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and SMC1595 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Given that not all <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains exhibited increased sensitivity in the mixed community, some strains may carry mutations in other pathways conferring tolerance to tobramycin in the mixed community. Indeed, clinical <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> isolates can accumulate mutations including in the negative regulator MexZ, driving multidrug resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We observed that phenazines mediate the community tolerance of the Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant and can induce tolerance of WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Our rationale for testing the impact of these redox-active compounds in our system is supported by reports highlighting the capacity of these molecules to drive <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> drug tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meirelles et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schiessl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Also, strains lacking LasR function are known to overproduce phenazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groleau et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mould et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cugini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cabeen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dekimpe and Déziel, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the highest levels of phenazine production by the Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant were observed in the mixed community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PCA production of WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown in the mixed community was not statistically significantly different from the concentration detected in monospecies biofilm, while the Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant did show a significant, twofold increase in PCA production in the community compared to the monoculture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The mechanistic basis for the difference between the WT and Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant production of PCA in the mixed community is the subject of ongoing work. Finally, while we do see a role of phenazines in conferring tolerance, we acknowledge that other LasR-regulated factors may also contribute to this phenotype.</p><p>While the approaches used here have allowed us to explore community function, we acknowledge certain limitations to this study. First, while we provide a rationale for the selection of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> for use in our mixed community system, it is fair to ask, ‘is four enough?’ While the four microorganisms we have selected are a reasonable start, the model could be further improved by including additional CF-relevant species. However, adding pathogens such as <italic>Burkholderia</italic> or <italic>Achromobacter</italic> does not markedly increase the number of pwCF captured by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Furthermore, while the in vitro polymicrobial model does not perfectly match the Pa.M1 and Pa.M2 mixed community compositions detected in the CF airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>), the abundances of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, and <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> all fall within the clinical range detected in these communities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). More importantly, the increased sensitivity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to tobramycin treatment in the mixed community could be observed for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> co-cultivated over a 1000-fold range of the other microbial partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These in vitro observations confirm the importance of studying microbes in the context of mixed-species communities but also suggest that the ratio of microbial partners relative to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population can vary with similar observed phenotypes.</p><p>Finally, we argue that this novel in vitro polymicrobial system will serve as a resource for the research community to probe novel community functions ranging from persistence to virulence and also for understanding the impact of host factors such as immune cells and host-derived metabolites. As such, all strains and protocols will be made freely available upon request, and we are happy to assist other groups in the implementation of this system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial strains and culture conditions</title><p>All the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp., and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> cultures were grown in Tryptic soy broth (TSB) with shaking at 37°C. <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. cultures were grown in TSB supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract (YE), 5 µg/mL hemin, 2.85 mM L-cysteine hydrochloride, and 1 µg/mL menadione (PGM). <italic>Streptococcus</italic> spp. cultures were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with 0.5% YE (THY) at 37°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

Briefly, reads from sputum samples from 167 clinically stable subjects aged 8–69 from 14 CF centers in the United States and Europe were assigned to bacterial taxa at the genus level. Applying a gap statistic to unsupervised k-means clustering of Bray-Curtis distance of these 167 subject samples suggested that five community types best represented differences between the 167 subjects as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hampton et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we have used this compendium of taxonomically assigned reads from 167 pwCF to assess how many distinct genera, which ones, are required to capture 70% or more of taxonomically assigned 16S rRNA reads in each subject.

SteadyCom performs community flux balance analysis by computing the maximal community growth while ensuring that all metabolites are properly balanced within each species and across the community. SteadyCom provides the capability to constrain the relative abundance of each species in the community to determine the main interspecies metabolic interactions. This simulation method is based on several simplifying assumptions, including spatial homogeneity and that all propagating species have the same growth rate at steady state. Outputs of each SteadyCom simulation included the community growth rate and species-dependent uptake and secretion rates of each extracellular metabolite. Model parameters, such as constraints in metabolite uptake rates, were taken from previous work modeling CF airway communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henson et al., 2019</xref>). Four independent simulations, corresponding to the species abundances in the community types found to explain the variability in lung function, were performed. We calculated the relative abundance between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic>, <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic> within each community type, while ignoring remaining species. The simulations were then used to determine the main metabolites exchanged between the four species.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Community composition shapes microbial-specific phenotypes in a cystic fibrosis polymicrobial model system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Arturo Casadevall as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William DePas (Reviewer #2); Robert Quinn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further justification is required for why the authors jump to phenazine production as the singular lasR-associated phenotype they pursue. Details of phenazine experiments should be expanded.</p><p>2) There is a missed opportunity to analyze how interactions between species influence the productivity of each species and the greater community, with methods provided by one reviewer.</p><p>3) The methods for oxygen exposure during experiments and their effects require more clarity, particularly focusing on how it affects antibiotic tolerance and Prevotella growth in monoculture</p><p>4) The diluted mixed community experiment should be repeated to ensure reproducibility</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>L174-187 The difference in yield between biofilm and planktonic cultures is interesting. More interesting, and not explored, is how cultivation methods change the interactions between these species. With measures of growth yield from each of the species in monoculture at a given time point, and estimates of the numbers of each species in the inoculum, you can calculate how interactions between species influence the productivity of each species and the community as a whole. These calculations are important for a broader understanding of the community ecology of the model system and provide a baseline for further manipulations in the paper, eg following TOB treatment. This approach is detailed in Poltak and Cooper ISMEJ 2011 and is based on Loreau and Hector Nature 2002. I encourage the authors to analyze data using these equations to report realized productivity in mixture – who are the winners and losers of mixture, and how do these changes depend on cultural context? The way the data are currently presented in the figures makes these inferences nearly impossible.</p><p>TOB sensitivity in monoculture vs mixed culture: the reported changes are interesting and the results that lasR mutants influence susceptibility reasonable. However, the methods don't provide sufficient context for the reported findings and leave me wondering about intermediate ratios of strains, whether these changes require cells or merely supernatant, etc. This is fundamentally a methods development paper and these specific methods deserve further attention.</p><p>Re: lasR, please describe some other plausible reasons why lasR could have influenced TOB sensitivity other than phenazines. This section immediately jumps to these compounds as the cause of altered sensitivity and considers no other possible causes, which is problematic for such a pleiotropic regulator.</p><p>Reproducibility and sharing: cultivation and testing of this CF-relevant microbial community are presumably designed to be a resource for the community. Thus, a short statement in the main text describing the potential and limitations for sharing these resources would be a strength, beyond the standard availability statements in the supplementary material.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is extremely interesting and, in my opinion, very valuable for infectious disease microbiologists and likely the broader microbiology field. My major concerns are related to the weaknesses identified in the public review.</p><p>1) How do your findings that phenazines can be protective against tobramycin tie in to your original observation that WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> becomes susceptible to tobramycin in mixed communities? Figure 4 seems to indicate that WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> makes more PCA in the mixed community than in a monospecies biofilm. Shouldn't that increase confer increased protection against tobramycin? Is that difference not significant? Is increased susceptibility possibly due to a decrease in a different type of phenazine? Even if phenazine production is not decreased in WT in the mixed biofilm community compared to monospecies biofilms, that result should be explicitly discussed.</p><p>2) Are you exposing cells to oxygen when changing the medium and when exposing cells to tobramycin? If so, how would you expect that to impact tolerance?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1 c really adds nothing to the study. It needs to be more detailed to be useful.</p><p>– The metabolic flux analysis is poorly explained. Why would one expect the abundance of the organism to affect the metabolic flux? Is this not more of a binary analysis? It is unclear why this was done. For example, the wording 'multiple similarities' and 'distinguish' is very confusing. Can this be quantified?</p><p>– The decision to use a single 'mixed community model' is not well supported. This modeling aspect of the manuscript suffers from clarity and reasoning behind the approach.</p><p>– In fact lines 132-148 set a much better rationale for choosing these organisms, they are abundant and prevalent seems to make enough sense to me.</p><p>– Figure 1 supplement 3 is confusing. There are many bar graphs shown for the clinical strains, but the figure legend doesn't explain well what is being shown. Can this be better explained? This is an important experiment because the use of laboratory strains was peculiar after all the rationale for choosing the bacteria from people with CF.</p><p>– Figure 1 supplement 2B. It would be useful to show the variation in the experiment instead of a single point. Looking at the source data, the replicates are quite reproducible. This is important information for the reader and those trying to work on similar experiments to know that it is quite reproducible.</p><p>– The use of anaerobic culture conditions is of interest, especially with all of the pre-preparation of the cultures described in the methods. Were the washing and resuspending of cells done in anaerobic conditions? Might this explain the lack of growth of Prevotella spp. It is not clear if these preparations were done anaerobically. If Prevotella cultures are prepared and cultured in ASM anaerobically does the microbe grow? Or is it missing nutrients in ASM?</p><p>– Why was treating <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> alone with tobramycin and finding a reduction in planktonic growth surprising? It is an antibiotic after all.</p><p>– A recent experiment with sputum cultures in ASM as model communities shows that outcomes of competition in CF microbiome were driven by pH (Ghuneim et al. ISMEJ. 2022). The authors mention that they added MOPS to their cultures, can they comment on how this might affect competition and antibiotic outcomes in light of this similar manuscript?</p><p>– Figure 2 supplement 1, the 1000x diluted cultures of other bacteria with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> exposed to tobramycin has a very large error bar. I believe three technical replicates were performed, but only two points can be seen. Can this be explained? Repeated?</p><p>– Line 247 again brings up the question of whether the inability to culture Prevotella is due to not preparing in robust anaerobic conditions. This should be tested and shown.</p><p>– The pre-incubation with microbial supernatants does not preclude microbial inactivation as responsible for the increased killing.

Furthermore, as the inactivation of the <italic>mvfR</italic> gene in a Δ<italic>lasR</italic> background rescued tobramycin sensitivity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a polymicrobial environment (Figure 3D), and the MvfR-PQS system is crucial for phenazines production (3, 4), we hypothesized that these molecules might be overproduced in the mixed community, thereby conferring tolerance to the Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant. That is, phenazines have previously been shown to drive tolerance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to various drug classes, including aminoglycosides (5-7). For example, Schiessl and colleagues observed that inactivating phenazine production results in increased sensitivity of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> to tobramycin (6). Moreover, it has been reported that inactivation of the <italic>lasR</italic> gene drives overproduction of phenazines in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (8), thus further suggesting a pivotal role of these redox-active molecules in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> tobramycin tolerance in our experimental conditions. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying the precursor molecule phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) produced by wild-type and associated mutants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown as monospecies and mixed biofilm communities. Confirming our hypothesis, we measured significantly higher PCA levels in the mixed community containing the Δ<italic>lasR</italic> mutant when compared to WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Figure 4A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a missed opportunity to analyze how interactions between species influence the productivity of each species and the greater community, with methods provided by one reviewer.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that this type of analysis would be a good addition to the manuscript. We have added the productivity analyses to the paper (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3) and added the following paragraph at lines 206–228:</p><p>“Calculating the theoretical productivity (or yield) of each microorganism grown as planktonic or biofilm monospecies or as mixed communities, as defined using a reported method (9), and comparing these values to the experimentally determined populations revealed several interesting findings (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3). First, the yield of monospecies biofilm populations of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> was higher than planktonically-grown cells, while the opposite was observed for <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A). Furthermore, the observed productivity in the mixed planktonic community (denoted as “Mix (P) – Observed”) was lower than the theoretical productivity (i.e. assuming additivity of the CFU/mL yield counts of each species in the community, denoted as “Mix (P) – Theoretical”), suggesting antagonism among the different species grown in these conditions (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A). Interestingly, examining the yield of the observed mixed biofilm and planktonic populations (both denoted as “Mix (P/B) – Observed”) revealed that the productivity of the mixed biofilm is higher than that of the planktonic community (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A). There was no statistically significant difference in the yield of observed and theoretical mixed biofilm communities (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3A). However, taking a closer look at the productivity of each species in the observed mixed community revealed that there is a trend wherein <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> have lower productivity in the mixed biofilm versus monoculture (P = 0.67) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3B). On the other hand, <italic>S. sanguinis</italic> showed a statistically significant increase in productivity in a mixed biofilm community compared to the monospecies biofilm (P = 0.03) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3B). Overall, these data indicate a complex relationship among the microbes in the community, which varies depending on whether they are growing planktonically or in a biofilm.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The methods for oxygen exposure during experiments and their effects require more clarity, particularly focusing on how it affects antibiotic tolerance and Prevotella growth in monoculture</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have integrated additional figures and associated text in the manuscript confirming that anoxic conditions were used. That is, we used an anoxic environmental chamber (10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 10% H<sub>2</sub>, 80% N<sub>2</sub>) for all steps in the experiment (thus the cultures were never exposed to oxygen), confirming that: (i) <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> does not grow in ASM in monoculture, while as a positive control, we show it does grow when using a rich medium that has been reported previously to support its growth (10) (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2) and (ii) our observed changes in tobramycin susceptibility can be reproduced using the anoxic environmental chamber (Figure 2 —figure supplement 7). Taken together, these data indicate that our methods presented in the original manuscript (GasPak + anaerobic jar system) can rigorously and reproducibly recapitulate findings obtained in a controlled anoxic environment. The modifications to the revised manuscript are as follows:</p><p>Lines 198–204: “The impact of residual oxygen negatively influencing the growth of <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> in monoculture was ruled out by performing these experiments using an anoxic environmental chamber (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2).

That is, we observed that <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> can robustly grow as a planktonic or biofilm monospecies community in a medium capable of sustaining its growth (PGM) while this microbe fails to grow in ASM (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2). Thus, we argue that the mixed-community-specific growth of <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. we observed across several conditions (Figure 1C, Figure 1 —figure supplement 5, Figure 2 —figure supplement 6) is not due to residual oxygen.”</p><p>Lines 290–293: “Growing and replenishing the preformed biofilm communities with fresh ASM supplemented or not with tobramycin using an anoxic environmental chamber resulted in similar phenotypes for all tested microorganisms (Figure 2 —figure supplement 7), indicating that the use of the GasPak system provides a robust anoxic environment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The diluted mixed community experiment should be repeated to ensure reproducibility</p></disp-quote><p>The diluted mixed community experiment was repeated a fourth time, yielding the same statistical conclusions. An updated “Figure 2 —figure supplement 1” was added to the paper. The highest (1:1000 – labeled in red in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1) dilution still yielded high variation, which could perhaps be explained by low (i.e., ~10<sup>3</sup> CFU/mL) inoculum for <italic>S. aureus</italic>, <italic>S. sanguinis,</italic> and <italic>P. melaninogenica</italic> used in these experiments—see updated (“Microbial assays” paragraph of the “Materials and methods” section).

More interesting, and not explored, is how cultivation methods change the interactions between these species. With measures of growth yield from each of the species in monoculture at a given time point, and estimates of the numbers of each species in the inoculum, you can calculate how interactions between species influence the productivity of each species and the community as a whole. These calculations are important for a broader understanding of the community ecology of the model system and provide a baseline for further manipulations in the paper, eg following TOB treatment. This approach is detailed in Poltak and Cooper ISMEJ 2011 and is based on Loreau and Hector Nature 2002. I encourage the authors to analyze data using these equations to report realized productivity in mixture – who are the winners and losers of mixture, and how do these changes depend on cultural context? The way the data are currently presented in the figures makes these inferences nearly impossible.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion.

To probe mechanisms associated with the community tolerance phenotype of the <italic>lasR</italic> mutant, we tested ~20 mutants coding for global regulators, including mutants in metabolism regulation genes (<italic>relAspoT</italic>, <italic>crc</italic>) and/or mutants in genes coding for factors that are known targets implicated in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> tolerance to antimicrobials (<italic>pel,</italic> rhamnolipids, efflux pumps, siderophores). None of the tested mutants except for the <italic>lasR</italic> mutant resulted in increased tolerance to tobramycin. The observation that the double <italic>lasRmvfR</italic> mutant resulted in loss of the increased tolerance in the <italic>lasR</italic> mutant, in addition to our review of the recent literature, prompted us to focus on phenazines, as explained on Lines 362–379 of the updated manuscript (see “Essential Revisions” section Comment #1).

My major concerns are related to the weaknesses identified in the public review.</p><p>1) How do your findings that phenazines can be protective against tobramycin tie in to your original observation that WT P. aeruginosa becomes susceptible to tobramycin in mixed communities? Figure 4 seems to indicate that WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> makes more PCA in the mixed community than in a monospecies biofilm. Shouldn't that increase confer increased protection against tobramycin? Is that difference not significant? Is increased susceptibility possibly due to a decrease in a different type of phenazine? Even if phenazine production is not decreased in WT in the mixed biofilm community compared to monospecies biofilms, that result should be explicitly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. While we cannot completely rule out that other factors might shift tobramycin susceptibility of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in a mixed community, our genetic, quantification, and biochemical data strongly suggest that phenazines play a major role in this phenotype. That is, adding phenazine to the mixed community treated with tobramycin restores tolerance of WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. We have updated Figure 4A, which now shows the statistical analysis comparing PCA production in WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown as a monospecies vs mixed community. No statistically significant differences were observed. However, as specified by the reviewer, we have not measured all the possible phenazines produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and so cannot rule out contributions of other phenazines; but PCA and other phenazines such as pyocyanin can induce similar tolerance phenotypes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as reported (6), suggesting a similar role for these molecules, at least for antibiotic tolerance. We argue that future work, outside the scope of this publication, will be necessary to completely understand how phenazines impact community tolerance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>To address this critique, the following text was added at Lines 471–476:</p><p>“PCA production of WT <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> grown in the mixed community was not statistically significantly different from the concentration detected in monospecies biofilm, while the <italic>lasR</italic> mutant did show a significant, 2-fold increase in PCA production in the community compared to the monoculture (Figure 4A). The mechanistic basis for the difference between the WT and <italic>lasR</italic> mutant production of PCA in the mixed community is the subject of ongoing work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Are you exposing cells to oxygen when changing the medium and when exposing cells to tobramycin?

Furthermore, other studies such as in (14) have also reported a minimal bactericidal activity of tobramycin against <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> situated at approximately the same concentration as the one reported in our study (i.e. 64 ug/mL).</p><p>References</p><p>1.
