potentiates motivation by interacting with dopamine reward systems is unexplored. As a model of impaired metabolic-sensing, we used the AgRP-specific deletion of carnitine acetyltransferase (<italic>Crat</italic>) in mice. We hypothesised that metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons is required to increase motivation for food reward by modulating accumbal or striatal dopamine release. Studies confirmed that <italic>Crat</italic> deletion in AgRP neurons (KO) impaired ex vivo glucose-sensing, as well as in vivo responses to peripheral glucose injection or repeated palatable food presentation and consumption. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgPP neurons reduced acute dopamine release (seconds) to palatable food consumption and during operant responding, as assessed by GRAB-DA photometry in the nucleus accumbens, but not the dorsal striatum. Impaired metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed radiolabelled 18F-fDOPA accumulation after ~30 min in the dorsal striatum but not the nucleus accumbens. Impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons suppressed motivated operant responding for sucrose rewards during fasting. Thus, metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons is required for the appropriate temporal integration and transmission of homeostatic hunger-sensing to dopamine signalling in the striatum.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AgRP</kwd><kwd>photometry</kwd><kwd>FED3</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>fasting</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1126724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Zane B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1154974</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>Zane B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hunger-sensitive AgRP neurons must sense changes in calorie availability to transmit metabolic information into dopamine release in the NAc and dorsal striatum, albeit over different time frames, to increase motivated food reward seeking.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The motivation to approach and consume food depends not only on the palatability and caloric density of the available food source, but also on the energy state of the organism. For example, when food is abundant many prey species forage within known territories to reduce survival threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sih, 1980</xref>). Conversely, when food is scarce, animals are motivated to take greater risks and forage within unfamiliar territories to search for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Whitham and Mathis, 2000</xref>). Thus, the motivation to seek palatable, energy-dense food evolved as a key mechanism for survival and maturation in an environment with limited food resources. Given that heightened motivation for palatable food in an environment of low food availability shaped an evolutionary benefit, it is not surprising that homeostatic feeding circuits can have a profound effect on motivation. With high caloric foods readily available, these circuits may contribute to the overconsumption of highly palatable and calorie dense foods, which is a leading cause for today’s obesity crisis. Indeed, human evidence shows that fasting biases reward systems to high caloric foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldstone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cameron et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) are a critical population of hunger-sensitive neurons that primarily function to increase appetite or conserve energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aponte et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gropp et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luquet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Siemian et al., 2021</xref>). A key element of appetitive behaviour is the increased motivation for goal-directed outcomes. Intriguingly, hunger has been used for decades in behavioural neuroscience to improve performance and learning in operant tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramond, 1954</xref>). AgRP neurons function within this framework by increasing the willingness to work for food and food rewards to the same level as that seen in fasted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, AgRP neurons influence motivation circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazzone et al., 2020</xref>), with chemogenetic activation elevating dopamine release in response to food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2019</xref>). Since AgRP neurons are most active during periods of energy deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baskin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggs et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwartz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesised that they transmit hunger-specific metabolic information to motivation circuits. However, whether AgRP neurons are required to gauge homeostatic state through metabolic sensing, to influence motivation neural circuits, remains unknown.</p><p>Sensory cues that predict food availability and palatability rapidly suppress hunger-sensitive AgRP neuronal activity in hungry mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Although this decrease in activity occurs prior to food consumption, post-ingestive caloric feedback is required to sustainably reduce AgRP neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, the reduction of AgRP neuronal activity correlates with the number of calories ingested and was not observed after repeated ingestion of a non-caloric sweetened gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>). These studies highlight that the maintenance of normal AgRP activity in response to post-ingestive gastrointestinal feedback requires metabolic sensing of available calories in combination with gut-brain neural communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we demonstrated that carnitine acetyltransferase (<italic>Crat</italic>) in AgRP neurons was required as a molecular sensor for peripheral substrate utilisation during fasting and refeeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2018c</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Crat</italic> activity in AgRP neurons programmed a broad metabolic response of the AgRP proteome and was required to promote normal refeeding after fasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2018c</xref>). The reduced feeding response after fasting in AgRP <italic>Crat</italic> KO mice suggested that metabolic sensing of homeostatic state by AgRP neurons transmits hunger-specific metabolic information into neural circuits controlling dopamine signalling and the motivational aspects of food-directed behaviour. Here, we describe experiments demonstrating that impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons, using the conditional deletion of <italic>Crat</italic> from AgRP neurons as a validated model, reduces motivated behaviour during an operant task and dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or dorsal striatum, over different time frames, in response to palatable food rewards. These studies highlight that metabolic-sensing in AgRP neurons is required for the appropriate temporal integration of hunger-sensing to potentiate food reward-related dopamine release in the striatum and control motivation for palatable food rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Crat</italic> deletion in AgRP neurons is a valid model of impaired metabolic sensing</title><p>To demonstrate that <italic>Crat</italic> deletion in AgRP neurons is a reliable model of impaired metabolic sensing, we prepared hypothalamic brain slices from WT and KO mice for electrophysiological characterisation of glucose sensing in AgRP neurons. We detected no differences in the fundamental electrophysiological properties of AgRP neurons including resting membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), input resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), spontaneous firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), although peak action potential amplitude was significantly lower in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, these studies demonstrate that <italic>Crat</italic> in AgRP neurons has little effect on the intrinsic electrophysiological properties of the cell. Similarly, no genotype-dependent changes in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory or inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (EPSPs or IPSPs, respectively) were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>), indicating no differences in the external synaptic input onto AgRP neurons in WT compared to KO mice. To show impaired glucose-sensing in AgRP neurons, we recorded neuronal responses to an increase in extracellular glucose from a basal level of 2 mM to 5 mM. These glucose concentrations were chosen to represent brain glucose concentrations under fasting and fed conditions, based on estimates in the CSF from fasted and fed rats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van den Top et al., 2017</xref>). Glucose-excited neurons were defined based upon a response characterised by membrane potential depolarisation and/or an increase in action potential firing frequency with increased extracellular glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Glucose-inhibited cells were identified by responses to increased glucose characterised by membrane potential hyperpolarisation and/or a reduction in spontaneous action potential firing frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In WT mice, 48% of cells (n = 10/21) were excited, 33% of cells (n = 7/21) were inhibited and 19% (n = 4/21) were insensitive to changes in extracellular glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In KO mice, the number of glucose-excited cells was reduced compared to WT, with only 28% classified as glucose-excited (n = 7/25). Similarly, the incidence of glucose-inhibited cells was reduced to 16% (n = 4/25) of the population compared to WT mice, with the majority of cells not responding to 5 mM glucose 56% (n = 14/25) and classified as glucose insensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In total 17/21 AgRP neurons responded to an increase in extracellular glucose in WT mice, whereas as only 11/25 AgRP neurons responded to glucose in KO mice, representing a decrease in glucose-responsive neurons (WT 81% vs KO 44%). To examine whether these ex vivo recordings translated to in vivo changes<italic>,</italic> we injected a cre-dependent GCAMP6s-expressing virus into <italic>Agrp<sup>cre/wt</sup></italic> mice to record AgRP neural activity in freely moving WT and KO mice. An increase in activity to ghrelin was used as an index of correct viral expression and fibre optic placement. Only mice with a maximal peak z-score of &gt;4 were included for analysis in experimental groups, using this criterion 5/19 mice, across both WT and KO mice, were excluded for experimentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N-O</xref>). Fed or overnight fasted WT and KO mice were injected with glucose (2.25 g/kg) and GCaMP6s fluorescence from AgRP neurons was measured for 10 min post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>, K, M). Glucose injection suppressed AgRP activity in WT and KO mice; however, activity quickly returned to baseline levels in fasted WT but not KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Therefore, despite identical infusion of glucose, the activity of AgRP neurons in KO mice failed to rebound, which could dampen the motivation to seek food.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deletion of Crat in AgRP neurons is a model of impaired metabolic sensing.</title><p>Intrinsic electrophysiological properties were little affected in WT versus KO mice including resting membrane potential (<bold>A</bold>, n = 22/23 cells WT/KO), input resistance (<bold>B</bold> n = 13/16 cells WT/KO), spontaneous action potential firing frequency (<bold>C</bold> n = 14/16 cells WT/KO), although action potential amplitude was significantly reduced in KO AgRP neurons (<bold>D</bold>, n = 14/16 cells WT/KO).

These results suggest KO mice could not integrate caloric information associated with PB consumption either in the fed or fasted state and therefore did not show the expected greater reduction in activity.

This exploits the fact that food restriction enhances appetitive drive, which is a result of elevated AgRP neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). To avoid this potential confound we placed the open source Feeding Experimental Device 3 (FED3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matikainen-Ankney et al., 2021</xref>) in home cages to facilitate learning in a low stress environment for long periods of time. As such, operant learning can be acquired quickly and easily in ad libitum-fed mice without the need for caloric restriction – an important consideration for our experiments in which differential feeding responses to fasting, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichenbach et al., 2018b</xref>), may affect task acquisition and performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). With this approach, there were no differences in operant responding during FR sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating no differences in learning the operant task. To test motivation, progressive ratio sessions were performed overnight with (fed) and without access (fasted) to chow. Importantly, in fasted PR experiments, mice began fasting at the same time FED3s were placed in home cages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This was designed to test the motivational response to an increasing energy deficit, which requires an awareness of homeostatic state over time, rather than in response to an existing energy deficit after a prolonged fast. During PR fed experiments, WT and KO mice displayed a similar breakpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and total number of pellets collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), however, during a fasted PR, KO mice showed a reduced breakpoint and total pellet consumption compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>). Active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) but not inactive nose pokes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) during the fasted PR session were significantly lower in KO mice compared to WT, as well as pellets received during the progressive ratio session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Intriguingly, active nose pokes and pellets collected only diverge around 6–8 hr after the beginning of fasting and the PR session, similar to when food intake diverges after fasting as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichenbach et al., 2018b</xref>). This timepoint likely reflects the stage at which impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons can no longer accurately report homeostatic state and energy need appropriately. Collectively, these results suggest that the appropriate detection of homeostatic state via metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons affects motivation for a palatable food reward.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons affects motivation for sucrose rewards during fasting.</title><p>Mice (8 WT, 9 KO) were trained to nose poke for sucrose rewards using fixed ratio schedule (<bold>A</bold> - FR1, FR3, FR5) to reliably nose poke on average 75% correct for three consecutive nights (<bold>C</bold>), before undergoing PR schedules with or without chow accessible.

Thus, reduced NAc dopamine release in response to pellet retrieval underpins reduced motivation for a palatable food reward in KO mice.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that neural encoding of non-caloric and caloric solutions is differentially processed in the NAc and dorsal striatum respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tellez et al., 2016</xref>). Next, we explored dopamine release in the dorsal striatum of WT and KO mice under fed and fasted conditions. We used the same protocol to measure acute dopamine release in the dorsal striatum in response to a non-food object (wood dowel), chow food and a PB chip with each presentation separated by 2 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Although we observed a main effect for a PB chip to acutely increase dopamine release in the dorsal striatum 0–30 s and 30–60 s after food or object presentation, there were no significant genotype differences in either the fed or fasted state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–K</xref>).

However, we observed a main effect of time to increase dopamine release at 0–30 s in fed and fasted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O and P</xref>) independent from genotype showing that PB consumption elicits an acute increase in dopamine release in the dorsal striatum.

Our data collected from the dorsal striatum suggest that impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons does not affect acute dopamine release after food/object presentation (0–60 s) or during a PR (0–10 s). However, our photometry approach cannot assess longer term changes, which may be an important factor since a study using human subjects showed that there are two temporally and spatially distinct dopamine responses to ingesting a milkshake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanarajah et al., 2019</xref>). An immediate orosensory response occurs in response to taste and a second delayed post-ingestive response occurs in response to calories, which is localised to the dorsal striatum. To investigate this, we employed a positron electron tomography (PET) method using radiolabelled 18F-fDOPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>). First, we measured dynamic basal dopamine uptake in ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum in fasted mice without reward presentation and observed no differences in fDOPA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggesting impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons does not affect baseline uptake parameters. However, in response to PB chip consumption, we detected an increase in fDOPA accumulation 30 min after starting in the dorsal striatum of WT but not in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>) and no differences in the ventral striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>).

We demonstrate that <italic>Crat</italic> deletion in AgRP neurons is a valid model of abnormal metabolic-sensing since it impairs glucose-sensing using ex vivo electrophysiological recordings and impairs in vivo AgRP GCaMP6 responses to IP glucose injection and repeated palatable food intake. An important role for <italic>Crat</italic> in metabolic sensing is supported by studies deleting <italic>Crat</italic> from myocytes, as this diminishes the switch from fatty acid metabolism to glucose metabolism after pyruvate administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Muoio et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>There has been a shift in the understanding of AgRP neuronal function since it was discovered that the integration of sensory information suppresses AgRP neuronal activity prior to food consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Betley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mandelblat-Cerf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Intriguingly, in our studies, the first presentation of PB to WT and KO mice produces a similar reduction in AgRP neural activity suggesting normal integration of sensory and taste information, in the absence of post-ingestive interoceptive information. The subsequent fall in AgRP activity from WT mice after initial PB consumption shows that WT mice integrate additional interoceptive information based on post-ingestive feedback from PB consumption. However, KO mice do not show any greater suppression of AgRP neural activity with repeated PB exposure and consumption. Our results are supported by several studies illustrating that post-ingestive feedback from gut-derived signals is required to maintain the suppression of AgRP activity in response to consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>). Su et al demonstrated that the consumption of caloric gels, but not non caloric gels, is required for the sustained suppression of AgRP neuron activity, the magnitude of which is proportional to the calories obtained. In these studies the caloric value of a gel was learnt in a single trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>), similar to the response seen in WT mice after first exposure to PB in our studies. It should be noted, however, that we cannot rule out the possibility of reduced synaptic inhibitory input on to AgRP neurons in fasted KO mice after initial PB presentation, although no differences in baseline inhibitory or excitatory input on to AgRP neurons were observed in WT and KO mice. The majority of inhibitory input to AgRP neurons comes from GABAergic leptin-receptor expressing DMH (DMH<sup>LEPR</sup>) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garfield et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, DMH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons provide inhibitory input to AgRP neurons in response to sensory cues but with only a minimal response to metabolic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berrios et al., 2021</xref>), arguing against the possibility of altered inhibitory input in AgRP neurons from KO mice in our study. It is also possible that <italic>Crat</italic> deletion from AgRP neurons alters the post-synaptic response to GABAergic inhibitory inputs since altered mitochondrial glucose metabolism, as observed after crat deletion, affects GABA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cavalcanti-de-Albuquerque et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Similar to recently published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>), IP glucose injection suppressed AgRP neural activity in WT and KO mice, however activity quickly returned to pre-injection levels in WT fasted but not KO fasted mice. Given that the integration of calorie information is required to sustain suppressed AgRP neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>), our data highlight that calorie availability from IP glucose administration was insufficient to sustain the suppression of AgRP neural activity in fasted WT mice and activity returned to pre-glucose levels to encourage further food seeking. Although fasted KO mice reduced activity in response to IP glucose injection, AgRP activity did not return to baseline levels indicating an inability to sense further calorie need. Thus, we have generated a valid model of impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons in vivo.</p><p>By using GRAB-DA photometry to measure dopamine release dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2018</xref>), we observed that KO had significantly attenuated acute dopamine release in the NAc in fed or fasted state, despite equal time spent consuming a PB chip. By contrast, we did not see any difference in acute dorsal striatum dopamine release between WT and KO mice. Thus, metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons is required to potentiate acute dopamine release in the NAc, extending previous observations that artificial activation of AgRP neurons increases dopamine release in response to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons also attenuated progressive ratio operant responding for sucrose rewards during fasting with KO mice showing reduced breakpoint achieved, active nose pokes and pellets consumed. Although the motivation to obtain food is associated with chemo- or opto-genetic activation of AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krashes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), our studies show metabolic sensing of homeostatic state is required for translating low energy availability into a dopamine-driven motivational action to consume sucrose.</p><p>Using FED3 coupled with GRAB-DA photometry, we measured dopamine release in the NAc or dorsal striatum during a progressive ratio session in response to rewarded and non-rewarded nose pokes. In the NAc, dopamine release increased prior to pellet retrieval consistent with FED3-motor activity acting as an auditory cue for pellet delivery, given the well-known role of cue-induced dopamine release in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schiffer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covey and Cheer, 2019</xref>). Intriguingly, cue-evoked dopamine release in the NAc reflects expected dopamine-mediated reinforcement rather than the actual magnitude of dopamine neuronal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Covey and Cheer, 2019</xref>). There were no differences in average z-score prior to pellet retrieval, however average z-score was reduced after pellet retrieval in KO mice under fasted conditions. These observations show that metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons does not influence the response to the reward predicting cue, but to the reward itself, which is driven by taste and caloric value, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2019</xref>). The combination of reduced breakpoint responding and lower dopamine release in the NAc to pellet retrieval is consistent with the known role of NAc dopamine release to drive food seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roitman et al., 2004</xref>) and to assign an appropriate investment of effort to the available reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>). In the dorsal striatum, dopamine ramping was observed prior to pellet retrieval without any genotype differences, which dropped to baseline soon after pellet retrieval consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">London et al., 2018</xref>). One potential limitation from our studies is that reduced dopamine release in KO mice may reflect less active AgRP neurons at baseline or during fasting. Although our ex vivo electrophysiology studies show no differences at baseline, they cannot rule out in vivo differences that could not be addressed with ex vivo slice recording or population calcium changes using GCaMP6.</p><p>With photometry, we were unable to detect any differences in dopamine release in the dorsal striatum yet studies in humans show palatable food elicits an immediate orosensory dopamine response and a delayed dorsal striatum dopamine response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanarajah et al., 2019</xref>). Our photometry approach only examined a 60-s window after PB consumption or a 10-s window after pellet retrieval. Indeed, after these short time periods dopamine release had already returned to baseline, making it impossible to utilise photometry to measure long-term changes in dopamine function. To address longer term changes in dopamine function we used 18 F fDOPA in PET/CT studies and revealed reduced dopamine uptake 30 min after PB consumption in fasted KO mice compared to WT mice, with no difference in the ventral striatum. Thus, we have identified an interesting separation in the temporal relationship of metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons and dopamine release in the NAc or dorsal striatum. Impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons causes an acute attenuation of dopamine release in the NAc but not the dorsal striatum whereas it causes a longer term attenuation in the dorsal striatum but not the ventral striatum, which encompasses the NAc. The exact mechanisms for these differences are unknown, although it is encouraging to see a similar temporal separation in an orosensory dopamine response and a delayed dorsal striatum dopamine response in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thanarajah et al., 2019</xref>). It is possible that the dorsal striatum response is delayed due to a requirement for metabolic processing in the gut or peripheral tissues. For example, disrupting peripheral glucose oxidation suppresses dorsal striatum dopamine efflux during sugar intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tellez et al., 2013</xref>) and we have previously observed impaired glucose oxidation in response to refeeding after fasting in mice lacking <italic>Crat</italic> in AgRP neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reichenbach et al., 2018c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Reichenbach et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reichenbach et al., 2018a</xref>). Moreover, AgRP neurons respond to sensory cues within seconds yet require a slightly longer time frame (~minutes) to respond effectively to post-ingestive signals from the gut, such as nutrients and hormones released into the blood or via neural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beutler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we predict that impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons affects both the immediate acute response to reward consumption, via dopamine signalling in the NAc, as well as a slower response, which involves the integration of post-ingestive signals of calorie content in regions such as the dorsal striatum. In support of this, dopamine release in the dorsal striatum depends on calorie content, independent from taste, and is modulated by direct calorie infusion into the gut and gut-derived vagal afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tellez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Araujo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Han et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we predict that both short term NAc dopamine release and longer-term dorsal striatum dopamine release may be required to manifest a behavioural change in motivation, both of which require metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons. This comes from our observations that NAc dopamine release to a rewarded nose poke is lower in both fed and fasted KO mice, however reduced motivation for sucrose pellets in the PR session only manifests 6 hr into the fasted period. Indeed, we only observed changes in fDOPA accumulation in the dorsal striatum in mice fasted overnight.</p><p>Although artificial activation of AgRP neurons increases VTA dopamine activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mazzone et al., 2020</xref>), an unanswered question remains, as to how AgRP neurons influence mesolimbic dopamine signalling. Given that very few, if any, AgRP terminals are found in the adult VTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dietrich et al., 2012</xref>) and the slow nature of AgRP activity at the MC4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krashes et al., 2013</xref>), it seems more likely that the effects of AgRP neurons on mesolimbic dopamine activity is driven through either NPY or GABA release at downstream targets. NPY release is required for the ongoing ability of AgRP neurons to drive positive reinforcement and hunger signalling after the suppression of AgRP neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting it is the prime candidate to modulate dopamine release in NAc. In summary, we show that metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons is required to transmit interoceptive metabolic information into dopamine release in the NAc and dorsal striatum, albeit over different time frames, and to increase motivated behaviour for sucrose rewards.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments were conducted in compliance with the Monash University Animal Ethics Committee guidelines.

Prior to experiments, baseline GCaMP6s or dopamine signal was measured and LED power was adjusted for each mouse to achieve approximately 200 mV for 465 nm (530 Hz) and 100 mV for 405 nm (210 Hz). This approach is designed to minimise the impact of variable GCaMP6s expression, tissue irradiance, surgery quality and distance of the fibre optic from GCaMP6s fluorescence. 405 nm was used as an isosbestic control, which is wavelength at which GCaMP6 excitation is independent from intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>], allowing for an assessment of motion artefact. For data analysis, we used a modified python code provided by TDT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barker et al., 2017</xref>).

Briefly, raw traces were down sampled and df/f (f465 nm-f405 nm/f405 nm) was calculated to detrend signal bleaching and remove any motion artefact. Individual z-scores around each precisely timed transistor-transistor logic (TTL)-triggered event were extracted to allow a standardised comparison between events. Z-score normalisation indicates the number of standard deviations a particular data point is away from a defined baseline mean and was calculated according to the following equation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">[</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∧</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">]</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> where the raw data point <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is subtracted from the mean of the baseline period <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow/></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> divided by the standard deviation <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of the baseline period. The baseline period was defined as the period prior to a defined TTL-triggered behavioural event as described in results and figure legends.</p><p>To measure dopamine release to non-food-object/chow/peanut butter chip, single-housed mice with fiber implants were habituated to receiving Reese’s peanut butter chips in the home cage (Macronutrient composition – Fat 29%, Carbohydrate 52%, Protein 3%). On the test day mice were connected to fiber photometry setup in their home cage and a small ceramic bowl placed inside. Recording started after 5 minutes acclimation period. In 2 min intervals, a small wood dowel (novel non-food object), a chow pellet, and a peanut butter chip were dropped into the ceramic bowel in that order. Mice were fed or fasted in random cross over design. Peanut butter chips were measured to ~70 mg per pellet and one pellet was given per trial. Mice consumed all of this peanut butter chip during each trial such that no differences in consumption were observed. Recordings were conducted during the light phase, with the majority towards the end of the light phase. GRAB-DA responses in WT and KO mice were similar on approach to PB and prior to pellet retrieval in both the NAc and dorsal striatum showing that genotype differences in response to palatable food or sucrose pellets could not be due to differences in GRAB-DA expression in the NAc. Moreover, a post mortem analysis was conducted to identify the localisation of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the approximate viral injections sites for GRAB-DA in the Nucleus Accumbens (<bold>A</bold>) and dorsal striatum (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>AP = anterior posterior position relative to bregma.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72668-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>For fiber photometry using GCaMP6s in AgRP neurons, successful targeting of AgRP neurons was tested 2 weeks after surgery by injecting ghrelin (1 mg/kg). Baseline GCaMP6s signals were recorded 15 min prior to ip injection and mice presented with standard chow 90 min after injection. To measure AgRP responsiveness to palatable food, mice were presented with Reese’s peanut butter chips. Mice were habituated to peanut butter chips for 5 days (1 × 70 mg pellet/day) unless otherwise stated as naïve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–H</xref> only). Multiple trails of this experiment were repeated over multiple days in fed and fasted mice (overnight fasting ~16 hr). To measure glucose responsiveness of AgRP neurons, fed or fasted mice were injected with glucose (2.25 g/kg) and AgRP neuronal activity recorded for 10 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Operant conditioning task</title><p>For operant conditioning experiments, Feeding Experiment Devices version 3 (FED3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matikainen-Ankney et al., 2021</xref>) were placed overnight (16 hr) inside home cages under ad libitum conditions trained to reliably nose poke on fixed ratio (FR)1, FR3, and FR5 schedules (criteria to move to higher schedule was three consecutive days over 75% correct nose pokes) The dispensing of a sugar pellet (20 mg, 65% sucrose, 5TUT Test Diets, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) was paired with an LED light cue. During these FR sessions, a nose poke in the ‘active’ hole resulted in the delivery of a sugar pellet and was paired with a LED light cue whereas a nose poke in the ‘inactive’ hold resulted in no programmed response. Importantly, mice were never food restricted during training to prevent this confounding the interpretation of our results. Once stable operant responding was established ( &gt; 75% correct nose pokes on FR5) mice were placed on a progressive ratio (PR) schedule under ad libitum-fed conditions for a single overnight PR session (16 hr). PR sessions were based on a Richardson Roberts schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Richardson and Roberts, 1996</xref>) where the number of pokes required to obtain a reward increased after every completed trial in the following pattern; 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 25, 32, etc. After this single PR session, stable FR5 responding was re-established ( &gt; 75% correct nose pokes, typically 1 FR session) and a second PR session was performed except this time mice were fasted 16 hr during to the PR session. Separate cohorts with fiber implants in the dorsal striatum or NAc were trained to receive sugar rewards as described above and dopamine responses to both nose pokes and sugar pellet retrieval were recorded in fed state or after an overnight fast. For GRAB-DA photometry during PR session, data are presented as the averaged dopamine response for each animal. On average mice collected ~3.5 pellets during the PR in ad libitum-fed conditions and ~6 pellets when fasted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>PET/CT and MRI</title><p>Mice were single housed and trained to receive a single Reese’s peanut butter chip 6 hr into the light phase (time of PET scan) for 1 week. The day before PET/CT scans, mice were fasted overnight (18 hr) with ad lib access to water. On the experimental day, mice were injected IP with 10 mg/kg Benserazide (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.selleckchem.com/">Selleckchem.com</ext-link>) and 10 mg/kg Entacapone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.selleckchem.com/">Selleckchem.com</ext-link>) 30 min before injecting radiolabelled fDOPA (approx. 5 MBq) into the tail vein. After 5 min rest, mice received one peanut butter chip and only those mice that initiated feeding within the first minute were included in the analysis. Then mice were anaesthetised (1–2.5% isoflurane) and a 65 min PET/CT scan was performed under anaesthesia. The scan was acquired using the Inveon scanner (Siemens Inveon). CT was generated using the following parameters: 97 µm of resolution, 80 kV voltage and 500 µA current, mainly for attenuation correction and MRI overlaying purposes. PET scans were acquired for 60 min (16 time frames). One week later MRI scan was performed on these animals to generate T2 weighted images using these parameters: 3D Flash sequence, TE/TR = 8/60ms, 4 averages, flip angle = 10 degree, resolution = 0.155 mm<sup>3</sup>, scan time 20 min. PET images were analysed using IRW software (Inveon Research Workplace 4.2). PET/CT images were overlaid manually with the T2-Weighted images. Region of Interests (ROIs) were generated carefully by one investigator (AR) on the T2 images on left/right ventral striatum, left/right dorsal striatum and cerebellum (according to Allen brain atlas) and PET voxel intensities (Unit Bq/ml) at three different time points were exported for further analysis. We specifically choose to use the ventral striatum, rather than the NAc, due to greater accuracy with ROI identification. SUV (Standardised Uptake Value) of ROIs were calculated for each time point using the following equation: SUV = C<sub>PET</sub>(T)/(Dose/Weight). C<sub>PET</sub>(T) = Tissue radioactivity concentration at time T.</p><p>Dose = administration dose at time of injection (decay corrected to the time points). Weight = animal body weight. To eliminate bias for slight variation of size/location of ROI we used upper bound Bq/ml values to calculate SUVmax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kinahan and Fletcher, 2010</xref>) and normalised to cerebellum as reference:</p><p>SUVRmax = SUVmax target/SUVmax reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>To confirm viral injection and fiber placements, animals were deeply anaesthetised with isoflurane and perfused with 0.05 M PBS, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C then placed in 30% sucrose. Brains were cut at 40 μm on a cryostat, and every fourth section was collected and stored in cryoprotectant at −20 °C. Sections were washed in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB), incubated with 1% hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) for 15 minutes to prevent endogenous peroxidase, activity, and blocked for 1 hr with 5% normal horse serum (NHS) in 0.3% Triton in 0.1 M PB.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Herbert Herzog (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. We assume that after eating a PB chip the inhibitory input to AgRP neurons from DMH (and elsewhere) increases leading the reduced fiber photometry readings in AgRP neurons. With consumption of more chips the inhibition increases, but the AgRP neurons in KO mice cannot respond more due to metabolic-sensing defect. But, what if chronic Crat deficiency in AgRP neurons affects the activity of neurons that synapse onto AgRP neurons due to compensatory changes. For example, maybe inhibitory DMH (or other) neurons become less response to signals from the gut. Thus, we suggest that the authors compare mini IPSCs of WT and KO mice before and after consuming a few PB chips, They might also assess evoked IPSCs by stimulating the DMH and recording from AgRP neurons before and after chip consumption.</p><p>2. There are also suggestions below for improving the display and analysis of the data that should be given serious consideration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Fasting enhances the motivation of rodents to seek and work for food. Dopamine release in the striatum, especially in the nucleus accumbens, underlies the motivational response to hunger. The authors of this paper provide genetic evidence that metabolic sensing by hypothalamic AgRP neurons contributes to the enhanced dopamine signaling in the striatum. The suppression of AgRP-neuron activity with repeated consumption of palatable chips in Crat-KO mice is postulated to be due to inadequate metabolic sensing by AgRP neurons i.e., the neurons cannot respond to further inhibitory input that follows food consumption in the absence of Crat. If metabolic sensing is an intrinsic property of AgRP neurons, then it should be independent of input. Thus, it is important to show that inhibitory input to AgRP neurons is unaltered when comparing WT and KO mice after consumption of several PB chips.</p><p>2. In Figure 1J, it would be useful to know the times of PB chip consumption when these measurements were made. Figure 1E,F suggest that KO neurons are less responsive to glucose. Are the measurements made before or after there is a measurable change in circulating glucose levels?</p><p>3. Discussion of how lack of Crat might limit the ability of AgRP neurons to respond normally to inhibitory inputs should be added.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– I think simplest explanation for the abnormal response of AgRP neurons to food presentation and the decrease in DA release to palatable rewards may be that AgRP neurons are less active at baseline and/or less excitable by fasting in KO mice. As noted above, the relatively normal ex vivo measurements may not accurately reflect this. Additional work to directly and indirectly address this possibility may include further slice studies (comparing fasted and fed KO and control mice), additional fiber photometry studies to assess baseline AgRP neuron activity over time (analogous to Mazzone et al., 2020), and optogenetics studies to assess whether exogenous stimulation of AgRP neurons can overcome deficits in motivated behavior observed in the knockout mice. I do not necessarily think that this paper needs to answer this question with additional experiments; however, if already done or underway these data would add substantially to the paper. Barring that, addressing this possibility/avenue for future experiments in the discussion would be adequate from my perspective</p><p>– In figure 1 – food intake/re-feeding data to accompany the photometry experiments showing decreased AgRP neuron responses to repeat rewards should be presented to show the correlation between the AgRP neuron response to food and subsequent food intake. Prior studies by the authors have showed decreased re-feeding in KO mice over 24 hours but have not reported food intake immediately following food presentation. If immediate food intake does not correlate with AgRP neuron inhibition on food presentation/re-presentation it would be the first example where these findings are dissociated and would warrant explanation and follow-up.</p><p>– For the experiments in figure 4 (and other GRAB-DA experiments), how are mice evaluated for inclusion or exclusion from photometry experiments. Photometry signals between animals can vary much more than within animals, and comparing groups of 4 WT vs KO mice as is done in D and E could yield skewed results based on low virus expression or implant placement (and the latter can be challenging to determine precisely post-mortem).</p><p>– Related to this, to more accurately represent the biological data collected, I think the scatter plots and statistics in figure 4 F,G,J should use the number of mice as N and average nose poke z-scores within animal. If I'm incorrect about this, would appreciate an explanation.</p><p>– In figure 6, I think – as above – that z-scores should be presented by animal in the scatter plots in F,I,L,M. I could understand using z-scores from individual nose pokes if trying to show a difference in DA response across the session (or something like that), but since this is not the point of the figure I think treating nose pokes within animal as technical replicates and each animal as a biological replicate with a single data point on the scatter plot is appropriate.</p><p>Recommendations for improving the writing and presentation.</p><p>– the authors describe how AgRP photometry implants are determined to be functional with ghrelin injection. What were the cut-offs for inclusion? It would also be helpful to know how GRAB-DA implants are evaluated for inclusion either prior to experiments or post-mortem.</p><p>– why is sex mentioned in some but not all figure legends. Where not mentioned are they all male or all female?</p><p>– it would be helpful to mention in figure legends or schematics where PB chips are used whether mice in a given experiment are naïve or habituated to the chips.</p><p>Correction to text and figures:</p><p>– figure supplement 1 – I think A/ B and C/D are reversed on the legend relative to the figure.</p><p>– figure 4 – does panel J contain any data not in F,G? If not I think it can be omitted. Apologies if I'm missing something.</p><p>– figure 5 – D,E,H,I – Y axes seem pretty expanded. Responses to all stimuli would be easier to appreciate if they could be scaled down.</p><p>– line 166 – Beutler et al., 2017 also show that the response to presentation of food predicts calories consumed using complementary experiments and should be cited alongside Su et al., 2017 when discussing this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Almost all data are presented as Z scores. While this is acceptable it does not allow to get an idea of the magnitude of the activity change. Is there some other metric that could be used at least in one experiment to allow this to be compared to other responses seen in the literature?</p><p>Despite missing the mention of (I,J,K,L) in the legend of SubFigure 2, the data on the behavioural experiments (L/D box and EPM) need to be extended showing all parameters eg #entry into the different zones, total distance travel in the zone and over all, etc to allow to give a conclusive answer whether the animals show anxiety behaviour or not.</p><p>The discussion is rather long and a bit repetitive, it could be more concise and only fucus on the main points. It could however, expand a bit on how the authors think AgRP neurons mediate this response to dopamine changes eg is it dependent on AgRP, NPY or GABA signalling from these neurons etc? Are AgRP neurons the only ones that mediate energy sensing responses eg what is the role of POMC neurons in that process?</p><p>In the PET analysis were any other brain areas also affected and analysed by the treatment?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72668.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

We have lacked both expertise and resources to complete these studies with our ephys expert unable to enter Victoria Australia for most of the revision period.</p><p>Nevertheless, we wanted to address this issue by providing additional data to support our conclusions that impaired dopamine signaling in AgRP Crat KO mice was a failure of metabolic sensing. To do this, we looked at in vivo AgRP neural responses to an IP glucose challenge, which is known to suppress AgRP neural activity (3). Although IP glucose injection suppressed AgRP activity in WT and KO mice, activity quickly returned to baseline levels in fasted WT but not KO mice (new data Figure 1—figure supplement 1J-M). Thus, in fasted WT mice calorie availability was insufficient to sustain the suppression of AgRP neural activity and activity returned to pre-glucose levels to encourage further food seeking. Although fasted KO mice reduced activity in response to IP glucose, AgRP activity did not return to pre glucose levels indicating an inability to sense further calorie need. With the addition of this new data, we show that AgRP crat deletion affects both ex vivo and in vivo AgRP neural responses to glucose, as well as in response to palatable food.</p><p>Furthermore, the majority of inhibitory inputs into AgRP neurons come from leptin-receptor expressing DMH (DMH<sup>LEPR</sup>) GABA neurons (4) and it was recently demonstrated that DMH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons provide inhibitory input to AgRP neurons in response to sensory cues but with only a minimal response to metabolic signals (5). Thus, we feel our data, together with evidence from the literature, strongly supports the conclusion that impaired metabolic sensing in AgRP neurons, and not alterations in inhibitory inputs, is responsible for the changes in dopamine signalling observed.</p><p>We have added more detailed and addressed this as a limitation (below) in the discussion.</p><p>“It should be noted, however, that we cannot rule out the possibility of reduced synaptic inhibitory input on to AgRP neurons in KO mice after initial PB presentation. The majority of inhibitory input to AgRP neurons comes from GABAergic leptin-receptor expressing DMH (DMH<sup>LEPR</sup>) neurons (4). Importantly, DMH<sup>LEPR</sup> neurons provide inhibitory input to AgRP neurons in response to sensory cues but with only a minimal response to metabolic signals (5), arguing against the possibility of altered inhibitory input in AgRP neurons from KO mice in our study. It is also possible that Crat deletion from AgRP neurons alters the post-synaptic response to GABAergic inhibitory inputs since altered mitochondrial glucose metabolism, as observed after crat deletion, affects GABA metabolism(6)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In terms of in vivo changes in AgRP activity, no differences were observed in response to PB when presented for the first time, however, subsequent exposures showed significantly greater fall in activity in WT and but not KO mice. Thus, the integration of available caloric information (assumed to included changes in plasma glucose) must come after the first exposure. Subsequent exposure to PB in both WT and KO was conducted over multiple days, so all mice would have been available to integrate metabolic after first exposure. However, changes in activity to subsequent exposure occur immediate as PB is dropped into the cage (see videos 3-6) and these changes occur prior to any measurable difference in plasma glucose.</p><p>In addition, GRAB-DA responses occur prior to measurable changes in plasma glucose, but again all mice have been habituated to PB pellets for multiple days prior to recordings. It is interesting to note that fDOPA PET/CT data only show changes in the dorsal striatum 30 mins after PB pellet exposure, during which time measurable changes in blood glucose can be observed. In fact, our previous studies show impaired glucose clearance in KO mice 15 mins after a glucose challenge (1), further supporting the inability to sense plasma glucose over a time frame similar to PET/CT studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This approach is designed to minimise the impact of variable GCaMP6s expression, tissue irradiance, surgery quality and distance of the fibre optic from GCaMP6s”.</p><p>We have also added the following text to the discussion.</p><p>“One potential limitation from our studies is that reduced dopamine release in KO mice may reflect less active AgRP neurons at baseline or during fasting.

Moreover, a postmortem analysis was conducted to identify the localization of GFP expression (Figure 7).</p><p>We have added the following text.</p><p>“GRAB-DA responses in WT and KO mice were similar on approach to PB and prior to pellet retrieval in both the NAc and dorsal striatum showing that genotype differences in response to palatable food or sucrose pellets could not be due to differences in GRAB-DA expression in the NAc.

It could however, expand a bit on how the authors think AgRP neurons mediate this response to dopamine changes eg is it dependent on AgRP, NPY or GABA signalling from these neurons etc? Are AgRP neurons the only ones that mediate energy sensing responses eg what is the role of POMC neurons in that process?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the discussion to shorten.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the PET analysis were any other brain areas also affected and analysed by the treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>No other regions were examined.
