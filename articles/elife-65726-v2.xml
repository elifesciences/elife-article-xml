Abbott ID NOW provides fast results but has been criticized for low sensitivity. Here we determine the sensitivity of ID NOW in an ambulatory population presented for testing. The study enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, of whom 21 were positive by both ID NOW and RT–PCR, and 2 only by RT–PCR. All 189 asymptomatic patients tested negative. The positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the RT–PCR assay was 91.3%, and negative percent agreement was 100%. The results from the current study were included into a larger systematic review of literature where at least 20 subjects were simultaneously tested using ID NOW and RT–PCR. The overall sensitivity for ID NOW assay was calculated at 84% (95% confidence interval 55–96%) and had the highest correlation to RT–PCR at viral loads most likely to be associated with transmissible infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>ID NOW</kwd><kwd>RT-PCR</kwd><kwd>ambulatory</kwd><kwd>sensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AG60917</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iqbal</surname><given-names>Jameel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK113627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iqbal</surname><given-names>Jameel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2008201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Yuan-Po</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000098</institution-id><institution>NIH Clinical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2008202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tu</surname><given-names>Yuan-Po</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Although the ID NOW platform is less sensitive than RT–PCR for identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it provides high positive and negative predictive values in low-prevalence populations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus has infected over 63 million people worldwide, causing over 1,500,000 deaths as of December 1, 2020. Infected individuals may be asymptomatic or may have a range of symptoms varying from a mild upper respiratory illness or gastrointestinal distress to severe respiratory distress with multisystem failure and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Wiersinga et al., 2020</xref>). Definitive diagnosis requires laboratory detection of virus and is required for patients to be eligible for both clinical trials and current antiviral drugs and biologicals approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tu and O'Leary, 2020</xref>). Early in the pandemic, detection of SARS-CoV-2 relied predominately on reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) assays performed in moderate to high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. RT–PCR assays performed in certified laboratories are highly sensitive and specific, but require expensive and complex analyzers operated by certified and highly skilled laboratory workers; in many cases, these tests have required turnaround times of nearly a week or more.</p><p>The use of testing strategies with a rapid turnaround may allow for an earlier detection and better isolation of confirmed cases compared to laboratory-based diagnostic methods, as well as facilitate earlier treatment decisions and provide guidance on appropriate use of personal protective equipment. On March 27, 2020, Emergency Use Authorization was granted for the COVID-19 EUA assay on the ID NOW system (Abbott, Scarborough Diagnostics). The ID NOW system is a point-of-care (POC) device that uses an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique to allow for nucleic acid amplification without thermal cyclers and allows for results to be obtained quickly. The ID NOW SARS-CoV-2 assay (Abbott) amplifies a unique region of the RdRp genome with a manufacturer’s claimed limit of detection (LOD) of 125 genome equivalents/mL. The isothermal technique allows for positive results to be available as soon as 5 min into the assay, and negative results within 13 min.</p><p>Since its release, several studies have been published demonstrating a sensitivity relative to RT–PCR from 44% to 94% (excluding a study with only a single positive). Studies have shown fairly definitively that the LOD for ID NOW COVID-19 requires significantly higher amounts of virus than most RT–PCR assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smithgall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhen et al., 2020a</xref>), but the clinical importance of this finding has been tempered by the observation that virus detectable only at high cycle time threshold (Ct) values is generally not culturable, and may therefore not be sufficiently high to infect others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mina et al., 2020</xref>). Additional studies have suggested that nasal viral loads peak at around the time symptoms appear, and fall off as infection lingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kucirka et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, a diagnostic approach that is adequate early in the course of infection may be inadequate for patients that present later in the course of disease. Thus, the decision on whether the time advantage of a lower sensitivity device offsets the potentially higher LOD may depend on the context in which that device is employed.</p><p>To better understand the performance characteristics and trade-offs involved in the use of the ID NOW system, we have carried out a prospective clinical evaluation of the ID NOW system in the context of a community screening program focusing on symptomatic persons demonstrating one or more clinical feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, comparing the results with those obtained by RT–PCR testing. We have augmented the findings of this investigation with a systematic review and meta-analysis of ID NOW performance, focusing on ambulatory community populations undergoing initial testing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The evaluation enrolled 785 symptomatic patients, of whom 21 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by both the ID NOW and Hologic assays, and 2 tested positive only with the Hologic assay (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the evaluation enrolled 189 asymptomatic patients, none of whom tested positive by either ID NOW or RT–PCR. An ‘invalid’ ID NOW assay result was reported for nine subjects (two asymptomatic, seven symptomatic), all of whom tested negative by RT–PCR. Thus, the positive percent agreement between the ID NOW assay and the Hologic Panther Assay was 91.3%, and the negative percent agreement was 100%.

In studies reporting more than a single positive RT–PCR result, the sensitivity of ID NOW, as compared to the composite reference standard, varied from 44 to 94%, while that of the RT–PCR test varied from 91 to 100%. For studies in which patient selection bias was rated low, the sensitivity of ID NOW (in comparison with the composite reference standard) ranged from 60 to 92% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This corresponds with published analytical sensitivity estimates that have shown limits of detection for ID NOW that are several orders of magnitude higher than those of RT–PCR assays, ranging from 3900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lephart et al., 2020</xref>) to 20,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhen et al., 2020a</xref>) gene copies/mL, and data published on an FDA web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-reference-panel-comparative-data">https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/sars-cov-2-reference-panel-comparative-data</ext-link>) that suggests a 500-fold higher LOD for the ID NOW platform than for the Panther Fusion Assay employed in our clinical study. These results are consistent with the studies in our systematic review that showed discordance among assays to be most frequent when Ct values were relatively high (see Appendix 1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cradic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lephart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mitchell and George, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Smithgall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhen et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>The ID NOW instructions for use (IFU, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136525/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/136525/download</ext-link>) have changed over time, but generally have called for samples to be tested no later than 1 hr after specimen acquisition and kept at room temperature during that period. The changes in the IFU have made it difficult to assess whether published studies provided sufficient information to allow a determination that conformation to instructions for use was followed sufficiently. Four studies included in this review were based upon a split/residual sample design; the calculated sensitivity for the ID NOW in these studies ranged from 72% to 94%. For eight of the studies, timing of the ID NOW test was unclear, while for four studies, samples were held after collection at 4°C for up to 24 hr (two studies), 48 hr (one study), or 72 hr (one study). The degree to which this affects assay sensitivity is unclear; however, it is noteworthy that a study that held samples for up to 72 hr reported ID NOW sensitivity (as compared to the composite reference standard) of 88%, while another study that held samples for no more than 2 hr reported a sensitivity of 56%. Only one of the studies captured for this systematic review reported a time-to-test for ID NOW of ≤1 hr, and that study included only one patient that tested positive using either device. Thus, there is no conclusive evidence that the refrigeration serves as an explanation for varying sensitivities.</p><p>There was no obvious relationship between the sample site, such as anterior nares (AN) versus NP, or sampling device and the sensitivity of the ID NOW test. Both high and low concordance with the composite reference standard were found for both sites and for both foam and flocked swabs. Similarly, both good performance and poor performance were found for both samples transported in a medium or transported dry. Finally, the overall prevalence of positive findings in the study population was not correlated with the performance of ID NOW in the studies we have examined.</p><p>We included the two cohorts with low risk of patient selection bias, together with the current study, in a meta-analysis, the results of which are shown as forest plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The sensitivity of ID NOW, as compared with the reference standard, was estimated at 82% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>); the lower and upper 95% confidence bounds were 67% and 91%, respectively. Measures of heterogeneity did not reach statistical significance (τ<sup>2</sup> = 0.25, Q[df = 2]=3.67, p=0.16, I<sup>2</sup> = 45.53). In contrast, the sensitivity of RT–PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) was estimated at 98% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 96–99%. There was no suggestion of heterogeneity (τ<sup>2</sup> = 0.000, Q[df = 2] = 0.453, p=0.112, I<sup>2</sup> = 0.000). The sensitivity estimates for both ID NOW and RT–PCR were reduced, probably by about 2%, by the need to include a continuity correction in the der Simionian–Laird computations.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Forest plots demonstrating the three studies with low risk of patient selection bias utilized in the meta-analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The sensitivity of ID NOW as compared with the reference standard, and the overall sensitivity was estimated to be 82% with a lower 95% confidence bound at 67% and an upper bound of 91%.

Several features that distinguish this study from those included in the systematic review are worth noting. The first is that the time from specimen collection to ID NOW testing was 15 min or less for most individuals tested. None of the studies meeting criteria for inclusion in the systematic review had such a short collection-to-testing time. This may account, at least in part, for the relatively high positive percent agreement found in our studies by comparison with most previous reports (although we note overlap of CIs for studies included in the meta-analysis, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). A second feature of the current clinical evaluation, shared by only two of the studies included in our systematic review, was that the sample was based on a subject group that resulted from an attempt to enroll virtually every patient who walked through the door. Our study did not find cases in which NP specimens tested by RT–PCR were negative in the face of a positive ID NOW result; this finding is similar to the findings of our systematic review, which found only four such cases among 1942 tests, as seen in Appendix 1.</p><p>Most of the variation in performance reported for the ID NOW system seems to result from the differences in recruitment strategies employed in these studies. Peak viral loads and transmission risk for SARS-CoV-2 are found in symptomatic patients at symptom onset and then fall throughout the course of disease. Because RT–PCR assays have a LOD that are several orders of magnitude lower than that of the isothermal PCR ID NOW assay, one would expect them to remain positive for significantly longer times after the time of peak viral load. The use of ‘convenience samples’, particularly populations including patients who have been hospitalized after a diagnosis of COVID-19, may include more patients who are past their period of peak viral load compared to a sample of ambulatory patients first presenting for evaluation – such as those in our study who appeared for testing because of recent symptom onset. The two studies that met inclusion criteria for our review, which had the lowest positive percent agreement between ID NOW and RT–PCR, included hospitalized patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lephart et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Thwe and Ren, 2020</xref>) although another study with very low concordance did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basu et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The conclusions from our clinical study are limited by a relatively small number of positive cases; nonetheless, the high level of agreement with RT–PCR suggests that ID NOW is effective at identifying, or excluding, SARS-CoV-2 in a symptomatic ambulatory patient population. The systematic review and meta-analysis generally support this conclusion, although they suggest a reduction in sensitivity NOW, in comparison with that of RT–PCR, that may be clinically significant under some circumstances. The specificity of a positive ID NOW result appears to be upwards of 99.8%, based upon the studies included in this review.</p><p>Under the conditions of the current clinical study (population prevalence of 2.36%), the positive and negative predictive values of the ID NOW test were 100% and 99.8% (99.2–99.9%), respectively. At a prevalence of 10% in the tested population, the positive and negative predictive values are 100% and 99% (96.49–99.74%), respectively. Using the 82% estimate from our meta-analysis in a 2% positive population yields a negative predictive value of 99.6% (99.4–99.7%), which drops to 98.0% (97.1–98.7%) in a population with 10% disease prevalence. At the lower 95% confidence limit of the meta-analysis (67%), negative predictive value remains acceptable at 99.2% (99–99.4%) for a population prevalence of 2.3%. It becomes more marginal at 96.5% (95.4–97.3%) when the prevalence of disease in the tested population goes to 10% or higher.</p><p>Our clinical study and meta-analysis suffer from several limitations. The data from our clinical study does not provide information on the potential utility of ID NOW in testing an asymptomatic patient population, since no positive cases were identified among the enrolled asymptomatic patients similarly, our systematic review and meta-analysis does not focus on this group. Comparison of RT–PCR cycle numbers between symptomatic and asymptomatic ambulatory outpatients from The Everett Clinic suggests that the viral load for symptomatic patients is generally higher than for asymptomatic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This observation, which has also been reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ra et al., 2021</xref>), raises the possibility that ID NOW may miss infections in the asymptomatic infected population. On the other hand, the observation that specimens that demonstrate high Ct values are unlikely to be successfully cultured raises the possibility that many of these patients are less likely to transmit the infection, although the relationship between the ability to culture virus and infectivity has yet to be demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2. Our clinical study also suffered a significant loss of power to assess ID NOW sensitivity as a result of the low number of positive results, and the reduction of sample size caused by the decision to terminate the study as a result. The meta-analysis is also limited by the small number of studies meeting inclusion criteria, and the fact that positive cases are heavily concentrated in only a single study. Strengths of the clinical study include pre-trial power analysis with sample size estimation, precise adherence to the ID NOW specimen acquisition protocol, and extremely high power for assessing assay specificity. Taken together with the focus on initial diagnosis of disease in the studies included in the meta-analysis, we believe the combination of trial and meta-analysis provides useful information for clinicians for whom POC testing is helpful.</p><p>POC testing has substantial advantages over laboratory-based testing when a patient presents with symptoms characteristic of COVID-19. Patients who are SARS-CoV-2 positive can be asked to isolate immediately, and patients who test negative can be reassured or retested using a more sensitive test, depending on clinical judgment. Although the performance of ID NOW in an asymptomatic population has not been established, and caution may be appropriate when using ID NOW with a high-risk population, increased frequencies of testing, together with a rapid turnaround time, are likely to have greater impact on population health outcomes than are differences in test sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Larremore et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mina et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the ID NOW system provides excellent negative predictive value in symptomatic ambulatory patients, particularly when the population prevalence of SARS-CoV2 is low. It thus provides a speedy and effective alternative to laboratory-based RT–PCR methods under many clinical circumstances.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">ID NOW SARS-CoV-2 reagents</td><td valign="top">Abbott</td><td valign="top">Cat. # 190–000 for COVID reagents <break/>Cat. # 190–080 for COVID controls</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fda.gov/media/136525/download">https://www.fda.gov/media/136525/download</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">SARS-CoV-2 reagents</td><td valign="top">Hologic</td><td valign="top">Cat. # PRD-06420 for the COVID reagents and Cat. # 303014 for the assay fluids reagents</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.hologic.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/AW-21159-001_004_01.pdf">https://www.hologic.com/sites/default/files/2020-09/AW-21159-001_004_01.pdf</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population and sample collection</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Clinical study</title><p>The IRB-approved clinical study was conducted at The Everett Clinic between April 8 and 22, 2020, and engaged ambulatory symptomatic patients seen in the febrile upper respiratory infection (F/URI) clinics and other patients from non-F/URI clinics. Patients who were unable to demonstrate understanding of the study, not willing to commit to having all samples collected, had a history of nosebleed in the past 24 hr, nasal surgery in the past 2 weeks, chemotherapy treatment with documented low platelet and low white blood cell counts, or acute facial trauma were excluded; nonetheless, an attempt was made to consecutively enroll all eligible patients.</p><p>The original study design called for enrolling 2000 symptomatic and 500 asymptomatic subjects, which would have provided, in the symptomatic population, power of 80% for finding a difference (at α = 0.05) of 5% in the sensitivity of ID NOW compared with the RT–PCR reference standard; inclusion of at least 1350 negative patients would have provided 95% power (at α = 0.025) for finding a 5% difference in specificity. The study design assumed a population prevalence of 10%, and the study was terminated early when the population prevalence dropped to such a low level as to make the study unaffordable. We have re-estimated the power of this study without reference to the observed results but considering the sample size and proportion of RT–PCR-positive tests that were observed when the study was terminated. This re-estimation suggests that the study retained 80% power to find a difference of 15% or more in sensitivity between ID NOW and RT–PCR, and well over 95% power to find a difference in specificity of more than 5%. Indeed, the significant drop in population prevalence that led to a loss of power for detecting loss of sensitivity resulted, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bujang, 2016</xref>), in an increase in power for detecting loss of specificity.</p><p>Patients who consented to the study had two sterile foam swabs (Puritan, #PK002196) obtained by trained clinical staff. To ensure maximum loading of viral material, each swab sampled in both AN. To ensure that both swabs had equal opportunity to collect viral material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), the collection of the two swabs used a cross-over method.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The collection methodology to ensure proper randomized sampling of nares for simultaneous analysis for SARS-CoV-2 by the ID NOW isothermal amplification and Hologic Panther RT–PCR assays.</title><p>A total of two swabs was collected on each patient, with patients having an even birth year number the right nares were collected first followed by a second swipe in the left nares and then for ID NOW point-of-care (POC) testing (depicted as red swab).

If the patient’s year of birth was an odd year, the first swab inserted into the left nostril was designated for SARS-CoV-2 testing using the ID NOW analyzer. The swab designated for testing in the ID NOW analyzer was reinserted into the original paper sleeve packaging, a patient label was affixed, placed in a plastic bag, and transported to the clinic lab on site for immediate testing. Typically, fewer than 15 min passed between the time the room-temperature sample was collected and the time that the swab was inserted into the ID NOW sample receiver.</p><p>The remaining swab was placed in VTM (Medical Diagnostic Laboratories, LLC). After a patient label was affixed, the specimen was placed in a plastic bag and transported at 4°C to the University of Washington Virology Lab, where a Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Marlborough, MA) was performed per manufacturer’s recommendations. With the Hologic assay, a sample is considered positive if an amplification signal is detected at a cycle time (Ct) of 42 cycles or less. Those involved in the RT–PCR assay were blinded to the ID NOW result.</p><p>ID NOW results, which were reported as ‘invalid’, were treated as negative when calculating the sensitivity of the ID NOW test; moreover, they were excluded from computations of specificity since this result would be expected to trigger reflex testing.

PubMed, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were searched over the interval from January 1, 2020 to August 16, 2020, using the search ‘ID NOW’, ‘isothermal amplification’, and lamp isothermal’. Following the initial identification of papers, the titles and abstracts were screened to eliminate papers not meeting the prespecified inclusion criteria as defined below and diagramed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Papers remaining after this process were rescreened, particularly since many of the papers reviewed were in the form of research letters that did not have an abstract. Ultimately, 14 papers that met inclusion criteria for clinical comparison were available for analysis, as shown in the PRISMA flow diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, one additional paper addressing the LOD for ID NOW was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fung et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To be included in the systematic review, studies were required to include a minimum of 20 unique subjects. Studies must have compared samples obtained simultaneously from the same site or from an equivalent site. Both split-sample designs and independent sample designs were considered. Results must have been reported in a manner that allowed construction a confusion matrix including the RT–PCR and ID NOW test. Because ‘discrepant analysis’ provides biased sensitivity estimates, studies using this technique to resolve diagnostic conflicts between two sites were not to be included unless data could be analyzed independently of the discrepant analysis. If multiple time points were included in one of the included studies, only the first time point was to be used in our analysis. If confusion matrices could only be constructed from data involving multiple time points from the same patients, the study was excluded. No attempt was made to obtain data from the investigators involved in these published studies.</p><p>Study information was recorded on a predetermined data extraction form that included study author, type of study, inclusion and exclusion criteria, setting, sample types, swab types, transport medium, manufacturer or description of nucleic acid amplification assays, as well as space to record study results in the form of confusion matrices. The potential for bias associated with each study was evaluated using the QUADAS2 instrument. The risk of spectrum bias, which is the variability of medical test performance that happens when tests are given to different mixes of patients at different locations, was assessed from the perspective of testing as an initial diagnostic method; the risk estimate does not constitute a judgment on the quality of the study, which may have been performed to demonstrate assay validity, assessment of recovery, or other purposes different than that for which we evaluated potential bias.</p><p>Because the choice of any particular diagnostic device as a ‘gold standard’ provides a biased estimate of relative sensitivity, which compared with all other devices, a composite reference standard (CRS) was computed for each study on the basis of all devices and sample types included in the study, when possible. Equivocal results and assay failures were not used in the calculation of sensitivity or in the construction of the CRS for each study. Where multiple RT–PCR assays were performed, only the performance of the most sensitive of these assays (as measured using the composite reference standard) is reported in results tables. Confidence limits for sensitivity were computed using Newcombe’s efficient score method, as above. Criteria for performing a formal meta-analysis were prespecified as follows: (1) studies used the same amplification technology (such as RT–PCR) as a reference; (2) studies used the same upper airway sample site (AN, mid-turbinate [MT], and NP could be included together, but not admixed with studies based on oropharynx samples); (3) studies enrolled a similar patient mix (e.g. symptomatic, asymptomatic, hospitalized and similar clinical environment [drive-through/community health center or hospital]). Three papers in which with a low risk of bias were deemed appropriate to include in a meta-analysis were analyzed using a diagnostic effects model (der Simion–Laird) as implemented by OpenMetaAnalyst software program.</p><p>The choice of any particular diagnostic device as a ‘gold standard’ provides a biased estimate of relative sensitivity which compared with all other devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baughman et al., 2008</xref>). When two devices, each of which is expected to have a near-zero false positive rate, are being compared, the use of a CRS is a reasonable approach by which to reduce this bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, we compared the performance of ID NOW and RT–PCR methods with a composite reference standard in which the specificity of all assays was considered to be perfect, and a positive result for any assay was considered to be a ‘true positive’. Equivocal results and assay failures were not used in the calculation of sensitivity or in the construction of the CRS for each study. Where multiple RT–PCR assays were performed, only the performance of the most sensitive of these assays (as measured using the composite reference standard) is reported in results tables.

Since our model is built on the assumption that there are no false positive ID NOW results, a value of 0.5 was added to all cells as a continuity correction.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of Garrett Galbreath, Lorraine Bell, Susan Spanos, Anne Hartman, Amanda Wells, Kim Gangloff, Jeremy Norris, and Korie Packwood (from The Everett Clinic Laboratory, analytical and electronic medical records staff), The Everett Clinic nurses, medical assistants, staff, providers and patients who graciously contributed to this study.

nares (AN) swabs obtained from patients presenting in the ED and 13 from recovering COVID-positive inpatients. NP swabs were transported to a central laboratory and tested with the Simplexa, following which residual specimens were tested within 24 hr on the m2000 and Xpert Xpress devices. Nasal swabs were collected in parallel, transported dry to the laboratory, stored at 4°C, and tested by ID NOW within 24 hr. The potential for patient selection bias is unclear because of the inclusion of recovering hospitalized subjects.

We apologize that the manuscript was not written clearly enough to delineate that the current cohort study is larger than any other single study reported in the literature on ID NOW and is the only study in which power analysis was used to plan sample size. We have revised the manuscript to emphasize that the current study is the largest of its kind to analyze the ID NOW SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and believe that this remains an important distinction from other papers in the literature. Importantly, we have not submitted the current cohort study as a stand-alone clinical study, but rather as a clinical study associated with a systematic review and meta-analysis; for this, we have included as much publicly available and publicly described data as possible to maximize the utility to the practitioner. From this open analysis, only three studies exist with a low risk of patient selection bias (including the current one).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting a review of additional studies available on Abbott’s website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Abbott-Releases-Interim-Clinical-Study-Data-on-ID-NOW-COVID-19-Rapid-Test-Showing-Strong-Agreement-to-Lab-Based-Molecular-PCR-Tests">https://abbott.mediaroom.com/2020-05-21-Abbott-Releases-Interim-Clinical-Study-Data-on-ID-NOW-COVID-19-Rapid-Test-Showing-Strong-Agreement-to-Lab-Based-Molecular-PCR-Tests</ext-link>). We have re-examined the details of the studies reported by Abbott as well as those used by FDA and note that all of them have an overall sample size less than that used in the current clinical study. Some of the studies cited in Abbott’s link are similar to the current findings; for example, one “urgent care study” found one case where ID NOW PCR was positive, and RT-PCR was negative from a group of 256 patients overall giving a rate of &gt;99% negative agreement. Abbott’s site also reports on an unpublished study in which ID NOW demonstrated 94.7% positive agreement and 98.6% negative agreement compared to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 2019-Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel, as well as on a study of hospitalized and nursing home patients where ID NOW showed 85.7% positive agreement and 97.6% negative agreement compared to the CDC assay, and 83.3% positive agreement and 96.5% negative agreement when compared to Hologic's Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We agree with the reviewer that the negative percent agreements in these studies does appear to differ from the current study; however, those results also differ from the summary results of the published studies that we included in the systematic review that showed an overall 99.8% negative agreement.</p><p>As detailed above, the negative percent agreement is one area of potential confusion for readers and we are very grateful to the reviewer for helping to point this out. Many of these studies and press releases are unpublished or utilize interim clinical study data, thereby making it difficult to be certain of the exact reasons for differences in positive and negative percent agreement. What is evident, however, is that the effectiveness of each of these technologies in detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly dependent on sample acquisition site and timing of testing, particularly with ID NOW, as well as specimen transport and to a lesser extent swab construction. To help clarify differences that exist in the literature we have expanded the Discussion to clarify and explain these issues. The relevant section of the revised Discussion now reads as follows:</p><p>Although the performance of ID NOW in an asymptomatic population has not been established, and caution may be appropriate when using ID NOW with a high-risk population, increased frequency of testing, together with a rapid turnaround time, are likely to have greater impact on population health outcomes than are differences in test sensitivity (Larremore et al., 2020; Mina et al., 2020).</p></body></sub-article></article>
