To date, the mechanisms of KCNQ channel modulation have been mostly characterized to be inhibitory via Gq-coupled receptors, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM, and protein kinase C. Here we demonstrate that methylation of KCNQ by protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (Prmt1) positively regulates KCNQ channel activity, thereby preventing neuronal hyperexcitability. <italic>Prmt1+/-</italic> mice exhibit epileptic seizures. Methylation of KCNQ2 channels at 4 arginine residues by Prmt1 enhances PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, and <italic>Prmt1</italic> depletion lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of KCNQ2 channels and thereby the channel activities. Consistently, exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition to <italic>Prmt1+/-</italic> neurons restores KCNQ currents and neuronal excitability to the WT level. Collectively, we propose that Prmt1-dependent facilitation of KCNQ-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction underlies the positive regulation of KCNQ activity by arginine methylation, which may serve as a key target for prevention of neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17159.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17159.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17159.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the brain, cells called neurons transmit information along their length in the form of electrical signals. To generate electrical signals, ions move into and out of neurons through ion channel proteins – such as the KCNQ channel – in the surface of these cells, which open and close to control the electrical response of the neuron.</p><p>Abnormally intense bursts of electrical activity from many neurons at once can cause seizures such as those experienced by people with epilepsy. A significant proportion of patients do not respond to current anti-seizure medications. Openers of KCNQ channels have emerged as a potential new class of anti-epileptic drugs. A better understanding of how KCNQ channels work, and how their opening by PIP<sub>2</sub>lipid signals is regulated, could help to develop more effective therapies for epilepsy.</p><p>A process called methylation controls many biological tasks by changing the structure of key proteins inside cells. Although methylation occurs throughout the brain, its role in controlling how easily neurons are activated (a property known as “excitability”) remains unclear.</p><p>Kim, Jeong, Kim, Jung et al. now show that a protein called Prmt1 methylates the KCNQ channels in mice, and that this methylation is essential for suppressing seizures. Mice born without the Prmt1 protein developed epileptic seizures and the KCNQ channels in their neurons featured a reduced level of methylation. However, increasing the amount of PIP<sub>2</sub> in these neurons restored their excitability back to normal levels. The methylation of KCNQ channel proteins increases their affinity for PIP2, which is critical to open KCNQ channels. Kim et al. propose that these “opening” controllers balance the action of known “closers” of KCNQ channels to maintain neurons in a healthy condition.</p><p>In future, Kim et al. plan to investigate whether methylation affects the activity of other ion channels controlled by PIP<sub>2</sub>. Such experiments will complement a more widespread investigation into other ways in which the Prtmt1 protein may control the activity of neurons.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17159.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17159.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>KCNQ channel</kwd><kwd>neuronal excitability</kwd><kwd>protein arginine methylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2012R1A2A2A01046878</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyun-Ji</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Seul-Yi</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Koh</surname><given-names>Jewoo</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>Hana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2015R1A2A1A15051998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeong</surname><given-names>Myong-Ho</given-names></name><name><surname>Vuong</surname><given-names>Tuan Anh</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Jong-Sun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-048055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Kyung-Ran</given-names></name><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Won-Kyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The PRMT1 protein mediates arginine methylation of KCNQ2 channels to control neuronal excitability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epilepsy imposes a major burden at both global and individual levels. Worldwide, about 1% of the population suffers from epilepsy, and nearly 4% of the population will experience epilepsy at some point during their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malkki, 2014</xref>). In almost 30% of patients with epilepsy, anti-seizure medications do not provide sufficient seizure control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Malkki, 2014</xref>). Thus, understanding the etiology of epilepsy is essential both for clinical management of patients and for conducting neurobiological research that will direct future therapies. The etiology of epilepsy was formerly regarded as unknown in about three-quarters of patients; however, massively parallel gene-sequencing studies showed the importance of gene mutations in the etiology of epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thomas and Berkovic, 2014</xref>). Among those epileptic conditions linked to channelopathies, mutations in potassium channel subunits represent the largest category (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brenner and Wilcox, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noebels, 2003</xref>). Together with KCNA1, KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 are the earliest identified K<sup>+</sup> channels associated with idiopathic epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogawski, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroeder et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Browne et al., 1994</xref>). More than 30 mutations have been detected in KCNQ channels, most of which were found in KCNQ2: only four mutations were found in KCNQ3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maljevic et al., 2010</xref>). These mutations caused a reduction in channel activity by different molecular mechanisms, by which all can lead to membrane depolarization and increased neuronal firing.</p><p>In the central nervous system (CNS), heteromeric KCNQ2/3 potassium channels form the M-current, a subthreshold potassium current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jentsch, 2000</xref>). Due to the slow gating kinetics, M-currents effectively oppose sustained membrane depolarization and repetitive action potential (AP) firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Passmore, 2009</xref>). Thus, breakdown of M-channels by loss of function mutations or pharmacological inhibitors leads to neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroeder et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). KCNQ potassium channels are standouts for epileptologists, in that they are both mutated in human epilepsy and principal targets of an approved anti-epileptic drug (ezogabine/retigabine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gunthorpe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soldovieri et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, regulation of KCNQ channel activity has been studied by many groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). Notably, M-channels are inhibited by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists, leading to a profound increase in cellular excitability that can be reversed by the withdrawal of receptor agonist. Some subtypes of receptors for dopamine, serotonin, glutamate, and several peptide neurotransmitters, including luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone and bradykinin, are also found to be capable of inhibiting the M-channels. An important property of M-channels is that they require membrane phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) to open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>), and the certain receptors mentioned above suppress M-current by depletion of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>). In addition, M-channels are also inhibited by CaM in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent manner, providing another mode of intracellular modulation of M-channel activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamper and Shapiro, 2003</xref>). Recent work indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of the KCNQ2 subunit reduces the affinity for its PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, sumoylation of KCNQ channels results in reduced channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, all regulatory pathways discovered so far act on the KCNQ channels to reduce the channel activity and increase neuronal excitability. Given its important role in stabilization of neuronal excitability, <italic>there has</italic> been much speculation for regulatory mechanisms to increase the channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction and channel activities, however, to date <italic>there is no</italic> evidence supporting such regulatory mechanism.</p><p>Protein methylation, along with phosphorylation, controls a variety of cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson et al., 2009</xref>). Protein arginine methyltransferases (Prmts) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group to arginine residues of histone or non-histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvert et al., 2005</xref>). In mammals, nine Prmts have been characterized. Among these, Prmt1, originally identified as a histone H4 methyltransferase, methylates many non-histone proteins and implicated in diverse cellular processes including RNA processing, transcriptional regulation, oncogenesis, cell survival, insulin signaling, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisvert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krause et al., 2007</xref>). Although Prmt1 is a predominant Prmt in mammalian cells and is highly expressed in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nicholson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>), its functional significance in the CNS has not yet been identified.</p><p>The positively charged (basic) arginines or lysines are candidates for mediating electrostatic interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub> in channels such as KCNQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez et al., 2008</xref>), Kir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopes et al., 2002</xref>), and GIRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). Considering that each additional methyl group to an arginine residue can readily modulate their physical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford and Clarke, 2009</xref>), methylation of arginine residues in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding domain may alter KCNQ channels' affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub>. However it is not known whether such methylation really occurs and regulates the channel activity and whether it is implicated in common disease phenotypes. In the present study, the role of arginine methylation of KCNQ in regulation of channel activities and neuronal excitability was investigated. <italic>Prmt1</italic>-heterozygous (+/-) mice exhibit epileptic seizures. We also found that <italic>Prmt1</italic> depletion causes a decreased interaction between PIP<sub>2</sub> and KCNQ channels, consequently causing a reduction in KCNQ channel activity. Prmt1 interacts and methylates at 4 arginine residues of KCNQ channels. Hippocampal neurons from the heterozygote mice lack KCNQ currents, and the current can be restored by exogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> addition, accompanied by concomitant rescue of normal excitability. Furthermore a pharmacological inhibition of methylation or methylation-deficient mutants of KCNQ2 reduce PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and activities of KCNQ channels. These data demonstrate that protein arginine methylation facilitates KCNQ channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction, leading to seizure suppression. We propose that Prmt1-dependent regulation of KCNQ channels represents an important mechanism of neuronal protection against over-excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Prmt1+/-</italic> mice show spontaneous seizure activity</title><p>To assess the physiological importance of Prmt1 in the CNS, we utilized mutant mice for the <italic>Prmt1</italic> gene in a C57BL/6J background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2012</xref>).

To identify neural mechanisms underlying spontaneous seizure activities in <italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- mice, we performed electrophysiological recordings from the dentate gyrus granule cells (GCs) of hippocampal slices from WT and mutant mice. GCs from WT mice typically displayed tonic firing patterns in response to a 1-s square current pulse injection: AP frequency elevated as the magnitude of the square pulse increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>).

An increase in neuronal excitability without a change in AP height and width indicated that the kinetics and amplitude of voltage-gated currents associated with the spike itself were not affected. Increased cation current or leak current was unlikely to be involved in the phenotype, either, as this would be expected to result in a decrease in input resistance. Thus, the most probable target was the KCNQ/M channel. KCNQs are voltage-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels that partially open at the resting membrane potential. Inhibiting the KCNQ channel increases both input resistance and neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jentsch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Passmore, 2009</xref>).

After the MTA treatment, AP frequency in response to a 200 pA depolarizing current was 34.7 ± 4.6 Hz.

Four arginine residues such as Arg333 (R333), Arg345 (R345), Arg353 (R353), and Arg435 (R435), were identified as methylated in vivo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine whether Prmt1 methylates KCNQ2, we performed in vitro methylation assays using various bacterially purified GST-Prmts (Prmt1-6) or myc-tagged Prmt5 purified from HEK293T cells and GST-KCNQ2 (amino acids 320–449) that contain all of four arginine residues identified by mass spectrometry. GST-KCNQ2 was methylated by Prmt1, but not by other Prmts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). We next examined whether the newly identified methylation sites were direct targets for methylation by Prmt1. KCNQ2 mutants in each of which either R333, R345, R353, or R435 were substituted with lysine (further referred as RK mutants) were generated and analyzed by in vitro methylation assay with Prmt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). While the single arginine-to-lysine substitutions did not result in observable decrease of methylation (data not shown), the reduction in KCNQ2 methylation was readily detected with the double RK mutants, R333K/R353K, R345K/R353K, or R345K/R435K. This was further declined in the triple mutant of R333K/R345K/R353K, compared to double mutants. Furthermore, substitution of the four Arg’s in KCNQ2 (4RK, R333K/R345K/R353K/R435K) completely abolished the methylation by Prmt1, suggesting that these four arginine residues are critical targets for Prmt1-dependent methylation.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17159.019</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Mono- and dimethylated peptides identified from KCNQ2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17159.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17159.019</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Peptide*</th><th valign="top">Modification</th><th valign="top">Charge state</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><sup>332</sup>R<bold>R</bold>NPAAGLIQSAWR<sup>345</sup></td><td valign="top">Mono-methylated R333</td><td valign="top">+3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><sup>334</sup>NPAAGLIQSAW<bold>R</bold><sup>345</sup></td><td valign="top">Mono-methylated R345</td><td valign="top">+2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><sup>346</sup>FYATNLS<bold>R</bold><sup>353</sup></td><td valign="top">Di-methylated R353</td><td valign="top">+2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><sup>435</sup><bold>R</bold>SPSADQSLEDSPSK<sup>449</sup></td><td valign="top">Di-methylated R435</td><td valign="top">+3</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><p>*Methylated amino acid residues are highlighted in bold.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>To test whether Prmt1 methylates KCNQ2 in vivo, HEK293T cells expressing HA-KCNQ2 were transfected with control or <italic>Prmt1</italic> shRNA, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-KCNQ2 antibodies and immunoblotting with antibodies to asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and KCNQ2. <italic>Prmt1</italic> knockdown specifically decreased the ADMA-positive KCNQ2 levels, suggesting that KCNQ2 methylation is sensitive to Prmt1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>).

Interestingly, the methylated arginine residues, R333, R345, R353, and R435, reside in the PIP<sub>2</sub>-binding domain of KCNQ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez et al., 2008</xref>). This led us to postulate that methylation might affect the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding affinity of KCNQ2 thereby regulating channel activities.</p><p>To appraise the affinity of PIP<sub>2</sub> for KCNQ2, we utilized neomycin, which is widely used to sequester PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liscovitch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suh and Hille, 2007</xref>).Since neomycin is a polycation that binds specifically to PIP<sub>2</sub>, it has been used to determine the PIP<sub>2</sub> content in biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arbuzova et al., 2000</xref>). The neomycin sensitivity of ion channels such as Kir and KCNQ is well regarded as a measure of its PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haider et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suh and Hille, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosenko et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulze et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, ion channels with high PIP<sub>2</sub> affinities are expected to be less sensitive to neomycin than those with low PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity. Inclusion of 10 μM neomycin in the patch pipette solution led to a moderate inhibition of the WT KCNQ2 current in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, mutant channels with reduced methylation showed greatly increased inhibition by 10 mM neomycin. So, the remaining current at 10 min time points after rupturing the membrane is significantly reduced from 81.2 ± 1.9% (WT, n = 5) to 48.7 ± 4.2% (R333K, n = 5, p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). We measured dose-responses to neomycin. In comparison with WT, methylation-deficient mutant KCNQ2 (R333K, R345K, R353K, R435K) exhibited a higher sensitivity to neomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), suggesting lower PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity. To directly examine whether these channels have different PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, we included 20 μM or 200 μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the patch pipette solution and measured current augmentation after rupturing the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c and d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). WT KCNQ2 did not show increase in current by diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> even at 200 μM, suggesting that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> might be at a saturating concentration. In contrast, methylation-deficient mutant KCNQ2 (R333K, R345K, R353K, R435K, 4RK) showed a dose-dependent increase in current but they did not reach to WT level at corresponding concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Only R333K reached to the WT level when introduced to 200 μM PIP<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, 4RK appeared to be most severely affected in PIP<sub>2</sub> binding. Altered PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity in RK mutants was also assessed by a voltage-sensitive phosphatase from Danio rerio (Dr-VSP), which hydrolyzes PIP<sub>2</sub> at highly depolarized voltages (e.g., +100 mV) and transiently reduces the PIP<sub>2</sub> level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rjasanow et al., 2015</xref>). Dr-VSP was coexpressed with WT KCNQ2 or RK mutants and its activity was elicited by membrane depolarization. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falkenburger et al., 2010</xref>), activation of Dr-VSP reduced WT KCNQ2 currents and currents were recovered quickly after PIP<sub>2</sub> resynthesis on repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 7—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). When subjecting RK mutants to the same VSP activation protocol, the overall behavior was similar to the WT KCNQ2 channel; however, the recovery of current was slowed 2–4 folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 7—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). The mean time to the 70% maximum current (T<sub>70</sub>) for R333K, R345K, R353K and R435Kwas 22.8 ± 3.7, 24.1 ± 1.9, 32.1 ± 2.6, and 17.9 ± 1.5 s, respectively (p&lt;0.05 vs WT:9.5 ± 3.1 s). The slowed recovery after VSP reflects the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rjasanow et al., 2015</xref>), further supporting for the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of RK mutants. Taken together, these data suggest that methylation of KCNQ2 channel regulates its interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub>.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17159.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Methylation of KCNQ2 determines its PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Pooled data show 10 μM neomycin-induced rundown of WT (●) and R333K (○) KCNQ2 currents.

Taken together, Prmt1 is prerequisite for cytoprotective enhancement of KCNQ currents in the milieu of oxidative stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we describe a novel regulatory mechanism whereby methylation of KCNQ2 affects KCNQ/M channel activities and overall excitabilities of the brain. The heterozygous reduction of the <italic>Prmt1</italic> gene dose in mice caused spontaneous seizures. The elevated neuronal excitability in <italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- mice appears to be a direct result of reduced KCNQ/M channel activities in that KCNQ2 from the <italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- brain was less asymmetrically methylated and showed diminished affinity to PIP<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the activation of KCNQ channel under oxidative stress as well as its basal activity at rest depends on protein arginine methylation. It is well known that ROS generated under oxidative stress induces augmentation of KCNQ currents in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>). The resulting reduction in neuronal discharge lowers electrical activity of the cell and energy consumption, thereby providing an important mechanism of protecting neurons from the oxidative stress-induced death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gamper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Won et al., 2002</xref>). Considering that oxidative stress is also involved in induction of seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Patel, 2004</xref>), the impairment of neuroprotective KCNQ activation in response to oxidative stress, may contribute to spontaneous seizures together with the reduced basal activity of KCNQ channels in <italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- mice. Protein arginine methylation is a unique post-translational modification that increases the KCNQ/M channel function unlike other known regulatory signaling pathways, and thus provides a platform for the design of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy and other neuronal hyperexcitability disorders.</p><p>Our results find that 4 arginine residues (R333, R345, R353, and R435) are the major methylation sites in KCNQ2. Interestingly, all of the methylation sites reside within the C-terminal PIP<sub>2</sub> binding domain. This is known as a 'hot spot', as it serves as binding sites for multiple signaling molecules as well as PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delmas and Brown, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hernandez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>). The observation that decreased methylation lowers PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity proposes that Prmt1 methylation on the arginine residues would increase channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction. Indeed, previous computational analyses revealed that methylation renders the guanidinium of arginines to be more electron-rich and thus to exhibit higher pKa values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shearer, 2008</xref>), which would stabilize the positive charge of the arginine residue in proteins in the physiological condition and thereby likely facilitate their electrostatic interaction with negatively charged molecules. Thus, it is conceivable that arginine methylation is required for the KCNQ channel activity because it promotes electrostatic binding of KCNQ proteins to PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Various KCNQ channel mutations associated with epilepsy have been shown to cause a reduction in M-channel activity, which all can lead to membrane depolarization and increased neuronal firing via diverse mechanisms. Mutations in the C-terminal region of KCNQ channels reduce channel activities by interfering with channel targeting to the surface membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwake et al., 2000</xref>), protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soldovieri et al., 2006</xref>), interaction with calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jentsch, 2000</xref>), or modulation by cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schroeder et al., 1998</xref>). Mutations affecting the pore region of KCNQ2 may reduce currents by affecting ion channel conductance, while mutations at the S4 domain affect channel gating and increase the threshold for channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maljevic et al., 2010</xref>). It is interesting in this context that R353G, a mutant of one of the major methylation sites identified in this study, is linked to familial epilepsy, likely due to reduced calmodulin binding and a consequent defect in membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jentsch, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etxeberria et al., 2008</xref>). However, a recent study proposed an additional pathophysiological mechanism involving a diminished PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of the channel for this epileptic KCNQ2 mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kosenko et al., 2012</xref>). This is in agreement with our current study indicating that disruption of KCNQ2 channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction caused by decreased methylation is a key mechanism linked to neuronal hyperactivity.</p><p><italic>Like KCNQ2,</italic> KCNQ<italic>3</italic> channel contains conserved methylation sites within the PIP<sub>2</sub> biding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) suggesting that arginine methylation might be also involved in regulation of channel-PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction in KCNQ3 channels as well. Considering that the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 complex produces M-currents, hypo-methylation of either KCNQs might significantly diminish M-currents and neuronal hyperexcitability. The positively charged arginines are also important for electrostatic interaction with PIP<sub>2</sub> in other PIP<sub>2</sub>-sensitive channels and transporters such as Kir2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lopes et al., 2002</xref>), and GIRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> is required for proper function of many plasma membrane ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hilgemann et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, methylation can be a general mechanism for regulating ion flux physiology. Consistent with this, our results show that the effects of KCNQ channel block on firing rates are not the same as those of Prmt1 block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), implying a possible involvement of other Prmt1 target(s) in neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. PIP<sub>2</sub> loading to <italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- GCs recovered the firing properties significantly but incompletely. It appears that SK and BK channels are not involved in this matter. Thus further studies are required to identify other Prmt1 targets in the control of neuronal excitability. Regardless, the results presented here provide the first direct evidence of functional role for protein arginine methylation in the control of neuronal excitability and also offers a platform to further investigate the physiological and pathophysiological roles of KCNQ/M channel activity in CNS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p><italic>Prmt1</italic>+/- mice were obtained from EUCOMM consortium (C57BL/6N agouti background) and backcrossed onto C57BL/6J background for at least 5 generations before being used for the experiment as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi et al., 2012</xref>).

After 48 hrs, the lentivirus-containing culture media were harvested. 293T cells were infected by 0.45 μm-filtered supernatant from virus-producing cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. After 2 days, the puromycin-resistant cells were maintained with 2 μg/ml puromycin. Medium containing puromycin was replaced every 2 days until puromycin-resistant stable cell lines were established.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell culture, transfection and recording</title><p>Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T cells (ATCC, USA, Virginia) were maintained in Dulbecco’s modification of Eagle’s medium (Gibco-BRL, USA, California) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. For transient transfections, cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagents (Invitrogen, USA, California) and green fluorescent protein was used as a reporter to label the transfectants. The KCNQ currents from HEK293T cells were measured with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Voltage clamp was performed using an EPC-10 amplifier (HEKA Instruments, Germany, Lambrecht/Pfalz) at a sampling rate of 10 kHz filteredat 1kHz. Data were acquired using an IBM-compatible computer running Patchmaster software (HEKA Instruments, Germany, Lambrecht/Pfalz). The patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate capillaries(Hilgenberg-GmbH, Germany, Malsfeld) using a Narishige puller (PC-10, Narishige, Japan, Tokyo). The patch pipettes had a resistance of 2–3 MW when filled with the pipette solution containing (in mM) 140 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 20 KCl, 20 HEPES, 0.5 Na-GTP, 5 Mg-ATP, 4 vitamin C, and 10 1,2-bis (2-aminophenoxy) ethane <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>_,<italic>N</italic>_-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), pH 7.4 adjusted with KOH.

Pipette capacitance was compensated after formation of a gigaohm seal. Access resistance was typically 2.8–3.2 MΩ. The perfusion system was a homemade 100-μl perfusion chamber through which solution flowed continuously at 5 ml/min. The currents from HEK293T cells were studied by holding the cell at −60 mV, and 1-s steps from −70 to 40 mV in 10-mV increments were applied, followed by 1-s pulses to −60 mV. All recordings were carried out at room temperature (RT).</p><p>Currents were analyzed and fitted using <italic>Patch master</italic> (HEKA Instruments, Germany, Lambrecht/Pfalz) and Origin (ver. 6.0, Microcal, USA, Massachusetts) software. All values are given as mean ± standard error. I/V relationship were obtained by plotting the outward current at the end of a 1-s test pulse as a function of the test potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>Cells were lysed in NETN lysis buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 1 hr at 4ºC. Following lysis, the cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Total cell extracts were incubated with appropriate antibodies for 4 hrs at 4°C and Protein G plus/Protein A-agarose (Calbiochem, USA, California) was added, and the incubation was continued for 2 hrs. After incubation, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NETN lysis buffer and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with TBS containing 5% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 30 min at RT. The membranes were incubated with appropriate primary antibody for 2 hr at RT. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times for 10 min, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT. After washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 three times for 10 min, proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescent (ECL) system (GE Healthcare, USA, Chicago). Primary antibodies used in this study were as follows: Prmt1 (1:1000, Millipore, USA, Massachusetts), ADMA (1:1000, Cell Signaling, USA, Massachusetts), α-tubulin (1:2000, Cell signaling, USA, Massachusetts), KCNQ2 (1:1000 Abcam, UK, Cambridge), Hsp90 and PRMT8 (1:1000, Santa Cruz, USA, Texas), α-Flag, α-Myc, α-HA and α-GST (1:1000, Abfrontier, South Korea, Seoul), and GAPDH (1:2000, Abfrontier, South Korea, Seoul).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Peptide analysis with mass spectrometry</title><p>For mass analysis of KCNQ2 proteins, HA-KCNQ2 expression vectors were tranfected into HEK293T cells. Cells were lysed in NETN lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A for 1 hr at 4°C.

After incubation, immunoprecipitates were washed three times with NETN lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. In-gel digestion was carried out with 12.5 ng/µl sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega, USA, Wisconsin) in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> buffer (pH 7.8) at 37°C for overnight. Produced tryptic peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid in 50% ACN solution at room temperature for 20 min. The supernatants were collected and dried with SpeedVac. Resuspended samples in 0.1% formic acid were purified and concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, USA, Massachusetts) before MS analysis.</p><p>The tryptic peptides were loaded onto a fused silica microcapillary column (12 cm × 75 µm) packed with C18 reversed phase resin (5 µm, 200 Å). Peptide separation was conducted with a series of step gradients composed of initial isobaric flow for 5 min with 3% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile), then linear gradient from 3% to 40% for 40 min. At the end of each running, 90% of solvent B was eluted for 10 min with the flow rate 250 nL/min. The% gradient of solvent B was against solvent A (0.1% formic acid in H<sub>2</sub>O). The column was directly connected to LTQ linear ion-trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, USA, New Jersey) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source. The electrospray voltage was set at 1.95 kV, and the threshold for switching from MS to MS/MS was 500. The normalized collision energy for MS/MS was 35% of main radio frequency amplitude (RF) and the duration of activation was 30 ms. All spectra were acquired in data-dependent scan mode. Each full MS scan was followed by five MS/MS scan corresponding from the most intense to the fifth intense peaks of full MS scan. The acquired LC-ESI-MS/MS fragment spectra were searched against a modified NCBI protein reference database using Mascot program. The searching conditions were trypsin enzyme specificity, a permissible level for three missed cleavages, peptide tolerance; the amu, a mass error of amu on fragment ions, fixed modification of carbamidomethylation of cysteine, and variable modifications of oxidation of methionine, monomethylation of arginine and dimethylation of arginine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro methylation assay</title><p>Purified recombinant GST-KCNQ2 (amino acids 320–449) proteins were incubated for 3 hrs at 37°C with 1 μg of recombinant GST-Prmts in 30 μl methylation buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5 μCi of <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-L-[<italic>methyl</italic>- <sup>3</sup>H]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, USA, Massachusetts).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.

The PRMT1 +/- mice are shown to have spontaneous seizures as well as a change in excitability of dentate granule neurons of the hippocampus, accompanied by a smaller M-current in those neurons. Through a series of electrophysiological and biochemical evidence, the authors show that KCNQ2 channels are indeed methylated and directly interact with PRMT1. The targeted arginines are within a previously identified KCNQ2 PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site, leading to the proposal that methylation of KCNQ2 channels alters their affinity for PIP<sub>2</sub>. likely producing changes in their probability of opening.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Both reviewers found the main findings of the manuscript to be interesting and convincing. Certain parts of the study, however, require further clarification and/or experimentation. The key points that must be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1) The evidence presented makes it seem likely that PRMT1 may influence more channels than just KCNQ. Please consider and acknowledge the possibility and/or likelihood of PRMT1 actions at other K channels, especially taking into account the quantitative elements of the changes observed (detailed below in Reviewers' Specific Point 1).</p><p>2) The interpretation of the PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity experiments raised a number of questions. Please improve the measurements of PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity, ideally by new experiments with CiVSP and/or by clarifying the apparent quantitative inconsistencies within the dataset (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) and differences from the literature (detailed below in Reviewers' Specific Point 2).</p><p>3) Aspects of the results with peroxide were unclear. Please clarify by discussing why methylation appears required for the peroxide-mediated augmentation of current, even though the effect of methylation can occur in channel mutants not susceptible to peroxide modulation (detailed below in Reviewers' Specific Point 3).</p><p>The Reviewers' General Comments are also included for your information.</p><p>Reviewers' General Comments:</p><p>This well-designed study shows a dramatic and interesting effect of protein arginine methylation on the epilepsy in mice and on the KCNQ2/3 (M-current) channels, mutations of which have previously been linked to epilepsy. The PRMT1 +/- mice are shown to have spontaneous epileptic seizures as well as a dramatic change in the excitability of the dentate granule neurons of the hippocampus. The authors nicely show that PRMT1 associates with the KCNQ2 channel, or with its isolated C-terminus, by immunoprecipitation. They use LC-MS to identify the four arginines that are methylated in KCNQ2, and to show that substituting 2 to 4 of these arginines reduces (or eliminates) the methylation. These mutations also dramatically reduce the KCNQ2 currents in a heterologous system, though they did not eliminate protein expression or the current in the presence of the channel activator retigabine.</p><p>The goal of this study is to understand the mechanism by which loss of PRMT1, an arginine methyltransferase, leads to hyperexcitability and seizures in mice. In particular, the authors show that dentate granule cells from PRMT1 heterozygous mice fire a greater number of action potentials and have increased input resistance. Based on this data, they speculated loss of PRMT1 most likely caused a decreased to the M-current (KCNQ2/3), a potassium conductance critical for neuronal excitability. This is the first demonstration of KCNQ2 channels being targeted for methylation. The evidence that KCNQ2 channels are methylated is convincing.</p><p>Reviewers' Specific Points (expanding on essential revisions):</p><p>1) While the conclusions about PRMT1 effects on KCNQ2 are convincing, there is clearly another major contribution to the altered DGN excitability. This is not denied by the authors, but it is practically ignored until the penultimate sentence of the paper. It would be much better to acknowledge this contribution much earlier in the paper, and then to have a slightly more complete discussion of the differences between the PRMT1 +/- phenotype, the only partial ability to mimic it with XE991 blockade of KCNQ2, and the only partial ability to reverse it with PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>In fact, the authors show that PRMT1 deficiency shifts the firing frequency of DGC from 8Hz to 31Hz, an almost 4 fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). They attribute this change to the complete absence of M-current in PRMT1+/- DGC. However, application of XE991 at a concentration that completely blocks the M-current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) only shifts the AP frequency in wild-type cells from 8Hz to 13Hz. As such, what evidence do the authors have that no additional potassium currents that are also PIP<sub>2</sub> dependent (SK, sAHP) and are known to control DGC firing properties did not change in cells deficient in PRMT1?</p><p>Further, the authors argue that the M-current is likely the main culprit for the change in the firing rate in PRMT1 het mice because application of XE991 in PRMT1+/- DGC did not have any additional effect. However, the lack of change in the firing rate by XE991 might be due to a ceiling effect as the PRMT1+/- DGC fired at 34Hz when XE991 was applied, unlike the control cells that fired at 8Hz. The authors should have tested the effect of XE991 in neurons that fired the same number of action potentials by simply adjusting the injected current. The same ceiling issue is for all experiments done with XE991 in the presence of different PRMT1 blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). By not controlling the number of AP, one can get very misleading results.</p><p>2) To correctly quantify the change in PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity in KCNQ2 mutants (R to K substitutions), the authors should have co-transfected their cells with the KCNQ2 mutant channels and Ci-VSP, a voltage-activated PIP<sub>2</sub> phosphatase (currently, the standard methodology). Using this approach the rate and extent of KCNQ2/3 current inhibition following PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion as well as the rate of current recovery following PIP<sub>2</sub> restoration could be measured. Also relating to this point, the authors state that inclusion of 200uM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the pipette did not increase KCNQ2 currents suggesting that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> might be at saturating concentrations (subsection Arginine methylation of KCNQ2 is required for maintaining PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity”, third paragraph). This finding is inconsistent with all previous papers on KCNQ2 channels and PIP<sub>2</sub>. See work by Shapiro and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> as well as Brown DA and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> and KCNQ2 and KCNQ2/3 channels. All papers agree that increasing endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> levels leads to an increase in KCNQ2/3 currents, as their PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity is low.</p><p>3) Regarding the experiments with hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), it is known that the hydrogen peroxide induced increase in KCNQ2/3 currents is due to its action on a series of cysteines in the KCNQ2 and not through arginines on the S6 (Gamper et al.. 2006), cited by the authors. So, it is unclear why mutating S6 arginines alone leads to abrogation of the hydrogen peroxide effect on KCNQ2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Please clarify.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17159.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewers' Specific Points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) While the conclusions about PRMT1 effects on KCNQ2 are convincing, there is clearly another major contribution to the altered DGN excitability.

In addition to firing rates, we analyzed all the parameters of intrinsic firing properties including threshold current, input resistance, and resting membrane potential. PRMT1+/- GCs required ~90pA less current injection than WT GCs to achieve AP, which we think facilitates their AP initiation and, hence, increase in spike number. The change in the threshold currentin PRMT1+/- neurons reflects the change of input resistance. Thus, it is of note that, even though XE991 treatment fully recapitulates firing rates observed in PRMT1+/- mice, it does increase input resistance to the level that was not different from that in PRMT1+/- mice. On the other hand, XE991 reduced threshold current by ~30pA, which is less effective than PRMT1 blocker.</p><p>DiC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> loading <italic>reversed firing rates</italic> in PRMT1+/- GCs (&lt;0.05). For example, with 200pA current injection for 1 sec, WT GCs fired 9 APs while PRMT1+/- GCs fired 31 APs, which returned to 15 APs with diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> loading. To analyze PIP<sub>2</sub> effects in detail, we examined threshold current and input resistance. With diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub>, threshold current was also reversed from 115 pA to 175pA, which is close to the WT level, 199pA. Thus firing rates and threshold current are rescued significantly but incompletely by diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub>. Input resistance, however, was fully rescued to the WT level by PIP<sub>2</sub> loading (p&gt;0.05 vs WT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>).</p><p>Thus, there might be another factor(s) contributing to reduction of threshold current and increase of firing rates. We suspected the persistent Na<sup>+</sup> current or Na<sup>+</sup> leak channel because their activation might afford the additional reduction of threshold current with little effect on input resistance. Regardless of this possible explanation, our study showed the solid link between PRMT1 and KCNQ/M channels taking advantage of various approaches involving in situ and heterologous electrophysiology.</p><p>As the reviewers suggested, we acknowledge the possible involvement of channels other than KCNQ in the Results section of the revised manuscript and have added a slightly more complete discussion about this point in the Discussion section.</p><p>In the Results:</p><p>“Thus, these results showed that PRMT1+/- GCs displayed a high firing rate at baseline, and their firings did not further increase during XE-991 application, suggesting that defective M-current contributes to the neuronal hyperexcitability observed in the PRMT1+/- mice. However, we cannot exclude the potential involvement of other PRMT1 target(s) in the neuronal hyperexcitability observed in the PRMT1+/- mice.”</p><p><bold>“</bold>Although the recovery of excitability with PIP<sub>2</sub> application was significant it was incomplete, suggesting the possible involvement of other PRMT1 target(s) in neuronal hyperexcitability.

PIP<sub>2</sub> loading to PRMT1+/- GCs recovered the firing properties significantly but incompletely. It appears that SK and BK channels are not involved in this matter. Thus further studies are required to identify other PRMT1 targets in the control of neuronal excitability.”</p><p><italic>In fact, the authors show that PRMT1 deficiency shifts the firing frequency of DGC from 8Hz to 31Hz, an almost 4 fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). They attribute this change to the complete absence of M-current in PRMT1+/- DGC. However, application of XE991 at a concentration that completely blocks the M-current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) only shifts the AP frequency in wild-type cells from 8Hz to 13Hz. As such, what evidence do the authors have that no additional potassium currents that are also PIP<sub>2</sub> dependent (SK, sAHP) and are known to control DGC firing properties did not change in cells deficient in PRMT1?</italic></p><p>SK and BK channels are known to regulate membrane excitability of dentate gyrus GCs (Nat Neurosci. 8, 1752-1759) and are also PIP<sub>2</sub>-dependent (Nat Chem Biol. 10, 753-759; J Biol Chem. 289, 18860-18872). Using apamin and paxilline, specific SK and BK channel blockers, respectively, we examined whether SK and/or BK channels were altered in PRMT1-deficient GCs. Consistent with previous studies (Nat Neurosci. 8, 1752-1759), the AP firing rate of control WT GCs was markedly increased by SK channel blockade (see attached figure below) whereas paxilline had little effect on control WT GCs. Similar responses were observed in dentate gyrus GCs pretreated with furamidine, a PRMT1 inhibitor. They displayed a high firing rate at baseline, and their firings further increased by apamin application, but not by paxilline. These data illustrate that neither SK nor BK channel activities are altered in PRMT1-deficient GCs.</p><p>We added new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>, and included the following in the Results:</p><p><bold>“</bold>As immediate candidates, we tested other K<sup>+</sup> channels such as SK and BK channels in PRMT1 effects which are known to regulate membrane excitability of dentate gyrus GCs (Brenner et al., 2005). The data obtained by using apamin and paxilline, specific SK and BK channel blockers, respectively, ruled out that the contribution of these channels in hyperexcitability of PRMT1-deficient GCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Further, the authors argue that the M-current is likely the main culprit for the change in the firing rate in PRMT1 het mice because application of XE991 in PRMT1+/- DGC did not have any additional effect. However, the lack of change in the firing rate by XE991 might be due to a ceiling effect as the PRMT1+/- DGC fired at 34Hz when XE991 was applied, unlike the control cells that fired at 8Hz. The authors should have tested the effect of XE991 in neurons that fired the same number of action potentials by simply adjusting the injected current. The same ceiling issue is for all experiments done with XE991 in the presence of different PRMT1 blockers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). By not controlling the number of AP, one can get very misleading results.</italic></p><p>In each condition, spike trains in dentate gyrus granule cells were evoked by injecting 1s depolarizing current pulses of different intensities (from 100 to 400pA, 50-pA increment) into the cell before and after application of XE991. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref> show the mean number of action potentials (AP No.) plotted against the wide range of eliciting currents (100-400 pA) although we presented only the mean AP No. against 200pA in text. As you may see in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, at 100pA current injection, the mean AP firing frequency in PRMT1+/- GCs was 8Hz, which is the same number of APs in WT GCs at 200-pA current injection. In contrast to WT GCs, however, it did not further increase upon XE991 treatment (P&gt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The same applies to GCs treated with different PRMT1 blockers. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and G</xref>, at 100-pA current injection, MTA- or furamidine-treated GCs fired at 10Hz and 6HZ, respectively and they did not respond to XE991 treatment (P&gt;0.05). These data suggest that the lack of change in the firing rate by XE991 in methylation-deficient GCs is not due to a ceiling effect, but rather due to loss of M currents. In addition, the increase of firing rates in furamidine-pretreated GCs in response to apamin also rules out the ceiling effects (see point #1-2).</p><p><italic>2) To correctly quantify the change in PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity in KCNQ2 mutants (R to K substitutions), the authors should have co-transfected their cells with the KCNQ2 mutant +channels and Ci-VSP, a voltage-activated PIP<sub>2</sub> phosphatase (currently, the standard methodology). Using this approach the rate and extent of KCNQ2/3 current inhibition following PIP<sub>2</sub> depletion as well as the rate of current recovery following PIP<sub>2</sub> restoration could be measured.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we co-transfected HEK293T cells with KCNQ2 channels and voltage-activated phosphatase (Dr-VSP, a zebrafish Ci-VSP homolog). Both Ci-VSP and Dr-VSP were widely used for quantification of PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (Front Pharmacol 2015 Jun 19;6:127). Consistent with previous reports (J Gen Physiol. 135, 99-114), WT KCNQ2 current was reduced by activation of VSP and fully recovered after repolarization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The recovery of WT KCNQ2 current was fitted with a single exponential; Mean recovery time constants for current were 7.0 ± 1.1s (n=9). When subjecting RK mutants to the same VSP activation protocol, the overall behavior appeared to be similar to the WT KCNQ2 channel. The remaining current of RK mutants was small but still responsive to VSP activation. However, recovery of RK mutants was slower than that of WT channels and it was not well fitted with the single-exponential function. Thus, to compare recovery kinetics between WT KCNQ2 channels and RK mutants, we calculated the time to the 70% maximum current (T<sub>70</sub>). Compared to T<sub>70</sub> of WT KCNQ2 channels, T<sub>70</sub>s of RK mutants were significantly increased (P&lt;0.05). Taken together, these data are in alignment with the conclusion that hypomethylation of KCNQ2 channels diminishes PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of KCNQ channels.</p><p>We added new data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>, and modified the text in the Results to read:</p><p>“Altered PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity in RK mutants was also assessed by a voltage-sensitive phosphatase from <italic>Danio rerio</italic> (Dr-VSP), which hydrolyzes PIP<sub>2</sub> at highly depolarized voltages (e.g., +100 mV) and transiently reduces the PIP<sub>2</sub> level (Falkenburger et al., 2010; Rjasanow et al., 2015). Dr-VSP was coexpressed with WT KCNQ2 or RK mutants, and its activity was elicited by membrane depolarization. Consistent with a previous report (Falkenburger et al., 2010), activation of Dr-VSP reduced WT KCNQ2 currents, which were recovered quickly after PIP<sub>2</sub> resynthesis on repolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). When subjecting RK mutants to the same VSP activation protocol, the overall behavior was similar to the WT KCNQ2 channel; however, recovery of current was slowed 2-4 folds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mean time to the 70% maximum current (T<sub>70</sub>) for R333K, R345K, R353K and R435Kwas 22.8 ± 3.7, 24.1 ± 1.9, 32.1 ± 2.6, and 17.9 ± 1.5 s, respectively (P&lt;0.05 vs WT:9.5 ± 3.1 s). The slowed recovery after VSP reflects the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity (Rjasanow et al., 2015), further supporting for the reduced PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity of RK mutants.”</p><p><italic>Also relating to this point, the authors state that inclusion of 200uM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> in the pipette did not increase KCNQ2 currents suggesting that endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> might be at saturating concentrations (subsection Arginine methylation of KCNQ2 is required for maintaining PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity”, third paragraph). This finding is inconsistent with all previous papers on KCNQ2 channels and PIP<sub>2</sub>. See work by Shapiro and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> as well as Brown DA and colleagues on PIP<sub>2</sub> and KCNQ2 and KCNQ2/3 channels. All papers agree that increasing endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> levels leads to an increase in KCNQ2/3 currents, as their PIP<sub>2</sub> affinity is low.</italic> </p><p>In fact, Brown DA and colleagues reported that 200μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> produced a significant reduction in the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine-M on M-currents. However diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> at 200μM did not affect the M-current density itself (J Neurosci. 26, 7950-7961) which is consistent with our data showing that whole-cell dialysis of 200μM diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> does not increase M currents in DG granule cells.</p><p>The discrepancy between the work from Shapiro laboratory and our current work might be due to the experimental designs used. Work from the Shapiro laboratory inquired about EC50 for single channel in CHO cell-excised inside-out patches (J Neurosci. 25, 9825-9835), while we examined the effects of diC8-PIP<sub>2</sub> on whole cell KCNQ currents. As several cellular factors can modulate PIP<sub>2</sub> sensitivity, EC50 value for single channel recording in inside-out patches can be different from that for whole-cell currents. Another possibility is the variable saturating concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> for KCNQ channels in different cell systems. For example, EC50 value for KCNQ2/KCNQ3 channels in CHO cells-excised patches was 40 μM (J Neurosci. 25, 9825-9835) while it was 87mM in oocytes-excised macropatches (Neuron 6, 963-975).</p><p><italic>3) Regarding the experiments with hydrogen peroxide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), it is known that the hydrogen peroxide induced increase in KCNQ2/3 currents is due to its action on a series of cysteines in the KCNQ2 and not through arginines on the S6 (Gamper et al. 2006), cited by the authors. So, it is unclear why mutating S6 arginines alone leads to abrogation of the hydrogen peroxide effect on KCNQ2 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Please clarify.</italic></p><p>As the reviewers point out, triple cysteines are required for augmentation of KCNQ channel activity induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2.</sub> Given that mutation of S6 arginines in KCNQ2 abrogates its PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, we propose an additional regulatory mechanism involving PIP<sub>2</sub> interaction of KCNQ2 channel for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effects.</p></body></sub-article></article>
