response to the loss of sleep can provide a window into the enigma of sleep function. Sleep loss is associated with brain differential gene expression, an increase in pyramidal cell mEPSC frequency and amplitude, and a characteristic rebound and resolution of slow wave sleep-slow wave activity (SWS-SWA). However, the molecular mechanism(s) mediating the sleep-loss response are not well understood. We show that sleep-loss regulates MEF2C phosphorylation, a key mechanism regulating MEF2C transcriptional activity, and that MEF2C function in postnatal excitatory forebrain neurons is required for the biological events in response to sleep loss in C57BL/6J mice. These include altered gene expression, the increase and recovery of synaptic strength, and the rebound and resolution of SWS-SWA, which implicate MEF2C as an essential regulator of sleep function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>MEF2C</kwd><kwd>slow wave activity</kwd><kwd>sleep deprivation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS103422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH102603</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC014702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Konopka</surname><given-names>Genevieve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000913</institution-id><institution>James S.

Following an extended period of waking, or sleep deprivation (SD), the mammalian cortex shows an altered pattern of EEG activity characterized by rebound slow wave power (delta power in the frequency range of 0.5–4.5 Hz) during the ensuing slow wave sleep (SWS; also referred to as NREM) periods. The amplitude of the rebound directly correlates with the previous waking or SD duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franken et al., 2001</xref>) implicating rebound SWS, slow wave activity (SWS-SWA) as a biomarker of sleep need. During SWS episodes, the rebound SWS-SWA increase resolves, consistent with resolution of sleep need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The buildup and resolution of sleep need is correlated with overall cortical, excitatory synaptic strength. Based on sleep-related modulation of excitatory synapse biochemistry, morphology and electrophysiological activity, a scaling-up during waking and a scaling-down during sleep have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bushey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Vivo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diering et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), although this may not necessarily be reflected by the neuronal firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hengen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watson et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Changes in synaptic transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noya et al., 2019</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diering et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noya et al., 2019</xref>) expression, required for synaptic down-scaling, are observed during the sleep phase in association with an average decrease in synapse size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Vivo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diering et al., 2017</xref>). Characterization of the cell-signaling biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for these sleep-related changes in protein expression is needed.</p><p>MEF2 transcription factors are critical regulators of activity-dependent synapse elimination (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Assali et al., 2019</xref>). MEF2C plays an essential role in development to control cortical synaptic connectivity, function and plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rajkovich et al., 2017</xref>). MEF2C’s activation results in excitatory synapse down-regulation with potential relevance for sleep, in that prolonged waking activity leads to excitatory synaptic scaling-down during ensuing sleep, as noted above. Neuronal activity associated with waking, that may include neuronal depolarization, firing and arousal-associated neuromodulator activity, can switch MEF2C from a transcriptional repressor to an activator. The switch depends on dephosphorylation of a conserved Serine (S396) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu and Gulick, 2004</xref>), and both the repressor and activator functions of MEF2C appear critical for its regulation of synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). However, the relationship between MEF2C and sleep-regulated transcripts, sleep-regulated excitatory synaptic strength and sleep-homeostatic EEG activity remains unexplored.</p><p>In this study, we examined neurobiological changes in the mouse frontal cortex in response to sleep loss, involving transcriptomic architecture, regulation of synaptic strength in excitatory cortical neurons and SWS-SWA, correlated with sleep need. As changes in neuronal activity may be observed across sleep-wake states, we investigated the possible role of MEF2C as a key regulator of sleep-related control of gene expression, sleep-related modulation of synaptic function and sleep-need correlated SWS-SWA buildup and resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wake-sleep mediated control of the transcriptome</title><p>To evaluate the effects of sleep loss, we compared three sleep-related conditions for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from samples of the frontal cortex (FC, the cortical region showing the highest power of SWS-SWA) of male C57BL/6J (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) including: (1) control sleep (CS; mice free to sleep, ad libitum; n = 6), (2) sleep deprived for 6 hr (SD; n = 7), and (3) sleep deprived for 4 hr followed by recovery sleep for 2 hr (RS; n = 7).

Comparing the SD samples to the CS samples, we observed 6,248 DEGs with roughly half the number of genes having decreased expression (FDR &lt;= 0.05; |log<sub>2</sub> (fold change)|&gt;=0.3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), confirming an earlier report of massive transcriptome changes associated with SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diessler et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, the RS cohort showed 3827 DEGs compared to CS, again with approximately half the number of genes showing decreased expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, only 81 genes showed significantly altered expression comparing the SD condition to RS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting that for the majority of SD-sensitive genes, RS is more than simply a direct recovery of altered gene expression back to CS levels. Rather, more than half of the differential expression initiated during SD is continued during RS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), significantly extending the SD-induced change.</p><p>Because SD may be considered stressful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mongrain et al., 2010</xref>), we compared classic glucocorticoid-mediated response genes to the increased DEGs observed in response to SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). No significant increase in glucocorticoid (GC) intracellular response genes was found in the upregulated SD DEGs (p-value=0.513 using Fisher’s exact test), suggesting a more SD-specific response than other GC-mediated stress responses.</p><p>This bulk transcriptomic analysis includes mRNA from all cell types found in frontal cortical tissue. Many of the genes expressed in these tissues are, nonetheless, cell-type specific, allowing potential correlation between DEGs specific for a sleep condition and specific cell types. Using previously published single-cell RNA-seq from the adult mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>), we identified cell-type-specific gene expression patterns across sleep conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the downregulated DEGs shared by SD and RS were enriched for genes associated with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, whereas the upregulated DEGs shared by SD and RS were enriched for non-neuronal genes that are down in the Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Emx1</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref> ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We also examined MEF2C target gene expression in response to SD or RS. We found that the downregulated DEGs shared by SD and RS were enriched for neuronal genes affected by <italic>Mef2c</italic> loss of function as previously observed in a conditional knockout of pan-neuronal <italic>Mef2c,</italic> Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Emx1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). Whereas the upregulated DEGs in response to SD and RS were enriched for <italic>Mef2c</italic> non-neuronal genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the DEGs altered by SD and RS in the cortex significantly overlap those altered by the loss of cortical MEF2C function.</p><p>We next functionally characterized the sleep-loss induced transcriptional changes shared by SD and RS states by carrying out a gene ontology (GO) analysis. Overall, there are distinct GO categories for the upregulated and downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The upregulated categories include mitochondrial components and signaling pathways of oxidative phosphorylation and anaplerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicative of energy mobilization, as well as anabolic protein metabolism that includes ribosomal components together with transcriptional, translational and related processes. These results are consistent with and extend those from a previous study using microarrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cirelli et al., 2004</xref>) that lead to a conclusion, ‘… that sleep, far from being a quiescent state of global inactivity, may actively favor specific cellular functions’. Recently, similar findings were reported in a RNA-seq analysis from C57BL/6J whole cortex and a ‘gentle handling’ method of SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Several studies provide converging evidence for a general decrease in cortical excitatory synaptic strength in association with sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Vivo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maret et al., 2011</xref>) with respect to protein expression in synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Diering et al., 2017</xref>) and spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents and frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyazovskiy et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed that the downregulated genes observed in SD and RS are enriched for GO categories reflecting synaptic biological processes and cellular components. These genes are also enriched for genes involved in diseases of cognition associated with abnormal synaptic function, including schizophrenia, autism, intellectual disability and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Some of the SD upregulated DEGs have a notable role as both transcription factors and/or first responders to neural activity and sensory stimulation. Rapid, primary response genes (rPRG) have been identified in cortical neuronal cultures as responders to both brief or 6 hr exposures to a depolarizing concentration of potassium in the presence of a translational blocker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tyssowski et al., 2018</xref>). We find that DEGs for CS compared to SD and/or RS conditions are significantly enriched for these rPRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, upregulated transcription factors were identified in visual cortex that responded to a short exposure to light after being in constant darkness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that 50% of these were upregulated DEGs for CS to SD (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, these upregulated, transcription factors in the visual cortex overlapped with DEGs from the FC, and showed sustained, increased expression even after 6 hr of SD-induced activation.</p><p>It was recently shown that the influence of circadian rhythms on gene transcript expression in synaptosomes was relatively unaffected by SD, although SD did prevent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noya et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, many core clock genes are known to affect sleep homeostasis and the expression of some core clock genes, in particular, <italic>Per2</italic>, are altered by SD, as previously reviewed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Franken, 2013</xref>). To control for circadian-mediated changes in gene expression, we assessed DEGs at the same circadian time, ZT6, changing only the 6 hr, immediate sleep history. In contrast to DEGs in synaptosomes, we observed in FC tissue that SD from ZT = 0 to 6 hr resulted in a number of core clock DEGs (compared to CS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), including downregulation of <italic>Arntl</italic>, <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Npas2</italic> and downregulation of a set of genes regulating circadian entrainment (MGI; GO:0009649). Taken together, these data are consistent with an SD-induced attenuation and destabilization of circadian-mediated gene expression and confirm recent observations using an RNA-seq assessment in time series together with SD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hor et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To further uncover the organizational architecture and prioritize the extensive SD-mediated transcriptome, we used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), with expressed genes from all three conditions (CS, SD, and RS) to generate a network of 59 modules. Many of the modules (53%) were enriched for either up or downregulated DEGs from CS to SD conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Most of those enriched for upregulation from CS to SD (n = 11), were also enriched for upregulation from CS to RS (n = 10), and similarly, most modules enriched for downregulation from CS to SD (n = 18) were also enriched for downregulation from CS to RS (n = 13), showing an organization primarily driven by DEGs, that is consistent between SD and RS conditions. The GO of these shared modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>) is also consistent with those seen using only the lists of DEGs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Coordinated transcriptomic responses with sleep need indicate a role for MEF2C.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing enrichment of sleep-state DEGs across modules of genes identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).

Using a Monte Carlo model to assess the likelihood of such a result gave a probability of p&lt;0.001 from a sample of 1000 permutations of genes randomly assigned to the experimentally defined number of modules and module size. It is consistent with a widespread influence of MEF2C on the transcriptome as it varies from CS to SD to RS. Furthermore, most of the enriched modules had sleep-condition-related eigengenes indicating that sleep condition was the principal component factor driving their coordinated expression.</p><p>We identified two modules (M04 and M10) whose module eigengenes were more positively correlated with CS or ad lib sleep or, conversely, more negatively correlated with SD and RS samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that the primary component driving their pattern of coexpression is CS versus SD and RS conditions. These two modules were of interest due to significant enrichment of several major categories of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): (1) DEGs in neuronal <italic>Mef2c conditional KO</italic> cortex (Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Emx1</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>), (2) excitatory and inhibitory neuronal genes, (3) genes downregulated in SD and RS, and (4) genes involved in synaptic function, epilepsy and cognitive pathologies including autism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

About two thirds of the significant changes in gene expression observed in response to sleep deprivation were maintained when 2 hr of recovery sleep followed 4 hr of sleep loss indicating that direct recovery of sleep deprivation-induced transcriptional changes is delayed for at least the 2-hr observation time employed in this study. This result suggests additional post-transcriptional mechanisms are also key to sleep-loss molecular mechanisms as for example, in synaptosomes, the translation of DEGs to proteins is at least, in part, dependent on sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Noya et al., 2019</xref>) or, more generally, the sleep loss associated increase in phosphorylation of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The transcriptional changes shared between CS to SD and CS to RS, included increased expression of genes involved in protein anabolism (including genes encoding ribosomal components and enzymes controlling their activity), protein catabolism and mobilization of energy resources (including genes encoding mitochondrial structural components and enzymes). These altered expression patterns are associated especially with non-neuronal brain tissue. In contrast, there is enrichment for decreased expression of genes primarily linked to neuronal cells, for the control of synaptic strength. These sleep condition associations relate protein and energy metabolism to neuronal synaptic strength in much the same way as the energy-related metabolite, adenosine, mediates a synaptic homeostasis of glutamate synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brambilla et al., 2005</xref>), which is part of a neuronal-glial circuit limiting glutamatergic activity. This circuit is an essential part of the CNS response to sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bjorness et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brambilla et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greene et al., 2017</xref>). Because we conditionally deleted Mef2c in neurons induced by Camk2a-Cre expression and did not see large transcriptomic changes in neurons or non-neurons in response to SD, we can speculate that the observed changes in non-neuronal genes during SD were likely secondary to loss of Mef2c function that was restricted to neurons. A contributing factor to SD evoked secondary transcriptional changes in non-neuronal cells could result from Mef2c-dependent changes in SD evoked increases in excitatory synaptic strength that we observed along with its absence after neuronal loss of Mef2c. Adenosine, released in response to increased glutamatergic synaptic activity associated with SD and acting to decrease this same activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brambilla et al., 2005</xref>), affects non-neuronal cells through non-neuronal adenosine receptors and/or by affecting glial adenosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greene et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, adenosine can be a molecular mediator (although not necessarily the only mediator) for these Mef2c-dependent secondary effects on the non-neuronal transcriptome.</p><p>We would also like to note that the design of our current study only examined gene expression changes after 2 hr of recovery sleep. It is possible that many genes require greater than 2 hr of recovery sleep before returning to baseline. Future studies that use additional longer time periods of recovery sleep can examine this possibility.</p><p>Coordination of the extensive change in transcriptome in response to loss of sleep requires the function of the transcription factor MEF2C, and sleep loss appears to increase MEF2C activity via the well-studied, calcium-dependent dephosphorylation of MEF2C in frontal cortex. The MEF2C-dependent, sleep loss, DEGs encode proteins modulating cellular and systemic functions. These same functions may also be expected to be affected by sleep loss in an MEF2C-depedent manner, and indeed, the normal reduction of synaptic strength and activity associated with recovery sleep (RS) is absent in the Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> mice. Notably, in WT, there is an acute increase in synaptic activity and strength induced by prolonged waking (SD) that we observe in association with a downregulation of genes controlling synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The SD, down-regulation of synaptic DEGs is presumably not translated during the prolonged waking time, but with recovery sleep, the effects become manifest. Nonetheless, the normal increase in synaptic activity resulting from prolonged waking is also absent in Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> mice, indicating an abnormal synaptic response both to the acute loss of sleep and to recovery sleep in the absence of MEF2C function.</p><p>In a normal waking state, MEF2C may function mainly as a transcriptional repressor when phosphorylated at S396 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrington et al., 2016</xref>). With loss of <italic>Mef2c</italic>, MEF2C will no longer be available for activation of specific target genes resulting in both de-repression from decreased phosphorylated MEF2C and loss of facilitation of transcription by dephosphorylation of S396 of MEF2C. Many of the DEGs comparing CS to SD conditions in WT animals showed significant overlap with genes dysregulated in Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Emx1</sup></italic> mice. These same genes no longer show differential expression comparing CS to SD in Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> mice in the present study, implicating an essential role in WT mice for MEF2C in sleep-condition-dependent transcriptome change. In Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Emx1</sup></italic> mice, similar widespread, abnormal gene expression is apparent, even in the absence of experimentally induced sleep loss. A portion of such widespread gene expression alterations may be in response or compensation to the more chronic absence of MEF2C-mediated response to sleep loss, since recombination of the floxed-alleles occurred early in embryonic brain development and may alter cortical circuit development.</p><p>Our findings show that loss or reduction of MEF2C function alters the response to sleep loss. Postnatal loss of MEF2C in forebrain excitatory neurons results in an enhanced SWS-SWA rebound and an attenuated resolution of the rebound. To the extent that SWS-SWA reflects sleep need, loss of MEF2C function increases sleep need in response to a loss of sleep compared to wild type MEF2C response, and it attenuates the sleep-mediated resolution of sleep need. We would like to point out that our comparisons of Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> mice are always to mice with the floxed allele, <italic>Mef2c</italic><sup>f/f</sup>. However, similar comparisons to mice that only express Cre would also be another valid and important comparison.</p><p>Taken together, these findings suggest a model of the sleep loss response that reflects a MEF2C-dependent, metabolically driven non-neuron to neuron homeostatic sleep circuit. This circuit can act to promote protein and energy metabolism and constrain synaptic activity in response to sleep loss.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus.

State assignment was determined via a custom Matlab (Mathworks) autosorter program using standard criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>) for waking, SWS, and REM after which files were manually checked to ensure correct assignment of state and flag epochs featuring artifact. Epochs were scored in 10 s bins with artifact-flagged epochs excluded from power spectral analysis. Episodes began with 30 consecutive seconds of one state and ended with 30 consecutive seconds of a different state. Power spectrum values were calculated in a 2 s window with a 1 s overlap and a Hamming window using the mean squared spectrum function in Matlab. For statistical analyses, Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> was compared to <italic>Mef2c</italic><sup>f/f</sup> and C57BL/6, while <italic>Mef2c<sup>+/-</sup></italic> was compared to <italic>Mef2c<sup>+/+</sup>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Decay of SWA across the light (inactive) phase</title><p>SWA (0.5–4.5 Hz) was normalized to the 24 hr average SWA and the percentage change between the first and last consolidated 1 hr sleep period was calculated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). The baseline day with the clearest consolidated sleep periods early and late in the light phase were used for statistical comparison via a one-way ANOVA with Sidak’s multiple comparison test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Decay of SWS-SWA within an averaged SWS episode under baseline conditions</title><p>For a full description of the decay analysis see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, SWS-SWA power was normalized to W SWA power after which SWS episodes of at least 5 min in duration were collected and gathered into an excel file with one episode per column such that the normalized SWS-SWA power of the first epoch was in the first row of each column, the normalized SWS-SWA power of the second epoch was in the second row of each column, and so forth. Based on the 5 min duration criteria, all columns had at least 30 rows; the longest four episodes were truncated to leave five episodes at the longest time point. One Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic>, one <italic>Mef2c</italic><sup>f/f</sup>, and one <italic>Mef2c<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mouse per group was excluded on the basis of insufficient episodes of at least 12 min in duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>). The natural log was taken after which episodes were averaged within animal to create a single averaged SWS episode per mouse followed by averaging across animals within group to result in a single episode per group. Next, the group average episode was transformed by taking the exponential. A fragment of the average was created (excluding the initial ascending phase and periods of high variability toward the end) and fit using a single phase decay (GraphPad Prism) in order to determine the time constant of decay (τ). Based on previously described exclusion criteria (absolute sum of squares, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjorness et al., 2016</xref>), the averaged group episode for Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> mice could not be fit. Thus, the time constant of decay determined for the <italic>Mef2c</italic><sup>f/f</sup> group was used to determine the plateau and R<sup>2</sup> value for the Mef2c-cKO<italic><sup>Camk2a-Cre</sup></italic> group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Rebound SWS-SWA following chronic, partial SD</title><p>Mice underwent 8 cycles of 4 hr SD (TM ‘ON’) followed by 2 hr RS (TM ‘OFF’) starting at ZT0. SWS-SWA power was averaged in 2 hr bins. Rebound SWS-SWA was determined by the percent change in SWS-SWA from baseline conditions to TM ‘OFF’ conditions using time-matched circadian bins (i.e. ZT 4–6, ZT 10–12, ZT 16–18, ZT 22–24). A one-way ANOVA was used to compare average rebound across the 8 RS periods and a One sample T test was used to compare average values to a theoretical mean of 0 (GraphPad Prism).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Time in sleep/waking state</title><p>Time in each sleep/waking state (waking, SWS, REM) under baseline conditions was averaged in 2 hr bins and calculated as the percent time of the total period. Averaged percent time in state for each state was compared between groups using a one-way ANOVA (GraphPad, Prism).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Cumulative distribution of SWS episodes</title><p>SWS episodes under baseline and SD (recovery periods) conditions were binned by duration using the histogram function in excel (Microsoft); the first bin was 90 s with successive bins increasing by 40 s. The number of episodes in each bin was divided by the total number of episodes for the condition and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage of the total episodes represented by each bin. Next, a cumulative percentage was calculated by adding the percentage of successive bins. A two-way ANOVA (condition, bin) was used to compare cumulative histogram episode durations across groups and conditions (baseline and SD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Spectral power distribution across state</title><p>Under baseline conditions, individual 10 s epochs were separated by state (waking, SWS, REM) after which spectral power in each 1 Hz bin up to 50 Hz was normalized by the total power for that state (waking epoch normalized to waking total power, etc). Fraction power was then averaged across epochs within each 1 Hz bin to get an average spectral distribution from 1 to 50 Hz by state. Two-way ANOVA (group, frequency) was used to compare spectral distributions by state across groups.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mr. To Thai, Ms. Lilian Zhan and Dr. Busra Goksu for technical assistance and Dr. Stefano Berto for discussions about genomic analyses.

The authors of this interesting and well-written study investigated the transcriptional changes in frontal cortex that accompany sleep loss in mice in order to gain insight into the molecular basis of these plasticity changes. The study is very well done including controls for circadian effects, and the key results are striking, with an interesting investigation of the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie changes in brain function with sleep deprivation and strong functional evidence of a role for MEF2C in the regulation of synaptic plasticity and sleep homeostasis.</p><p>There are two issues that need to be addressed by the authors with text revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were generally impressed by the transcriptomic data, however they raised two specific concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>– Why do we see 767 DEGs in the <italic>Mef2C</italic><sup>f/f</sup> control mice in Figure 3, compared with 6248 DEGs in the WT mice of Figure 1, with roughly the same number of genes (11-13k) detected? This was confounding to all three of the reviewers and requires a clear, direct explanation.</p><p>– While the authors would like to make the point that many transcripts continue to be mis-expressed even after RS, their study wasn't really designed to address this. Comparing DEGs across the different conditions examined by the authors, certainly, the difference between 6248 (or 3827) and 81 is massive. However, it is unclear how much of this is due to insufficient recovery sleep under their conditions, especially considering that many transcripts may have longer half-lives that would make effects of a 2h &quot;recovery&quot; difficult to quantify accurately. This conclusion might better be made with methods to look at transcription initiation per se, and a fairer way of examining these data would be to ask how many of the 6248 genes changed expression levels toward baseline, significantly or not. This is not the main point of the manuscript and the discussion of this section could certainly be softened, however if retained, stronger and considerable qualification of the arguments presented would be needed.</p><p>2) The functional studies on MEF2C are deep and compelling, however MEF2C does not leap out of the transcriptomic analyses the way the authors seem to suggest in the text. The reviews proposed several text revisions to the MEF2C section to make it stronger.</p><p>– Mef2C rather &quot;drops out of the blue&quot;, first at the end of the Introduction after a single sentence, and then appears in the Results without much justification (the authors suggest the gene expression data &quot;pointed them&quot; to Mef2C in unbiased fashion, but it doesn't really). Discussing Harrington et al. more fully in the Introduction would greatly aid the reader in following and appreciating this story.</p><p>– The authors need to back off or better support the text suggesting the transcriptomic data point to MEF2C.</p><p>One reviewer noted, &quot;It starts with Figure 1E: downregulated DEGs shared by SD and RS were enriched for neuronal genes downregulated by <italic>Mef2c</italic> loss of function. The statistics to me are unclear here. What is the actual overlap? The general nature of Figure 1E does not allow the reader to evaluate this conclusion very well. Then it looks like Figure 2 is showing exactly the opposite of what its title suggests. Very few WGCNA modules overlap between the SD analysis and the set of genes known to be regulated by Mef2C. Much of the data in this paper is striking, but this figure is unconvincing.&quot;</p><p>A second version of this concern raised by another reviewer suggested removing the Emx1-Cre MEF2C cKO data comparisons from the manuscript to solve this problem. The reviewer said, &quot;Considering only the data presented from the CamKII-Cre cKO mice, the data are highly consistent showing a blunting of the transcriptional responses, the synaptic responses and the EEG responses to SD in the cKO compared with f/f mice. (The text indicates that both gene expression and synaptic function differ in the control condition between f/f and cKO mice and the authors suggest that there may be homeostatic compensations in the cKO mice prior to SD that contribute to the blunted response, which is an interesting model). However, the paper also tries to tell their MEF2C story using a previous set of RNAseq data from Emx-Cre MEF2C cKO mice. The pattern of knockout in the Emx1-Cre and CamKII-Cre lines is not the same and functional data are available here only for CamKII-Cre. The Emx1-Cre RNAseq data are counterproductive and their use to motivate the further study of MEF2C feels forced. I would pull these data.&quot;</p><p>– All three reviewers agreed that the MEF2C phosphorylation data are not compelling and should be removed. The relationship between the phosphorylation and the activation of MEF2C is complex, with both concerted dephosphorylation (as seen by the downshift on western) and specific increases in phosphorylation (Thr 293/300/Ser 387, which would require phospho-antibodies to see) associated with activation. The reviewers as a group were confused by the text about whether the authors were proposing that MEF2C activity was increased or decreased during SD (which depends in part on whether the authors think the relevant functions of MEF2C in this context are as an activator or a repressor, which also was differentially interpreted by the reviewers). Anything the authors can do to clarify their model of MEF2C action in SD would benefit the text, but removing the phosphorylation from Figure 3 including the cartoon will especially benefit this part of the story.</p><p>– Finally, one reviewer recommended the analysis of the MEF2C germline HET mice should be brought up to the main figures rather than relegated to the supplementary and the comparison between the HET and the CamKII-Cre mice should be more completely discussed. One particularly interesting issue that is briefly mentioned but never addressed in the context of the HET mice is the possibility that MEF2C may have both neuronal and non-neuronal functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58331.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers were generally impressed by the transcriptomic data, however they raised two specific concerns that need to be addressed.</p><p>– Why do we see 767 DEGs in the Mef2C<sup>f/f</sup> control mice in Figure 3, compared with 6248 DEGs in the WT mice of Figure 1, with roughly the same number of genes (11-13k) detected?

[…] Furthermore, the synaptic and EEG phenotypes of these genotypes across sleep conditions are indistinguishable as shown below (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and Figure 6).”</p><p>Importantly, such differences ultimately do not affect physiological profiles (synaptic strength or EEG measurements of sleep need) inferring that any differences between WT and floxed mice at the transcriptomic level are just “noise” and do not have a functional read out affecting sleep condition-dependent cellular state. Since these responses are absent in the cKO animals, the CS to SD differential expression that is essential for both the similar WT or the <italic>Mef2c<sup>f/f</sup></italic> sleep SD phenotype requires intact <italic>Mef2c</italic> genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– While the authors would like to make the point that many transcripts continue to be mis-expressed even after RS, their study wasn't really designed to address this.

The reviewers are correct that we do not examine the recovery period longer than 2hrs. While that will make for a very interesting future study, we hope the reviewers appreciate that is it outside of the scope of this current study. We have now included language that a 2hr time point might be insufficient to see transcripts with longer half-lives potentially return to baseline using the current design:</p><p>“We would also like to note that the design of our current study only examined gene expression changes after two hours of recovery sleep. […] Future studies that use additional longer time periods of recovery sleep can examine this possibility.”</p><p>Most genes that are significantly changed for CS|SD show non-significant change towards baseline by 2h of RS. Moreover, we plotted a histogram of the number of genes changing based on FDR cut-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and we observe few changes in the number of genes changing until ~FDR&gt;=0.75. This suggests that we cannot predict the additional transcriptomic changes that would occur with longer SD using the current dataset.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58331-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The functional studies on MEF2C are deep and compelling, however MEF2C does not leap out of the transcriptomic analyses the way the authors seem to suggest in the text.

A Fisher’s exact test was used to calculate the significance of the overlap of the sleep DEGs and the <italic>Mef2c</italic> DEGs.

The WGCNA represents the distribution of <italic>all</italic> expressed genes in the mouse frontal cortex in our dataset and breaks down these genes into modules of co-expression. One would never expect to find all modules in a WGCNA analysis represented by a particular trait, especially when considering this is a dataset of over 13,000 expressed genes. The fact that we observe significant enrichment for <italic>Mef2c</italic> target genes in 15 out of the 59 modules is remarkable (Monte Carlo P-value: 0.001; now added to text). When all the expressed genes are randomly grouped into modules to simulate the 59 detected modules (controlling for module sizes) over and over again (1000 iterations), the chance of 15 or more modules to show significant enrichment for <italic>Mef2c</italic> target genes is extremely rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). The list of <italic>Mef2c</italic> target genes is comprised of 1,076 genes. Thus, out of 13,000 expressed genes, 1,005 (441 up-regulated and 564 down-regulated) <italic>Mef2c</italic> target genes are coordinately co-expressed in our dataset of wildtype mice undergoing sleep deprivation into modules. Moreover, these modules are primarily modules represented by sleep-related eigengenes. In other words, the first principal component driving the coordination of expression of the genes in these modules is sleep state.</p><p>We now state in the manuscript:</p><p>“Notably, putative target genes of MEF2C, were enriched in a surprising, 15 of 59 modules generated from the three sleep conditions employed in this study. […] Furthermore, most of the enriched modules had sleep condition related eigengenes indicating that sleep condition was the principal component factor driving their coordinated expression.”</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58331-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second version of this concern raised by another reviewer suggested removing the Emx1-Cre MEF2C cKO data comparisons from the manuscript to solve this problem.

[…] In contrast, RS did not significantly alter MEF2C P-S396 levels (Figure 3D), suggesting that SD triggers signaling events to transiently activate MEF2C-dependent transcription and promote the weakening and/or elimination of excitatory synapses.”</p><p>We have also rewritten the Introduction section relevant to the phosphorylation of MEF2C as follows:</p><p>“Neuronal activity associated with waking, that may include neuronal depolarization, firing and arousal associated neuromodulator activity, can switch MEF2C from a transcriptional repressor to an activator.
