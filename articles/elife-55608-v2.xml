This stratagem has evolved independently within the three major bilaterian clades (annelids, arthropods, and chordates) as well as in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Richmond and Oates, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chipman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ten Tusscher, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balavoine, 2014</xref>). In chordates, a segmentation clock oscillates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM); with each cycle, a pair of somites form flanking the neural tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pourquié, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>). Somites differentiate into dermis, skeletal muscle, tendons, as well as the vertebral column, which retains the segmented attribute of the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christ et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, genes with an oscillatory pattern within the PSM include those encoding components or targets of the FGF, WNT, and Notch signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hubaud and Pourquié, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krol et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dequéant et al., 2006</xref>). However, which individual genes oscillate differs among species, with the exception of the Notch-responsive HES/HER transcription factors, suggesting that Notch signaling is at the core of the somitogenesis clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Krol et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting this idea, genetic and pharmacological manipulations demonstrate that Notch pathway oscillation in the mouse embryo is essential for somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</xref>). In the mouse, oscillatory waves of the <italic>Notch1</italic> receptor and Delta-like 1 (<italic>Dll1</italic>) ligand expression, as well as the activated Notch receptor (cleaved Notch intracellular domain, NICD) sweep from the posterior to anterior, where oscillations arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bone et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shimojo et al., 2016</xref>). These oscillations are established through negative-feedback loops of Notch components such as the transcriptional repressor, HES7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niwa et al., 2011</xref>), and the glycosyltransferase, LFNG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimoto et al., 2005</xref>), both of which are encoded by oscillating genes under Notch pathway regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niwa et al., 2011</xref>). Notch oscillations arrest in the anterior PSM, where NICD cooperates with TBX6 to periodically activate <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>). MESP2 then regulates formation of the nascent somite as well as its rostro-caudal patterning, which is essential for normal patterning of the subsequent vertebral column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Takahashi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saga et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in nearly all of the aforementioned Notch pathway genes have been identified in human patients where defective somitogenesis is thought to be the cause of Segmentation Defects of the Vertebrae (SDV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckalbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giampietro et al., 2009</xref>). For example, frequently recessive mutations in <italic>DLL3</italic>, <italic>HES7</italic>, <italic>MESP2</italic> and <italic>LFNG</italic> and a dominant mutation in <italic>TBX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sparrow et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lefebvre et al., 2017</xref>) have been identified in patients with spondylocostal dysostosis (SCDO), which is characterized by severe vertebral malformations that include hemivertebrae, vertebral loss and fusion along the length of the axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>). Whereas SCDO is relatively rare, congenital scoliosis (CS), defined as a lateral curvature of the spine exceeding 10%, is much more common, with a frequency of 1:1000, which is suspected to be an underestimation because asymptomatic individuals do not seek medical care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giampietro et al., 2013</xref>). Mutated alleles of <italic>HES7</italic>, <italic>LFNG</italic>, <italic>MESP2</italic>, and <italic>TBX6</italic> are all associated with CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lefebvre et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Takeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giampietro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The position in the anterior PSM where Notch oscillations arrest and <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression establishes the future somite boundary is called the determination front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morimoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saga et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>). This region is also the anterior limit of the wavefront in the classical clock-and-wavefront, a theoretical model proposed over 40 years ago to explain the precipitous and periodic formation of segments in the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cooke and Zeeman, 1976</xref>). In this model, wavefront activity prevents the PSM from responding to the segmentation clock; hence somites form only anteriorly, where the wavefront ends. In chick or zebrafish embryos, exogenously added FGF protein or pharmacological inhibition of FGF signaling will shift the determination front rostrally or caudally, respectively. In the mouse, Cre-mediated inactivation of <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> specifically in the PSM results in an initial expansion of <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression, followed by the premature expression of somite markers throughout the PSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>). Canonical WNT signaling is also a wavefront candidate, mostly because ectopic activation of βcatenin in the PSM results in an expansion of this tissue and a rostral shift of <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunty et al., 2008</xref>). However, this expansion observed in βcatenin ‘gain-of-function’ mutants requires FGF4 and FGF8 activity, suggesting that these FGF signals are synonymous with the wavefront (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in preventing somite differentiation, FGF signaling is also implicated in the regulation of key Notch components of the segmentation clock. Several studies have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of FGF disrupts Notch oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niwa et al., 2007</xref>). In mouse embryos with PSM-specific loss of <italic>FGF receptor one</italic> or both <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic>, Notch pathway genes such as <italic>Hes7</italic>, are downregulated, although this analysis can be complicated due to the loss of PSM tissue in these mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niwa et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we focus on FGF-Notch interactions by analyzing mouse mutants that lack only one of the wavefront Fgf genes, <italic>Fgf8</italic> or <italic>Fgf4</italic>. An indispensable technique in our analysis is whole mount in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which allows us to multiplex different gene expression domains and quantify mRNA levels within specific embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>). We demonstrate that, while <italic>Fgf8</italic> is not required for somitogenesis, <italic>Fgf4</italic> is required for normal Notch oscillatory patterns and patterning of the vertebral column.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FGF4 activity is required in the PSM for normal segmentation of rostral somites</title><p>To analyze the role of <italic>Fgf4</italic> or <italic>Fgf8</italic> expression in the primitive streak and PSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> - B), we inactivated each gene specifically within these tissues using the transgenic mouse line, Tg(T-cre)1Lwd (hereafter 'TCre’), in which Cre is controlled by <italic>Brachyury</italic> regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perantoni et al., 2005</xref>).

On the other hand, <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants display a variety of segmentation defects in the cervical and thoracic vertebrae with 100% penetrance (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D’</xref> with C).

Such compensatory upregulation fails in compound <italic>Fgf4/Hes7</italic> mutants because we observed an 80% <italic>Hes7</italic> reduction to occur in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

The synergistic 80% reduction of <italic>Hes7</italic> that occurs in compound <italic>Fgf4/Hes7</italic> mutants causes a severe dampening of oscillatory gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>).

Together, our data support our hypothesis that FGF4 acts to maintain <italic>Hes7</italic> above a necessary threshold for normal somitogenesis. In <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, a reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> levels, leads to abnormal patterns of activated Notch. Abnormal Notch oscillations initiate <italic>Mesp2</italic> unevenly in the anterior PSM leading to improperly shaped somites and subsequently, malformed vertebrae.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We describe mutants with only <italic>Fgf4</italic> or <italic>Fgf8</italic> inactivated specifically in the primitive streak and PSM. In previous work, we reported that somites form in such mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Perantoni et al., 2005</xref>); here we examine the patterning of these somites, the Notch pathway oscillations that control their formation, as well as the vertebral elements that they eventually form. We found that <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants display a range of cervical and thoracic vertebral defects that are caused by aberrant Notch oscillations during somitogenesis. In contrast, the vertebral columns of <italic>Fgf8</italic> mutants are normally segmented, with about 30% displaying minor homeotic transformations; such alternations in vertebral identity are not likely due to defects in somitogenesis per se. Previously, a role for FGF signaling in wavefront activity in chick and zebrafish embryos was supported by pharmacological manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubrulle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sawada et al., 2001</xref>) and in mouse mutants where both <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> are simultaneously inactivated using the same TCre activity that we use in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>). These double <italic>Fgf4/Fgf8</italic> mutants as well as mutants with tissue-specific inactivation of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> support a role for FGF signaling in clock oscillations, but these conclusions were complicated by a loss of PSM tissue due to potential wavefront defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oginuma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niwa et al., 2007</xref>). Compared to these <italic>Fgf</italic> pathway mutants, the phenotype of <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants is relatively subtle, with no wavefront defect, as indicated by no loss of caudal vertebrae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2016a</xref>) and no quantitative change in wavefront gene markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This lack of any overt axis extension defect allows us to unambiguously identify <italic>Fgf4</italic> as an <italic>Fgf</italic> ligand gene required for a normal segmentation clock. This insight is supported by recently published work showing that FGF signaling regulates the dynamics of gene expression oscillations in PSM cells cultured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Diaz-Cuadros et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our mutants model human Segmentation Defects of the Vertebrae (SDV); <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants resemble CS and the synergistic phenotype resulting from the additional removal of one <italic>Hes7</italic> copy in these mutants resembles human SCDO. Both of these diseases are caused by mutations in Notch signaling components that we find are misexpressed in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, such as <italic>HES7</italic>, <italic>MESP2,</italic> and <italic>LFNG</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eckalbar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giampietro et al., 2009</xref>). With regard to the human FGF pathway and SDV, a straightforward gene-disorder relationship has not been uncovered, probably because of the pleiotropic phenotypes of such putative mutations would preclude embryonic survival. Sparrow et al found that gestational hypoxia in mice results in an increase in the severity and penetrance of CS in <italic>Notch1</italic>, <italic>Mesp2</italic>, and <italic>Hes7</italic> heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, CS is more severe in children living at high altitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hou et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting a similar environmental effect may affect human development. In mice, hypoxia was found to diminish FGF signaling components, but expression of <italic>Fgf8</italic> was unchanged, and <italic>Fgf4</italic> was unexamined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>). Our data suggest that FGF4 may be part of the system that is responsive to this environmental insult. However, if this is the case, reduced FGF4 activity cannot be the only response to reduced oxygen levels because gestational hypoxia reduces expression of the FGF target gene <italic>Spry4</italic> in the PSM, whereas we found no change in expression in this or other such canonical FGF target genes in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.</p><p>Rather, as is the case for hypoxia-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>), <italic>Hes7</italic> expression is reduced in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants and we propose that this leads to aberrant segmentation. An indispensable tool to this insight was the use of multiplex HCR imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trivedi et al., 2018</xref>). The simultaneous fluorescent imaging of multiple mRNA domains with this technique is particularly useful in a complex embryonic process, such as somitogenesis, where many complex and dynamic gene expression patterns need to be analyzed. HCR is a relatively new tool for mutant embryo analysis, just beginning to be used to analyze mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lignell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attardi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKinney et al., 2016</xref>). We used HCR to examine the expression of multiple genes in a single tissue by combining it with Imaris image analysis software. This combination of HCR and Imaris-modeling is broadly applicable for in situ quantification of gene expression within any complex embryonic or clinical sample. With distinct molecular markers, one can use this approach to quantify gene expression in any cell population with a precision that heretofore was not possible and still retain the intact whole mount embryo or tissue. Here, we generated and analyzed Imaris-based volumetric models of the PSM, based on <italic>Tbx6</italic> expression, and determined that <italic>Hes7</italic> levels are reduced by about 40–50% specifically in the PSM of <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants during early somite stages when the progenitors of aberrant vertebrae are segmenting.</p><p>We propose that this reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> levels is the primary defect in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, and subsequently causes an irregular activated Notch (NICD) pattern, misexpression of <italic>Mesp2</italic>, and ultimately leads to vertebral defects. A reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> levels, due to heterozygosity or hypomorphic mutations, has been shown to cause vertebral defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fujimuro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stauber et al., 2009</xref>).

If so, we speculate such regulation would be post-transcriptional because we find no significant difference in levels of the genes encoding these factors. Additionally, it is possible that FGF4 signaling is interfacing with WNT signaling, which also has been shown to regulate <italic>Hes7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aulehla et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunty et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">González et al., 2013</xref>. Given the molecular feedbacks during genetic oscillations in the PSM, we considered whether FGF4 might have a primary role on <italic>Lfng</italic> expression, whose pattern is abnormal in our mutants. However, we suggest this is not the case, because, although embryos completely lacking <italic>Lfng</italic> also display aberrant <italic>Hes7</italic> oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Niwa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stauber et al., 2009</xref>), overall <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels are not reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ferjentsik et al., 2009</xref>), unlike the case in our <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.</p><p>We support our proposal that the observed 50% reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> is the cause of the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant with the synergistic worsening of the vertebral segmentation defect that occurs when we further reduce <italic>Hes7</italic> levels by removal of one wildtype allele. Notably, such synergy in defects does not occur when a copy of <italic>Hes7</italic> is removed from <italic>Fgf8</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). From another perspective, the mild CS caused by loss of one <italic>Hes7</italic> allele in a wildtype background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sparrow et al., 2012</xref>) is worsened 9-fold by removing <italic>Fgf4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Therefore, <italic>Fgf4</italic> is a robustness-conferring gene that buffers somitogenesis against a perturbation in <italic>Hes7</italic> gene dosage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Félix and Barkoulas, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We observed that in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels are reduced during rostral somitogenesis at E8.5 (5–6 somite stages), when defective somitogenesis occurs. At about E9.5 (24–26 somite stages), <italic>Hes7</italic> levels are unaffected, and the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant embryo is beginning to generate correctly patterned somites that will differentiate into normally patterned vertebrae. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tam, 1981</xref> showed that between these two stages of mouse development, somites more than double in size. Such an increase in segment size can be due to a slower segmentation clock and/or faster regression of the determination front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oates et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gomez et al., 2008</xref> found that the caudal movement of the wavefront does not significantly change at these stages, suggesting a slowing clock between E8.5 and E9.5. Consistent with a slower clock, we observed at least 2 and frequently 3 bands of <italic>Hes7</italic> expression at the <italic>Fgf4</italic>-sensitive stages (5–6 somite stages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), but only 1 to 2 bands when <italic>Fgf4</italic> loss has no effect on <italic>Hes7</italic> expression (24–26 somite stages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). In future experiments, we will test this hypothesis directly by measuring the clock rate, using recently generated fluorescent transgenic reporters of <italic>Hes7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it appears that FGF4 activity is required to maintain <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels above a certain threshold when the segmentation clock is faster; when Notch oscillations slow, they may become FGF-independent, or other FGFs may be at play. If this is the case in all vertebrates, we might expect embryos with faster segmentation clocks, such as snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gomez et al., 2008</xref>), to have a longer window of FGF4-dependence for normal somitogenesis.</p><p>This study and past work indicate that FGF4 and FGF8 have both shared and unique roles in the vertebrate embryo’s posterior growth zone. They redundantly encode wavefront activities, preventing PSM differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boulet and Capecchi, 2012</xref>). In this capacity, when signaling together, they activate downstream canonical FGF target genes, such as <italic>Spry2</italic>, <italic>Spry4,</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we show the role that FGF4 signals play in maintaining <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels cannot be replaced by FGF8. Future efforts will explore how the signaling machinery within the PSM discriminates between these two FGF ligands. For example, our work argues for a reassessment of FGFR function in the PSM; prior work, in which the same Cre driver used here (TCre) inactivates <italic>Fgfr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wahl et al., 2007</xref>), thought to be the only FGF receptor gene expressed in the PSM, does not exactly phenocopy the defects due to TCre-mediated loss of either <italic>Fgf4</italic> (this study) or <italic>Fgf4/Fgf8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Naiche et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our insights regarding the roles of FGF4 and FGF8 in the caudal embryonic axis are intriguing in the context of the evolution of the vertebrate body plan. Vertebrates, together with Cephalochordates and Urochordates make up the phylum Chordata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Putnam et al., 2008</xref>). Somitogenesis predates vertebrate evolution as it occurs in Cephalochordata, the most basal living chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holland and Onai, 2012</xref>). In both Cephalochordates and Urochordates, the FGF essential for embryonic axis extension is an <italic>Fgf8</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pasini et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting that this <italic>Fgf</italic> (<italic>‘Fgf8/17/18’)</italic> may be the ancestral gene in this process. However, <italic>Fgf8/17/18</italic> activity in these invertebrate chordates does not control gene oscillations as these embryos apparently lack a segmentation clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertrand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Onai et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the recruitment of an <italic>Fgf4</italic> role during the evolution of vertebrate axis extension may have coincided with the development of gene oscillations that control somitogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Fgf4Flox/delta</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10802662/">10802662</ext-link></td><td>MGI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:95518">95518</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Fgf8flox/delta</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9462741">9462741</ext-link></td><td>MGI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:99604">99604</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>Hes7delta</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11641270/">11641270</ext-link></td><td>MGI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/marker/MGI:2135679">2135679</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background <italic>Mus musculus</italic></td><td>TCre</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16049111/">16049111</ext-link></td><td>MGI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/allele/key/40586">3605847</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Alcian Blue 8GX</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A5268-25G</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Alizarin Red</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A-5533</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>BM Purple</td><td>Roche</td><td>11 442 074 001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Dapi</td><td>Life Technologies</td><td>D21490</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Iohexol (Nycodenz)</td><td>Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corp</td><td>AN1002424</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ultra-low gelling temperature agarose</td><td>Sigma</td><td>A5030</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Hydrogen peroxide</td><td>Sigma</td><td>516813–500 ML</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ammonium Chloride</td><td>Mallinckrodt</td><td>3384</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>N-Methylacetamide</td><td>Sigma</td><td>AN1002424</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Triton-X-100</td><td>Sigma</td><td>T8787</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>fluorescein</td><td>Sigma</td><td>46960</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>acid blue 9</td><td>TCI</td><td>CI42090</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>rose bengal</td><td>Sigma</td><td>198250</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>V3.0 HCR Kit</td><td>Molecular Instruments</td><td>Wholemount Mouse Embryo</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Imaris Software</td><td>Bitplane Inc</td><td>Imaris V9.2.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-NICD (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>CST</td><td>#4147</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-rabbit alexa-647 (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>A32733</td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Dig (sheep FAB fragments)</td><td>Roche</td><td>11 093 274 910</td><td>(1:4000)</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Fetal calf serum</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>16140071</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Alleles, Breeding and Genotyping</title><p>All mice were kept on a mixed background.

Using mouse mutants harboring conditional deletions of <italic>Fgf4</italic> or <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the PSM, they show that only <italic>Fgf4</italic> deletion leads to significant segmentation defects first visible in the oscillatory pattern of <italic>Hes7</italic> and NICD and in the stripes of Mesp2 ultimately leading to abnormal vertebrae. Interestingly, these defects are restricted to the cervico-thoracic region. Remarkably, in these mutants, expression of PSM markers and FGF targets is normal indicating that <italic>Fgf8</italic> is sufficient to maintain the wavefront. They then use quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (HCR) to analyze the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants and show that while the periodic expression of <italic>Hes7</italic> is maintained, it is not as sharp as in controls, leading to abnormal Mesp2 expression at the wavefront. Importantly, they show a significant downregulation of <italic>Hes7</italic> expression in the PSM of mutants compared to controls and propose a model wherein <italic>Fgf4</italic> is required to maintain <italic>Hes7</italic> above a defined threshold to ensure proper negative regulation of its expression associated to oscillations. They provide further evidence for this model by showing that <italic>Fgf4</italic> (but not <italic>Fgf8</italic>) genetically interacts with <italic>Hes7</italic> such that double heterozygote mutants exhibit a strong increase of segmentation defects compared to single mutants.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression analysis should be performed by HCR in both wild type and mutant embryos. In the case of the WT embryos, it should include both E8.5 and E9.5. <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression does not seem to be well characterized and the absence of phenotype at later stages could just reflect absence of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression at that level. This could also show the extension of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression in the PSM. As pointed out by the reviewers, T-cre activity is not restricted to the PSM as it starts in the primitive streak. Checking <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression in the mutants will also show where and the extent of its inactivation.</p><p>2) Similarly, characterization of <italic>Lfng</italic> expression and better assessment of Mesp2 activation in the mutants is essential.</p><p>3) It would be nice if you could also perform dynamic analysis of cycling activity in the PSM of <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, if you have access to the reporter strain crossed with the T-cre-<italic>Fgf4</italic> line. Similarly, dynamic evaluation of the cycling activity in the PSM and/or solving the mechanism of <italic>Hes7</italic> regulation by <italic>Fgf4</italic> would be a nice addition, but we would understand if this might take too long under the present circumstances.</p><p>We include the full reviews below for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The role of FGF signaling in somite patterning has so far been difficult to understand as it appears to be involved in both the control of the oscillations and in the formation of a posterior gradient involved in controlling the positioning of the determination front. I find this a very interesting study which combines elegant mouse genetics coupled to novel quantitative methods of gene expression analysis in vivo to demonstrate the implication of <italic>Fgf4</italic> in the regulation of the oscillations. This is a novel finding that should be of interested to the community of developmental biologists and beyond. The paper is suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> provided the comments below are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of puzzling observations of the work is the irregular pattern of NICD expression. It is unclear to me why the disruption of <italic>Hes7</italic> expression should affect NICD. One explanation could be through <italic>Lfng</italic> which is regulated by <italic>Hes7</italic> and which in turn regulates Notch signaling. I think analyzing <italic>Lfng</italic> expression in the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants would be important for this study to be able to conclude on this point.</p><p>Also, it would be interesting to examine Axin2 expression to see if the effect is strictly restricted to Notch targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the effect that removal of <italic>Fgf4</italic> from the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) of mouse embryos has on Notch cyclic activity in this region and axial skeletal development. The authors show that embryos in which <italic>Fgf4</italic> was conditionally inactivated in the PSM had vertebral malformations in the cervical and thoracic regions, compatible with abnormal segmentation in the paraxial mesoderm. This effect was not seen in similar <italic>Fgf8</italic> mutants, the other FGF molecule thought to be functionally relevant in this embryonic region. They then show abnormal cyclic behaviour of <italic>Hes7</italic> and <italic>Lfng</italic> in the PSM of <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant embryos at E8.5 but not ~E9.5 (22-24 somites). Through quantitative estimations using whole mount in situ HCR the authors show that in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant embryos <italic>Hes7</italic> expression is overall reduced in the PSM. To explain the link between <italic>Hes7</italic> expression levels and abnormal Notch cyclic behaviour the authors propose that the reduced <italic>Hes7</italic> expression would interfere with the negative feedback loop on its own transcription, eventually impacting the cyclic Notch signalling activity in the PSM. The relevance of <italic>Hes7</italic> downstream <italic>Fgf4</italic> signalling was further shown by introducing the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutation into the <italic>Hes7</italic> heterozygous background, which resulted in a clear increase in the strength of the skeletal phenotypes relative to those observed in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant or <italic>Hes7</italic> heterozygote embryos.</p><p>This work provides evidence of a connection between <italic>Fgf4</italic> signalling and the cyclic behaviour of Notch signalling in the PSM. It also represents the first direct quantitative description of the importance of precise expression levels of a particular component of the Notch pathway to guarantee proper function of the regulatory network leading to Notch cyclic signalling activity, and the impact that this actually has on paraxial segmentation. It also shows the value of HCR to understand the impact of quantitative parameters in gene function in vivo.</p><p>I have a few comments that I think could help increasing the impact of this manuscript in order to further understand the mechanisms of paraxial segmentation and the specificity in FGF signalling activity.</p><p>1) The current paradigm for somitogenesis includes a FGF signalling gradient in the PSM, acting as an essential component of clock and wavefront model. How does the data in this manuscript fit in this model? For instance, <italic>Fgf8</italic> has been considered the key FGF signal forming the relevant gradient, but <italic>Fgf8</italic> inactivation seems to have no negative impact on somitogenesis. However, <italic>Fgf4</italic> inactivation alone is able to interfere with proper somitogenesis. Does <italic>Fgf4</italic> generate a gradient in the PSM? This could be explored by whole mount in situ HCR. In case such gradient is not observed, or it does not cover the PSM length, is a FGF gradient required for somitogenesis?</p><p>2) In line with the previous comment, it looks like the <italic>Fgf4</italic> is required to set <italic>Hes7</italic> expression levels and that this alone has significant effects on the functional dynamics of Notch signalling, eventually affecting segmentation. This might actually fit better with a role of FGF signalling on the cells added by the axial progenitors to the posterior end of the PSM as the embryo grows, rather than with interference with a FGF gradient in the PSM. Indeed, an independent double <italic>Fgf4</italic>/<italic>Fgf8</italic> gene inactivation in the axial progenitor zone (Boulet and Capecchi, 2012) produced a phenotype more consistent with these signals modulating the production of new paraxial mesodermal tissue to be incorporated into the PSM as the embryos grow. The phenotype of the double T-cre-<italic>Fgf8</italic>/T-cre-<italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants mentioned in this manuscript could also be interpreted along the same lines.</p><p>3) Do the authors have an insight into the mechanism by which <italic>Fgf4</italic> modulates <italic>Hes7</italic> expression levels? Also, why is <italic>Fgf8</italic> not able to substitute for <italic>Fgf4</italic> in this function, when it is expressed at higher levels in the posterior embryo than <italic>Fgf4</italic>? This is important as it could also help understanding signalling specificity from the different FGF molecules (and they are too often used interchangeably in many experimental designs). Also, it questions the use of the analysis of <italic>Fgf8</italic> gradients to interpret segmentation defects in mutant embryos.</p><p>4) An interesting finding in this manuscript is that the effects of inactivating <italic>Fgf4</italic> are observed in cervical, thoracic and anterior lumbar regions but not in more posterior areas of the skeleton. This is reminiscent of what has been observed for <italic>Lfng</italic>: while its total inactivation affects paraxial segmentation throughout the anterior posterior axis (Zhang and Gridley, 1998; Evrard et al., 1998), <italic>Lfng</italic> cyclic activity seems to be required for presacral vertebrae but dispensable for posterior embryonic regions (Shifley et al., 2008). The authors interpret this differential <italic>Fgf4</italic> effect in terms of different speed of somitogenesis at the two axial levels. However, as that the anterior regions derive from the epiblast through the primitive streak, whereas more posterior regions derive from the tail bud, it is possible that somitogenesis itself could be mechanistically not so uniform and contain relevant differences in areas produced by progenitors in the epiblast or tail bud. Such differences could explain the differential phenotypes in anterior and posterior embryonic regions upon <italic>Fgf4</italic> inactivation or the different requirements for <italic>Lfng</italic> cyclic behaviour. Also, could differences in T-cre driver activity in the epiblast and tail bud play a role in the regional-specific phenotypes of the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors provide convincing genetic evidence for a role of <italic>Fgf4</italic> in controlling somite formation in mouse embryos. I find this work of high quality and importance. While in a previous study, the authors had concluded that &quot;<italic>Fgf4</italic> [...] is not required for somitogenesis per se&quot; (Page 4021 in Naiche et al., 2011) their current work clearly identifies <italic>Fgf4</italic> as an important player particularly for cervical somite formation. Moreover, they suggest a possible mechanism, i.e. the control of <italic>Hes7</italic> expression by <italic>Fgf4</italic> (see below my comments). These findings will stimulate follow up studies needed to clarify the precise mechanism of how <italic>Fgf4</italic> impacts segmentation, possible via an effect on segmentation clock oscillations. As such this will be an important contribution to the field.</p><p>My main concerns relate to the interpretation of the data and mechanism underlying the phenotype and also the reference to previous work.</p><p>1) Interestingly, <italic>Fgf4</italic> KO results in a regionally confined phenotype, i.e. mainly cervical and thoracic defects, while more posterior vertebrae are not affected. This is mirrored by a slight downregulation of <italic>Hes7</italic> only during early stages of somite formation and a slight mis-expression of Mesp2, again only in the early stages of somite formation.</p><p>As possible explanation the authors suggest that anterior somites, which are forming at a slightly faster rate, are more susceptible to the downregulation of Hes7. However, this interpretation seems to be difficult to reconcile with previous data, i.e. it has been shown that the phenotype of <italic>Hes7</italic> KO is LESS severe in more rostral somites and more severe in more posterior somites ( Bessho et al., 2001). If indeed the loss of <italic>Fgf4</italic> is mediated by the downregulation of Hes7, wouldn't one expect to find a similar bias, i.e. rostral vs. caudal, in phenotype severity in both conditions, i.e. <italic>Fgf4</italic> KO and <italic>Hes7</italic> KO? This point needs clarification.</p><p>2) Another possible mechanism compatible with the data presented is an issue with cell-to-cell synchronization upon <italic>Fgf4</italic> depletion. This is supported by the data on NICD expression, for instance, which is more &quot;irregular&quot; in the PSM. In turn, synchronization is known to rely on Notch-Δ interactions and both, Notch1 and Dll1 have been shown to exhibit oscillatory expression dynamics.</p><p>Therefore, another analysis that I think is urgently missing is a quantification of Dll1 and Notch1 (mRNA and/or protein) in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants. If affected, this could provide a mechanistic insight into a potential loss of synchrony between cells in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.</p><p>3) At the conceptual level, the role suggested for <italic>Fgf4</italic> is to control segmentation clock oscillations, not the wavefront. The authors state: &quot;neither a change in wavefront activity nor a change in determination front position explains the aberrant pattern of Mesp2 expression in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.&quot;(subsection “Wavefront gene expression is normal in <italic>Fgf4”</italic>). What remains unclear, unfortunately, is what the effect of <italic>Fgf4</italic> on the segmentation clock oscillations actually is and how it mechanistically works. Hence, while the key conclusion is 'Together, these data suggest the aberrant Mesp2 patterning <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants can be explained by imprecise oscillations of Notch signaling.&quot; (subsection “Oscillation of Notch family components is altered in the PSM of <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants”), there is no direct data on oscillation dynamics. In my view, the static analysis of clock phases (Figure 5) is difficult to interpret. Real-time imaging quantification are needed, in my view, in particular if relevant for the main conclusion(s) of the study, as in this case (see title of the manuscript!). I would advise to make this extra effort and quantify segmentation oscillations in real-time and reveal, whether indeed &quot;imprecise oscillations&quot; are found. This would substantially strengthen this manuscript. If deemed &quot;beyond the scope of this paper...&quot;, I would argue that the conclusions regarding the effect of Fg4 on the segmentation clock need to be rephrased and adjusted accordingly, i.e. the tile would need to be rephrased, in my view.</p><p>4) &quot;We demonstrate that, while <italic>Fgf8</italic> is not required for somitogenesis, <italic>Fgf4</italic></p><p>is required for normal Notch oscillations and patterning of the vertebral column (Introduction).&quot; As stated above, this contrasts with the previous conclusion by the authors, i.e. &quot;that <italic>Fgf4</italic> likewise is not required for somitogenesis per se (Page 4021 in Naiche et al., 2011). Given that the similar read-out was used at least partially, i.e. skeletal preparations, there needs to be a reference and explanation to avoid confusion of the reader.</p><p>5) Axial level of effects – somites vs. vertebrae:</p><p>The comparison between effects at the level of segmentation of cranial somites vs. cervical vertebrae needs to be clarified. Figure 1E indicates that the first defects are found at vertebrae C5, which actually is formed by somite 10/11. However, somite defects are visible much earlier, i.e. starting at somite 3 (Figure 1J). I think this needs clarification or at least commenting. In this regard, it is again interesting to relate to the seminal <italic>Hes7</italic> KO report (Beshho et al., 2011), as in this context, initial irregularities at the level of somite segmentation were found to be corrected during later development. Is a similar explanation appropriate here? This could also mean that a relevant score (in Figure 1J) could include how severe the phenotype is at the level of Mesp2 expression, i.e. extend of irregularity, for instance. The idea here could be that while minor Mesp2 irregularities might be corrected, more extended Mesp2 irregularities cannot and lead to a phenotype. Such a Mesp2 severity scoring could hence provide additional mechanistic clues into the observed phenotype.</p><p>6) One key remaining question is the mechanism of <italic>Fgf4</italic> function. I think that the evidence to claim &quot; that <italic>FGF4</italic> controls Notch pathway oscillations through the transcriptional repressor, <italic>HES7</italic>&quot; (Abstract) is not convincing. While indeed <italic>Hes7</italic> expression appears irregular in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, this could also be interpreted as an indirect consequence of <italic>Fgf4</italic> depletion, for instance as consequence of synchronization issues (see above). The finding that <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Hes7</italic> genetically synergize does not provide evidence that <italic>Hes7</italic> downregulation is a direct consequence of <italic>Fgf4</italic> depletion, either. In this regard, it is of note that <italic>Hes7</italic> gene expression regulation has been intensively studied and it was shown that the <italic>Hes7</italic> enhancer is controlled (and bound) by Tbx6, Mesogenin and Nicd (Hayashi et al., 2018). What is the evidence <italic>Fgf4</italic> and FGF signaling controls <italic>Hes7</italic> expression directly? I suggest this uncertainty in interpretation is better reflected in the phrasing of the conclusion (again, see Title) and interpretations until the mechanism of <italic>Fgf4</italic> is revealed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55608.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Fgf4 expression analysis should be performed by HCR in both wild type and mutant embryos.

Specifically, “the absence of phenotype at later stages could just reflect absence of Fgf4 expression at that level.”? (This relates to reviewer 2, comment 4).</p><p>In the first draft of this manuscript, Figure 1A, A’ and B showed <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression at somite stages 5 and 10 in wild-type embryos, when defects occur in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants. We have now added Figure 1—figure supplement 3, which shows PSM-specific <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression at somite stages 6 and 24 (via HCR) (Panels A, A’, C, C’) as well as E9.5 through 12.5 in the tailbud (via WISH) (panels E-G’). The somites and vertebrae generated at all of these stages (except somite stage 6) are normal, thus directly answering this question. The following new text (subsection “FGF4 activity is required in the presomitic mesoderm for normal segmentation of rostral somites”) addresses this question:</p><p>“We considered whether this normal <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) and the resulting proper somite patterning caudal to somite 22 that occurs in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants (Figure 1J), might reflect an absence of PSM-specific <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression in normal development at later stages. However, we detected <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression throughout the PSM at somite stage 22 through E12.5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, C’, E-G’).”</p><p>1.2) Show the efficiency of TCre-mediated inactivation of <italic>Fgf4</italic>. “As pointed out by the reviewers, T-cre activity is not restricted to the PSM as it starts in the primitive streak. Checking Fgf4 expression in the mutants will also show where and the extent of its inactivation.” (related to reviewer 2, comment 4). In the new Figure 1—figure supplement 3, we performed an HCR analysis of <italic>Fgf4</italic> at somite stages 6 and 24, using a probe for sequences deleted by Cre (therefore we are screening Cre deletion of <italic>Fgf4</italic>). This shows <italic>Fgf4</italic> is deleted both in the PSM and primitive streak.</p><p>The following text (subsection “FGF4 activity is required in the presomitic mesoderm for normal segmentation of rostral somites”) describes this new data:</p><p>“We then considered whether TCre-mediated inactivation of <italic>Fgf4</italic> resulted in loss of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression in the PSM throughout development. We expected this would be the case because TCre is active in the primitive streak at E7.5<sup>36</sup> and, in prior studies, has been shown to inactivate <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> in the primitive streak and PSM, prior to formation of the first somite <sup>28,36</sup>. Indeed, we detect no <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression in the PSM at somite stage 6 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, B’), when aberrant somites form, nor at somite stage 24 (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D, D’), when normal somites form. Therefore, we conclude that <italic>Fgf4</italic> is expressed within the PSM throughout development, but is required for normal somitogenesis only at early stages. When <italic>Fgf4</italic> is inactivated early, in the caudal embryo, abnormally patterned <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression occurs only at these early stages, causing the observed vertebral defects in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.”</p><p>Also, we edited the Discussion to read “We describe mutants with only <italic>Fgf4</italic> or <italic>Fgf8</italic> inactivated specifically in the primitive streak and PSM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.3) “This could also show the extension of Fgf4 expression in the PSM.”</p></disp-quote><p>We think this relates to reviewer 2, comment 1, asking whether <italic>Fgf4</italic> is expressed in a gradient.

We agree that dynamic analysis of cycling activity would be ideal. One of our co-authors (Dr Kageyama, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) sent us mice carrying the Hes7-Luc transgene (Takashima et al., 2011). We then generated the appropriate crosses to analyze this Hes7-Luc transgenic luciferase activity live in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants. Unfortunately, we found the luciferase activity too weak at the necessary early somite stages, particularly in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, which have a ~ 50% reduction in both endogenous and Hes7-Luc expression, to obtain data of sufficient quality for analysis.</p><p>We are currently importing a more sensitive fluorescent Hes7 transgenic reporter mouse line, also generated by Dr. Kagayama’s group, called “Hes7-Achilles” (Yoshioka-Kobayashi et al., 2020).

I find this a very interesting study which combines elegant mouse genetics coupled to novel quantitative methods of gene expression analysis in vivo to demonstrate the implication of Fgf4 in the regulation of the oscillations. This is a novel finding that should be of interested to the community of developmental biologists and beyond. The paper is suitable for eLife provided the comments below are addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his opinion:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of puzzling observations of the work is the irregular pattern of NICD expression. It is unclear to me why the disruption of Hes7 expression should affect NICD. One explanation could be through Lfng which is regulated by Hes7 and which in turn regulates Notch signaling. I think analyzing Lfng expression in the Fgf4 mutants would be important for this study to be able to conclude on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very helpful criticism.

However, Axin2 (while a good WNT reporter) is not required for somitogenesis (Yu et al., 2005). Therefore, any observed changes require further studies to determine whether WNT signaling is acting epistatically between <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Hes7</italic> or just downstream of <italic>Fgf4</italic>, in parallel to <italic>Fgf4</italic>’s effect on <italic>Hes7</italic>.

The authors show that embryos in which Fgf4 was conditionally inactivated in the PSM had vertebral malformations in the cervical and thoracic regions, compatible with abnormal segmentation in the paraxial mesoderm. This effect was not seen in similar Fgf8 mutants, the other FGF molecule thought to be functionally relevant in this embryonic region. They then show abnormal cyclic behaviour of Hes7 and Lfng in the PSM of Fgf4 mutant embryos at E8.5 but not ~E9.5 (22-24 somites). Through quantitative estimations using whole mount in situ HCR the authors show that in Fgf4 mutant embryos Hes7 expression is overall reduced in the PSM. To explain the link between Hes7 expression levels and abnormal Notch cyclic behaviour the authors propose that the reduced Hes7 expression would interfere with the negative feedback loop on its own transcription, eventually impacting the cyclic Notch signalling activity in the PSM. The relevance of Hes7 downstream Fgf4 signalling was further shown by introducing the Fgf4 mutation into the Hes7 heterozygous background, which resulted in a clear increase in the strength of the skeletal phenotypes relative to those observed in Fgf4 mutant or Hes7 heterozygote embryos.</p><p>This work provides evidence of a connection between Fgf4 signalling and the cyclic behaviour of Notch signalling in the PSM. It also represents the first direct quantitative description of the importance of precise expression levels of a particular component of the Notch pathway to guarantee proper function of the regulatory network leading to Notch cyclic signalling activity, and the impact that this actually has on paraxial segmentation. It also shows the value of HCR to understand the impact of quantitative parameters in gene function in vivo.</p><p>I have a few comments that I think could help increasing the impact of this manuscript in order to further understand the mechanisms of paraxial segmentation and the specificity in FGF signalling activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her opinion: This work provides evidence of a connection between Fgf4 signalling and the cyclic behaviour of Notch signalling in the PSM.

How does the data in this manuscript fit in this model? For instance, Fgf8 has been considered the key FGF signal forming the relevant gradient, but Fgf8 inactivation seems to have no negative impact on somitogenesis. However, Fgf4 inactivation alone is able to interfere with proper somitogenesis. Does Fgf4 generate a gradient in the PSM? This could be explored by whole mount in situ HCR. In case such gradient is not observed, or it does not cover the PSM length, is a FGF gradient required for somitogenesis?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding a role of an FGF signaling gradient in somitogenesis. We address the question of <italic>Fgf4</italic> expression and a potential gradient in Essential revisions 1.3 above. We enthusiastically agree with the reviewer that the subject of FGF gradients in the PSM is an important and fascinating one. However, we suggest that a deep analysis of FGF gradients via HCR analysis, including an experimental investigation into their functionality, is beyond the scope of the current paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In line with the previous comment, it looks like the Fgf4 is required to set Hes7 expression levels and that this alone has significant effects on the functional dynamics of Notch signalling, eventually affecting segmentation. This might actually fit better with a role of FGF signalling on the cells added by the axial progenitors to the posterior end of the PSM as the embryo grows, rather than with interference with a FGF gradient in the PSM. Indeed, an independent double Fgf4/Fgf8 gene inactivation in the axial progenitor zone (Boulet and Capecchi, 2012) produced a phenotype more consistent with these signals modulating the production of new paraxial mesodermal tissue to be incorporated into the PSM as the embryos grow. The phenotype of the double T-cre-Fgf8/T-cre-Fgf4 mutants mentioned in this manuscript could also be interpreted along the same lines.</p></disp-quote><p>The caption of a new Figure 1—figure supplement 3, makes clear that <italic>Fgf4</italic> does not appear to be expressed in a gradient in the PSM (although note, we have only analyzed mRNA, not protein. Again, much more experimentation is needed, beyond the scope of the current study). We contend that FGF4 doesn’t affect the number of cells added by the axial progenitors to the posterior end of the PSM as the embryo grows, because there is no axial truncations in these <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants (Anderson, 2016). Furthermore, a measure of the wavefront size (Figure 2) shows no difference at a stage when mispatterned somites are generated. In the two studies the reviewer references, where both <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> are inactivated, (Boulet and Capecchi, 2012; Naiche et al., 2011) such a truncation indeed occurs (although in Figure 4 of Naiche et al., we also demonstrated premature PSM differentiation). In the current draft we state this in subsection “Wavefront gene expression is normal in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants”, “Therefore, we conclude that wavefront activity is normal in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, an insight consistent with the observation that normal axis extension occurs in these mutants, with no loss of caudal vertebrae <sup>42</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors have an insight into the mechanism by which Fgf4 modulates Hes7 expression levels? Also, why is Fgf8 not able to substitute for Fgf4 in this function, when it is expressed at higher levels in the posterior embryo than Fgf4? This is important as it could also help understanding signalling specificity from the different FGF molecules (and they are too often used interchangeably in many experimental designs). Also, it questions the use of the analysis of Fgf8 gradients to interpret segmentation defects in mutant embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an intriguing and excellent question. (although we would point out that while the <italic>Fgf8</italic> mRNA pattern may be larger than that of <italic>Fgf4</italic>, we don’t know that this results in higher signaling levels). As mentioned above in Essential revision 3 and below in response to reviewer 3, comment 3 and 6, our future work will focus on how FGF4 regulates <italic>Hes7</italic>. Regarding Fgf8, we have added text to our Discussion section:</p><p>“This study and past work indicate that FGF4 and FGF8 have both shared and unique roles in the vertebrate embryo’s posterior growth zone. They redundantly encode wavefront activities, preventing PSM differentiation <sup>28,74</sup>. In this capacity, when signaling together, they activate downstream canonical FGF target genes, such as <italic>Spry2</italic>, <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Etv4</italic><sup>28</sup>. Here, we show that the role that FGF4 signals play in maintaining <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels cannot be replaced by FGF8.</p><p>Future efforts will explore how the signaling machinery within the PSM discriminates between these two FGF ligands. For example, our work argues for a reassessment of FGFR function in the PSM; prior work, in which the same Cre driver used here (TCre) inacativates <italic>Fgfr1</italic><sup>31</sup>, thought to be the only FGF receptor gene expressed in the PSM, does not phenocopy the defects due to TCre-mediated loss of either <italic>Fgf4</italic> (this study) or <italic>Fgf4/Fgf8</italic><sup>28</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) An interesting finding in this manuscript is that the effects of inactivating Fgf4 are observed in cervical, thoracic and anterior lumbar regions but not in more posterior areas of the skeleton. This is reminiscent of what has been observed for Lfng: while its total inactivation affects paraxial segmentation throughout the anterior posterior axis (Zhang and Gridley, 1998; Evrard et al., 1998), Lfng cyclic activity seems to be required for presacral vertebrae but dispensable for posterior embryonic regions (Shifley et al., 2008). The authors interpret this differential Fgf4 effect in terms of different speed of somitogenesis at the two axial levels. However, as that the anterior regions derive from the epiblast through the primitive streak, whereas more posterior regions derive from the tail bud, it is possible that somitogenesis itself could be mechanistically not so uniform and contain relevant differences in areas produced by progenitors in the epiblast or tail bud. Such differences could explain the differential phenotypes in anterior and posterior embryonic regions upon Fgf4 inactivation or the different requirements for Lfng cyclic behaviour. Also, could differences in T-cre driver activity in the epiblast and tail bud play a role in the regional-specific phenotypes of the Fgf4 mutation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that different axial levels have different requirements signaling and functional requirements eg, as shown in this paper and in (Shifley et al., 2008) as the reviewer points out. However, the reviewer is suggesting the transition from primary to secondary axis extension may correlate with the requirements for Fgf4 activity. We considered this intriguing idea, but do not think it helpful – because somites 22-32, which are still generated in the primary axis (i.e. rostral to neuropore closure) are unaffected in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants. Therefore, while all affected somites are in the primary axis, the caudal primary axis is not affected.</p><p>Regarding the TCre driver, our published work suggest inactivation of <italic>Fgf4</italic> and <italic>Fgf8</italic> prior to somitogenesis in all progenitors (see Figure 2 D,E in Perantoni et al., 2005 and Figures 1E, G, I and Figure 1—figure supplement 1D in Naiche et al., 2011). We have now added Figure 1—figure supplement 3, supporting these suppositions, as described above in Essential revision 1.2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors provide convincing genetic evidence for a role of Fgf4 in controlling somite formation in mouse embryos. I find this work of high quality and importance. While in a previous study, the authors had concluded that &quot;Fgf4 [...] is not required for somitogenesis per se&quot; (Page 4021 in Naiche et al., 2011) their current work clearly identifies Fgf4 as an important player particularly for cervical somite formation. Moreover, they suggest a possible mechanism, i.e. the control of Hes7 expression by Fgf4 (see below my comments). These findings will stimulate follow up studies needed to clarify the precise mechanism of how Fgf4 impacts segmentation, possible via an effect on segmentation clock oscillations. As such this will be an important contribution to the field.</p><p>My main concerns relate to the interpretation of the data and mechanism underlying the phenotype and also the reference to previous work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for her/his opinion. These findings will stimulate follow up studies needed to clarify the precise mechanism of how Fgf4 impacts segmentation, possible via an effect on segmentation clock oscillations. As such this will be an important contribution to the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Interestingly, Fgf4 KO results in a regionally confined phenotype, i.e. mainly cervical and thoracic defects, while more posterior vertebrae are not affected. This is mirrored by a slight downregulation of Hes7 only during early stages of somite formation and a slight mis-expression of Mesp2, again only in the early stages of somite formation.</p><p>As possible explanation the authors suggest that anterior somites, which are forming at a slightly faster rate, are more susceptible to the downregulation of Hes7. However, this interpretation seems to be difficult to reconcile with previous data, i.e. it has been shown that the phenotype of Hes7 KO is LESS severe in more rostral somites and more severe in more posterior somites ( Bessho et al., 2001). If indeed the loss of Fgf4 is mediated by the downregulation of Hes7, wouldn't one expect to find a similar bias, i.e. rostral vs. caudal, in phenotype severity in both conditions, i.e. Fgf4 KO and Hes7 KO? This point needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectively disagree that the 50% reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA (Figure 5H, Figure 5—figure supplement 4 and Figure 7E) is considered “slight”; it is both statistically significant and is a greater difference than that observed in <italic>Hes7</italic> heterozygotes (Figure 7E).</p><p>We suggest that a direct comparison of the conditional <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants and <italic>Hes7</italic> null homozygotes phenotypes is a little complicated because, in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, <italic>Hes7</italic> levels are reduced about 50% only at early stages (somite stage 5 – 6, Figure 5H and Figure 5—figure supplement 4) and then are found at normal levels later (somite stage 24-26, Figure 5 —figure supplement 5). Therefore, it is logical that more caudal regions of the vertebral column are unaffected in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, unlike <italic>Hes7</italic> mutants. We make this more explicit in the Discussion section:</p><p>“We observed that in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants <italic>Hes7</italic> mRNA levels are reduced during rostral somitogenesis at E8.5 (5-6 somite stages), when defective somitogenesis occurs. At about E9.5 (24-26 somite stages), <italic>Hes7</italic> levels are unaffected, and the <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutant embryo is beginning to generate correctly patterned somites that will differentiate into normally patterned vertebrae.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Another possible mechanism compatible with the data presented is an issue with cell-to-cell synchronization upon Fgf4 depletion. This is supported by the data on NICD expression, for instance, which is more &quot;irregular&quot; in the PSM. In turn, synchronization is known to rely on Notch-Δ interactions and both, Notch1 and Dll1 have been shown to exhibit oscillatory expression dynamics.</p><p>Therefore, another analysis that I think is urgently missing is a quantification of Dll1 and Notch1 (mRNA and/or protein) in Fgf4 mutants. If affected, this could provide a mechanistic insight into a potential loss of synchrony between cells in Fgf4 mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that quantification of <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Notch</italic> 1 would be an important step along the pathway of solving the mechanism of <italic>Hes7</italic> regulation by FGF4. But we contend that because NICD levels in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants are not significantly affected (Figure 4A), <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Notch1</italic> levels are unlikely to be significantly reduced. (For example, <italic>Dll1</italic> and <italic>Notch1</italic> heterozygotes have a much less severe defect, see Figure 2 in Sparrow et al., 2012). However, we speculate that a careful Imaris-based HCR analysis may show an asynchronous expression pattern of these genes, as we have found for NICD, <italic>Hes7</italic> and <italic>Lfng</italic> (Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). We agree with the reviewer that such an observation would support defective synchronization of oscillation (see point 3.3, below). However, we suggest this would be a step toward defining mechanism, but would be an incomplete analysis. Such experiments will be part of our mechanistic studies (see Essential revision 3, above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At the conceptual level, the role suggested for Fgf4 is to control segmentation clock oscillations, not the wavefront. The authors state: &quot;neither a change in wavefront activity nor a change in determination front position explains the aberrant pattern of Mesp2 expression in Fgf4 mutants.&quot;(subsection “Wavefront gene expression is normal in Fgf4”). What remains unclear, unfortunately, is what the effect of Fgf4 on the segmentation clock oscillations actually is and how it mechanistically works. Hence, while the key conclusion is 'Together, these data suggest the aberrant Mesp2 patterning Fgf4 mutants can be explained by imprecise oscillations of Notch signaling.&quot; (subsection “Oscillation of Notch family components is altered in the PSM of Fgf4 mutants”), there is no direct data on oscillation dynamics. In my view, the static analysis of clock phases (Figure 5) is difficult to interpret. Real-time imaging quantification are needed, in my view, in particular if relevant for the main conclusion(s) of the study, as in this case (see title of the manuscript!). I would advise to make this extra effort and quantify segmentation oscillations in real-time and reveal, whether indeed &quot;imprecise oscillations&quot; are found. This would substantially strengthen this manuscript. If deemed &quot;beyond the scope of this paper...&quot;, I would argue that the conclusions regarding the effect of Fg4 on the segmentation clock need to be rephrased and adjusted accordingly, i.e. the tile would need to be rephrased, in my view.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. Our response to Essential revision 3, above, describes our efforts at live-imaging and mechanism as well as plans for moving forward…. With the reviewer’s criticism in mind, we edited the manuscript throughout to reflect the idea that oscillation synchrony is clearly affected (not listed here, but these should be evident in the “tracked” draft.). For example, we have edited the Title as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot; We demonstrate that, while Fgf8 is not required for somitogenesis, Fgf4</p><p>is required for normal Notch oscillations and patterning of the vertebral column (Introduction).&quot; As stated above, this contrasts with the previous conclusion by the authors, i.e. &quot;that Fgf4 likewise is not required for somitogenesis per se (Page 4021 in Naiche et al., 2011). Given that the similar read-out was used at least partially, i.e. skeletal preparations, there needs to be a reference and explanation to avoid confusion of the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In Naiche et al., we used a broader definition of somitogenesis, equivalent to “somites form.” In the current manuscript we mean somitogenesis to mean “properly patterned somites”. To clarify this, we added a sentence in the beginning of the Discussion section:</p><p>“In previous work, we reported that somites form in such mutants <sup>28,36</sup>; here we examine the patterning of these somites, the Notch pathway oscillations that control their formation, as well as the vertebral elements that they eventually form.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Axial level of effects – somites vs. vertebrae:</p><p>The comparison between effects at the level of segmentation of cranial somites vs. cervical vertebrae needs to be clarified. Figure 1E indicates that the first defects are found at vertebrae C5, which actually is formed by somite 10/11. However, somite defects are visible much earlier, i.e. starting at somite 3 (Figure 1J). I think this needs clarification or at least commenting. In this regard, it is again interesting to relate to the seminal Hes7 KO report (Beshho et al., 2011), as in this context, initial irregularities at the level of somite segmentation were found to be corrected during later development. Is a similar explanation appropriate here? This could also mean that a relevant score (in Figure 1J) could include how severe the phenotype is at the level of Mesp2 expression, i.e. extend of irregularity, for instance. The idea here could be that while minor Mesp2 irregularities might be corrected, more extended Mesp2 irregularities cannot and lead to a phenotype. Such a Mesp2 severity scoring could hence provide additional mechanistic clues into the observed phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these excellent suggestions. We scored the severity of mutant <italic>Mesp2</italic> expression, and found no significant difference comparing somite stages 5-7 to somite stages 10-12. However, the reviewer’s instruction to look more closely at Beshho et al., 2001 was an excellent idea. In our original scoring of <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> patterning (Figure 1J), somites 1-6 were scored in somite stage 7 <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants and somites 7-26 were scored in somite stage 26-30 <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants. By examining the fifth and sixth somites in each of these two sets, we indeed found evidence that mispatterning of these somites corrected as the embryos developed, as the reviewer suggested, and as was reported in the <italic>Hes7</italic> KO (Beshho et al., 2001). Therefore, we replaced Figure 1J with only the data from the latter stage mutants and now show the more rostral scoring (of both sets of mutants) in Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We now describe these analyses in subsection “FGF4 activity is required in the presomitic mesoderm for normal segmentation of rostral somites”:</p><p>“We examined gross somite patterning in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants by staining embryos at various stages for <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> mRNA, which marks the posterior somite compartment <sup>37,38</sup>. Analysis of 19 E9.5 <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants revealed a frequency of irregular <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> expression specifically in future cervical and thoracic somites with full penetrance (Figure 1F-J). We did not score the most rostral somites in these samples because <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> expression is absent in these early somites due to the differentiation of somites 1 – 4 to form the occipital bones <sup>39</sup>. To examine these rostral somites we scored 20 <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants at somite stage 7 and found defective <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> patterning beginning at somite 3 in this sample set (black bars, Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Interestingly, a majority of <italic>Uncx4.1</italic> patterning defects in somite 5 and 6 had apparently corrected by (gray bars, E9.5 Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Hence, these somites partially corrected or regulated their pattern and may account for the relatively low level of rostral vertebral defects at E18.5 (Figure 1E). This correction of rostral somite patterning is found in embryos lacking <italic>Hes7</italic> expression <sup>40</sup>, which, as we show below, is reduced in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) One key remaining question is the mechanism of Fgf4 function. I think that the evidence to claim &quot; that FGF4 controls Notch pathway oscillations through the transcriptional repressor, HES7&quot; (Abstract) is not convincing. While indeed Hes7 expression appears irregular in Fgf4 mutants, this could also be interpreted as an indirect consequence of Fgf4 depletion, for instance as consequence of synchronization issues (see above). The finding that Fgf4 and Hes7 genetically synergize does not provide evidence that Hes7 downregulation is a direct consequence of Fgf4 depletion, either. In this regard, it is of note that Hes7 gene expression regulation has been intensively studied and it was shown that the Hes7 enhancer is controlled (and bound) by Tbx6, Mesogenin and Nicd (Hayashi et al., 2018). What is the evidence Fgf4 and FGF signaling controls Hes7 expression directly? I suggest this uncertainty in interpretation is better reflected in the phrasing of the conclusion (again, see Title) and interpretations until the mechanism of Fgf4 is revealed.</p></disp-quote><p>One of our important observations is that <italic>Hes7</italic> expression not only “appears irregular” but is reduced by 50%. Such a reduction is likely to cause the observed defects given that <italic>Hes7</italic> heterozygosity or hypomorphic defects, all cause vertebral defects (Sparrow et al., 2012; Stauber et al., 2009; Fujimuro et al., 2014). We contend that the genetic synergy between <italic>Hes7</italic> and <italic>Fgf4</italic> supports this idea; although we agree with the reviewer that it does not prove that <italic>Hes7</italic> is a direct FGF4 target.</p><p>In our first draft, we never stated that <italic>Hes7</italic> is a direct FGF4 target. But we can see how a reader can get this impression, given our emphasis on <italic>Hes7</italic>. To correct this, we have edited the Discussion in several places to qualify our <italic>Hes7</italic> model as speculative, Also we</p><p>added a new paragraph, incorporating the reviewer’s ideas:</p><p>“We propose that this reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> levels is the primary defect in <italic>Fgf4</italic> mutants, and subsequently causes an irregular activated Notch (NICD) pattern, misexpression of <italic>Mesp2</italic>, and ultimately leads to vertebral defects. A reduction in <italic>Hes7</italic> levels, due to heterozygosity or hypomorphic mutations, has been shown to cause vertebral defects <sup>25,62,63</sup>. The concept that <italic>Hes7</italic> is generally regulated by FGF signaling is supported by numerous studies <sup>28,32,64</sup>. Future work will determine whether <italic>Hes7</italic> is a direct FGF4 signaling target, possibly through putative ETS binding sites in the <italic>Hes7</italic> promoter <sup>65</sup>. Alternatively, FGF4 may indirectly regulate <italic>Hes7</italic> transcription by affecting the activity of TBX6, NICD or MESOGENIN, all shown to regulate <italic>Hes7</italic> expression in the PSM <sup>65,66</sup>. If so, we speculate such regulation would be post-transcriptional because we find no significant difference in levels of the genes encoding these factors. Additionally, it is possible that FGF4 signaling is interfacing with WNT signaling, which also has been shown to regulate <italic>Hes7</italic><sup>6529,30</sup>.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
