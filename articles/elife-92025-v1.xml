medicine and disease modelling. In this study, we characterise the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from independent donors and find that while they express a near-identical set of proteins, they show consistent quantitative differences in the abundance of a subset of proteins. hiPSCs have increased total protein content, while maintaining a comparable cell cycle profile to hESCs, with increased abundance of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins required to sustain high growth rates, including nutrient transporters and metabolic proteins. Prominent changes detected in proteins involved in mitochondrial metabolism correlated with enhanced mitochondrial potential, shown using high-resolution respirometry. hiPSCs also produced higher levels of secreted proteins, including growth factors and proteins involved in the inhibition of the immune system. The data indicate that reprogramming of fibroblasts to hiPSCs produces important differences in cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins compared to hESCs, with consequences affecting growth and metabolism. This study improves our understanding of the molecular differences between hiPSCs and hESCs, with implications for potential risks and benefits for their use in future disease modelling and therapeutic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>hESC</kwd><kwd>protein content</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>098503/E/12/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/073980</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V010948/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/Y010655/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/097418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/105024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/205023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cantrell</surname><given-names>Doreen A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206293/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swedlow</surname><given-names>Jason R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lamond</surname><given-names>Angus I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

They show prolonged undifferentiated potential, as well as the ability to differentiate into the three main embryonic germ layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Thomson et al., 1998</xref>), making them excellent models for studying disease mechanisms, development, and differentiation. However, their use remains restricted by regulations, based in part upon ethical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Volarevic et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Over a decade ago, methods allowing the induction of pluripotent stem cells from fibroblast cultures, in both human and mice, were developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). These reports showed that by exogenously expressing a small set of key transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4), a somatic cell could be reprogrammed back into a pluripotent state, characterised by their capacity for self-renewal and ability to differentiate into the three main germ layers. These human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) show many key features of their physiological hESCs counterparts, while avoiding many of the ethical issues regarding the use of stem cells derived from embryos.</p><p>Since the discovery of reprogramming methods, hiPSC lines have attracted great interest, particularly for their potential use as alternatives to hESCs in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimbrel and Lanza, 2015</xref>) and disease modelling, including studies on monogenic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2009</xref>) and some late onset diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). However, to understand the value of using hiPSCs in regenerative therapy, drug development and/or studies of disease mechanisms, it is important to establish how similar hiPSCs are to hESCs at the molecular and functional levels. To address this, multiple studies have compared hiPSCs and hESCs, using a variety of assays, including methylation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mallon et al., 2014</xref>), transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mallon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guenther et al., 2010</xref>), and even quantitative proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munoz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phanstiel et al., 2011</xref>). It should be noted, however, that many of these earlier studies were performed at a time when reprogramming protocols were less robust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vitale et al., 2012</xref>) and when the depth of proteome coverage and quantitative information that could be obtained was lower than today.</p><p>In this study, we have addressed the similarity of hiPSCs to hESCs by performing a detailed proteomic analysis, comparing a set of four hiPSC lines derived from human primary skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kilpinen et al., 2017</xref>) of independent, healthy donors, with four independent hESC lines. The data highlight that while both types of stem cell lines have very similar global protein abundance profiles, they also show some specific and significant quantitative differences in protein expression. In particular, the reprogrammed iPSC lines consistently display higher total protein levels, predominantly affecting cytoplasmic proteins required to sustain higher growth, along with mitochondrial changes, and an excess of secreted proteins, with impact upon cell phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>hESCs and hiPSCs display quantitative differences in protein abundances</title><p>For this study, we compared multiple hESC and hiPSC lines, all derived from different donors and cultured using identical growth conditions. First, the expression levels of the main pluripotency markers were verified in each of the lines, with no differences detected between the respective hESC and hiPSC types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). From these data, representative sets of four hiPSCs and four hESCs lines were selected for detailed proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry (MS). The proteomes were characterised using tandem mass tags (TMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Thompson et al., 2003</xref>), within a single 10-plex (TMT channel allocation) and using MS3-based synchronous precursor selection (SPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McAlister et al., 2014</xref>). To further optimise quantification accuracy, each sample was allocated to a specific isobaric tag to minimise cross-population reporter ion interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brenes et al., 2019</xref>). In total 8491 protein groups (henceforth referred to as ‘proteins’) were detected at 1% false discovery rate (FDR), with &gt;99% overlap between the proteins detected from both the hESC and hiPSC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, it is important to highlight that TMT is not the best method to use when looking for proteins that are specific to one condition or population, as protein detected in one channel are frequently seen across all other channels as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brenes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteomic overview.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Western blots showing the expression of the pluripotency factors NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 across all human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiSPC) lines.

Our data show that the most abundant H1 variant in hESCs, HIST1H1E, is decreased in abundance in hiPSCs by ~3.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), while HIST1H1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), HIST1H1D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), and H1FX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>) are all decreased by &gt;1.7-fold.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Changes within histones.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Barplot showing the GO term enrichment results for proteins significantly decreased in abundance (see Materials and methods) in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).

The Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) assigns peptide intensities to a protein following a razor peptide approach, where the intensity of a peptide is assigned to only one protein, regardless of whether it is unique or shared by two or more proteins. This makes the analysis of specific variants challenging at the protein level. Hence, we focussed on a peptide-specific approach with the MS data and found that the intensity of the peptides that were shared between these 3 H1 histone variants displayed a consistent reduction in abundance in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The systematic reduction in abundance in hiPSCs seen with H1 histone variants was not seen for members of the other histone families. Evaluating either the concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), or copy numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), across all histones, showed no significant differences in expression between hiPSCs and hESCs. Furthermore, for core histones, including H3 and H4, there were no significant abundance differences seen within either the proteomics data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g and h</xref>), or in additional western blot analyses that were performed to validate these conclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i and j</xref>). However, we did detect differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in the expression of histone H2 variants, with H2AFV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>), H2AFY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6l</xref>), and H2AFY2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6m</xref>), all increased in abundance in hiPSCs. As histone H2 variants also have high sequence similarity and shared peptides, we also performed a peptide level analysis, which validated that both shared and unique peptides displayed the same pattern, i.e., showing increased abundance in hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, we conclude that there are opposing effects for histone H1 and histone H2 variants, with the former decreased and the latter increased in abundance in hiPSCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Induced pluripotent stem cells can provide valuable models for clinical research and future therapies, which makes it vital to understand both their similarities and any specific differences, with embryo-derived human stem cells. This study provides a detailed comparison of the proteomes of multiple hiPSC and hESC lines derived from different donors. The major conclusion is that while hiPSC and hESC lines express a near-identical set of proteins, with similar abundance ranks, they also display important quantitative differences. In particular, our data indicate that hiPSCs reprogrammed from skin fibroblasts display considerable differences in their cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteomes, compared to hESCs, while the nuclear proteome was very similar between the two cell types. Furthermore, additional microscopy analyses and functional assays showed that the systematic differences in the proteomes of the respective hiPSCs and hESCs had a measurable impact on cell phenotypes, most notably affecting mitochondria, metabolic activity, and nutrient transport. It would be of interest in future to analyse whether hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types, such as peripheral leukocytes, also share these differences in protein expression with hESCs, or if these specific changes are characteristic of fibroblast-derived iPS cells.</p><p>Using estimated protein copy numbers, our data show that only &lt;1% of proteins were significantly decreased in abundance in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs, including multiple H1 histones. In contrast, ~56% of all proteins quantified were significantly increased in hiPSCs (fold change&gt;1.5 and q-value&lt;0.001), with most of these increases affecting cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins and activities. The MS data show that total protein levels are higher overall in hiPSCs, as compared with hESCs, a result that was independently validated using an EZQ protein assay. This difference in total protein content was shown by FACS analysis not to result from systematic differences between hiPSCs and hESCs in cell cycle progression. Instead, the increased protein levels in hiPSCs correlated with increased levels of the protein translational machinery, along with increased metabolic and mitochondrial activity and higher levels of nutrient transport.</p><p>These results highlight an important technical point relating to data normalisation and its effect on the interpretation of such data. By using a standard median normalisation (concentration-based approach), instead of the proteomic ruler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wiśniewski et al., 2014</xref>), the difference in total protein content between the cell types, involving the increased abundance of thousands of proteins, is not apparent. Hence, two cell types with, for example, a fourfold higher total protein content, could nonetheless appear to show virtually no significant differences, as long as the protein ranks and relative concentrations remained similar. This would result in an erroneous conclusion that there is little to no change in protein expression, while the orthogonal data suggest otherwise.</p><p>Having established that hiPSCs displayed higher total protein content than corresponding hESC lines, we sought to understand how this could be maintained. To maximise protein synthesis, nutrient availability and energy production are key factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchingo and Cantrell, 2022</xref>). The proteomic data show that vital nutrient transporters, known to be important for growth and protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bröer, 2020</xref>), were significantly increased in hiPSCs, compared to hESCs. In particular, the three glutamine transporters, SLC1A5, SLC38A1, and SLC38A2, were all significantly increased in abundance, with additional functional assays showing that this correlated with higher levels of glutamine uptake measured in hiPSCs. Glutamine has been previously shown to fuel growth and proliferation in rapidly dividing cells, including cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhutia and Ganapathy, 2016</xref>) and could be sustaining higher rates in hiPSCs.</p><p>Nutrients provide the fuel, but it is the metabolic proteins that are the engines that convert them to energy. Here, our data showed that proteins involved in both glycolysis and glutaminolysis were significantly increased in abundance in hiPSCs. When cells preferentially use the glycolytic pathway, e.g., stem cells and cancer cells, there is increased demand for biosynthetic precursors and NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ju et al., 2020</xref>). These precursors can be supplied via glutaminolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wise and Thompson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reitzer et al., 1979</xref>) linked to the TCA, both important mitochondrial processes and both with significantly increased protein levels in hiPSCs, along with other proteins involved in the ETC. One caveat is that an uneven distribution of biological sex between donors of the respective hESC and hiPSCs lines could mean there is a potential for sex-specific differences to explain at least some of these effects, however in previous a large-scale proteomic study of male and female hiPSCs no changes in proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation were detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brenes et al., 2021</xref>). Differences in the mitochondria between hiPSCs and hESCs have been previously reported, but whether they originate from the reprogramming process, or are induced by the increased nutrient uptake, remains unknown and is a point of interest for future studies.</p><p>Secreted proteins, such as growth factors and ECM proteins, are a category of great interest, because their absolute abundance can affect the surrounding cellular microenvironment. hiPSCs were found here to show increased expression levels of growth factors that are linked to cancer and immunosuppression. For example, FGF2, an important growth factor for primed pluripotent stem cells, has been shown to promote ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lotz et al., 2013</xref>), stimulating protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pelletier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the increased abundance of FGF2 could generate a feedforward loop, further driving/sustaining growth in hiPSCs, however that growth potential is also linked to breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giulianelli et al., 2019</xref>) and gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2020</xref>), as well as gliomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sooman et al., 2015</xref>). Another important growth factor that is increased in abundance in hiPSCs is TGFB1, a known potent inhibitor of T cell responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas and Massagué, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li and Flavell, 2008</xref>). We note that the immunogenicity of pluripotent stem cells has important consequences for cell therapy applications. Our data suggest that hiPSCs might have a higher immune evasion potential, via multiple mechanisms. They display increased abundance of secreted T cell inhibitors, including TGFB1 and ARG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Munder et al., 2006</xref>), along with inhibitory ligands, such as CD276, CD200, and CD47. An increased inhibitory capacity, combined with the tumourigenic potential of hiPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), raises some concerns about the suitability of using reprogrammed hiPSCs for certain types of therapeutic applications. Based upon our current data, we recommend that potential phenotypic consequences resulting from the observed differences in iPS and ESC proteomes should be studied further to determine whether the immunosuppressive properties of these cells vary significantly.</p><p>In summary, our data show that hiPSCs and hESCs, despite their clear similarities, are not identical at both the protein and phenotypic levels. We show that hiPSCs reprogrammed from skin fibroblasts differ from hESCs, predominantly in their cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteome, leading to measurable functional differences affecting their metabolic activity and growth potential. These data can help to inform future strategies to mitigate for these differences as hiPSCs continue to be used in important clinical applications and as disease models.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Cells were collected with trypsin, pelleted, and then placed in MiR05 respiration medium (110 mM sucrose, 60 mM lactobionic acid, 0.5 mM EGTA, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM taurine, 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 20 mM HEPES adjusted to pH 7.1 with KOH at 30°C, and 1 g/l BSA, essentially fatty acid free). Substrate-Uncoupler-Inhibitor titration protocol number 2 (SUIT-002) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Doerrier et al., 2018</xref>) was used to determine respiratory rates. Briefly, after residual oxygen consumption in absence of endogenous fuel substrates, residual oxygen consumption (ROX), in presence of 2.5 mM ADP, was measured, fatty acid oxidation pathway state (F) was evaluated by adding malate (0.1 mM) and octanoyl carnitine (0.2 mM) (OctM<sub>P</sub>). Membrane integrity was tested by adding cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (10 μM) (OctMc<sub>P</sub>). Subsequently, the NADH electron transfer pathway state (FN) was studied by adding a high concentration of malate (2 mM, OctM<sub>P</sub>), pyruvate (5 mM, OctPM<sub>P</sub>), and glutamate (10 mM, OctPGM<sub>P</sub>). Then, succinate (10 mM, OctPGMS<sub>P</sub>) was added to stimulate the S pathway (FNS), followed by glycerophosphate (10 mM, OctPGMSGp<sub>P</sub>) to reach convergent electron flow in the FNSGp pathway to the Q-junction. Uncoupled respiration was next measured by performing a titration with CCCP (OctPGMSGp<sub>E</sub>), followed by inhibition of complex I (SGp<sub>E</sub>) with rotenone (0.5 μM, SGp<sub>E</sub>). Finally, ROX was measured by adding Antimycin A (2.5 μM). ROX was then subtracted from all respiratory states, to obtain mitochondrial respiration. Results are expressed in pmol · s<sup>−1</sup> · 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells. The P/E control ratio, which reflects the control by coupling and limitation by the phosphorylation system, was subsequently calculated by dividing the OctPGMSGp<sub>P</sub> value by the OctPGMSGp<sub>E</sub> value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Radiolabelled glutamine uptake (protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yeramian et al., 2006</xref>)</title><p>Two hiPSC lines (wibj_2 and oaqd_3) with three technical replicates each were compared to two hESC lines (SA121 and SA181) with three technical replicates of each.

authors compared four types of hiPSCs and four types of hESCs at the proteome level to elucidate the differences between hiPSCs and hESCs. Semi-quantitative calculations of protein copy numbers revealed increased protein content in iPSCs. Particularly in iPSCs, proteins related to mitochondrial and cytoplasmic were suggested to reflect the state of the original differentiated cells to some extent. However, the most important result of this study is the calculation of the protein copy numbers per cell, and the validity of this result is problematic. In addition, several experiments need to be improved, such as using cells of different genders (iPSC: female, ESC: male) in mitochondrial metabolism experiments.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The focus on the number of copies of proteins is exciting and appreciated if the estimated calculation result is correct and biologically reproducible.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The proteome results in this study were likely obtained by simply looking at differences between clones, and the proteome data need to be validated. First, there were only a few clones for comparison, and the gender and number of cells did not match between ESCs and iPSCs. Second, no data show the accuracy of the protein copy number per cell obtained by the proteome data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be useful to have data from more independent stem cell clones and ideally an equal gender balance of the donors would be preferable. As usual, practical cost-benefit, and time available affect the scope of work that can be performed. We note that the impact of biological donor sex on proteome expression in iPSC lines has already been addressed in previous studies13. We will however revise the manuscript to include specific mention of these limitations and propose a larger-scale follow-up when resources are available.</p><p>Regarding the estimation of protein copy numbers in our study, we would like to highlight that the proteome ruler approach we have used has been employed extensively in the field previously, with direct validation of differences in copy numbers provided using orthogonal methods to MS, e.g., FACS2-4,7,10. Furthermore, the original manuscript14 directly compared the copy numbers estimated using the “proteomic ruler” to spike-in protein epitope signature tags and found remarkable concordance. This original study was performed with an older generation mass spectrometer and reduced peptide coverage, compared with the instrumentation used in our present study. Further, we noted that these authors predicted that higher peptide coverage, such as we report in our study, would further increase quantitative performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Pluripotent stem cells are powerful tools for understanding development, differentiation, and disease modeling.

We have now included an expanded section in the discussion where we discuss potential causes. However, in our view fully understanding the reasons for this difference is likely to involve extensive future in-depth analysis in additional studies and is not something that can be determined just by one or two additional supplemental experiments.</p><p>We also agree studying hiPSCs reprogrammed from different cell types, such as blood lymphocytes, would be of great interest. Again, while we agree it is a useful way forward, in practice this will require a very substantial additional commitment of time and resources. We have now included a section discussing this opportunity within the discussion to encourage further research into the area.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) aizi1 and ueah1 clones, which were analyzed in Figure 1A, were excluded from the proteome analysis. In particular, the GAPDH expression level of the aizi1 clone is similar to that of ESCs and different from other iPSC clones. An explanation of how the clones were selected for proteome analysis is needed. Previously, the comparative analysis of iPSCs and ESCs reported in many studies from 2009-2017 (Ref#1-7) has already shown that the number of clones used in the comparative analysis is small, claiming differences (Ref#1-3) and that the differences become indistinguishable when the number of clones is increased (Ref#4-7). Certainly, few studies have been done at the proteome level, so it is important to examine what differences exist in the proteome. Also, it is interesting to focus on the amount of protein per cell. However, if the authors want to describe biological differences, it would be better to get the proteome data in biological duplicate and state the reason for selecting the clones used.</p><p>(1) M.

Yamanaka, Cell Stem Cell, PMID: 22704507</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analysing more clones would be beneficial. We have included a section of this topic in the discussion. In our study, we only had access to the 4 hESC lines included, therefore in the original proteomic study we also analysed 4 hiPSC lines, which were routinely grown within our stem cell facility. While as the study progressed the stem cell facility expanded the culture of additional hiPSC lines, unfortunately we couldn’t also access additional hESC lines.</p><p>We agree that ideally combining each biological replicate with additional technical replicates would provide extra robustness. As usual, cost and practical considerations at the time the experiments were performed affected the experimental design chosen. For the experimental design, each experiment was contained within 1 batch to avoid the strong batch effects present in TMT (Brenes et al 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) iPSC samples used in the proteome analysis are two types of female and two types of male, while ESC samples are three types of female and one type of female. The number of sexes of the cells in the comparative analysis should be matched because sex differences may bias the results.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree with the reviewer in principle, we have previously performed detailed comparisons of proteome expression in many independent iPSC lines from both biological male and female donors (see Brenes et al., Cell Reports 2021) and it seems unlikely that biological sex differences alone could account for the proteome differences between iPS and ESC lines uncovered in this study . However, as this is a relevant point, we have revised the manuscript to explicitly mention this caveat within the discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 1h, I suspect that the variation of PCA plots is very similar between ESCs and iPSCs. In particular, the authors wrote &quot;copy numbers for all 8 replicates&quot; in the legend, but if Figure 1b was done 8 times, there should be 8 types of cells x 8 measurements = 64 points. Even if iPSCs and ESCs are grouped together, there should be 8 points for each cell type. Is it possible that there is only one TMT measurement for this analysis? If so, at least technical duplicates or biological duplicates would be necessary. I also think each cell should be plotted in the PCA analysis instead of combining the four types of ESCs and iPSCs into one.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this error to our attention. The legend has been corrected to state, “for all 8 stem cell lines”.

Therefore, if the authors want to have a biological discussion based on the results, they need to show that the estimated concentrations are correct. For example, there are Western Blotting (WB) results for genes with no change in protein levels in hESC and hiPSC in Fig. 6ij, but the WB results for the group of genes that are claimed to have changed are not shown throughout the paper. Also, there is no difference in the total protein level between iPSCs and ESCs from the ponceau staining in Fig.6ij. WB results for at least a few genes are needed to show whether the concentration estimates obtained from the proteome analysis are plausible. If the protein per cell is increased in these iPSC clones, performing WB analysis using an equal number of cells would be better.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the ‘proteome ruler’ approach we would like to highlight that this method has previously been used extensively in the field, with detailed validation, as already explained above. It is also not ‘semi-quantitative’ and can estimate absolute abundance, as well as concentrations. Our work does not use their concentration formulas, but the estimation of protein copy numbers, which was shown to closely match the observed copy numbers as determined when spike-ins are used14.</p><p>In providing here additional validation using Western Blotting (WB), we prioritised for analysis also by WB the proteins related to pluripotency markers, which are vital to determine the pluripotency state of the hESCs and hiPSCs, as well as histone markers. We have included a section in the discussion concerning additional validation data and agree in general that further validation is always useful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Regarding the experiment shown in Figure 4l, the gender of iPSC used (wibj2) is female and WA01 (H1; WA01) is male. Certainly, there is a difference in the P/E control ratio, but isn't this just a gender difference? The sexes of the cells need to be matched.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept that ideally the sexes of donors should ideally have been matched and have mentioned this within the discussion. Nonetheless, as previously mentioned, our previous detailed proteomic analyses of multiple hiPSC lines13 derived from both biological male and female donors provide relevant evidence that the results shown in this study are not simply a reflection of the sex of the donors for the respective iPSC and ESC lines. When comparing eroded and non-eroded female hiPSCs to male hiPSCs we found no significant differences in any electron transport chain proteins, not TCA proteins between males and females.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(1) Method: Information on the hiPSCs and hESCs used in this study should be described. In particular, the type of differentiated cells, gender, and protocols that were used in the reprogramming are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this. The hiPSC lines were generated by the HipSci consortium, as described in the flagship HipSci paper15. We cite the flagship paper, which specifies in great detail the reprogramming protocols and quality control measures, including analysis of copy number variations15. However, we agree that this information may not be easily accessible for readers. We agree it is relevant to explicitly include this information in our present manuscript, instead of expecting readers to look at the flagship paper. These details have therefore been added to the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Method: In Figure1a, Figure 6i, j, the antibody information of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2, and Gapdh is not written in the method and needs to be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>The data relating to these has now been included within the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Method: In Figure 1b and other figures, the authors should indicate which iPSC corresponds to which TMT label; the data in the Supplemental Table also needs to indicate which data is which clone.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added this to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Method: The method of the FACS experiment used in Figure 2 should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>The methods related to the FACS analysis have now been included within the manuscript.</p><p>(5) Method: The cell name used in the mitochondria experiment shown in Figure 4 is listed as WA01, which is thought to be H1.

The investigation quantified approximately 7,900 proteins, and employing the &quot;Proteome ruler&quot; approach, estimated protein copy numbers per cell. Principal component analyses, based on protein copy number per cell, clearly separated hiPSC and hESC, while different hiPSCs and hESCs grouped together. The study revealed a global increase in the expression of cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, membrane transporters, and secreted proteins in hiPSCs compared to hESCs. Interestingly, standard median-based normalization approaches failed to capture these differences, and the disparities became apparent only when protein copy numbers were adjusted for cell numbers. Increased protein abundance in hiPSC was associated with augmented ribosome biogenesis. Total protein content was &gt;50% higher in hiPSCs compared to hESCs, a observation independently verified by total protein content measurement via the EZQ assay and further supported by the larger cell size of hiPSCs in flow cytometry. However, the cell cycle distribution of hiPSC and hESC was similar, indicating that the difference in protein content was not due to variations in the cell cycle. At the phenotypic level, differences in protein expression also correlated with increased glutamine uptake, enhanced mitochondrial potential, and lipid droplet formation in hiPSCs. ihPSCs also expressed higher levels of extracellular matrix components and growth factors.</p><p>Overall, the presented conclusions are adequately supported by the data. Although the mechanistic basis of proteome differences in ihPSC and hESC is not investigated, the work presents interesting findings that are worthy of publication. Below, I have listed my specific questions and comments for the authors.</p><p>(1) Figure 1a displays immunoblots from 6 iPSC and 4 ESC cell lines, with 8 cell lines (4 hESC, 4 hiPSC) utilized in proteomic analyses (Fig. 1b). The figure legend should specify the 8 cell lines included in the proteomic analyses. The manuscript text describing these results should explicitly mention the number and names of cell lines used in these assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have now marked in figure 1 all the lines that were used for proteomics and have added a section in the methods specifying which cell lines were analysed in each TMT channel.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In most figures, the quantitative differences in protein expression between hiPSC and hESC are evident, and protein expression is highly consistent among different hiPSCs and hESCs. However, the glutamine uptake capacity of different hiPSC cell lines, and to some extent hESC cell lines, appears highly variable (Figure 3e). While proteome changes were measured in 4 hiPSCs and 4 hESCs, the glutamine uptake assays were performed on a larger number of cell lines. The authors should clarify the number of cell lines used in the glutamine uptake assay, clearly indicating the cell lines used in the proteome measurements. Given the large variation in glutamine uptake among different cell lines, it would be useful to plot the correlation between the expression of glutamine transporters and glutamine uptake in individual cell lines. This may help understand whether differences in glutamine uptake are related to variations in the expression of glutamine transporters.</p></disp-quote><p>The “proteomic ruler” has the capacity to estimate the protein copy numbers per cell, as such changes in the absolute number of cells that were analysed do not cause major complications in quantification. Furthermore, TMT-based proteomics is the most precise proteomics methods available, where the same peptides are detected in all samples across the same data points and peaks, as long as the analysis is done within a single batch, as is the case here.</p><p>The glutamine uptake assay is much more sensitive to the variation in the number of cells. The number of cells were estimated by plating the cells with approximately 5e4 cells two days before the assay, which creates variability. Furthermore, hESCs and hiPSCs are more adhesive than the cells used in the original protocol, hence the quench data was noisier for these lines, making the data from the assay more variable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 4j, it would be helpful to indicate whether the observed differences in the respiration parameters are statistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now modified the plot to show which proteins were significantly different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The iPSCs used here are generated from human primary skin fibroblasts. Different cells vary in size; for instance, fibroblast cells are generally larger than blood lymphocytes. This raises the question of whether the parent cell origin impacts differences in hiPSCs and hESC proteomes. For example, do the authors anticipate that hiPSCs derived from small somatic cells would also display higher expression of cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, and membrane transporters compared to ESC? The authors may consider discussing this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. We have now added an extension to the discussion focussed on this subject.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) One wonders if the &quot;Proteome ruler&quot; approach could be applied retrospectively to previously published ihPSC and hESC proteome data, confirming higher expression of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins in ihPSCs, which may have been masked in previous analyses due to median-based normalization.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and think this is a very good suggestion. Unfortunately, in the main proteomic papers comparing hESC and hiPSCs16,17 the authors did not upload their raw files to a public repository (as it was not mandatory at that period in time), and they also used the International Protein Index (IPI), which is a discontinued database. So the raw files can’t be reprocessed and the database doesn’t match the modern SwissProt entries. Therefore, reprocessing the previous data was impractical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The work raises a fundamental question: what is the mechanistic basis for the higher expression of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins in ihPSCs? Conceivably, this could be due to two reasons: (a) Genes encoding cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins are expressed at a higher level in ihPSCs compared to hESC. (b) mRNAs encoding cytoplasmic and mitochondrial proteins are translated at a higher level in ihPSCs compared to hESC. The authors may check published transcriptome data from the same cell lines to shed light on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting point. We believe that the reprogrammed cells contained mature mitochondria, which are not fully regressed upon reprogramming and that this can establish a growth advantage in the normoxic environments in which the cells are grown. Unfortunately, the available transcriptomic data lacked spike-ins, and thus only enables comparison of concentration, not of copy numbers13. Therefore, we could not determine with the available data if there was an increase in the copies of specific mRNAs. However, with a future study where there was a transcriptomic dataset with spike-ins included, this would be very interesting to analyse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It is unclear whether changes in protein levels relate to any phenotypic features of cell lines used. For example, the authors highlight that increased protein expression in hiPSC lines is consistent with the requirement to sustain high growth rates, but there is no data to demonstrate whether hiPSC lines used indeed have higher growth rates.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this point. Our data show that hESCs and hiPSCs show significant differences in protein mass and cell size, with the MS data validated by the EZQ assay and FACS, while having no significant differences in their cell cycle profiles. Thus, increased size and protein content would require higher growth rates to sustain the increased mass, which is what we observe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim that the cell cycle of the lines is unchanged. However, no details of the method for assessing the cell cycle were included so it is difficult to appreciate if this assessment was appropriately carried out and controlled for.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for this omission; the details have been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details and characterisation of iPSC and ESC lines used in this study are overall lacking. The lines used are merely listed in methods, but no references are included for published lines, how lines were obtained, what passage they were used at, their karyotype status etc. For details of basic characterisation, the authors should refer to the ISSC Standards for the use of human stem cells in research. In particular, the authors should consider whether any of the changes they see may be attributed to copy number variants in different lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this and refer to the reply above concerning this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expression data for markers of undifferentiated state in Figure 1a would ideally be shown by immunocytochemistry or flow cytometry as it is impossible to tell whether cultures are heterogeneous for marker expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this. FACS is indeed much more quantitative and a better method to study heterogeneity. However, we did not have protocols to study these markers using FACS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>TEM analysis should ideally be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be nice to have a quantitative measure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All figure legends should explicitly state what graphs are representing (e.g. average/mean; how many replicates (biological or technical), which lines)? Some data is included in Methods (e.g. glutamine uptake), but not for all of the data (e.g. TEM).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. These has been corrected in the revised version of the manuscript, with additional details included.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Validation experiments were performed typically on one or two cell lines, but the lines used were not consistent (e.g. wibj_2 versus H1 for respirometry and wibj_2, oaqd_3 versus SA121 and SA181 for glutamine uptake). Can the authors explain how the lines were chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>The validation experiments were performed at different time points, and the selection of lines reflected the availability of hiPSC and hESC lines within our stem cell facility at a given point in time.</p><p>We chose to use a range of different lines for comparison, rather than always comparing only one set of lines, to try to avoid a possible bias in our conclusions and thus to make the results more general.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should acknowledge the need for further functional validation of the results related to immunosuppressive proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added a sentence in the discussion making this point explicitly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Differences in H1 histones abundance were highlighted. Can the authors speculate as to the meaning of these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding H1 histones, our study of the literature, as well as discussions with with chromatin and histone experts, both within our institute and externally, have not shed light into what the differences could imply, based upon previous literature. We think therefore that this is a striking and interesting result that merits further study, but we have not yet been able to formulate a clear hypothesis on the consequences.</p><p>(1) Howden, A. J.
