2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) have been key drivers of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic waves. To better understand variant epidemiologic characteristics, here we apply a model-inference system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa, a country that has experienced three VOC pandemic waves (i.e. Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1) by February 2022. We estimate key epidemiologic quantities in each of the nine South African provinces during March 2020 to February 2022, while accounting for changing detection rates, infection seasonality, nonpharmaceutical interventions, and vaccination. Model validation shows that estimated underlying infection rates and key parameters (e.g. infection-detection rate and infection-fatality risk) are in line with independent epidemiological data and investigations. In addition, retrospective predictions capture pandemic trajectories beyond the model training period. These detailed, validated model-inference estimates thus enable quantification of both the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, that is, Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1. These findings help elucidate changing COVID-19 dynamics and inform future public health planning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>variant of concern</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>transmissibility</kwd><kwd>reinfection rate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI145883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Wan</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI163023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CK000592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Morris-Singer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaman</surname><given-names>Jeffrey L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Model-inference reconstructed SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in South Africa during March 2020 to February 2022, and quantified the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major variants (Beta, Delta, and Omicron), highlighting their common characteristics and the need for more proactive preparedness.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since its emergence in late December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally, causing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koelle et al., 2022</xref>). In just 2 years, SARS-CoV-2 has caused several pandemic waves in quick succession in many places. Many of these repeated pandemic waves have been driven by new variants of concern (VOCs) or interest (VOIs) that erode prior immunity from either infection or vaccination, increase transmissibility, or a combination of both. However, while laboratory and field studies have provided insights into these epidemiological characteristics, quantifying the extent of immune erosion (or evasion) and changes to transmissibility for each VOC remains challenging.</p><p>Like many places, by February 2022 South Africa had experienced four distinct pandemic waves caused by the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and three VOCs (Beta, Delta, and Omicron BA.1). However, South Africa is also unique in that the country had the earliest surge for two of the five VOCs identified to date – namely, Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tegally et al., 2021</xref>) and Omicron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Viana et al., 2022</xref>). To better understand the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa and variant epidemiological characteristics, here we utilize a model-inference system similar to one developed for study of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, including the Beta variant in South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang and Shaman, 2021c</xref>). We use this system to reconstruct SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in each of the nine provinces of South Africa from the pandemic onset during March 2020 to the end of February 2022 while accounting for multiple factors modulating underlying transmission dynamics. We then rigorously validate the model-inference estimates using independent data and retrospective predictions. The validated estimates quantify the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 variants, that is, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1), in South Africa. Our findings highlight several common characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and the need for more proactive planning and preparedness for future VOCs, including development of a universal vaccine that can effectively block SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as prevent severe disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Model fit and validation</title><p>The model-inference system uses case and death data to reconstruct the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, while accounting for under-detection of infection, infection seasonality, implemented nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), and vaccination (see Materials and methods). Overall, the model-inference system is able to fit weekly case and death data in each of the nine South African provinces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, and additional discussion in Appendix 1). Additional testing (in particular, for the infection-detection rate) and visual inspections indicate that posterior estimates for the model parameters are consistent with those reported in the literature, or changed over time and/or across provinces in directions as would be expected (see Appendix 1).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pandemic dynamics in South Africa, model-fit and validation using serology data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pandemic dynamics in each of the nine provinces (see legend); dots depict reported weekly numbers of cases and deaths; lines show model mean estimates (in the same color).

First, we used serology data. We note that early in the pandemic serology data may reflect underlying infection rates but later, due to waning antibody titers and reinfection, likely underestimate infection. Compared to seroprevalence measures taken at multiple time points in each province, our model estimated cumulative infection rates roughly match corresponding serology measures and trends over time; as expected, model estimates were higher than serology measures taken during later months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, compared to hospital admission data, across the nine provinces, model estimated infection numbers were well correlated with numbers of hospitalizations for all four pandemic waves caused by the ancestral, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1) variants, respectively (<italic>r</italic>&gt;0.75, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A–D</xref>). Third, model-estimated infection numbers were correlated with age-adjusted excess mortality for both the ancestral and Delta wave (<italic>r</italic>=0.86 and 0.61, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A and C</xref>). For the Beta wave, after excluding Western Cape, a province with a very high hospitalization rate but low excess mortality during this wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>), model-estimated infection numbers were also correlated with age-adjusted excess mortality for the remaining provinces (<italic>r</italic>=0.55; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>). For the Omicron (BA.1) wave, like many other places, due to prior infection and/or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nyberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolter et al., 2022</xref>), mortality rates decoupled from infection rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2D</xref>). Overall, comparisons with the three independent datasets indicate our model-inference estimates align with underlying transmission dynamics.</p><p>In addition, as a fourth model validation, we generated retrospective predictions of the Delta and Omicron (BA.1) waves at two key time points, that is 2 weeks and 1 week, separately, before the observed peak of cases (approximately 3–5 weeks before the observed peak of deaths; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To accurately predict a pandemic wave caused by a new variant, the model-inference system needs to accurately estimate the background population characteristics (e.g. population susceptibility) before the emergence of the new variant, as well as changes in population susceptibility and transmissibility due to the new variant. This is particularly challenging for South Africa, as the pandemic waves there tended to progress quickly, with cases surging and peaking within 3–7 weeks before declining. As a result, often only 1–6 weeks of new variant data were available for model-inference before generating the prediction. Despite these challenges, 1–2 weeks before the case peak and 3–5 weeks before the observed death peak, the model was able to accurately predict the remaining trajectories of cases and deaths in most of the nine provinces for both the Delta and Omicron (BA.1) waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for the four most populous provinces and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> for the remainder). These accurate model predictions further validate the model-inference estimates.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Model validation using retrospective prediction.</title><p>Model-inference was trained on cases and deaths data since March 15, 2020 until 2 weeks (1st plot in each panel) or 1 week (2nd plot) before the Delta or Omicron (BA.1) wave (see timing on the x-axis); the model was then integrated forward using the estimates made at the time to predict cases (left panel) and deaths (right panel) for the remaining weeks of each wave. Blue lines and surrounding shades show model fitted cases and deaths for weeks before the prediction (line = median, dark blue area = 50% CrIs, and light blue = 80% CrIs, summarized over n=100 model-inference runs totaling 50,000 model realizations). Red lines show model projected median weekly cases and deaths; surrounding shades show 50% (dark red) and 80% (light red) CIs of the prediction (n = 50,000 model realizations). For comparison, reported cases and deaths for each week are shown by the black dots; however, those to the right of the vertical dash lines (showing the start of each prediction) were not used in the model. For clarity, here we show 80% CIs (instead of 95% CIs, which tend to be wider for longer-term projections) and predictions for the four most populous provinces (Gauteng in A and B; KwaZulu-Natal in C and D; Western Cape in E and F; and Eastern Cape in G and H). Predictions for the other five provinces are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78933-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pandemic dynamics and key model-inference, using Gauteng province as an example</title><p>Next, we use Gauteng, the province with the largest population, as an example to highlight pandemic dynamics in South Africa thus far and develop key model-inference estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for Gauteng and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">11</xref> for each of the other eight provinces). Despite lower cases per capita than many other countries, infection numbers in South Africa were likely much higher due to under-detection. For Gauteng, the estimated infection-detection rate during the first pandemic wave was 4.59% (95% CI: 2.62–9.77%), and increased slightly to 6.18% (95% CI: 3.29–11.11%) and 6.27% (95% CI: 3.44–12.39%) during the Beta and Delta waves, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). These estimates are in line with serology data. In particular, a population-level sero-survey in Gauteng found 68.4% seropositivity among those unvaccinated at the end of the Delta wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madhi et al., 2022</xref>). Combining the reported cases at that time (~6% of the population size) with undercounting of infections in sero-surveys due to sero-reversions and reinfections suggests that the overall detection rate would be less than 10%.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Example model-inference estimates for Gauteng.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Observed relative mobility, vaccination rate, and estimated disease seasonal trend, compared to case and death rates over time.

This high infection rate, while with uncertainty, is in line with serology measures taken in Gauteng at the end of the first wave (ranging from 15% to 27% among 6 sero-surveys during November 2020; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and a study showing 30% sero-positivity among participants enrolled in the Novavax NVX-CoV2373 vaccine phase 2a-b trial in South Africa during August – November 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shinde et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>With the emergence of Beta, another 21.87% (95% CI: 12.16–41.13%) of the population in Gauteng – including reinfections – is estimated to have been infected, even though the Beta wave occurred during summer under less conducive climate conditions for transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The model-inference system estimates a large increase in population susceptibility with the surge of Beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; note population susceptibility is computed as <italic>S</italic> / N×100%, where <italic>S</italic> is the estimated number of susceptible people and <italic>N</italic> is population size). This dramatic increase in population susceptibility (vs. a likely more gradual change due to waning immunity), to the then predominant Beta variant, suggests Beta likely substantially eroded prior immunity and is consistent with laboratory studies showing low neutralizing ability of convalescent sera against Beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wall et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, an increase in transmissibility is also evident for Beta, after accounting for concurrent NPIs and infection seasonality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; note transmissibility is computed as the product of the estimated variant-specific transmission rate and the infectious period; see Materials and methods for detail). Notably, in contrast to the large fluctuation of the time-varying effective reproduction number over time (<italic>R<sub>t</sub></italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the transmissibility estimates are more stable and reflect changes in variant-specific properties. Further, consistent with in-depth epidemiological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Raddad et al., 2021a</xref>), the estimated overall infection-fatality risk for Beta was about twice as high as the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (0.19% [95% CI: 0.10–0.33%] vs. 0.09% [95% CI: 0.05–0.20%], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>). Nonetheless, these estimates are based on documented COVID-19 deaths and are likely underestimates.</p><p>With the introduction of Delta, a third pandemic wave occurred in Gauteng during the 2021 winter. The model-inference system estimates a 49.82% (95% CI: 25.22–90.79%) attack rate by Delta, despite the large number of infections during the previous two waves. This large attack rate was possible due to the high transmissibility of Delta, as reported in multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Public Health England, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Challen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Earnest et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vöhringer et al., 2021</xref>), the more conducive winter transmission conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and the immune erosive properties of Delta relative to both the ancestral and Beta variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Oliveira and Lessells, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Due to these large pandemic waves, prior to the detection of Omicron (BA.1) in Gauteng, estimated cumulative infection numbers surpassed the population size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating the large majority of the population had been infected and some more than once. With the rise of Omicron (BA.1), the model-inference system estimates a very large increase in population susceptibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), as well as an increase in transmissibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); however, unlike previous waves, the Omicron (BA.1) wave progresses much more quickly, peaking 2–3 weeks after initiating marked exponential growth. These estimates suggest that several additional factors may have also contributed to the observed dynamics, including changes to the infection-detection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and Appendix 1), a summer seasonality increasingly suppressing transmission as the wave progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), as well as a slight change in population mobility suggesting potential behavior changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). By the end of February 2022, the model-inference system estimates a 44.49% (95% CI: 19.01–75.30%) attack rate, with only 4.26% (95% CI: 2.46–9.72%) of infections detected as cases, during the Omicron (BA.1) wave in Gauteng. In addition, consistent with the reported 0.3 odds of severe disease compared to Delta infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wolter et al., 2022</xref>), estimated overall infection-fatality risk during the Omicron (BA.1) wave was about 30% of that during the Delta wave in Gauteng (0.03% [95% CI: 0.02–0.06%] vs. 0.11% [95% CI: 0.06–0.21%], based on documented COVID-19 deaths; <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model-inferred epidemiological properties for different variants across SA provinces.</title><p>Heatmaps show (<bold>A</bold>) Estimated mean infection rates by week (x-axis) and province (y-axis), (<bold>B</bold>) Estimated mean <italic>cumulative</italic> infection numbers relative to the population size in each province, and (<bold>C</bold>) Estimated population susceptibility (to the circulating variant) by week and province.

In addition to Gauteng, high cumulative infection rates during the first three pandemic waves are also estimated for Western Cape and Northern Cape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). Overall, all nine provinces likely experienced three large pandemic waves prior to the growth of Omicron (BA.1); estimated average cumulative infections ranged from 60% of the population in Limpopo to 122% in Northern Cape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Corroboration for these cumulative infection estimates is derived from mortality data. Excess mortality before the Omicron (BA.1) wave was as high as 0.47% of the South African population by the end of November 2021 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), 2021</xref>), despite the relatively young population (median age: 27.6 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Anonymous, 2020b</xref>) vs. 38.5 years in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">United States Census Bureau, 2020</xref>]) and thus lower expected infection-fatality risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">O’Driscoll et al., 2021</xref>). Assuming an infection-fatality risk of 0.5% (similar to estimates in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">COVID-19 Forecasting Team, 2022</xref> for South Africa), these excess deaths would convert to a 94% infection rate.</p><p>We then use these model-inference estimates to quantify the immune erosion potential and increase in transmissibility for each VOC. Specifically, the immune erosion (against infection) potential is computed as the ratio of two quantities – the numerator is the increase of population susceptibility due to a given VOC and the denominator is population immunity (i.e. complement of population susceptibility) at wave onset. The relative increase in transmissibility is also computed as a ratio, that is, the average increase due to a given VOC relative to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (see Materials and methods). As population-specific factors contributing to transmissibility (e.g. population density and average contact rate) would be largely cancelled out in the latter ratio, we expect estimates of the VOC transmissibility increase to be generally applicable to different populations. However, prior exposures and vaccinations varied over time and across populations; thus, the level of immune erosion is necessarily estimated relative to the local population immune landscape at the time of the variant surge and should be interpreted accordingly. In addition, this assessment does not distinguish the sources of immunity or partial protection against severe disease; rather, it assesses the overall loss of immune protection against infection for a given VOC.</p><p>In the above context, we estimate that Beta eroded immunity among 63.4% (95% CI: 45.0–77.9%) of individuals with prior ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection and was 34.3% (95% CI: 20.5–48.2%) more transmissible than the ancestral SARS-CoV-2. These estimates for Beta are consistent across the nine provinces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, 1st column and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), as well as with our previous estimates using national data for South Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang and Shaman, 2021c</xref>).

immune landscape among provinces after two pandemic waves. Overall, we estimate that Delta eroded 24.5% (95% CI: 0–53.2%) of prior immunity (gained from infection by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and/or Beta, and/or vaccination) and was 47.5% (95% CI: 28.4–69.4%) more transmissible than the ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this finding, and in particular the estimated immune erosion, studies have reported a 27.5% reinfection rate during the Delta pandemic wave in Delhi, India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhar et al., 2021</xref>) and reduced ability of sera from Beta-infection recoverees to neutralize Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Oliveira and Lessells, 2021</xref>).</p><p>For Omicron (BA.1), estimates also vary by province but still consistently point to its higher transmissibility than all previous variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, 3rd column). Overall, we estimate that Omicron (BA.1) is 94.0% (95% CI: 73.5–121.5%) more transmissible than the ancestral SARS-CoV-2. This estimated transmissibility is higher than Delta and consistent with in vitro and/or ex vivo studies showing Omicron (BA.1) replicates faster within host than Delta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Beltran et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hui et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, we estimate that Omicron (BA.1) eroded 54.1% (95% CI: 35.8–70.1%) of immunity due to all prior infections and vaccination. Importantly, as noted above, the estimate for immune erosion is not directly comparable across variants, as it is relative to the combined population immunity accumulated until the rise of each variant. In the case of Beta, it is immunity accumulated from the first wave via infection by the ancestral SARS-CoV-2. In the case of Omicron (BA.1), it includes immunity from prior infection and re-infection of any of the previously circulating variants as well as vaccination. Thus, the estimate for Omicron (BA.1) may represent a far broader capacity for immune erosion than was evident for Beta. Supporting the suggestion of broad-spectrum immune erosion of Omicron (BA.1), studies have reported low neutralization ability of convalescent sera from infections by all previous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rössler et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cele et al., 2022</xref>), as well as high attack rates among vaccinees in several Omicron (BA.1) outbreaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Helmsdal et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using a comprehensive model-inference system, we have reconstructed the pandemic dynamics in each of the nine provinces of South Africa. Uncertainties exist in our findings, due to incomplete and varying detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections and deaths, changing population behavior and public health interventions, and changing circulating variants. To address these uncertainties, we have validated our estimates using three datasets not used by our model-inference system (i.e. serology, hospitalization, and excess mortality data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>) as well as retrospective prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). In addition, as detailed in the Results, we have showed that estimated underlying infection rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>) and key parameters (e.g. infection-detection rate and infection-fatality risk) are in line with other independent epidemiological data and investigations. The detailed, validated model-inference estimates thus allow quantification of both the immune erosion potential and transmissibility of three major SARS-CoV-2 VOCs, that is, Beta, Delta, and Omicron (BA.1).</p><p>The relevance of our model-inference estimates to previous studies has been presented in the Results section. Here, we make three additional general observations, drawn from global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics including but not limited to findings in South Africa. First, high prior immunity does not preclude new outbreaks, as neither infection nor current vaccination is sterilizing. As shown in South Africa, even with the high infection rate accumulated from preceding waves, new waves can occur with the emergence or introduction of new variants. Around half of South Africans are estimated to have been infected after the Beta wave (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>), yet the Delta variant caused a third large pandemic wave, followed by a fourth wave with comparable infection rates by Omicron BA.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref> for a preliminary assessment of reinfection rates).</p><p>Second, large numbers of hospitalizations and/or deaths can still occur in later waves with large infection surges, even though prior infection may provide partial protection and to some extent temper disease severity. This is evident from the large Delta wave in South Africa, which resulted in 0.2% excess mortality (vs. 0.08% during the first wave and 0.19% during the Beta wave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), 2021</xref>]). More recently, due to the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants that have been shown to evade prior immunity including from BA.1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Khan et al., 2022</xref>), a fifth wave began in South Africa during May 2022, leading to increases in both cases and hospitalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarah et al., 2022</xref>). Together, the continued transmission and potential severe outcomes highlight the importance of continued preparedness and prompt public health actions as societies learn to live with SARS-CoV-2.</p><p>Third, multiple SARS-CoV-2 VOCs/VOIs have emerged in the two years since pandemic inception. It is challenging to predict the frequency and direction of future viral mutation, in particular, the level of immune erosion, changes in transmissibility, and innate severity. Nonetheless, given high exposure and vaccination in many populations, variants capable of eroding a wide spectrum of prior immunity (i.e. from infection by multiple preexisting variants and vaccination) would have a greater chance of causing new major outbreaks. Indeed, except for the Alpha variant, the other four important VOCs (i.e. Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) all produced some level of immune erosion. In addition, later VOCs, like Delta and Omicron, appear to have been more genetically distinct from previous variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van der Straten et al., 2022</xref>). As a result, they are likely more capable of causing re-infection despite diverse prior exposures and in turn new pandemic waves. Given this pattern, to prepare for future antigenic changes from new variants, development of a universal vaccine that can effectively block SARS-CoV-2 infection in addition to preventing severe disease (e.g. shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mao et al., 2022</xref>) is urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morens et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused devastating public health and economic burdens worldwide. Yet SARS-CoV-2 will likely persist in the future.

To find these predominant periods, we first specified the approximate timing of each pandemic wave in each province based on: (1) when available, genomic surveillance data; specifically, the onsets of the Beta wave in Eastern Cape, Western Cape, KwaZulu-Natal, and Northern Cape, were separately based on the initial detection of Beta in these provinces as reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tegally et al., 2021</xref>; the onsets of the Delta wave in each of the nine provinces, separately, were based on genomic sequencing data from the Network for Genomic Surveillance South Africa (NGS-SA)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) of the National Health Laboratory (NHLS) on behalf of the Network for Genomics Surveillance in South Africa (NGS-SA), 2021</xref>); and (2) when genomic data were not available, we used the week with the lowest case number between two waves. The specified calendar periods are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table6">Appendix 1—table 6</xref>. During later waves, multiple variants could initially co-circulate before one became predominant. As a result, the estimated transmissibility tended to increase before reaching a plateau (see, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, in a previous study of the Delta pandemic wave in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang and Shaman, 2022</xref>), we also observed that when many had been infected, transmissibility could decrease a couple months after the peak, likely due to increased reinfections for which onward transmission may be reduced.

We then computed the level of immune erosion as the ratio of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Σ</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> to the model-estimated population immunity prior to the first detection of immune erosion, during each wave. That is, as opposed to having a common reference of prior immunity, here immune erosion for each variant depends on the state of the population immune landscape –that is, combining all prior exposures and vaccinations – immediately preceding the surge of that variant.</p><p>For all provinces, model-inference was initiated the week starting March 15, 2020 and run continuously until the week starting February 27, 2022. To account for model stochasticity, we repeated the model-inference process 100 times for each province, each with 500 model realizations and summarized the results from all 50,000 model estimates.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Model validation using independent data</title><p>To compare model estimates with independent observations not assimilated into the model-inference system, we utilized three relevant datasets:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Serological survey data measuring the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over time. Multiple serology surveys have been conducted in different provinces of South Africa. The South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium summarizes the findings from several of these surveys (see Figure 1A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">The South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium, 2021</xref>). We digitized all data presented in Figure 1A of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">The South African COVID-19 Modelling Consortium, 2021</xref> and compared these to corresponding model-estimated cumulative infection rates (computed mid-month for each corresponding month with a seroprevalence measure). Due to unknown survey methodologies and challenges adjusting for sero-reversion and reinfection, we used these data directly (i.e. without adjustment) for qualitative comparison.</p></list-item><list-item><p>COVID-19-related hospitalization data, from COVID19ZA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Data Science for Social Impact Research Group at University of Pretoria, 2021</xref>). We aggregated the total number of COVID-19 hospital admissions during each wave and compared these aggregates to model-estimated cumulative infection rates during the same wave. Of note, these hospitalization data were available from June 6, 2020 onwards and are thus incomplete for the first wave.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Age-adjusted excess mortality data from the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), 2021</xref>). Deaths due to COVID-19 (used in the model-inference system) are undercounted. Thus, we also compared model-estimated cumulative infection rates to age-adjusted excess mortality data during each wave. Of note, excess mortality data were available from May 3, 2020 onwards and are thus incomplete for the first wave.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model validation using retrospective prediction</title><p>As a fourth model validation, we generated model predictions at 2 or 1 weeks before the week of highest cases for the Delta and Omicron (BA.1) waves, separately, and compared the predicted cases and deaths to reported data unknown to the model. Predicting the peak timing, intensity, and epidemic turnaround requires accurate estimation of model state variables and parameters that determine future epidemic trajectories. This is particularly challenging for South Africa as the pandemic waves tended to progress quickly such that cases surged to a peak in only 3–7 weeks. Thus, we chose to generate retrospective predictions 2 and 1 weeks before the peak of cases in order to leverage 1–6 weeks of new variant data for estimating epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, for each pandemic wave, we ran the model-inference system until 2 weeks (or 1 week) before the observed peak of cases, halted the inference, and used the population susceptibility and transmissibility of the circulating variant estimated at that time to predict cases and deaths for the remaining weeks (i.e. 10–14 weeks into the future). Because the infection detection rate and fatality risk are linked to observations of cases and deaths, changes of these quantities during the prediction period could obscure the underlying infection rate and accuracy of the prediction. Thus, for these two parameters specifically, we used model-inference estimates for corresponding weeks to allow comparison of model-predicted cases and deaths with the data while focusing on testing the accuracy of other key model estimates (e.g. transmissibility of the new variant). As for the model-inference, we repeated each prediction 100 times, each with 500 model realizations and summarized the results from all 50,000 ensemble members.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data Availability</title><p>All data used in this study are publicly available as described in the “Data sources and processing” section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Code availability</title><p>All source code and data necessary for the replication of our results and figures are publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wan-yang/covid_SouthAfrica">https://github.com/wan-yang/covid_SouthAfrica</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:bc7e6b9b11cf64fd8bf7f16efd0992fb4a9df585;origin=https://github.com/wan-yang/covid_SouthAfrica;visit=swh:1:snp:7dcd842cdea58c0aace13d0ab5cd6c133cd3173c;anchor=swh:1:rev:40c0e5ac5ab65005b600a4ca646fec04b0870b81">swh:1:rev:40c0e5ac5ab65005b600a4ca646fec04b0870b81</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang, 2022</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>JS and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of SK Analytics.

A likely explanation is the audit and release of mortality data including deaths that occurred in previous time periods, which were not redistributed according to the actual time of death. Such instances have occurred in multiple countries (see, e.g., some of the documentations by Financial Times in ref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">FT Visual &amp; Data Journalism team, 2020</xref>), under the header “SOURCES”). Here, we could not adjust for this possibility due to a lack of information on these apparent data releases. Instead, to account for potential data errors, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 2001</xref>), used in the model-inference system, includes an estimate of observational error variance for computing the posterior estimates. In this study, the observational error variance was scaled to corresponding observations (thus, weeks with higher mortality would also have larger observational errors). In doing so, the EAKF reduces the weight of observations with larger observational errors (e.g., for weeks with very large death counts), which reduces their impact on the inference of model dynamics. As such, the posterior estimates for mortality tend to (intentionally) miss very high outlying data points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). In addition, posterior estimates for the infection-fatality risk (IFR) are more stable over time, including for weeks with outlying death counts (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig23">Appendix 1—figure 23</xref>, IFR estimates for Mpumalanga).</p><p>In light of these COVID-19 related mortality data patterns, we computed the overall IFR during each pandemic wave using two methods. The first method computes the wave-specific IFR as the ratio of the total reported COVID-19 related deaths to the model-estimated cumulative infection rate during each wave. Because reported COVID-19 related mortality is used as the numerator, this method is more heavily affected by the aforementioned data irregularities. The second method computes the wave-specific IFR as a weighted average of the weekly IFR estimates during each wave, a measure for which both the numerator and denominator are model-inference derived; the weights are the estimated fraction of infections during each week. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3</xref>, for provinces with consistent case and mortality trends (e.g., Gauteng), the two methods generated similar IFR estimates. In contrast, for provinces with mortality trends inconsistent with case trends (e.g., Mpumalanga), the second method generated IFR estimates more comparable to other provinces than the first method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Considerations in parameter prior choice and the EAKF inference algorithm</title><p>The model-inference system included 9 parameters, namely, the variant-specific transmission rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , latency period <italic>Z<sub>t</sub></italic>, infectious period <italic>D<sub>t</sub></italic>, immunity period <italic>L<sub>t</sub></italic>, scaling factor of NPI effectiveness <italic>e<sub>t</sub></italic>, infection-detection rate <italic>r<sub>t</sub></italic>, <italic>IFR<sub>t</sub></italic>, and two parameters for the distribution of time from infectiousness to case detection (i.e., the mean and standard deviation, for a gamma distribution). The initial prior distributions were randomly drawn from uniform distributions with ranges listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>. For parameters with previous estimates from the literature (e.g., transmission rate <italic>β</italic>, incubation period <italic>Z</italic>, infectious period <italic>D</italic>, and immunity period <italic>L</italic>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>, column “Source/rationale”), we set the prior range accordingly. For parameters with high uncertainty and spatial variation (e.g., infection-detection rate), we preliminarily tested initial prior ranges by visualizing model prior and posterior estimates, using different ranges. For instance, for the infection-detection rate, when using a higher prior range (e.g., 5 –20% vs 1 –10%), the model prior tended to overestimate observed cases and underestimate deaths. Based on the initial testing, we then used a wide range able to reproduce the observed cases and deaths relatively well and then derived estimates of unobserved state variables and parameters.</p><p>Importantly, the EAKF used here is an iterative filtering algorithm. After initialization using the initial prior distributions, it iteratively incorporates additional observations at each time step (here, each week) to compute and update the model posterior (including all model state variables and parameters) using the model prior and the latest observations. For the model state variables, the prior is computed per the dynamic model (here, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>); for the model parameters, the prior is the posterior from the last time step. As such, the influence of the initial prior range tends to be less pronounced compared to methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In addition, to capture potential changes over time (e.g., likely increased detection for variants causing more severe disease), we applied space reprobing (SR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang and Shaman, 2014</xref>), a technique that randomly replaces parameter values for a small fraction of the model ensemble, to explore a wider range of parameter possibilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5">Appendix 1—table 5</xref>). Due to both the EAKF algorithm and space reprobing, the posterior parameter estimates can migrate outside the initial parameter ranges (e.g., for the transmission rate during the circulation of new variants).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-3"><title>Testing of the infection-detection rate during the Omicron (BA.1) wave in Gauteng</title><p>A major challenge for this study is inferring the underlying transmission dynamics of the Omicron (BA.1) wave in Gauteng, where Omicron was initially detected and had the earliest case surge. In Gauteng, the number of cases during the first week of reported detection (i.e., the week starting 11/21/21) increased 4.4 times relative to the previous week; during the second week of report (i.e., the week starting 11/28/21) cases increased another 4.9 times. Yet after these two weeks of dramatic increases, cases peaked during the third week and started to decline afterwards. Initial testing suggested substantial changes in infection-detection rates during this time; in particular, detection could increase during the first two weeks due to awareness and concern for the novel Omicron variant and decline during later weeks due to constraints on testing capacity as well as subsequent reports of milder disease caused by Omicron. To more accurately estimate the infection-detection rate and underlying transmission dynamics, we ran and compared model-inference estimates using 4 settings for the infection-detection rate.</p><p>As noted above, with the model-EAKF filtering algorithm, parameter posterior is iteratively updated and becomes the prior at the next time step such that information from all previous time steps is sequentially incorporated. Given the sequential nature of the EAKF, rather than using a new prior distribution for the infection-detection rate, to explore new state space (here, potential changes in detection rate), we applied SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang and Shaman, 2014</xref>), which randomly assigns the prior values of a small fraction of the model ensemble while preserving the majority that encodes prior information. In previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang and Shaman, 2021c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang and Shaman, 2014</xref>), we have showed that the model ensemble posterior would remain similar if there is no substantial change in the system and more efficiently migrate towards new state space if there is a substantial change. Here, to explore potential changes in infection detection rates during the Omicron (BA.1) wave, we tested 4 SR settings for the infection-detection rate: (1) Use of the same baseline range as before (i.e., 1%–8%; uniform distribution, same for other ranges) for all weeks during the Omicron (BA.1) wave; (2) Use of a wider and higher range (i.e., 1%–12%) for all weeks; (3) Use of a range of 1%–15% for the 1<sup>st</sup> week of Omicron reporting (i.e., week starting 11/21/21), 5%–20% for the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of Omicron reporting (i.e., the week starting 11/28/21), and 1%–8% for the rest; and (4) Use of a range of 5%–25% for the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of reporting and 1%–8% for all others.</p><p>Estimated infection-detection rates in Gauteng increased substantially during the first two weeks of the Omicron (BA.1) wave and decreased afterwards under all four SR settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>, 1<sup>st</sup> row). This consistency suggests a general trend in infection-detection rates at the time in accordance with the aforementioned potential changes in testing. Without using a higher SR range (e.g., 1%–8% and 1%–12% in columns 1–2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref> vs 5%–20% and 5%–25% for week 2 in columns 3–4), the estimated increases in infection-detection rate were lower; instead, the model-inference system attributed the dramatic case increases in the first two weeks to higher increases in population susceptibility and transmissibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> row, compare columns 1–2 vs. 3–4). However, the higher estimates for population susceptibility and transmissibility contradicted with the drastic decline in cases shortly afterwards such that the model-inference system readjusted the transmissibility to a lower level during later weeks (see the uptick in estimated transmissibility in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row, first 2 columns). In contrast, when higher infection-detection rates were estimated for the first two weeks using the last two SR settings, the transmissibility estimates were more stable during later weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig12">Appendix 1—figure 12</xref>, 3<sup>rd</sup> row, last 2 columns). In addition, model-inference using the latter two SR settings also generated more accurate retrospective predictions for the Omicron (BA.1) wave in Gauteng (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig13">Appendix 1—figure 13</xref>).</p><p>Given the above results, we used the 4<sup>th</sup> SR setting in the model-inference for Gauteng (i.e., replace a fraction of the infection detection rate using values randomly drawn from U[5%, 25%] for the week starting 11/28/21 and U[1%, 8%] for all other weeks during the Omicron wave). Reported cases in other provinces did not change as dramatically as in Gauteng; therefore, for those provinces, we used the baseline setting, i.e., values drawn from U[1%, 8%], for re-probing the infection-detection rate. Nonetheless, we note that the overall estimates for changes in transmissibility and immune erosion of Omicron (BA.1) were slightly higher under the first two SR settings but still consistent with the results presented in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">Appendix 1—figure 14</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-4"><title>Examination of posterior estimates for all model parameters</title><p>To diagnose posterior estimates for each parameter, we plotted the posterior median, 50% and 95% credible intervals (CrIs) estimated for each week during the entire study period, for each of the nine provinces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref> – 23). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig15">Appendix 1—figure 15</xref>, the estimated transmission rate was relatively stable during the ancestral wave; it then increased along with the surge of the Beta variant around October 2020 and leveled off during the Beta wave. Similarly, following the initial surge of the Delta and Omicron variants, estimated transmission rates increased before leveling off when the new variant became predominant. Similar patterns are estimated for all provinces, indicating the model-inference system is able to capture the changes in transmission rate due to each new variant.</p><p>Estimated latent period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig16">Appendix 1—figure 16</xref>), infectious period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig17">Appendix 1—figure 17</xref>), immunity period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig18">Appendix 1—figure 18</xref>), and the scaling factor of NPI effectiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig19">Appendix 1—figure 19</xref>) all varied somewhat over time, but to a much less extent compared to the transmission rate. Estimated time from infectiousness to case detection decreased slightly over time, albeit with larger variations in later time periods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig20">Appendix 1—figure 20</xref> for the mean and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig21">Appendix 1—figure 21</xref> for the standard deviation). It is possible that the model-inference system could not adequately estimate the nuanced changes in these parameters using aggregated population level data.</p><p>Estimated infection-detection rates varied over time for all provinces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig22">Appendix 1—figure 22</xref>). The infection-detection rate can be affected by (1) testing capacity, e.g., lower during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, and sometimes lower near the peak of a pandemic wave when maximal capacity was reached; (2) awareness of the virus, e.g., higher when a new variant was first reported and lower near the end of a wave; and (3) disease severity, e.g., higher when variants causing more severe disease were circulating. Overall, the estimates were consistent with these expected patterns.</p><p>Lastly, estimated IFRs also varied over time and across provinces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig23">Appendix 1—figure 23</xref>). IFR can be affected by multiple factors, including infection demographics, innate severity of the circulating variant, quality and access to healthcare, and vaccination coverage. For infection demographics, IFR tended to be much lower in younger ages as reported by many (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levin et al., 2020</xref>). In South Africa, similar differences in infection demographics occurred across provinces. For instance, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giandhari et al., 2021</xref>) noted a lower initial mortality in Gauteng, as earlier infections concentrated in younger and wealthier individuals. For the innate severity of the circulating variant, as noted in the main text, in general estimated IFRs were higher during the Beta and Delta waves than during the Omicron wave. In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig23">Appendix 1—figure 23</xref>, estimated IFRs were substantially higher in four provinces (i.e., KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Free State) than other provinces during the Beta wave. Coincidentally, the earliest surges of the Beta variant occurred in three of those provinces (i.e., KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tegally et al., 2021</xref>). Nonetheless, and as noted in the main text and the above subsection, the IFR estimates here should be interpreted with caution, due to the likely underreporting and irregularity of the COVID-19 mortality data used to generate these estimates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-5"><title>A proposed approach to compute the reinfection rates using model-inference estimates</title><p>It is difficult to measure or estimate reinfection rate directly.

that the fraction of the population <italic>ever infected</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, is updated to compute the subsequent fraction of the population protected by prior immunity, because the immune erosion potential here is estimated relative to the combined immunity accumulated until the rise of a new variant. We can repeat the above process for the Delta wave and the Omicron wave. See an example calculation in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>.</p><p>Work to refine the reinfection estimates (e.g., sensitivity of these estimates to assumptions and uncertainty intervals) is needed. Nonetheless, these example estimates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>) are consistent with reported serology measures [4<sup>th</sup> column vs. e.g. ~90% seropositive in March 2022 after the Omicron BA.1 wave reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bingham et al., 2022</xref>] and reinfection rates reported elsewhere [5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> columns vs. e.g., reported much higher reinfection rate during the Omicron wave in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pulliam et al., 2022</xref>]. Importantly, these estimates also show that, in addition to the innate immune erosive potential of a given new variant, the reinfection rate is also determined by the prior cumulative fraction of the population ever infected (4<sup>th</sup> column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>) and the attack rate by each variant (3<sup>rd</sup> column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). That is, the higher the prior cumulative infection rate and/or the higher the attack rate by the new variant, the higher the reinfection rate would be for a new variant that can cause reinfection. For instance, despite the lower immune erosion potential of Delta than Beta, because of the high prior infection rate accumulated up to the Delta wave onset, the estimated reinfection rate by Delta <italic>among all Delta infections</italic> was higher compared to that during the Beta wave (6<sup>th</sup> column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). With the higher attack rate during the Delta wave, the reinfection rate <italic>among the entire population</italic> was much higher for Delta than Beta (5<sup>th</sup> column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>). Thus, these preliminary results suggest that reinfection rates observed for each variant and differences across different variants should be interpreted in the context of the innate immune erosion potential of each variant, the prior cumulative infection rate of the study population, and the attack rate of each variant in the same population.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model-fit to case and death data in each province.</title><p>Dots show reported SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths by week.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mia Moore (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to clarify how their modeling analysis supports stated conclusions.</p><p>2) The paper will benefit from a more detailed explanation and sensitivity analyses that show how model assumptions influence presented results.</p><p>3) The authors should elaborate on the time-dependent results for all hidden parameters estimated as part of the model</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1A is difficult to read but looks like the model underestimates many of the mortality peaks. Authors should discuss this.</p><p>2) Figure 1B: unclear what data is shown. y-label suggests it is a ratio of cum. inf over seroprevalence as %. However, this ratio should be &gt;1 yes? Most of the key quantitative metrics used in the paper include cumulative inf. rate, seroprevalence, susceptibility, transmissibility, etc. should be clearly defined to avoid confusion.</p><p>3) Using increased susceptibility and immune erosion interchangeably (as in rows 123-126) is troubling if attributed to the properties of different variants only. It should at least partially due to waning immunity, independent of what variants are prevalent. Several studies suggest that waning may not be the same for protection acquired from vaccines or from prior infection.

I am having some trouble fully evaluating the model, though, because of the numerous time-dependent variables estimated as part of the fitting process. I would suggest that the authors consider adding in a figure (at least from one example region) showcasing the time-dependent results for all hidden parameters estimated as part of the model (i.e. Zt, Dt, Lt, et, from Equation 1 as well as rt, IFRt and other parameters from the observation model). There is likely to be a high correlation between many of these parameters over time, so such plots would allow for proper diagnosis of the fitting procedure and ensure that all parameters are within the realistic parameter ranges at all times. As a note, it was not clear whether the prior distributions in Table S4 were actual Bayesian prior distributions, or merely the initial range of starting conditions for T0, and it would be helpful to clarify how they integrate with model fitting. Additionally, I suggest that the authors expand their Results section to include additional analyses from these hidden parameters such as how the latent period has changed over time (e.g. there is some evidence that omicron progressed quicker than previous variants) and/or the impact that mobility has had on transmission over time (incorporating the impact of et). Other analyses have found degradation of the relationship between mobility and transmission over time in limited contexts, so it would be useful to compare the current results (e.g. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2111870119)</p><p>The authors use seasonal patterns based on historic climate data from South Africa as a means to modulate COVID-19 transmission, but there doesn't appear to be any reference for the actual climate data for South Africa from the same time period. Are there any data from the modeling time period the authors could use as validation that their assumed seasonal curves match the actual climatic conditions?</p><p>The use of retrospective forecasts is used as a means to validate that the model is accurately capturing transmission, behavioral, and immunological status in the model. While I agree that overall, the 1-2 week forecasts look satisfactory, most forecast hubs are asking for forecasts up to 4 weeks (e.g. covid forecast hub), and accurate forecasts over a longer time horizon would dramatically strengthen the validation of the model estimates. I suggest that the authors attempt 3-4 week forecasts as part of a supplemental analysis to understand the limitations of the model and forecast ability.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78933.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Authors need to clarify how their modeling analysis supports stated conclusions.</p><p>2) The paper will benefit from a more detailed explanation and sensitivity analyses that show how model assumptions influence presented results.</p><p>3) The authors should elaborate on the time-dependent results for all hidden parameters estimated as part of the model</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to address all these suggestions:</p><p>We have clarified how the modeling analysis supports the conclusions in both the Results and the Discussion. We note that the findings and conclusions in this study are model inference estimates, which we draw further support for when comparing our estimates with independent data and reports from the literature in the Results section. In the Discussion section, we broaden the discussion to incorporate both the findings from this study in South Africa and those reported elsewhere on key epidemiological properties of new variants and their potential impacts on future SARS-CoV-2 dynamics. For the latter, we have now added more specifics to relate the findings to our general observations. We have also clarified that the three general observations we made are more general in the context of global SARS-CoV-2 dynamics, including but not limited to this study.</p><p>We have added more detailed explanation when introducing the terms used in the manuscript and when we present the model-inference estimates (e.g. population susceptibility and variant transmissibility). See e.g., Lines 129 – 138 and 186 – 200 in the main text. We have also added further detailing of the model-inference method (e.g. prior selection and diagnosis) in the Appendix 1. In addition, we have added sensitivity analyses, in particular for the infection-detection rate in Gauteng during the Omicron wave, to show how model assumptions influence the results. These supporting results are presented in the Appendix 1.</p><p>We have plotted and shown the weekly estimates for all parameters included in our model-inference system (Appendix 1-figures 15 -23). We have also added a brief note in the main text on these results (see Lines 62-65).

To clarify, we have relabeled the y-axis text. It is the estimated cumulative infection rate from this study, <italic>or</italic> seroprevalence measured by serology surveys from other studies, both relative to population size. Per the reviewer suggestion, we have also defined terms when first introducing them in the Results section (see e.g., Lines 129 – 138 and 186 – 200 in the main text). We have also briefly defined terms in the figure captions. See excerpts below:</p><p>Lines 129 – 138:</p><p>“The model-inference system estimates a large increase in population susceptibility with the surge of Β (Figure 3D; note population susceptibility is computed as <italic>S</italic> / <italic>N</italic> × 100%, where <italic>S</italic> is the estimated number of susceptible people and <italic>N</italic> is population size)… In addition, an increase in transmissibility is also evident for Β, after accounting for concurrent NPIs and infection seasonality (Figure 3C; note transmissibility is computed as the product of the estimated variant-specific transmission rate and the infectious period; see Methods for detail).”</p><p>Lines 186 – 200:</p><p>“We then use these model-inference estimates to quantify the immune erosion potential and increase in transmissibility for each VOC. Specifically, the immune erosion (against infection, same below) potential is computed as the ratio of two quantities – the numerator is the increase of population susceptibility due to a given VOC and the denominator is population immunity (i.e., complement of population susceptibility) at wave onset. The relative increase in transmissibility is also computed as a ratio, i.e., the average increase due to a given VOC relative to ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods). As population-specific factors contributing to transmissibility (e.g., population density and average contact rate) would be largely cancelled out in the latter ratio, we expect estimates of the VOC transmissibility increase to be generally applicable to different populations. However, prior exposures and vaccinations varied over time and across populations; thus, the level of immune erosion is necessarily estimated relative to the local population immune landscape at the time of the variant surge, and should be interpreted accordingly. In addition, this assessment also does not distinguish the sources of immunity or partial protection against severe disease; rather, it assesses the overall loss of immune protection against infection for a given VOC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Using increased susceptibility and immune erosion interchangeably (as in rows 123-126) is troubling if attributed to the properties of different variants only. It should at least partially due to waning immunity, independent of what variants are prevalent. Several studies suggest that waning may not be the same for protection acquired from vaccines or from prior infection. I understand that these effects are not easy to be disentangled but their feasibility needs to be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree that waning immunity could increase population susceptibility, aside from immune erosion due to a new variant. However, as individuals are infected and subsequently lose their prior immunity at different points in time, in aggregation, this would lead to a more gradual change in population susceptibility. In contrast, if a new variant is immune erosive, individuals exposed to such a variant would be susceptible to it regardless of prior infection history; and in aggregation, the population could become susceptible rapidly with the rapid spread of an immune erosive new variant. Note that mass vaccination was not rolled out during the Βeta wave (see, e.g., Figure 3A, green lines for vaccination uptake over time). Therefore, we infer the estimated rapid increase in population susceptibility with the surge of Βeta as an indication of the variant being immune erosive. To be more precise, we have revised the text as follows:</p><p>“The model-inference system estimates a large increase in population susceptibility with the surge of Βeta (Figure 3D; note population susceptibility is computed as <italic>S</italic> / <italic>N</italic> × 100%, where S is the estimated number of susceptible people and N is population size). Such a dramatic increase in population susceptibility (vs. a likely more gradual change due to waning immunity), to the then predominant Βeta variant, suggests Βeta likely substantially eroded prior immunity and is consistent with laboratory studies showing low neutralizing ability of convalescent sera against Βeta (9, 10). In addition, an increase in transmissibility is also evident for Βeta,.…” (Lines 129 – 138)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Large attack rate in rows 137-138 is attributed to the high transmissibility of Delta. What about waning immunity? What is the estimated reinfection rate?</p></disp-quote><p>We attribute the large attack rate during the Delta wave to multiple factors including higher transmissibility of Delta, the more conducive winter transmission conditions, and the immune erosive properties of Delta (i.e., it can cause reinfection). See the related text below.</p><p>“This large attack rate was possible, due to the high transmissibility of Delta, as reported in multiple studies (12-16), the more conducive winter transmission conditions (Figure 3A), and the immune erosive properties of Delta relative to both the ancestral and Βeta variants (17-19).” (Lines 148 – 151).</p><p>For waning immunity, the Delta wave occurred approximately from May – Aug 2021, less than 1 year after the first wave (ending ~Oct 2020) and less than 6 months after the Βeta wave (~Nov 2020 – April 2021). Given the estimated variant-specific immunity period of ~2-3 years (e.g., data from the SIREN study reported in Hall et al. 2021 Lancet 397: 1459; and data from Sweden reported in Nordström et al. 2022 Lancet Infect Dis 22:781) and the recency of the previous waves, waning immunity likely played a much lesser role producing the high attack rate during the Delta wave.</p><p>It is difficult to estimate reinfection rate. However, we are able to estimate the immune erosion potential of Delta, an indication of the variant’s ability to cause reinfection. We report this result and compare it to estimates reported in India:</p><p>“Estimates for Delta vary across the nine provinces (Figure 4D, 2nd column), given the more diverse population immune landscape among provinces after two pandemic waves. Overall, we estimate that Delta eroded 24.5% (95% CI: 0 – 53.2%) of prior immunity (gained from infection by ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and/or Β, and/or vaccination) and was 47.5% (95% CI: 28.4 – 69.4%) more transmissible than the ancestral SARS-CoV-2. Consistent with this finding, and in particular the estimated immune erosion, studies have reported a 27.5% reinfection rate during the Delta pandemic wave in Delhi, India (17) and reduced ability of sera from Βeta-infection recoverees to neutralize Delta (18, 19).” (Lines 210 – 217).</p><p>In addition, the estimated immune erosion potential and cumulative infection rate over time can be used to estimate the reinfection rate for a given population.

Note that the fraction of the population <italic>ever infected</italic>, <italic>c</italic>, are updated to compute the subsequent fraction of people protected by prior immunity, because the immune erosion potential here is estimated relative to the combined immunity accumulated until the rise of a new variant. We can repeat the above process for the Delta wave and the Omicron wave. See Appendix 1-table 1 for an example.</p><p>Work to refine these estimates (e.g., sensitivity of these estimates to assumptions and uncertainty intervals) is needed. Nonetheless, the example estimates shown in Appendix 1-table 1 are consistent with reported serology measures (fourth column vs. e.g., ~90% seropositive in March 2022 after the Omicron BA.1 wave reported in Bingham et al. 2022; DOI: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs<sup>-1</sup>687679/v2) and the reinfection rates reported elsewhere (fifth and sixth columns vs. e.g. reported much higher reinfection rates during the Omicron wave in e.g., Pulliam et al. Science 376:eabn4947). Importantly, these estimates also show that, in addition to the innate immune erosive potential of a given new variant, the reinfection rate is also determined by the prior cumulative fraction of the population ever infected (fourth column in Appendix 1-table 1) and the attack rate by each variant (third column in Appendix 1-table 1). That is, the higher the prior cumulative infection rate and/or the higher the attack rate by the new variant, the higher the reinfection rate would be for a new variant that can cause reinfection. For instance, despite the lower immune erosion potential of Delta than Βeta, because of the high prior infection rate accumulated up to the Delta wave onset, the estimated reinfection rate by Delta <italic>among all Delta infections</italic> was higher compared to that during the Βeta wave (sixth column in Appendix 1-table 1). With the higher attack rate during the Delta wave, the reinfection rate <italic>among the entire population</italic> was much higher for Delta than Βeta (fifth column in Appendix 1-table 1). Thus, these preliminary results suggest that reinfection rates observed for each variant and differences across different variants should be interpreted in the context of the innate immune erosion potential of each variant, the prior cumulative infection rate of the study population, and the attack rate of each variant in the same population.</p><p>We have added the above preliminary analysis on reinfection rate in the Appendix 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Immunity erosion is a key metric reported in the results. What is the mechanism of this erosion? More susceptible, more likely to get a severe infection or something else? Do you assume the same erosion after prior infection and after vaccination? What about waning over time? A more precise definition will help readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Essentially, we estimate erosion of immune protection against infection (i.e. not disease severity) due to a new variant and combine immune protection from both prior infections and vaccinations, as it is difficult to separate the sources of immunity. To help readers interpret the results, we have added the following paragraph in the Results section before presenting the specific estimates, to explain how the immune erosion potential and change in transmissibility are calculated in this study:</p><p>Lines 186 – 203:</p><p>“We then use these model-inference estimates to quantify the immune erosion potential and change in transmissibility for each VOC. Specifically, the immune erosion (against infection) potential is computed as the ratio of two quantities – the numerator is the increase of population susceptibility due to a given VOC and the denominator is population immunity (i.e., complement of susceptibility) at wave onset. The change in transmissibility is also computed as a ratio, i.e., the average change in transmissibility due to a given VOC relative to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 (see Methods). As factors contributing to population-specific transmissibility (e.g., population density and average contact rate) are largely cancelled out in the latter ratio, we expect estimates of the VOC transmissibility change to be generally applicable to different populations.

Will be nice to show how sensitive the results are to them.</p></disp-quote><p>Rows 311 – 315 specify the vaccine effectiveness (VE) values used in the model, based on types of vaccines used in South Africa and reported VE for each vaccine against each variant. These are based on reported data, i.e., not assumptions. Importantly, we also note that vaccination coverage in South Africa was relatively low throughout the study period (March 2020 – Feb 2022), see e.g. Figure 3A, &lt;30% in Gauteng by Feb 2022, for both vaccine doses. Given these lower vaccination rates, we do not expect the VE settings to make a large difference. In addition, we have conducted similar sensitivity analyses on VE settings in a previous study (Yang and Shaman 2022 RSIF 19: 20210900) and found no substantial differences in model estimates of immune erosion and change in transmissibility for the Δ variant in India (note that, similar to South Africa, India had low vaccination coverage during the time period of these sensitivity analyses on VE).</p><p>For other major parameters, the posterior estimates are made each week based on the model prior and the data (weekly cases and deaths). The main assumptions of these parameters are encoded in the initial prior ranges (listed in Appendix 1-table 5). Specifically, for parameters with previous estimates from the literature (e.g., transmission rate β, incubation period Z, infectious period D, and immunity period L), we set the prior range accordingly (see Appendix 1-table 5). For parameters with high uncertainty and spatial variation (e.g. infection-detection rate), we preliminarily tested them by visualizing the model prior and posterior estimates, using different ranges. For instance, for the infection-detection rate, when using a higher prior range (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> showing sample test runs using an initial range of 5 -20% vs. 1 -10%), the model prior tended to overestimate the observed cases and underestimate deaths. Based on this initial testing, we then used a wide range that is able to reproduce the observed cases and deaths relatively well and allow the filter to make inference of the infection-detection rate along with other parameters.</p><p>Importantly, we note that, the EAKF continuously adjusts the parameters based on both the model prior (in this iterative filtering algorithm, the posterior from the previous time step becomes the prior in the current time step) and the most recent data (here weekly cases and deaths). To capture potential changes over time (e.g., likely increased detection for variants causing more severe disease), we applied space reprobing, a technique that randomly replaces parameter values of a small fraction of the model ensemble, to explore a wider range of parameter values. Both the EAKF and the reprobing allow posterior parameter estimates that migrate outside the initial parameter ranges. This is evident from the posterior estimates (e.g. Figure 3E for infection detection rate).</p><p>In the revision, we have added discussion on the above consideration of the model-inference method in the Appendix 1. In addition, we have added sensitivity analyses, in particular for the infection-detection rate in Gauteng during the Omicron wave, to show how model assumptions influence the results.

Other explanation?</p></disp-quote><p>In Gauteng, the number of cases during the first week of detection (i.e., the week starting 11/21/21) increased 4.4 times relative to the previous week; during the second week of detection (i.e., the week starting 11/28/21), it increased another 4.9 times. Yet after these two weeks of dramatic increases, the case numbers peaked during the third week and started to decline thereafter. Initial testing suggested substantial changes in infection detection rates during this time; in particular, detection might have increased during the first two weeks due to awareness and concern of the novel Omicron variant and declined during later weeks due to constraints on testing capacity as well as subsequent reports of milder disease caused by Omicron later on. Anecdotal reports on changes in the detection rate during the Omicron wave include hospitals moving to testing patients admitted not necessarily for Omicron when Omicron was initially reported, which increased incidental detection (see e.g., Abdullah, et al. 2022 <italic>Int J Infect Dis</italic> 116:38-42); the very high test positive rates (~40%) around the peak of the Omicron wave also suggest reduced testing at that time (see e.g., https://www.nicd.ac.za/wpcontent/uploads/2022/01/COVID-19-Testing-Report_Week-52.pdf).</p><p>To more accurately estimate the infection detection rate and underlying transmission dynamics, we ran and compared model-inference using 4 settings for the infection detection rate. Estimated infection detection rates in Gauteng increased substantially during the first two weeks of the Omicron (BA.1) wave and decreased afterwards, under all four settings (see Appendix 1-figure 12, first row). This consistency suggests a general trend in infection detection rate at the time, in accordance with the aforementioned potential changes in testing. Further, diagnosis of the posterior estimates (e.g., estimated transmissibility; see Appendix 1-figure 12) and retrospective predictions (see Appendix 1-figure 13) indicates that there was likely a substantial increase of the infection detection rate during the first ~2 weeks of the Omicron wave. Importantly, we note that despite these increases, detection rates at the time were low (~10% during those weeks). In addition, overall estimates for changes in transmissibility and immune erosion of Omicron (BA.1) were slightly higher under the first two settings with lower infection detection rates, but still consistent with the results presented in the main text (see Appendix 1-figure 14).</p><p>We have now added the above additional sensitivity analyses and results to the revised Appendix 1.

In my view, they should be similar across regions if health systems are comparably effective. Is it assumed different rates for previously infected and/or vaccinated?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. These estimates were computed as the ratio of the total reported COVID-19 death to the estimated total infection rate during each wave for each province. For some provinces, COVID-19 mortality data appeared to be highly irregular, with very high weekly death counts for some weeks (e.g. see Appendix 1-figure 1 for Mpumalanga and Northern Cape). A likely explanation is audit and release of mortality data including deaths that occurred in previous time periods, which has happened in other countries (e.g., see some of the documentation of this phenomenon by the Financial Times at https://ig.ft.com/coronavirus-chart/?areas=eur&amp;areas=usa&amp;areas=prt&amp;areas=twn&amp;areas=nzl&amp;areas=e92000001&amp;areasRegio nal=usny&amp;areasRegional=usnm&amp;areasRegional=uspr&amp;areasRegional=ushi&amp;areasRegional=usfl&amp; areasRegional=usco&amp;cumulative=0&amp;logScale=0&amp;per100K=1&amp;startDate=2021-06-01&amp;values=deaths; under the header “SOURCES”). However, these “new” deaths sometimes were not properly redistributed according to the actual time of death but were instead lumped and counted as deaths on the date of data release. Here, we could not adjust for this possibility due to a lack of information. Instead, to account for such potential data errors, the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) algorithm used in the model-inference system includes an observational error when computing the posterior estimates. For instance, in this study, the observational errors were scaled to the corresponding observations (thus, weeks with higher mortality would also have larger observational errors). In doing so, the EAKF downweighs observations with larger observational errors (e.g., for weeks with the very large death counts) to reduce their impact on the inference of model dynamics. As such, the posterior estimates for mortality tend to (intentionally) miss the very high outlying data points (see Figure 1 and Appendix 1-figure 1). In addition, posterior estimates for the infection-fatality risk (IFR) are also more stable over time, including for weeks with outlying mortality data (see, e.g., Appendix 1figure 23, IFR estimates for Mpumalanga).</p><p>We have now added the above discussion in the Supplemental Material (see “A brief note on reported COVID-19 mortality and model-inference strategy in this study”). In addition, we have also added another supplemental table to show the model estimated IFR, computed as the weekly IFR estimates weighted using estimated weekly mortality rate (i.e., not computed directly using the reported mortality data). See the new Appendix 1-table 3.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that quality and access to health systems is a key factor contributing to the IFR. However, there are also other contributing factors, including infection demographics, intensity of the pandemic and strains on the health systems, innate severity of the circulating variant, and vaccination coverage. For infection demographics, IFR tended to be much lower in younger ages as reported by many (e.g., Levin et al. 2020 <italic>Eur J Epidemiol</italic> 35:1123-1138). In South Africa, similar differences in infection demographics occurred across provinces. For instance, in Giandhari et al. 2021 (<italic>Int J Infect Dis</italic> 103:234-241), authors wrote about the lower initial mortality in Gauteng, as earlier infections concentrated in younger and wealthier individuals. Specifically, Giandhari et al. wrote “GP, home of the largest metropolitan area of Johannesburg, had an unusual epidemic, as the majority of initial cases were in middleage and wealthy individuals who travelled overseas for holidays. This translated in a very small number of deaths over time and infections were concentrated in the wealthy suburb of Sandton in Johannesburg.” There were also substantial variations in pandemic intensity across the South African provinces during each wave, and in turn, varying strains on local health systems and IFRs. This is evident from the raw case fatality ratio (CFR) by province for each pandemic wave (see table below), where the CFR (based on reported data alone, without any modeling) varied largely by province (Aither response table 1).</p><p>To provide more context to the IFR estimates, we have added the following paragraph in the Appendix 1 (pages 4-5):</p><p>“Lastly, estimated IFRs also varied over time and across provinces (Appendix 1-figure 23). IFR can be affected by multiple factors, including infection demographics, innate severity of the circulating variant, quality and access to healthcare, and vaccination coverage. For infection demographics, IFR tended to be much lower in younger ages as reported by many (e.g., Levin et al. 2020 <italic>(5)</italic>). In South Africa, similar differences in infection demographics occurred across provinces. For instance, Giandhari et al. (6) noted a lower initial mortality in Gauteng, as earlier infections concentrated in younger and wealthier individuals. For the innate severity of circulating variant, as noted in the main text, in general estimated IFRs were higher during the Β and Δ waves, than the Omicron wave. In addition, as shown in Appendix 1-figure 23, IFRs were substantially higher in four provinces (i.e., KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape, and Free State) than other provinces during the Β wave. Coincidentally, earliest surges of the Β variant occurred in three of those provinces (i.e., KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape, Eastern Cape)(6). Nonetheless, and as noted in the main text and the above subsection, the IFR estimates here should be interpreted with caution, due to the likely underreporting and irregularity of the COVID-19 mortality data used to generate these estimates.”</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Raw case fatality ratio (%) by province and pandemic wave.</title><p>Raw case fatality ratio is computed as the total number of deaths ÷ total number of cases × 100%.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Province</th><th>Ancestral wave</th><th>Β wave</th><th>Δ wave</th><th>Omicron wave</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Gauteng</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.06</td><td align="left" valign="top">3</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.69</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.61</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">KwaZulu-Natal</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.15</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.39</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.99</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Western Cape</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.76</td><td align="left" valign="top">4.21</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.67</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.49</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Eastern Cape</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.92</td><td align="left" valign="top">8.11</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.65</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Limpopo</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">4.01</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.9</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.65</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Mpumalanga</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.03</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.62</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.77</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.85</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">North West</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.36</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.6</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.97</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.41</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Free State</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.65</td><td align="left" valign="top">6.26</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.97</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Northern Cape</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.21</td><td align="left" valign="top">3.22</td><td align="left" valign="top">2.58</td><td align="left" valign="top">5.9</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general very good work, but I think you need to make the logic that leads from your analysis to your conclusions a little clearer, ie what is it about what you found that makes you view large future waves as possible.

As noted above, the three general observations we made are related to the SARS-CoV-2 dynamics observed in South Africa, as well as in other places. Per this suggestion, we have now revised the text to provide more direct evidence drawn from specific findings here to support those observations. See Lines 252 – 271 and the summary below:</p><p>1) New waves of infection are still possible. As shown in this study, new variants can erode prior immunity, increase population susceptibility, and in turn cause new waves. This was the case for Βeta, Delta, and Omicron. In addition, a new wave due to the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants began in April 2022 after the initial Omicron wave.</p><p>2) Large new waves of deaths can still occur. We have revised the text to “… large numbers of hospitalizations and/or deaths can still occur in later waves with large infection surges.” As noted in the manuscript, for mortality, the large Delta wave in South Africa resulted in 0.2% excess mortality, despite the large first wave and Βeta wave; for reference, excess mortality was 0.08% during the first wave and 0.19% during the Βeta wave (20). More recently, the fifth wave caused by the BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants has also led to increases in hospitalization admissions.</p><p>3) New variants likely require an ability to evade existing immunity if they are to spread. As noted in the manuscript, this is based on the observation that four out of the 5 major VOCs identified thus far (Βeta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron) including three in South Africa were able to erode pre-existing immunity. In addition, the most recent BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants have also been shown to erode pre-existing immunity (including immunity gained from the initial BA.1 Omicron infection, see e.g. Cao et al. 2022 Nature and Khan et al. 2022 medRxiv 2022.2004.2029.22274477). We have added a brief note on the recent BA.4/BA.5 Omicron subvariants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm also concerned about the potential lack of identifiability in the fitting scheme with all of these different parameters. In particular, I'm concerned that the drastic changes in infection detection rate may be masking changes elsewhere, in particular during the Omicron wave.

Note that, we cannot fix the infection detection rate at a constant level, as there is empirical evidence suggesting substantial changes in detection rates through time. For instance, there were reports of changes to the detection rate during the Omicron wave when hospitals moved to testing patients admitted for reasons other than COVID-19 after Omicron was initially reported, which increased incidental detection (see e.g., Abdullah, et al. 2022 <italic>Int J Infect Dis</italic> 116:38-42); and the very high test positive rates (~40%) around the peak of the Omicron wave suggest reduced testing at that time (see e.g., https://www.nicd.ac.za/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/COVID-19-TestingReport_Week-52.pdf).</p><p>For all four modeling settings in the sensitivity analysis, the estimated infection detection rate in Gauteng increased substantially during the first two weeks of the Omicron (BA.1) wave and decreased afterwards (see Appendix 1-figure 12, first row).

Further diagnosis of the posterior estimates (e.g., estimated transmissibility; see Appendix 1-figure 12) and retrospective predictions (see Appendix 1-figure 13) indicate that there was likely a substantial increase in infection detection rate during the first ~2 weeks of the Omicron wave. Importantly, we note that overall estimates for the changes in transmissibility and immune erosion of Omicron (BA.1) were slightly higher under the two model settings with lower infection detection rates, but still consistent with the results presented in the main text (see Appendix 1-figure 14).</p><p>We have added the above additional sensitivity analyses and results to the revised Appendix 1.

I am having some trouble fully evaluating the model, though, because of the numerous time-dependent variables estimated as part of the fitting process. I would suggest that the authors consider adding in a figure (at least from one example region) showcasing the time-dependent results for all hidden parameters estimated as part of the model (i.e. Zt, Dt, Lt, et, from Equation 1 as well as rt, IFRt and other parameters from the observation model). There is likely to be a high correlation between many of these parameters over time, so such plots would allow for proper diagnosis of the fitting procedure and ensure that all parameters are within the realistic parameter ranges at all times. As a note, it was not clear whether the prior distributions in Table S4 were actual Bayesian prior distributions, or merely the initial range of starting conditions for T0, and it would be helpful to clarify how they integrate with model fitting. Additionally, I suggest that the authors expand their Results section to include additional analyses from these hidden parameters such as how the latent period has changed over time (e.g. there is some evidence that omicron progressed quicker than previous variants) and/or the impact that mobility has had on transmission over time (incorporating the impact of et). Other analyses have found degradation of the relationship between mobility and transmission over time in limited contexts, so it would be useful to compare the current results (e.g. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2111870119)</p></disp-quote><p>Per suggestion, we have plotted weekly estimates for all parameters (see Appendix 1-figures 15 – 23). We have also added further explanation of the model-EAKF inference process (model prior etc.; see section 2 of the Appendix 1), and diagnosis/discussion of the posterior estimates for all parameters in the Appendix 1 (see section 4). In general, visual inspections indicate that posterior estimates for the model parameters are consistent with those reported in the literature or change over time and/or across provinces in directions as would be expected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use seasonal patterns based on historic climate data from South Africa as a means to modulate COVID-19 transmission, but there doesn't appear to be any reference for the actual climate data for South Africa from the same time period.

This is particularly challenging for South Africa as the pandemic waves tended to progress quickly such that cases surged to a peak in only 3 to 7 weeks. Thus, we chose to generate retrospective predictions 2 and 1 weeks before the peak of cases in order to leverage 1 to 6 weeks of new variant data for estimating epidemiological characteristics. Specifically, for each pandemic wave, we ran the model-inference system until 2 weeks (or 1 week) before the observed peak of cases, halted the inference, and used the population susceptibility and transmissibility of the circulating variant estimated at that time to predict cases and deaths for the remaining weeks (i.e. 10-14 weeks into the future).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
