G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here, we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using <italic>E coli</italic> as a model, we show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m<sup>1</sup>G37-containing tRNAs. Stalling occurs during decoding of affected codons at the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanism than that of +1 frameshifting, which occurs after the affected codons leave the A site. Enzyme- and cell-based assays show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces tRNA aminoacylation and in some cases peptide-bond formation. We observe changes of gene expression in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency similar to those in the stringent response that is typically induced by deficiency of amino acids. This work demonstrates a previously unrecognized function of m<sup>1</sup>G37 that emphasizes its role throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis, providing new insight into its essentiality for bacterial growth and survival.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ribosome profling</kwd><kwd>ribosome pausing</kwd><kwd>TrmD</kwd><kwd>m<sup>1</sup>G37-tRNA</kwd><kwd>stringent response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM134931</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hou</surname><given-names>Ya-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM110113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buskirk</surname><given-names>Allen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and genome-wide analysis demonstrates that m<sup>1</sup>G37 is important for tRNA aminoacylation and for the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylation of G37 in tRNA, generating m<sup>1</sup>G37 on the 3'-side of the anticodon, is a post-transcriptional modification that is essential for life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 2001</xref>). It has been specifically associated across evolution with all isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, which are species that share the same prolyl specificity of aminoacylation but differ in the primary sequence and in the anticodon triplet and yet collectively decode the Pro CCN codons (N = A, C, G, and U). Similarly, m<sup>1</sup>G37 is conserved in the CCG isoacceptor of tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG)), with the anticodon CCG for pairing with the CGG codon, and it is conserved in isoacceptors tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>(GAG), tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>(UAG), and tRNA<sup>Leu</sup>(CAG) for pairing with CUU and CUC codons (CU[C/U]) and CU[A/G] codons, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Additionally, m<sup>1</sup>G37 may also be present in other tRNAs in higher eukaryotes. The m<sup>1</sup>G37 methylation of tRNA is required for cell growth and viability; elimination of the enzyme responsible for the methylation causes cell death in yeast and in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Björk et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Björk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masuda et al., 2019</xref>). The established function of m<sup>1</sup>G37 is to maintain the translational reading-frame during protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Björk et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hagervall et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qian et al., 1998</xref>). Loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 elevates frequencies of ribosomal +1 frameshifting in kinetic assays with reconstituted <italic>E. coli</italic> ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>), and in cell-based assays in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>). Unlike ribosomal miscoding, +1 frameshifting is almost always deleterious, altering the translational reading-frame, inducing premature termination of protein synthesis, and ultimately cell death.</p><p>Recent work has shed light on how loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 induces ribosomal +1 frameshifting. While non-methylated tRNAs were thought to pair incorrectly in the ribosomal A site (the aminoacyl-tRNA [aa-tRNA] binding site) during decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roth, 1981</xref>), they were found to occupy the correct reading-frame in X-ray crystal structures and in kinetic assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maehigashi et al., 2014</xref>). Maintenance of the correct reading-frame in the A site is consistent with the strict ribosomal A site structure that selects for accurate anticodon-codon pairing during decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ogle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogle and Ramakrishnan, 2005</xref>). Even genetically isolated high-efficiency +1--frameshifting tRNAs, which usually contain an extra nucleotide inserted to the anticodon loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkins and Björk, 2009</xref>), were found to occupy the correct reading-frame in the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dunham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fagan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maehigashi et al., 2014</xref>). These genetically isolated +1-frameshifting tRNAs, however, were found to occupy the triplet +1-frame in the ribosomal P site (the peptidyl-tRNA binding site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hong et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>All existing evidence points to tRNA +1 frameshifting occurring after decoding at the A site. A frameshift-prone tRNA, containing the natural anticodon loop but lacking m<sup>1</sup>G37, is shown in kinetic assays to undergo +1 frameshifting during translocation from the A site to the P site, or during occupancy in the P site next to an empty A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>). A genetically isolated high-efficiency +1-frameshifting tRNA, containing an expanded anticodon loop, is also shown in kinetic assays to undergo +1 frameshifting during translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>). The notion of +1 frameshifting during translocation is supported by a recent cryo-EM structural analysis of a canonical tRNA translating a frameshift-prone mRNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demo et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, the notion of +1 frameshifting within the P site is supported by X-ray crystal structures of a P site-bound frameshift-prone tRNA with a natural anticodon loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffer et al., 2020</xref>). In these latter structures, while m<sup>1</sup>G37 stabilizes the tRNA on an mRNA codon that is prone to frameshifting, loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 destabilizes the tRNA-ribosome interaction and induces +1 frameshifting within large conformational changes of the ribosome.</p><p>Here, we seek to determine whether m<sup>1</sup>G37 plays additional roles beyond maintaining the ribosome translational reading-frame. An earlier study suggested that loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 delayed the tRNA anticodon-codon pairing interaction during decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 1997</xref>), raising the possibility of a role at the ribosomal A site. To test this possibility more broadly, we employ the approach of ribosome profiling to determine ribosome positions during translation of the entire transcriptome of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>) and to monitor how ribosome density changes upon loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37. Using <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model, we show that deficiency of m<sup>1</sup>G37 induces global ribosome stalling, most notably at Pro codons CCN, the Arg codon CGG, and the Leu codon CUA, all of which are translated by tRNAs that are normally methylated with m<sup>1</sup>G37. Stalling is most prominent when the affected codons are being decoded at the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanism than that of +1 frameshifting. Enzyme- and cell-based assays show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces aminoacylation of the affected tRNAs, including all isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and the isoacceptor tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG), and that additionally it reduces rates of peptide-bond formation for some of these tRNAs. Most significantly, stalling induces programmatic changes in gene expression that are consistent with changes occurring during the bacterial stringent response under environmental stress of nutrient starvation. These findings support a model in which m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces levels of aa-tRNAs at the ribosomal A site and prevents peptide-bond formation in some cases, leading to ribosome stalling. Binding of uncharged tRNAs to the A site would then induce programmatic changes of gene expression similar to those occurring during the bacterial stringent response through activation of the ppGpp synthase RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>). The importance of m<sup>1</sup>G37 for the ribosomal activity at the A site, together with its already demonstrated importance in maintaining the translational reading-frame from the A site to the P site and within the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>), establishes the involvement of the methylation throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis. This sustained involvement of m<sup>1</sup>G37 during protein synthesis underscores its indispensable role in bacterial viability and survival.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> strains with conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency</title><p>Because m<sup>1</sup>G37 is essential for cell viability, a simple knock-out of the gene responsible for its biosynthesis cannot be made. Previous studies of cellular functions of m<sup>1</sup>G37 relied on temperature-sensitive variants of the gene responsible for m<sup>1</sup>G37 biosynthesis whose protein product became inactivated at elevated temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Björk and Nilsson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Masuda et al., 2013</xref>). Because elevated temperatures induce changes in gene expression, we took a different approach to conditionally deplete m<sup>1</sup>G37 to study its role in protein synthesis. Interestingly, while m<sup>1</sup>G37 is conserved in evolution, the genes responsible for its biosynthesis are distinct – being <italic>trmD</italic> in bacteria and <italic>trm5</italic> in archaea and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christian et al., 2004</xref>). The protein products of <italic>trmD</italic> and <italic>trm5</italic> are fundamentally different from each other in structure and mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Christian and Hou, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christian et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christian et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lahoud et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). We recently constructed conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient strains of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, in which the <italic>trmD</italic> locus is deleted from the chromosome and cell viability of the <italic>trmD-knock-out</italic> (<italic>trmD-KO</italic>) strain is maintained by a plasmid-borne human <italic>trm5</italic> that is under arabinose (Ara)-controlled expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masuda et al., 2019</xref>). Upon induction with Ara, expression of human <italic>trm5</italic> is sufficient to supply m<sup>1</sup>G37-tRNAs to support bacterial viability (<italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5</italic>+)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christian et al., 2004</xref>), whereas upon replacement of Ara with glucose (Glc), expression of human <italic>trm5</italic> is arrested and the human enzyme is degraded inside bacterial cells (<italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christian et al., 2013</xref>). As a control, a <italic>trmD-wild-type</italic> (<italic>trmD-WT</italic>) strain was created, where <italic>trmD</italic> remains on the chromosome and expression of the plasmid-borne <italic>trm5</italic> in the presence of Ara (<italic>trmD-WT</italic> (<italic>trm5</italic>+)), or its repression in the presence of Glc (<italic>trmD-WT</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>)), did not affect cell viability.</p><p>To avoid the possibility of artifacts by studying only one conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient strain, we developed a second conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient strain to compare data and to strengthen conclusions. In this second conditional strain, we chose <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model and extended <italic>trmD</italic> at the chromosomal locus with a degron sequence, adding YALAA to the C-terminus of the TrmD protein (the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> strain) to allow rapid degradation by the protease ClpXP. We controlled TrmD degradation by inducing the expression of <italic>clpXP</italic> from a plasmid using Ara, or by repressing the expression using Glc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 2012</xref>). Because over-expression of the plasmid-borne <italic>clpXP</italic> could also target proteins without the degron tag, we generated a control strain (<italic>trmD-cont</italic>) for comparison. In this <italic>trmD-cont</italic> strain, we added the coding sequence for the degron tag after the stop codon of <italic>trmD</italic> to maintain the same gene length as in <italic>trmD-deg</italic>, but without expression of the tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Overnight cultures of <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-cont</italic> strains were grown in LB + Glc and were spotted onto an LB + Ara plate to turn on expression of <italic>clpXP</italic>. Analysis of a serial dilution of each strain confirmed that <italic>trmD-deg</italic> cells rapidly lost viability, whereas <italic>trmD-cont</italic> cells retained viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In liquid culture, in which each strain was freshly diluted into LB + Ara at OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1 and grown to 0.3–0.4, followed by a second round of dilution and re-growth, we observed that the re-growth of the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> strain was retarded in the third round, whereas that of the <italic>trmD-cont</italic> strain was robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although the growth defect of the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> strain only manifested in the third cycle of dilution, the level of TrmD protein drastically decreased in 30 min after the first dilution into fresh LB + Ara (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas that in the <italic>trmD-cont</italic> strain remained stable up to 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We speculate that it takes time for cultures to express <italic>clpXP</italic> to a threshold level, after which TrmD is rapidly degraded. A similar pattern of drastic reduction of the target protein following <italic>clpXP</italic> induction was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carr et al., 2012</xref>). We also speculate that the <italic>clpXP</italic> expression plasmid, which has the strongest expression strength among a library of plasmids varying in Shine-Dalgarno sequences (Materials and methods), could also contribute to the drastic degradation of TrmD.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency of the <italic>E. coli trmD-deg</italic> strain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth of <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-cont</italic> G78 cells on an LB plate.

(<bold>D</bold>) Primer-extension inhibition analysis. An overnight culture of <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-cont</italic> cells in LB + Glc was diluted to LB + Ara at T = 0 and the fresh culture was taken through three cycles of dilution and re-growth. Total RNA was extracted over the time course, probed with a 5'-[<sup>32</sup>P]-labeled DNA primer targeting <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Leu/CAG</sup>, and analyzed by a 12% PAGE/7 M urea gel and phosphorimaging. Primer extension would terminate in the control at 1 nt downstream of m<sup>1</sup>G37, generating a 15 nt fragment, whereas primer extension would continue to the 5'-end in TrmD deficiency, generating a 53 nt fragment. The fraction of m<sup>1</sup>G37 in each sample is calculated based on all primer-extension products as shown in the source file, not including the primer.

The presence of m<sup>1</sup>G37 would inhibit primer extension, producing a 15 nt product, whereas the absence of m<sup>1</sup>G37 would permit primer extension to the 5'-end, producing a 53 nt product. The level of m<sup>1</sup>G37 was calculated as the fraction of the 15 nt product in the sum of all of the primer-extension products of each reaction. The primer was not included in the calculation due to its molar excess in these reactions.

Given that m<sup>1</sup>G37 is associated with a specific set of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNAs, we looked in the ribosome profiling data for local differences in the A site occupancy for each codon in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency. If loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 impaired tRNA decoding, we expected that the ribosome would linger on affected codons to accumulate higher levels of density. To quantify these codon-specific effects, we defined a pause score for each codon as the ribosome density at the first nt of the codon normalized by the average ribosome density on the gene where that codon occurs. We computed the pause score for all of the 61 sense codons by averaging the pause score at thousands of instances of each codon across the entire transcriptome. Strikingly, we observed significant increases in the pause score for a set of codons when each was positioned at the ribosomal A site during decoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Most notably, ribosome density at Pro codons was dramatically increased in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, showing an increase in the pause score from 1.4 in <italic>trmD-cont</italic> cells to 3.5 in <italic>trmD-deg</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left).

The increase in the pause score for all Pro codons indicates that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency affected decoding by some or all of the isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, leading to strong ribosome pausing during elongation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TrmD depletion leads to ribosome pausing at CCN (Pro) and CGG (Arg) codons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pause scores for codons positioned in the ribosomal A site.

There were stronger pauses at Ser and Gly codons in the control samples of <italic>trmD-cont</italic> than in the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> samples, and stronger pauses at Ser codons in the control samples of <italic>trmD-WT</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) than in the <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) samples. These pauses were likely due to artifacts of harvesting bacterial cultures. We previously observed pauses at Ser and Gly codons in cells harvested by filtration and showed that filtration reduced aminoacylation of the tRNA cognate to these codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>). These Ser and Gly pauses, however, are less obvious in strains where protein synthesis is defective (e.g., due to loss of the elongation factor EFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Woolstenhulme et al., 2015</xref>), which may explain their lower pause scores in the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) samples than in the control samples. We have also observed variable pausing at Thr codons under different harvesting conditions in unpublished work, although those pauses have not been as well characterized. Given that all of the samples described here were harvested by filtration, we attributed the pauses at Ser, Gly, and Thr codons (labeled in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) to artifacts of cell growth and harvesting and did not consider them further.</p><p>At the codon level, we observed higher pause scores for all four Pro codons (CCN, in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient cells relative to control cells, as shown in <italic>trmD-deg</italic> vs. <italic>trmD-cont</italic> strains (left) and in <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) vs. <italic>trmD-WT</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) strains (right). In both replicates of the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> strain, Pro codons CCG and CCA had significantly higher pause scores than CCC and CCU. In contrast, all four CCN codons showed similar pause scores in the <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) strain. While the reason for these differences between the two strains is not clear, the implication is that ribosomes paused at all four Pro codons in both strains. Also, we observed elevated pause scores on the CGG codon (in green) in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, increasing from 1.0 in control cells to 3.0 in <italic>trmD-deg</italic> cells and in <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) cells. Notably, CGG was the only Arg codon where pausing was observed upon loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37, whereas the other Arg codons CG[A/C/U], AGA, and AGG were not affected. Additionally, we observed a small increase of the pause score at the Leu codon CUA in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency at 1.4 relative to the pause score of 1.0 in control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Together, these data showed significant pauses at all Pro codons CCN, the Arg CGG codon, and to a lesser extent the Leu CUA codon. All of the paused codons are translated by tRNAs that are substrates of m<sup>1</sup>G37 methylation, although pauses at Leu codons CU[C/G/U], which are translated by tRNAs that should also be methylated with m<sup>1</sup>G37, were not observed.</p><p>The increase in the average pause scores in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency indicates accumulation of ribosome density when the affected codon is positioned in the A site. To explore the possibility of other effects on translation, we looked more broadly at the average ribosome density aligned to a specific codon of interest. For <italic>trmD-deg</italic> vs. <italic>trmD-cont</italic> samples, we observed strong increases of ribosome density in the A, P, and E sites at Pro codons, and at the Arg CGG codons in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, with the highest peak in the ribosomal P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, top). Although these findings could be interpreted to mean that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency in tRNAs for these codons led to pausing when each tRNA was in the P or E site, we recognized that the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-cont</italic> samples were obtained using the traditional lysis buffer with chloramphenicol to arrest translation in the lysate. We have since discovered that ribosomes continue to translate a few codons in the lysate under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that the several peaks observed in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency likely arose from a strong pause at the A site that was blurred by ongoing translation in the lysate during sample preparation. In contrast, the <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) and <italic>trmD-WT</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) samples were prepared with a buffer containing 150 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, which immediately arrests ribosomes without the need for antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>). In these samples, we observed that pauses at Pro codons and at Arg CGG codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, bottom) were the strongest when each codon was positioned at the A site, without an increased density in the P and E sites. We conclude that pauses are primarily in the A site, due to defects in decoding associated with m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed increased ribosome density ~25 nt upstream of affected codons in <italic>trmD-deg</italic> relative to <italic>trmD-cont</italic> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, top). This distance is roughly equivalent to the footprint length of a single ribosome, indicating that the increased density was due to collision of an upstream ribosome with a paused ribosome that was struggling to decode an affected codon. The collision of two ribosomes suggests that the pausing of the downstream ribosome at the affected codon is significantly prolonged. These findings are consistent with our prior observation of pausing and formation of disomes upon treatment of cells with mupirocin, an antibiotic that blocks aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Ile</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mohammad et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Reduced aminoacylation and A-site peptide-bond formation of m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient tRNAs</title><p>The observed ribosome pausing at specific codons in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency raised two possibilities for the tRNAs translating these codons. First, m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency may reduce aminoacylation of these tRNAs by the respective aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), preventing them from forming a ternary complex (TC) with EF-Tu-GTP and entering the ribosomal A site. Second, m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency may prevent these tRNAs from peptide-bond formation at the A site, leading to ribosome stalling. We addressed these two possibilities, which are not mutually exclusive, with all three isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and the tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG) isoacceptor. To isolate the effect of m<sup>1</sup>G37, we prepared tRNAs as T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcripts lacking m<sup>1</sup>G37 or any other post-transcriptional modification (the G37-state) and compared their activity to transcripts that were subsequently modified with m<sup>1</sup>G37 by TrmD <italic>in vitro</italic> (the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state). We confirmed that the level of methylation in the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state was high, reaching nearly 100% for the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG) and nearly 70% for the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, we also purified some of these tRNAs from cells (the native-state) containing the full complement of natural post-transcriptional modifications.</p><p>Aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> with Pro was performed with purified <italic>E. coli</italic> ProRS under steady-state multi-turnover conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>).

For all three isoacceptors of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, the catalytic efficiency <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> was decreased from the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state to the G37-state by 3- to 10-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and Figure 3—source data 1). The reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> was driven by an increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> for all three tRNAs, indicating that m<sup>1</sup>G37 may be important for binding of each tRNA to ProRS (Figure 3—source data 1A). This apparent binding defect makes sense structurally because m<sup>1</sup>G37 is immediately downstream of the two conserved anticodon nucleotides G35-G36, which are the major determinants of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> binding to ProRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cusack et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yaremchuk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yaremchuk et al., 2001</xref>).

The critical role that m<sup>1</sup>G37 plays in the UGG isoacceptor was further highlighted by the finding that aminoacylation reaction with the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state tRNA has the same <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values as the native-state tRNA (Figure 3—source data 1A), indicating that all other post-transcriptional modifications played little or no role in aminoacylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Kinetic parameters showing the loss of tRNA aminoacylation and peptide-bond formation at the A site in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fold-change in the loss of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of tRNA aminoacylation from the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state to the G37-state.

Each TC carried a fully aminoacylated tRNA in the G37-state or in the m<sup>1</sup>G37-state, in excess of the 70S IC, to allow evaluation of the activity of peptide-bond formation.

For example, induction of the Leu operon (<italic>leuA</italic>, <italic>leuB</italic>, <italic>leuC</italic>, and <italic>leuD</italic>) was particularly strong (~16-fold). This Leu operon is regulated by transcriptional attenuation depending on the efficiency of translation of the upstream <italic>leuL</italic> leader sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wessler and Calvo, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wohlgemuth et al., 2013</xref>).

We observed ribosomal pausing in <italic>leuL</italic> at the four consecutive Leu CUA codons in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with our observation of ribosome pausing at CUA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), suggesting that the pausing would prevent transcriptional termination and allow transcription elongation into the downstream Leu biosynthetic genes, resulting in elevated RNA levels.

Although this genetic switch has evolved to sense changes in levels of aa-tRNAs associated with the amino acids produced by the downstream genes, we instead observed strong ribosome pauses at two consecutive Pro codons CCA-CCG in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These strong pauses within the <italic>ilvL</italic> leader sequence could trigger anti-termination, explaining the higher RNA-seq levels of the downstream gene <italic>ilvG</italic>. Indeed, while we observed in the control strain a 45-fold decrease in the RNA-seq density from the region around <italic>ilvL</italic> to the first half of the downstream <italic>ilvG</italic> gene, we observed in the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> strain only a 9-fold decrease in the RNA-seq density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, the <italic>ilvG</italic> gene in strains derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> K12 MG1655, such as the one used here, has a mutation that induces a frameshift midway through the gene, suggesting that it may be a pseudogene, although the <italic>ilvG</italic> gene appears intact in other <italic>E. coli</italic> strains.</p><p>We confirmed that the changes of expression of these two operons were due to pauses at specific codons induced by m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency in cognate tRNAs.

In contrast, a smaller activation during m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (only 2.7-fold) was observed with a second nLuc reporter where the four consecutive Leu CUA codons were changed to Leu UUA codons, which do not require m<sup>1</sup>G37 for translation.</p><p>To examine the effect of the <italic>ilvL</italic> leader sequence on expression of <italic>ilvG</italic>, we altered the two Pro codons CCA-CCG in <italic>ilvL</italic> to two Ala codons GCA-GCG by genome editing using CRISPR and followed the expression of the downstream <italic>ilvG</italic> gene with qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Furthermore, given our observation that over-expression of <italic>proS</italic> restored aminoacylation and cell viability in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), we asked if it might also minimize pausing and induction of this genetic switch.

The up-regulation of these pathways suggests that they are activated by a genome-wide response due to ribosome stalling at Pro CCN, Arg CGG, and Leu CUA codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The increase in expression of the Cys biosynthesis pathway is correlated with the enrichment in gene ontology (GO) terms for genes involved in sulfate assimilation and hydrogen sulfide biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and is consistent with the notion that cysteine is synthesized from serine in bacteria by incorporation of sulfide to <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kredich and Tomkins, 1966</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Changes of gene expression in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency consistent with the stringent response</title><p>The high levels of expression of amino acid biosynthesis genes in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency was reminiscent of the bacterial stringent response, which is triggered in nutrient starvation by uncharged tRNAs binding to the ribosomal A site, activating synthesis of ppGpp catalyzed by the RelA protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gourse et al., 2018</xref>).

Genes in the glyoxylate cycle are also up-regulated. Notably, because the glyoxylate cycle bypasses the decarboxylation reactions and instead replenishes TCA cycle intermediates, it is reasonable that these changes may be to build up metabolic intermediates for amino acid biosynthesis. The two-carbon units entering the TCA cycle likely arise primarily from fatty acid oxidation, whose enzymes are highly up-regulated in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, as opposed to the glycolysis pathway, whose genes are strongly repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

This genome-wide view is important, because TrmD is ranked as a high-priority antibacterial target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">White and Kell, 2004</xref>), due to its fundamental distinction from Trm5, and its conservation throughout the bacterial domain, essentiality for bacterial life, and possession of a small molecule-binding site for drug targeting. The small molecule-binding site in TrmD is unique, consisting of a protein topological knot-fold that holds the methyl donor <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl methionine in an unusual shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elkins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2015</xref>), which is different from that in Trm5 and in most other methyl transferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goto-Ito et al., 2009</xref>), indicating the possibility to explore novel chemical space and diversity of drugs targeting TrmD. Additionally, we have shown that TrmD deficiency can disrupt the double-membrane cell-envelope structure of Gram-negative bacteria, thus facilitating permeability of multiple drugs into cells, preventing efflux of these drugs, and accelerating bactericidal action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Masuda et al., 2019</xref>). This multitude of advantages of targeting TrmD emphasizes that a better understanding of the genome-wide function of its m<sup>1</sup>G37 product will help develop a successful antibacterial strategy.</p><p>Using ribosome profiling, we show that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency causes ribosome stalling at codons specific for tRNAs that are methylated by TrmD, including strong pauses at all Pro CCN codons and the Arg CGG codon and weak pauses at the Leu CUA codon. Stalling is primarily observed when the affected codons are in the ribosomal A site, indicating a distinct mechanistic feature than that of +1 frameshifting, which occurs in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency after decoding at the A site and during tRNA translocation to the P site and occupancy within the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gamper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gamper et al., 2015a</xref>). The importance of m<sup>1</sup>G37 at the ribosomal A site thus expands the spectrum of its biology, which can be summarized in a model that explains its indispensability throughout the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In this model, m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling in the A site, triggering changes in gene expression and possibly affecting mRNA stability and co-translational protein folding. Ribosome stalling can be prolonged if a subset of the affected tRNAs is unable to perform peptide-bond formation in the A site, leading to ribosome collisions that increase the frequency of frameshifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Even if some of the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient tRNAs manage to enter the A site and participate in peptide-bond formation, they would induce +1 frameshifting during translocation to the P site and destabilize interaction with the ribosomal P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoffer et al., 2020</xref>), leading to premature fall-off from the ribosome and termination of protein synthesis. In contrast to starvation that can be alleviated by re-supply of nutrients, this series of defects associated with m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency cannot be readily resolved, thus underscoring the essentiality of m<sup>1</sup>G37 in protein synthesis that is coupled to cell growth and survival.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Deficiency of m<sup>1</sup>G37 impairs the elongation cycle of protein synthesis in bacteria.</title><p>A cloverleaf structure of tRNA, showing the position of m<sup>1</sup>G37 in red. Loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 reduces aminoacylation, lowering levels of aa-tRNAs at the ribosome A site, stalling the ribosome, and activating programmatic changes in gene expression similar to those induced by the bacterial stringent response upon RelA sensing of uncharged tRNA and synthesis of ppGpp. Ribosome stalling at the A site is prolonged if the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient aa-tRNA is delayed in peptide-bond formation, leading to ribosome collision. Even if the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient tRNA manages to enter the A site and participates in peptide-bond formation, it would promote +1 frameshifting during translocation from the A site to the P site and during occupancy within the P site, while also destabilizing the P site structure and possibly falling off from the P site to prematurely terminate protein synthesis. Accumulation of these defects ultimately collapses the entire elongation cycle and leads to cell death.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70619-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>An important finding of this work is that ribosome stalling in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency is primarily driven by loss of aminoacylation of affected tRNAs, which is shown in enzyme-based kinetic assays for all isoacceptors examined, and in cell-based acid-urea assays for tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG) and tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG), two major TrmD-dependent species in bacteria. While the loss of aminoacylation in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency is not due to the loss of ProRS or ArgRS in cells, it can be restored by over-expression of either enzyme, which improves cell viability. These results clearly demonstrate that the loss of aminoacylation in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, and consequently the accumulation of uncharged tRNAs, is the underlying basis of ribosome stalling that induces significant changes in gene expression. Direct changes include up-regulation of the <italic>leuABCD</italic> and <italic>ilvGMEDA</italic> operons. Indirect changes include hundreds of genes that are activated and similar to those in the bacterial stringent response – the central bacterial response to nutrient starvation upon RelA sensing of uncharged tRNAs binding to the A site of translating ribosomes. These changes certainly make sense given that we see higher levels of deacylated tRNAs accumulating in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency and that the binding of deacylated tRNA to the A site is known to induce (p)ppGpp synthesis by RelA on the ribosome. We did not test the role of RelA in the indirect changes in gene expression in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency, because the <italic>trmD-deg</italic> and <italic>trmD-KO</italic> (<italic>trm5–</italic>) cells are already substantially compromised in cell viability and the deletion of <italic>relA</italic> is expected to further reduce viability. Another confounding factor is that <italic>E. coli</italic> contains two genes responsible for ppGpp synthesis: <italic>relA</italic> and <italic>spoT</italic>, which have overlapping functions. Upon <italic>relA</italic> deletion, the protein product of <italic>spoT</italic> can still synthesize ppGpp in response to some of the metabolic changes that are observed here. Nonetheless, the changes in gene expression in <italic>trmD</italic> deficiency largely parallel with those observed during the stringent response, consistent with the notion that the loss of aminoacylation in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency activates the stringent response.</p><p>The significance of this work is that it demonstrates a stress response in bacteria similar to the stress response in eukaryotes that is activated by changes of the post-transcriptional modification state of tRNA. In yeast, loss of the 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm<sup>5</sup>) and/or the 2-thio (s<sup>2</sup>) groups from the normal mcm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34-state tRNA activates the <italic>GCN4</italic>-mediated pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zinshteyn and Gilbert, 2013</xref>). This <italic>GCN4</italic> pathway in yeast is translationally regulated in response to a variety of insults, most notably to amino acid starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). In yeast, loss of the threonyl-carbamoyl group from the normal t<sup>6</sup>A37-state tRNA also activates the <italic>GCN4</italic> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thiaville et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, deficiency of the t<sup>6</sup>A37-state in a specific tRNA activates the target of rapamycin response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rojas-Benitez et al., 2015</xref>), which reprograms gene expression in response to amino acid deficiency. In <italic>Neurospora</italic>, loss of the inosine (I) group from the normal I34-state tRNA activates the CPC-1 (cross-pathway-control-1) response, which is the ortholog of the yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lyu et al., 2020</xref>). Mechanistically, loss of the s<sup>2</sup> group from the mcm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34-state has been shown to reduce binding and accommodation of tRNA to the ribosomal A site and translocation to the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ranjan and Rodnina, 2017</xref>). While we had previously shown that loss of the s<sup>2</sup> group from the related cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34 (5-carboxy-amino-methyl-2-thio-uridine 34)-state in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> also reduced tRNA aminoacylation and the subsequent binding and accommodation to the A site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rodriguez-Hernandez et al., 2013</xref>), we did not investigate the cellular response due to the deficiency in bacteria. Thus, this work on m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency provides a previously unrecognized parallel between <italic>E. coli</italic> and eukaryotes in a stress response that activates amino acid biosynthesis upon loss of a post-transcriptional modification of tRNA. The parallel suggests the evolution of a conserved cellular priority that activates amino acid biosynthesis in response to nutrient deficiency or to tRNA modification deficiency, both of which compromise active protein synthesis and threaten cell viability.</p><p>The molecular insight obtained from this study is important for antibacterial therapeutics. The observation that over-expression of <italic>proS</italic> most effectively rescues cell viability in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) indicates that aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> is a major determinant of cell viability. Notably, loss of aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> is uniformly manifested at the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (tRNA) step in m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency (Figure 3—source data 1A), suggesting that the immediate proximity of the methylation to the aminoacylation-determinant anticodon G36 nucleotide is important for the bacterial ProRS. In contrast, human ProRS has diverged in tRNA recognition by shifting the emphasis toward the G35 nucleotide, which is more distant from m<sup>1</sup>G37 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2001</xref>). This shift suggests the possibility that the human enzyme may better accommodate m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient tRNAs for aminoacylation, and that the eukaryotic response to m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency is executed in a step other than aminoacylation for decoding at the A site. These possibilities remain to be tested in future experiments.</p><p>In summary, we show here that m<sup>1</sup>G37 is required for the ribosomal activity at the A site and that, when combined with previous studies, we emphasize the importance of m<sup>1</sup>G37 for the entire elongation cycle of protein synthesis. This new insight suggests the possibility that drug targeting of TrmD can be used in combination with classic antibiotics that target the elongation cycle of protein synthesis. For example, targeting TrmD can be explored in combination of antibiotics that target the A site (e.g., tetracycline [Tet], negamycin), those that target the translocation reaction (e.g., viomycin, spectinomycin), and those that target the P site (e.g., streptogramin A, bactobolin A, and retapamulin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vázquez-Laslop and Mankin, 2018</xref>). This combinatorial approach may produce a synergistic and accelerated bactericidal effect that can combat the rapid emergence of multi-drug resistance of pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

This leads to ribosome pausing when the respective codons need to be decoded, which evokes transcriptional derepression of the Leu and Ilv operons and produces other changes in the transcriptome that strongly resemble the stringent response.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of N 1-Methylation of G37 in tRNA Induces Ribosome Stalling and Reprograms Gene Expression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Document the level of m1G37 modification by TrmD of the T7 tRNA transcripts employed in biochemical experiments.</p><p>2) Properly characterize the kinetic data as measuring the rates of dipeptide formation, encompassing all of its partial reactions, rather than rates of peptidyl transfer per se.</p><p>3) Provide more convincing results and additional controls for experiments in Figures 3C and E.</p><p>4) Modify the claim that this is the first report showing that a tRNA modification affects its aminoacylation.</p><p>5) In the absence of analyzing a relA mutant, try to provide direct evidence for activation of the stringent response by measuring ppGpp levels in the trmD mutant.</p><p>6) Consider revising/shortening the discussion of changes in metabolism beyond the stringent response for which there is little supportive evidence or mechanistic understanding.

Therefore, they have to be more accurate in presenting their conclusions. Thus, the statement that &quot;loss of m1G37 only affected peptidyl transfer for one isoacceptor at one codon&quot; or that the loss of methylation of tRNA(Arg) &quot;reduced… peptide bond formation&quot; seem to be misleading making reader believe that there is a direct effect of the tRNA anticodon loop methylation on the rate of the chemical reaction of peptide bond formation.</p><p>2) ll.249-261.

I found the discussion of changes in metabolism (in comparison with those observed at stringent response) to be too excessive and less interesting than the rest of the work. There is a lot of handwaving here and the conclusions do not really contribute to the main story but rather dilute it. I recommend to either completely eliminate this section or to at least dramatically reduce its length – down to a few sentences and the key conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70619.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Document the level of m1G37 modification by TrmD of the T7 tRNA transcripts employed in biochemical experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have documented the level of m<sup>1</sup>G37 methylation by TrmD of the T7 tRNA transcripts used in biochemical experiments. We showed that the methylation was near 100% for the transcript of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG) and near 70% for the transcript of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). These results indicate that the kinetic parameters derived from these methylated tRNAs are meaningful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Properly characterize the kinetic data as measuring the rates of dipeptide formation, encompassing all of its partial reactions, rather than rates of peptidyl transfer per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our measurements of dipeptide formation encompass all of its partial reaction and that the rate constant <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub> represents a composite term, not just peptidyl transfer per se. We have provided more details to our measurements of <italic>k</italic><sub>obs</sub>, which is the slope of the linear synthesis of product vs. time under a substrate-limiting condition (pp13-14). Raw data for the linear dipeptide formation over time are shown for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG) against the CCA codon (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B, 1C) and for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Arg</sup>(CCG) against the CGG codon (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide more convincing results and additional controls for experiments in Figures 3C and E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this request. We have re-organized our data on aminoacylation and moved the previous Figures 3C and 3E to the revised Figures 4A and 4C, respectively.</p><p>In the revised Figure 4A, we provided new results that clearly resolve the charged Pro-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> from the uncharged tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> by acid-urea gels (Figure 4A, left panel). We achieved this clear resolution by an extra phenol/chloroform extraction of total RNA from cells, followed by incubation of the RNA sample with proteinase K at 0.1 mg/mL for 5 min on ice to remove residual proteins. The RNA was then run on an acid-urea gel and probed for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG). The results showed that the level of aminoacylation is decreased from 84% in the m<sup>1</sup>G37-abundant condition to 68% in the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient condition, but that it is restored to 82% in the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient condition upon over-expression of <italic>proS</italic>. These results support the notion that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency reduces aminoacylation of tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>(UGG) in vivo, and that the reduction can be overcome by over-expression of <italic>proS</italic>,</p><p>In the revised Figure 4A, we also included the acid-urea gel analysis of <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(QUA, Q = queuosine) as an m<sup>1</sup>G37-independent control, which contains ms<sup>2</sup>i<sup>6</sup>A37 (2-methyl-thio-<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-isopentenyl adenosine) and is not methylated by TrmD. The results showed that the level of aminoacylation of this tRNA is virtually identical between the m<sup>1</sup>G37-abundant condition (78%) and the m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient condition (81%) (Figure 4A, right panel), supporting the notion that loss of m<sup>1</sup>G37 does not affect the aminoacylation of an m<sup>1</sup>G37-independent tRNA in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Modify the claim that this is the first report showing that a tRNA modification affects its aminoacylation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have removed the claim from the Discussion section (pp 24-25). We apologize for our previous over-statement. We realized that we had published a paper showing that loss of the s<sup>2</sup> group from the cmnm<sup>5</sup>s<sup>2</sup>U34 (5-carboxy-amino-methyl-2-thio-uridine 34)-state in <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> also led to reduced aminoacylation and reduced binding and accommodation to the A site (Rodriguez-Hernandez <italic>et al.,</italic> 2013). We have cited our tRNA<sup>Gln</sup> paper in Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the absence of analyzing a relA mutant, try to provide direct evidence for activation of the stringent response by measuring ppGpp levels in the trmD mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that measuring ppGpp levels in the <italic>trmD</italic> mutant would strengthen the conclusion that m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency activates the stringent response. However, this measurement is difficult to perform for several reasons.</p><p>1) The measurement is most commonly performed with culturing bacterial cells in the presence of 32P-H3PO4 in the growth media (100 mCi/mL) to determine the cellular synthesis of 32P-GTP, 32P-ppGpp, and 32P-(p)ppGpp by TLC. However, we do not have the radiation permit to work with 32P isotope in our culturing equipment, which is located in a common equipment corridor that is shared by all labs on our floor.</p><p>2) The high dosage of 32P throughout the experiments is dangerous and causing contamination all over the labs. Our students and staff members do not wish to work with this high dosage of 32P, which also raises a serious concern of our Radiation office in the University.</p><p>3) Although there are a few reports of an HPLC-MS (mass spectrometry) method, this method is not reliable, based on our extensive discussion with Richard Gourse (U. Wisconsin), an expert of the stringent response who uses the 32P assay in a dedicated apparatus located in his own lab. Specifically, the HPLC-MS method uses HPLC to separate all cellular nucleotides, followed by MS analysis of ppGpp. However, the published reports did not provide details on the MS analysis and requires purchasing new and expensive columns. Further, we have not found an MS facility in the US that has analyzed ppGpp successfully. The only MS facility that has done it is in U. Wisconsin, which is currently not working according to a discussion with Jun Wang (U. Wisconsin), another expert of the stringent response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Consider revising/shortening the discussion of changes in metabolism beyond the stringent response for which there is little supportive evidence or mechanistic understanding. For example, the uncertain connection between m1G37 methylation and glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle detracts from the main message of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. We have substantially shortened the discussion on metabolism, particularly on glycolysis and the glyoxylate cycle (pp21-22). We have also removed a previous figure that illustrated metabolic changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Data presentation:</p><p>1) Figure 1D, could the authors explain why trmD levels drop abruptly?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We speculate that the rapid decrease of TrmD level upon turning on the <italic>clpXP</italic> machinery in the <italic>trmD-degron</italic> strain is because of the time requirement for expression of the degradation machinery to a threshold level, which once achieved would rapidly degrade TrmD protein. A similar pattern of rapid degradation of the target protein in a separate degron strain has been reported (Carr et al., 2012). Additionally, we speculate that the <italic>clpXP</italic> expression plasmid, which has the strongest expression strength as selected from a library of plasmids varying in Shine-Dalgarno sequences (Materials and methods), could also contribute to the drastic degradation of TrmD. These possibilities are discussed in Results “<italic>E. coli</italic> strains with conditional m<sup>1</sup>G37 deficiency” (p7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1E, I was curious as to why the primer-extension efficiency appears to increase as a function of cell-harvest time. I am assuming similar amounts of tRNA template was added to these reactions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an important question. However, we did not load similar amounts of tRNA template to each primer-extension reaction. Instead, we used same amounts of cell culture for extraction of tRNA in different growth conditions. Due to the increased cell density from 0-3 h, an increased tRNA amount was produced, leading to an increased primer-extension stop at the 15 nt-band relative to the primer position in the <italic>trmD-cont</italic> cells. The primer is always added in excess and only the primer extension products are used in the quantification. This information is provided in the legend to the revised Figure 1D (p47).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 3C, the data on the effect of proS overexpression is not convincing. The signal is smeary and too weak to be quantified accurately. Also, proper controls to show that other tRNAs, which are not substrates for trmD are not affected by its depletion, are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with the reviewer that the data on the effect of <italic>proS</italic> over-expression is not convincing in the previous submission. We have provided new data in the revised Figure 4A, showing clear separation of the charged Pro-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> from the uncharged tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> and clear demonstration of the recovery of Pro-tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> levels upon over-expression of <italic>proS</italic> (Figure 4A, left panel).</p><p>We have provided data for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(QUA), an m<sup>1</sup>G37-independent tRNA, showing that its aminoacylation level is unchanged between the m<sup>1</sup>G37-abundant and m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient conditions (<italic>Figure 4A, right panel</italic>). The new data for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(QUA) are described (pp15-16).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, aminoacylation reactions with non-trmD substrates are needed for figure 3E to show that equivalent amounts of lysates were added to the different reactions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this control. We have provided data for <italic>E. coli</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup>(QUA), showing that it is aminoacylated similarly by lysates prepared from m<sup>1</sup>G37-abundant and m<sup>1</sup>G37-deficient conditions (Figure 4C, right panel).
