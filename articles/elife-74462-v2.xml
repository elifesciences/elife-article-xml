Even patients that survive, CNS infections can have lasting neurological dysfunction resulting from immune and pathogen induced pathology. Developing approaches to noninvasively track pathology and immunity in the infected CNS is crucial for patient management and development of new therapeutics. Here, we develop novel MRI-based approaches to monitor virus-specific CD8+ T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in the living brain. We studied a relevant murine model in which a neurotropic virus (vesicular stomatitis virus) was introduced intranasally and then entered the brain via olfactory sensory neurons – a route exploited by many pathogens in humans. Using T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI, we identified small cerebral microbleeds as an early form of pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. Mechanistically, these microbleeds occurred in the absence of peripheral immune cells and were associated with infection of vascular endothelial cells. We monitored the adaptive response to this infection by developing methods to iron label and track individual virus specific CD8+ T cells by MRI. Transferred antiviral T cells were detected in the brain within a day of infection and were able to reduce cerebral microbleeds. These data demonstrate the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events in the virally infected CNS as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells in mitigating this pathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MRI cell tracking</kwd><kwd>antiviral CD8 T cells</kwd><kwd>microbleeds</kwd><kwd>brain viral infection</kwd><kwd>cerebrovascular pathology</kwd><kwd>single cell imaging</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>the Intramural Program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIANS003047-15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koretsky</surname><given-names>Alan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>the Intramural Program of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIANS003112-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGavern</surname><given-names>Dorian B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A MRI study of virally infected CNS demonstrates the utility of MRI in detecting the earliest pathological events and studying pathogen-specific T cells at the level of single cell as well as the therapeutic potential of antiviral T cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The CNS is protected by several physical barriers, however, a variety of neurotropic viruses from different families are able to infect the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swanson and McGavern, 2015</xref>). Viruses use multiple strategies to access the CNS. Some can infect the brain through the blood brain barrier (BBB) directly, whereas others enter the peripheral nervous system and use axonal transport along motor and olfactory neurons. Infection of hematopoietic cells is also used to enter the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGavern and Kang, 2011</xref>).</p><p>One common pathology associated with viral infection is bleeding. Two major causes of virus-induced CNS bleeding are direct killing of infected cells and immune-mediated damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ludlow et al., 2016</xref>). Neural and glial inflammatory reactions play an important role in the defense against a viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatbar et al., 2018</xref>), as do innate and adaptive immune cells recruited from the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Manglani and McGavern, 2018</xref>). Antiviral T cells recruited into the brain in response to infection can be both helpful and harmful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klein and Hunter, 2017</xref>). For example, studies have shown that antiviral memory T cells adoptively transferred into mice persistently infected from birth with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) can clear virus from the brain without causing immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herz et al., 2015</xref>). However, pathogen-specific CD8 T cells can also trigger fatal vascular breakdown, which has been observed during cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belnoue et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riggle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swanson et al., 2016</xref>), viral meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2009</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schwabenland et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, immunotherapies designed to treat CNS pathogens face more challenges than those focused on peripheral infections due to the sensitivity of the CNS compartment as well as the unique features and functions of cerebrovasculature.</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been very useful for the detection of pathological changes in the CNS during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poyiadji et al., 2020</xref>). Microbleeds can be detected sensitively as punctate hypointensity spots on T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted MRI (gradient-recalled echo or susceptibility-weighted imaging) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>). In post-mortem brain tissue from COVID patients, microbleeds were detected by T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted MRI, which guided the histology studies of cerebrovascular pathology and associated inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). Recently, there has been growing interest in using MRI to track cell movements, even at the single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pothayee et al., 2017</xref>). Noninvasive MRI based tracking of antiviral T cells in relation to microbleeds should provide additional insights into the mechanisms that result in CNS vascular bleeding during different types of infections.</p><p>In this study, we used intranasal infection of mice with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sabin and Olitsky, 1937</xref>) to explore cerebrovascular pathology and antiviral T cells by MRI. The olfactory bulb (OB) serves as the CNS entry point for many neurotropic viruses inhaled into the nose. For example, VSV can infect olfactory sensory neurons that project fibers from the nasal airway to the OB, enabling viral transit within axon fibers and CNS entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatbar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moseman et al., 2020</xref>). The main goal of this study was to noninvasively define the temporal and spatial relationship between cerebrovascular breakdown and CD8 T cell infiltration in the virus-infected brain. More specifically, our aims were to: (i) characterize microbleeds as an neuroimaging marker starting at early stages of CNS viral infection by T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted MRI; (ii) determine whether VSV-induced cerebrovascular damage was caused by the virus or infiltrating immune cells; (iii) evaluate whether adoptively transferred virus-specific CD8 T cells could prevent cerebrovascular damage; (iv) develop an MRI technique to label and track antiviral CD8 T cells; (v) define the relationship between microbleeds and CD8 T cells. Our results demonstrate that VSV promotes extensive bleeding in the OB and other brain regions. Bleeding occurred even in the absence of peripheral immune infiltration, suggesting that the virus alone (or, in combination with brain resident cells) can cause vascular breakdown. Spatially, virus-specific CD8 T cells were observed in brain regions with and without bleeding, and vascular pathology was reduced in mice supplemented with these antiviral cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Detection of microbleeds in the VSV-infected turbinates and brain by MRI</title><p>Upon intranasal VSV inoculation, immune cell accumulation in the turbinates and OB has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chhatbar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moseman et al., 2020</xref>). To determine how VSV infection affects vessel integrity, high resolution T2*-weighted MRI was used to detect bleeding at different time points post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Large areas of bleeding were readily detected in the turbinates at day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The amount of bleeding, as indicated by hypointense areas (red arrows), increased from day 4–11. Two major sites of bleeding were also detected by MRI in the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Bleeding was observed at the edge of the bulb, in the olfactory nerve layer (ONL) and glomerular layer (GL), and at the center of the bulb near the granule cell layer (GCL). The in-vivo and ex-vivo images on each day were obtained from the same mouse before and after perfusion. In the in-vivo images (upper panel), the asymmetric hypointense region at the edge of the OB indicates the bleeding. As early as day 4, in-vivo MRI revealed microbleeds and vessel rupture starting in the ONL and GL of the OB (red arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Ex-vivo high-resolution MRI detected punctate hypointensities in the ONL and GL on day 4, which confirmed the results of in-vivo MRI. On day 6, punctate hypointensities near the center of the OB were also detected by in-vivo MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The number of microbleeds in the OB increased from day 4–11. The increasing amount of hypointensities in the turbinates and OB were quantified as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moseman et al., 2020</xref>) reported that VSV infected OB very efficiently and viral titers reached ~10<sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) on day 1. Viral titer peaked on day 6, ~10<sup>5</sup> PFU, before being cleared on day 8. Viral RNA measurements on day 6 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) agreed with this earlier report.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected microbleeds in turbinates and olfactory bulb (OB) since day 4 post-infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ex-vivo MRI of turbinates (axial view) from a normal mouse and VSV-infected mice on day 4, 6, and 11 post-infection.

These are also the sites where VSV entered the brain and replicated. On day 4, IHC showed microbleeds and VSV in the ONL, GL and external plexiform layer (EPL) of the OB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Most of the virus was localized in ONL, GL, and the center of the OB on day 6 when viral titer was the highest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Thus, microbleeds largely co-localized with sites of VSV replication in the brain.</p><p>Although VSV replication is usually contained within the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Detje et al., 2009</xref>), we detected vessel breakdown and microbleeds in other parts of the brain by MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; more views are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Punctate hypointensities were detected from frontal brain to midbrain beginning at day 4. In most of the infected mice, microbleeds were detected in the orbital frontal cortex area and somatomotor areas of the cortex around day 4. On day 6, microbleeds were detected in the caudoputamen (CP) and thalamus (TH). From day 8–11, microbleeds were observed from midbrain to hindbrain. IHC verified the presence of microbleeds and VSV in the brain on different days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). The increasing amount of hypointensities in the brain (not including the OB) was quantified as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For the OB and other brain regions, sites of bleeding were enumerated without accounting for size. This was done to assess the number of new bleeding regions that developed. Foci of bleeding (defined as spots/mm<sup>3</sup>) were ~100-fold greater in the OB than the brain. For these calculations, the size of mouse OB was assumed to be ~2% of the brain by volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGann, 2017</xref>). The elevated bleeding in the OB is consistent with the fact that VSV is most abundant in this brain region following intranasal inoculation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitored vessel breakdown in the rest of brain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Axial view and (<bold>B</bold>) coronal view of in-vivo (upper panel) and ex-vivo (lower panel) MRI of brain, showing the breakdown of vessels from frontal brain to midbrain.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, to track the virus, VSV-GFP was used. Virus localized to the center of the bulb on day 1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6D</xref>, the center of the bulb was a major site of virus infection. It is likely that the ability of T cells to traffic to sites of viral infection rapidly prior to vascular damage explains why adoptive transfer of T cells greatly reduced brain bleeding during VSV infection. That T cells can enter sites of viral infection prior to vessel break down is consistent with earlier studies using the LCMV model to study this issue on the surface of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herz et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>On day 1, at the locations that CD8 T cells and microbleeds were detected, activation of vascular endothelium cells (as indicated by VCAM-1 and ICAM-1) and microglia (as indicated by CD68) were also detected by IHC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref>). Thus, MRI of microbleeds and T cell tracking provides a noninvasive method for early detection of cerebrovascular inflammation.</p><p>The combination of MRI contrast from MPIO-labeled T cells and bleeds increased MRI sensitivity to areas where there was both microbleeds and T cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). To test whether this enabled better detection of sites of inflammation at later stages of infection, MRI hypointensity spots were counted after T cell transfer at day 6 and 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). More hypointensity spots could be detected likely due to additive effects of bleeding and T cell detection. The limitation at this stage is that we cannot distinguish microbleeds from MPIO-labeled T cells, and some of the MRI sites may be due to bleeding alone or T cell infiltration alone. However, the total signal from MPIO-labeled immune cells plus bleeds made sites of inflammation more readily detectable by MRI. This provides an approach for imaging neuroinflammation when peripheral cells enter the brain. This was shown in previous studies focused on stroke and traumatic brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Drieu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foley et al., 2009</xref>) where large numbers of peripheral immune cells infiltrate. The present study has been able to detect small bleeds and very few T cells infiltrating in an antigen specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Inflammatory processes are involved in most neurological disorders but are especially important during viral infections. Interactions between the immune system and CNS as well as the pathways by which immune cells infiltrate the brain differ depending on the anatomical location, structure of the barriers, and type of disorder. Using microbleeds as a marker of cerebrovasculature breakdown, we studied the relationship between vascular disruption and CD8 T cell infiltration using T2*-weighted MRI during a neurotropic VSV infection of the mouse brain.</p><p>T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted MRI exhibits a high sensitivity to microbleeds. This high sensitivity is due to paramagnetic properties of deoxy-hemoglobin from RBCs or its degradation product, hemosiderin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haller et al., 2018</xref>). Paramagnetic and supermagnetic materials create a magnetic field gradient that is detected by T2*-weighted MRI and has an amplifying affect because the field gradients can extend at least 50 times greater than the actual size of the material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lauterbur et al., 1996</xref>). This amplification is critical for MRI detection of vascular effects during brain activation (BOLD functional MRI), for sensitive detection of bleeding by MRI, and for many pre-clinical studies that have labeled and imaged cells with MRI. Sensitivity down ~1 pg iron per voxel can be achieved at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shapiro et al., 2004</xref>). This is why we followed in-vivo MRI with ex-vivo MRI of fixed brains because ex-vivo MRI can provide significantly higher resolution to guide histology. One RBC contains ~0.2 pg iron as calculated from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ozment and Turi, 2009</xref>. Thus, there is the potential to detect ~5–10 fully deoxygenated RBCs, which facilitates high sensitivity visualization of vessel bleeds where only a small amount of blood has entered the brain. Thus, MRI was shown to be more sensitive than CT to detect bleeding in human brain. For example, it was demonstrated in a study of herpes simplex virus induced encephalitis that T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted MRI could detect bleeds in the brain within 2 days during the acute phases of the disease, whereas 1–2 weeks were required for CT-based detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2012</xref>). The presence of microbleeds in patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury is increasingly recognized as an indicator of worse outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Griffin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haller et al., 2018</xref>). Iron deposition can initiate continued neuroinflammation and brain damage. Indeed, MRI detected brain vessel damage and microbleeds in COVID patients was recently used to guide histological studies and uncover mechanisms of inflammation associated with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riggle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poyiadji et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Peripheral pathology and inflammation associated with viral infection can contribute to brain bleeding without viral infection of the brain. Previous studies showed that following i.n. inoculation, VSV replicated in the mouse lung, caused a transient viremia, and was found transiently in other organs, including liver and spleen. The virus was cleared from the periphery (lung, plasma, and liver) within 2–3 days post-infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Publicover et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ramsburg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roberts et al., 1999</xref>). In the CNS, viral titer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moseman et al., 2020</xref>) and histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) showed that VSV infected brain very efficiently, peaking on day 6 before being cleared by day 8. Microbleeds largely co-localized with sites of VSV replication in the brain. Based on these results, we think that direct CNS infection, rather than peripheral pathology, causes brain microbleeds in this model. However, no attempt was made to rule out peripheral infection to brain bleeding in the present study.</p><p>Guided by MRI, we demonstrated that neurotropic VSV can cause brain vessel breakdown without the involvement of the peripheral immune system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). VSV spike G-protein binds to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) and enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nikolic et al., 2018</xref>). It was reported that endothelium of brain capillaries express LDL-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Méresse et al., 1989</xref>). In addition, a cell culture experiment showed that VSV-GFP infected and lysed endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patel et al., 2020</xref>). This may explain the presence of VSV along vessels and provides a potential mechanism for viral disruption of vascular integrity independent of peripheral immune cell infiltration into brain. There is also microglia and astrocyte activation during VSV infection that could potentially lead to vessel inflammation. Future studies are required to reveal the exact mechanism by which VSV infects endothelial cells and the role this plays in causing damage to cerebral blood vessels.</p><p>The present study demonstrated that the peripheral immune response to VSV infection is important for the maintenance of vascular integrity and pathogen clearance, as blockade of CNS immune cell entry via administration of anti-LFA1/VLA4 antibodies increased brain bleeding and viral RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, supplementing the immune response by adoptively transferring activated virus-specific CD8+ T cells at either early (day 0–2) or later (day 6) time points post-infection protected cerebral vessels. Nevertheless, some bleeding was still observed even after transfer of CD8+ T cells at days 0–2, and CD8+ T cells responding to the virus were associated with vessel damage at this early stage. The transferred CD8+ T cells were not effective at completely blocking early viral entry from nasal olfactory sensory neurons into the OB. Notably, at both early and late stages of infection, adoptive transfer of MPIO-labeled virus-specific CD8+ T cells at the proper dose protected against brain bleeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Therefore, MPIO-labeled CD8+ T cells retained their therapeutic functions, indicating that the MPIO labeling did not have a negative effect on T cell functionality in-vivo. This is consistent with the in-vitro assays of T cell function after MPIO labeling that revealed no impact on T cell migration or cytokine production.</p><p>VSV showed tropism for the neurons in the GL and GCL and transferred virus-specific CD8+ T cells first arrived in these two layers between 15 and 24 hr post-infection. A previous study demonstrated that CD8+ T cells controlled neuronal virus in this model through engagements with cross-presenting microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moseman et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, adoptive transfer of virus-specific CD8+ T cells improved CNS viral control leading to reduced viral RNA and preserving vascular integrity in the GL and GCL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These two layers of the bulb contain proliferating immature neurons in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batista-Brito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994</xref>). These immature neurons are generated by precursor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and traffic through the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to different layers of the OB, primarily the GL and GCL, where they differentiate into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batista-Brito et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, 1994</xref>). Many viruses have a tropism for immature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2016</xref>), and the presence of immature neurons in these two layers may in part explain the tropism of VSV.</p><p>Based on our MRI cell tracking experiment, the appearance of hypointensity at 22 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I</xref>) is specific for OB inflammation. We do not observe hypointensity in any other brain locations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). We evaluated the possible movement of MPIO-labeled T cells by time-lapse MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), but migration of T cells from the ONL/GL region, which had early signs of bleeding, was not detected. Furthermore, there was no change in the location of T cells from 22–24 hr after cells arrived in the MCL/GCL area. There are two possibilities to explain our inability to detect T cell movement over a 2 hr time interval: (1) the T cells under investigation may have been attached to blood vessels and required more time to extravasate, or (2) although T cell velocities in the CNS have been clocked at ~10 µm/min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herz et al., 2015</xref>), their paths are often tortuous and influenced by antigen presenting cells displaying cognate peptide MHC as well as local chemokine gradients. Thus, upon entering a site of viral infection, the labeled T cells may not have traveled far enough in 2 hr for us to detect their movement by MRI. We did not image mice beyond 24 hr post-infection due to the possibility of bleeding. Nevertheless, future studies will monitor T cell movement over longer time intervals.</p><p>In conclusion, our MRI guided studies have revealed that VSV has the ability to cause vascular damage even at the early stages of infection. This damage is worse if peripheral immune cell infiltration is blocked and can be reduced by adoptively transferring antiviral T cells. It is clear that control of a CNS viral infection requires maintenance of a precise balance between reducing viral titer and preserving tissue integrity, since transfer of too many T cells led to more extensive bleeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies showing that CD8+ T cells can also contribute to cerebrovascular pathology following <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swanson et al., 2016</xref>). Identifying specific viral and immune mechanisms that result in cerebrovascular damage is a clinically relevant area of research, and our studies demonstrate that MRI can be used to evaluate the extent of pathology after a CNS viral infection as well as the efficacy of a therapeutic intervention like adoptive antiviral T cell transfer. In future studies, it will be important to develop more sensitive MRI contrast agents that can be distinguished from blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barbic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zabow et al., 2014</xref>) and / or to use quantitative T2* analysis at different magnetic field strengths. Development of new MRI based approaches that can distinguish blood from iron-labeled immune cells will aid studies designed to assess the relationship between vascular breakdown and the peripheral inflammatory response. Finally, study of pathogen-specific T cells by MRI at the level of single cell detection should advance our understanding T cell entry and movement throughout the brain, which could aid in optimizing adoptive cell therapies for the treatment of different infections and cancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

MRI experiments were performed at 11.7T on a Bruker Biospec MRI system (Bruker BioSpin). T2<sup>*</sup>-weighted 3D gradient-recalled echo (GRE) sequences were used for acquisitions. For in-vivo imaging, the following parameters were used: isotropic resolution = 75 μm, TE/TR = 10/30ms, FA = 10°, NA = 3, scan time = 36 m. For time-lapse MRI: isotropic resolution = 75 µm, TE/TR = 8/25ms, FA = 10°, NA = 1, each scan time = 10m2 s208ms. After in-vivo acquisitions, mice were perfused transcardially with 5% formalin.

Subsequently, 1 μg of RNA was treated with amplification grade DNAse I (Life Technologies) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. We used 250 ng of total RNA for cDNA synthesis using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). All Q-PCRs were performed in 20 μL volumes using SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) in a 96-well optic tray using a CFX96 Real-Time PCR machine (Bio-Rad). The reactions were conducted in duplicate, and samples without reverse transcriptase were used as non-template controls. Forward primer (specific for the VSV genes): TGA TGA TGC ATG ATC CAG CTC T; reverse primer: ACA CAC CTC CAA TGG AAG GGT. Actin RNA was used as internal standard. Q-PCR reactions were run with an initial denaturation temperature of 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of three-step amplification (denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C annealing for 15 s and extension at 72 °C for 20 s).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Adhesion molecule blockade studies</title><p>Anti-LFA-1 (clone M17/4), anti-VLA-4 (clone PS/2), and isotype control (rat IgG2a) antibodies were purchased from BioXcell.

system (CNS) infections and associated pathology. Utilizing a rodent intranasal infection model as a route of CNS entry, novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches are explored to non-invasively track sites of brain vascular microbleeds and the associated immune cell invasion, particularly virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and their relationship to cerebrovascular pathology in living brains. This study is a timely report about how MRI can detect a potential biomarker for early detection of CNS infections and is used as a surrogate readout for treatment efficacy. It will be of interest to research communities involved in immunotherapies across a broad disease continuum as well as imaging physicists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74462.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Belz</surname><given-names>Gabrielle T</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rqy9422</institution-id><institution>The University of Queensland</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Erik</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.21.465276">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.21.465276v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Demonstrate capacity to track virus specific T cells and cerebrovascular pathology in real time in living brains; and show impact on peripheral pathology.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. To address this concern, we conducted new experiments. In these experiments, MRI was used to detect the earliest virus specific T cell infiltrating the olfactory bulb and to assess whether T cells got to this region prior to bleeding. We found no evidence for T cell migration from the edge of the bulb where bleeding had already begun (Figure 8). The new Figure 8I shows the appearance of a MPIO-labeled T cell in the brain at 22 hr-post infection. Thus, we can show the moment a T cell enters the brain. Figures 1-6 showed the capacity of T2*-weighted high-resolution MRI to detect small microbleeds as an early form of cerebrovascular pathology associated with viral entry into the brain. These new data show that T cells can enter infected regions prior to bleeding, likely explaining the therapeutic effect of viral specific T cells on preventing brain bleeding in this model.</p><p>We did not directly address whether peripheral pathology associated with viral infection contributes to brain bleeding. VSV was inoculated into the nose, and previous studies demonstrated that the virus is cleared from most peripheral tissues in 2-3 days and there is minimal evidence of peripheral pathology (Ramsburg et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 1999) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16809308/, https://doi.org/10.1128/Jvi.73.5. 3723-3732, https://doi.org/10.1128/Jvi.79.24.15043-15053. By contrast, there is extensive virus in the olfactory bulbs and brain. Brain bleeding corresponds to sites that are high in virus and occurs after peripheral virus is cleared. Furthermore, we present evidence that virus replicates in brain vessels. This issue and reference to these previous publications have been added to the Discussion on page 18, where the possibility of peripheral pathology is discussed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

With OT-I T cell transfer, there are about 10<sup>6</sup> OT-I cells in the OB. In the present manuscript, the IHC shown in Figure 6 is consistent with previous flow cytometry data. The purpose of the IHC study in Figure 6 is to provide more information of the distribution pattern of the virus, bleeds, and CD8 T cells.</p><p>We had to use anti-CD8 because mTomato on OT-I cells is not very bright, especially after fixation, as shown in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B and C.

It is challenging to measure VSV RNA in purified CD31+ endothelial cell especially at the early stages of infection. There likely is low levels of virus in CD31+ cells and we do not have quantitative information on how many vessels are infected. At peak stages, virus likely lyses the infected CD31+ cells possibly causing bleeding. It is also likely that virus in the vascular endothelial cells can be detected and cleared to some extent by the peripheral immune system.

Previous study showed that following intranasal inoculation, VSV replicates in the mouse lung, causes a transient viremia, and is found transiently in other organs, including liver and spleen. The virus is cleared from the periphery within 2-3 days. (Ramsburg et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 1999). Viral titer (Moseman et al., 2020) and histology (Figures 1,2,8) showed that VSV infected brain very efficiently, peaking on day 6 before being cleared on day 8. Microbleeds largely co-localized with sites of VSV replication in the brain. Based on these, we think that direct CNS infection, rather than peripheral pathology, causes brain microbleeds.

It is our goal by using this well studied model. We were very surprised to see that cerebrovascular breakdown and microbleeds take place even at day 1 of infection through MRI studies. This new finding poses challenges for the goal for tracking T cells. However, it shows the importance of MRI guided histology in the study of cerebrovascular pathology and neuroinflammation. We have added new data since the original review (new Figure 8I) that show time lapse imaging of the deep OB region prior to bleeding from 20-24 hour. We can detect the earliest arrival of T cells to this region. There was no evidence of migration from the surface ONL/GL regions of the bulb, and once in the deep OCB regions we saw no significant migration on the distance scale of MRI. This leads to the model that T cells are entering via local extravasation through the vasculature. T cell entry, vascular breakdown and hemorrhage are common features. We think this work takes a significant step forward to describing the sequence of event in this model of viral infection that will be useful for many other modes. Future MRI developments to distinguish bleeds from MPIOs will be crucial, and we have discussed where we think those developments will come from in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1F – it is stated that the peak in viral loads in the OB is at day 6 however no earlier time points are shown. It would be informative to measure viral loads at day 4 post infection.</p></disp-quote><p>Viral titers have been studied from day 1 to day 8 post infection by plaque assay in previous study [(Moseman et al., 2020) https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32503876/, Figure 1E]. We have added this reference and modified our statement in the Revised Manuscript page 6 to 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 3 – it is important to confirm anti-LFA-1/VLA-4 actually blocked immune cell influx into the brain. Flow cytometry quantitating the absolute number of lymphocytes in the brains with and without treatment would strengthen the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We added cell counting and flow cytometry experiments to confirm the efficacy of the antibody blockade in this Revision (Figure 3B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). The blocking antibodies decreased the number of total immune cells (CD45+) over 95% on day 6 (Figure 3B). The decreased numbers of neutrophils, Ly6C+, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and CD11b+ cells are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 4 – it is suggested based on the IHC data that VSV infects vascular endothelial cells. To strengthen this claim, I recommend the authors purify out CD31+ endothelial cells and measure VSV RNA in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the histology result (Figure 4) provided enough evidence to suggest that VSV infects brain vascular endothelial cells. It is challenging to measure VSV RNA in purified CD31+ endothelial cell especially at the early stages of infection. There likely is low levels of virus in CD31+ cells, and we do not have quantitative information on how many vessels are infected. At peak stages, virus likely lyses the infected CD31+ cells possibly causing bleeding. It is also likely that virus in the vascular endothelial cells can be detected and cleared to some extent by the peripheral immune system. In future studies we will tackle this challenging problem and determine if endothelial cells have VSV RNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 5 – the labelling on this figure is a little confusing (day 6 = early transfer and day 11 late transfer). It would be useful if the authors simplify the labelling to early and late transfer.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 5 was improved in the Revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 6c – validation of this data using a more robust and quantitative read out (flow cytometry of brain tissue measuring OT-I cells numbers) would be useful. Also it is unclear why anti-CD8 was used instead of dTomato to identify the transferred OT-I cells. It would be interesting to distinguish the localisation of the endogenous CD8 and activated OT-I cells in these sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Flow cytometry analysis of olfactory bulb measuring OT-I cell numbers has been performed and published previously [(Moseman et al., 2020), Figure 2 E-F]. As in this reference, with no OT-I T cell transfer, there are about 2 x 10<sup>5</sup> (endogenous) CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the OB on day 6. With OT-I T cell transfer, there are about 10<sup>6</sup> OT-I cells in the OB. In this manuscript, the IHC showing in Figure 6 is consistent with previous flow cytometry data. The purpose of the IHC study in Figure 6 is to provide more information of the distribution pattern of the virus, bleeds, and CD8 T cells.</p><p>We have to use anti-CD8 because mTomato on OT-I cells is not very bright, especially after fixation, as shown in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 2B and C. Moreover, olfactory bulb shows high auto-fluorescence background. The high auto-fluorescence background in the bulb makes the mTomato on OT-I cells even more difficult to detect. Thus, anti-CD8 was used to stain total CD8 T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.
