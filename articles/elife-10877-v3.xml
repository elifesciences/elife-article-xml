embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, little is known about how CTFs are governed during cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that the regulation of Oct4 by Aurora kinase b (Aurkb)/protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) during the cell cycle is important for resetting Oct4 to pluripotency and cell cycle genes in determining the identity of ESCs. Aurkb phosphorylates Oct4(S229) during G2/M phase, leading to the dissociation of Oct4 from chromatin, whereas PP1 binds Oct4 and dephosphorylates Oct4(S229) during M/G1 transition, which resets Oct4-driven transcription for pluripotency and the cell cycle. Aurkb phosphor-mimetic and PP1 binding-deficient mutations in Oct4 alter the cell cycle, effect the loss of pluripotency in ESCs, and decrease the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming. Our findings provide evidence that the cell cycle is linked directly to pluripotency programs in ESCs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10877.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10877.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10877.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Embryonic stem cells can give rise to any type of cell in the body – an ability known as pluripotency. These cells rapidly divide and self-renew until they are exposed to signals that cause them to mature into a particular specialized cell type.</p><p>As cells prepare to divide, they transition through a series of phases known as the cell cycle. In embryonic stem cells, these phases are often shorter than in other cell types. This altered timing is thought to be important for maintaining the pluripotency of the stem cells.</p><p>Proteins called core transcription factors also help stem cells to remain pluripotent. Evidence suggests that the activity of some of these proteins affects the timing of the different cell cycle phases. However, it is not clear exactly how they do so or how the activity of the transcription factors is controlled.</p><p>A core transcription factor called Oct4 is thought to be a “master regulator” of pluripotency that controls the activity of many of the other core transcription factors. Shin, Kim, Kim, Kim et al. have now studied the activity of Oct4 around the point of cell division. This revealed that a protein called aurora kinase B modifies Oct4 by adding a phosphate group to it just before a cell divides. This modification causes Oct4 to detach from chromatin, the protein structure in which DNA is packaged inside cells.</p><p>Following cell division, another protein called PP1 removes the phosphate group from Oct4. This “resets” the pluripotency of the stem cell, allowing it to continue to self-renew. Cells that contain only mutant forms of Oct4 that cannot bind to aurora kinase B or PP1 lose their pluripotency. The mutant Oct4 proteins also alter the cell cycle of the stem cells.</p><p>Overall, Shin et al.’s findings suggest that Oct4 regulates the cell cycle of embryonic stem cells as well as their pluripotency. How Oct4 activity affects the specialization of the stem cells into mature cell types remains to be investigated in future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10877.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10877.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>aurkb</kwd><kwd>cell cycle of ESCs</kwd><kwd>oct4 phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>oct4 resetting</kwd><kwd>PP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>No. 2012R1A3A2048767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Youn</surname><given-names>Hong-Duk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The regulation of the core transcription factor Oct4 by the Aurkb-PP1 axis links the cell cycle to pluripotency programs in embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have unique transcriptional programs for self-renewal and pluripotency which differentiates into all types of cells. Core transcription factors—Oct4, Sox2, Nanog (OSN)—govern such pluripotency transcriptional programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaenisch and Young, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Young, 2011</xref>). ESCs grow rapidly and undergo an unusual cell cycle, characterized by a very short G1 phase and a long S phase in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kapinas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Savatier et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White and Dalton, 2005</xref>). The duration of G1 in mouse ESCs and human ESCs determines their fate with regard to differentiation and pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mummery et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>). A recent study revealed that the S and G2 phases tend to maintain the pluripotent state at early time of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, cell cycle regulation in ESCs should be linked to pluripotency in maintaining ESC identity.</p><p>Our understanding of the molecular associations between the cell cycle and pluripotency in ESCs is limited. Robust Cdk2 activity shortens G1 phase by inducing rapid G1-S transition and promotes pluripotency and self-renewal in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Neganova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Hoof et al., 2009</xref>). Nanog controls S phase entry by targeting Cdc25c and Cdk6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). Despite the growing evidence on the direct connection between the cell cycle and pluripotency, it remains unknown how ESCs preserve their pluripotency through cell cycle progression and reset pluripotency transcriptional programs during the transition from mitosis to G1 phase.</p><p>Oct4 is considered a master regulator of ESC pluripotency through its cooperation with other core transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jerabek et al., 2014</xref>). Post-translational modifications to Oct4 affect its transcriptional activity and lead to ESC pluripotency. For example, we previously reported that O-GlcNAcylatoin of murine Oct4(T228) is important for ESC pluripotency and somatic cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2012</xref>). Also, Oct4 is controlled by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brumbaugh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saxe et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Spelat et al., 2012</xref>), but there is no evidence that phosphorylation-mediated regulation of Oct4 during the cell cycle affects Oct4-mediated pluripotency programs in ESCs.</p><p>The Aurora kinase b (Aurkb)-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) axis is critical for kinetochore assembly/disassembly during the cell cycle, regulating the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of kinetochore substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emanuele et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, PP1 mediates the M/G1 transition and ensures proper resetting of the subsequent G1 phase by dephosphorylating cell cycle machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ceulemans and Bollen, 2004</xref>). When the cell cycle resets, transcriptional programs for ESC pluripotency should be reset, because transcriptional programs are generally switched off at the onset of mitosis and subsequently reestablished during entry into the next G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delcuve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Egli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martinez-Balbas et al., 1995</xref>). Thus, during the cell cycle, the Aurkb-PP1 axis might be linked directly to the post-translational modification of pluripotency factors with regard to the resetting of pluripotency in ESCs.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the Aurkb-PP1 axis regulates Oct4 during the cell cycle over time and by location. We found that Oct4 contains a well-conserved Aurkb phosphorylation residue (S229) and PP1 binding motif (RVXF) in its homeodomain. Aurkb phosphorylates Oct4(S229) during G2/M phase and dissociates p-Oct4(S229) from chromatin, and PP1 dephosphorylates p-Oct4(S229) during the M/G1 transition, which prompts Oct4 to reset pluripotency transcription on re-entry into the following G1 phase. We found that mutating the Aurkb-phosphorylation residue S229 and the PP1-binding residue F271 of Oct4 in ESCs led to a significant loss of pluripotency and altered the cell cycle. Transduction of these mutants into MEFs significantly decreased the reprogramming efficiency.</p><p>Based on these findings, we propose that the spatiotemporal regulation of Oct4 by the Aurkb-PP1 axis during the cell cycle is critical for resetting pluripotency and cell cycle genes in determining the identity of ESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylated Oct4 at serine 229 is highly enriched in G2/M phase and dissociated from chromatin</title><p>To understand the function of the phosphorylation of Oct4, we examined its phosphorylation sites by transient transfection of Flag-Oct4 into E14 ESCs, analyzed the phosphorylation state of purified Oct4 by mass spectrometry, and identified 4 phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

The detachment of Oct4 from chromatin is consistent with findings from previous reports. Most transcriptional machinery proteins, such as RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gottesfeld and Forbes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parsons and Spencer, 1997</xref>), and many transcription factors dissociate from condensed chromatin at the onset of mitosis, and many studies have implied that mitotic dissociation of transcription factors occurs through phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delcuve et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Aurka regulates ESC pluripotency through phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>) but is not involved in the phosphorylation-mediated recycling of Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, both Aurk isoforms—Aurka and Aurkb—appear to be related to ESC pluripotency, but in a different molecular mechanism.</p><p>We also found that PP1 mediates the resetting of Oct4 during the M/G1 transition. PP1 governs the resetting of cell cycle machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ceulemans and Bollen, 2004</xref>), binding specific sequences—the RVxF motif—and dephosphorylating interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hendrickx et al., 2009</xref>). We identified an RVWF motif in the C-terminal POU-h domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and an Aurkb phosphorylation site (S229) in the N-terminal POU-h domain of Oct4, which come into close proximity in the 3-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This arrangement convinces us that PP1 binds Oct4 through the RVxF motif and dephosphorylates Oct4 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we revealed that PP1 inhibition by OKA treatment delayed the Oct4 dephosphorylation at S229 residue and consequently resetting to the target genes in E14 ESCs during M/G1 transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). We further found that OKA treatment relatively less affected the binding of phosphor-defect Oct4(S229A) to target genes, significantly impeding the resetting of Oct4(WT) at M/G1 transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), implying that dephosphorylation of S229 residue by PP1 is paramount for the resetting of Oct4 to target genes. Nonetheless, we cannot perfectly rule out the possibility that OKA treatment may affect the function of broad spectra of cell cycle regulators during M/G1 transition.</p><p>We confirmed that Aurkb-phosphor-mimetic and PP1-binding-defective mutations lead to a loss of pluripotency, even in the presence of LIF, and that introduction of these mutants into somatic cells lowers the reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>), supporting that Aurkb/PP1 is a critical pair of regulators in resetting Oct4 on chromatin during the cell cycle.</p><p>Mitotic phosphorylation of a transcription factor affects its transcriptional activity and other properties. For example, Oct1, a member of the POU domain transcription factors, is phosphorylated during mitosis and localizes to the spindle matrix, forming a complex with lamin B1 at the midbody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Mitotic phosphorylation of Sp1 protects itself from ubiquitin-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuang et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, we found that Oct4 protein levels were unchanged, even though nascent <italic>Oct4</italic> RNA levels fluctuated during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and F</xref>), implying that phosphorylated Oct4 is probably protected from degradation during the cell cycle. We are interested in determining the mechanism of how phosphorylated Oct4 escapes protein degradation.</p><p>The molecular association between pluripotency and the cell cycle in ESCs has garnered attention with regard to identifying the mechanism by which the cell fate of ESCs is determined. In particular, the protraction of G1 in naive ESCs by knockdown of cyclin E1 causes spontaneous differentiation; in contrast, promoting G1/S transition through overexpression of cyclin E1 enhances self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coronado et al., 2013</xref>). G1 phase regulators, cyclin D proteins control the differentiation of hESCs into various lineages via the TGF-β-Smad2/3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pauklin and Vallier, 2013</xref>). Sox2 was identified as a cell cycle regulator that suppresses p21 and p27 and induces cyclin D3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herreros-Villanueva et al., 2013</xref>). Oct4 downregulation lengthens G1 phase and upregulates p21 in ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). A nontranscriptional function of Oct4 in mitotic entry has recently been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). A recent study performed functional screening of human embryonic stem cells under various differentiation conditions and identified that genes involved in S and G2 phases are gatekeepers of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, S and G2 phases of cell cycle possess an intrinsic propensity for maintaining pluripotency.</p><p>In this study, in addition to observing that Aurkb/PP1 control the dynamics of Oct4 during the cell cycle, we found that Oct4 governs the cell cycle of ESCs by directly targeting genes that are related to cell cycle regulation and pluripotency. In particular, 2 cell cycle genes—<italic>Bub1</italic> and <italic>Rif1</italic>—are reset by Oct4 during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Considering that Bub1 and Rif1 are important cell cycle regulators that control the checkpoints for mitosis and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolanos-Garcia and Blundell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>) and are crucial for maintaining pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), the regulation of S-G2-M phase by Oct4 might also be critical for ESC pluripotency.</p><p>Our study might provide insights into why ESCs reset Oct4 during the cell cycle. Like, this mechanism might bifurcate the fate of ESCs: tight resetting of Oct4 on chromatin during the cell cycle strengthens the pluripotency of ESCs at the ground state, but on differentiation, loose resetting of Oct4 at the next M/G1 transition leads to lineage differentiation.</p><p>During reprogramming by nuclear transfer, mitotic chromosomal condensation is required to reset the origins of replication of differentiated donor cells in embryonic DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lemaitre et al., 2005</xref>), transfer of a mitotic genome into a zygote in mitosis-enhanced reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Egli et al., 2007</xref>), and mitotic chromatin induces core pluripotency factors more rapidly than interphase nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halley-Stott et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that a genome can be exchanged during mitosis which is an open window that allows transcription factors to occupy target genes on mitotic exit and thus enabling postmitotic cell fate changes to be induced.</p><p>We have provided evidence that cell cycle machinery cooperates with pluripotency transcriptional programs. The resetting of Oct4 occurs rapidly during the exit from mitosis and that delayed resetting alters the cell cycle and effects the loss of pluripotency—ie, prompt resetting of Oct4 prevents postmitotic cell fate changes in ESCs. Based on our results, we suggest that the potential of ESCs to differentiate might be derived from the small window of the M/G1 transition by which the resetting of Oct4 is the central mechanism to determine the maintenance of ESC pluripotency or lineage commitments.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>E14 and ZHBTc4 ESCs were cultured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jang et al., 2012</xref>) in 0.1% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri ) coated plates.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers found the work to be of considerable interest but wanted additional work to reinforce some of the most critical conclusions. Given that virtually nothing is known about how post-translational modifications regulate Oct4, this paper provides some provocative evidence that phosphorylation by Aurora B Kinase influences the association of Oct4 with chromatin. Addressing the critical points enumerated below will strengthen the paper:</p><p>1) Please determine when in the cell cycle Oct4 is bound to DNA and perform CHIP-seq during distinct phases of the cell cycle (e.g., G2M vs G1) to define which regions are bound in a cell-cycle dependent manner.</p><p>2) Please provide evidence for the robustness of the pOct4 Ab for CHIP.</p><p>3) Consider the criticism from Reviewer #2 regarding the lack of specificity of the OKA experiments.</p><p>4) Provide better characterization of the nocodozole effects as stressed by Reviewer #3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes data showing that Oct-4 is phosphorylated by aurora kinase B in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). This mechanism blocks Oct-4 to bind chromatin. PP1 then dephosphorylate Oct-4 in M/G1 restoring its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of this mechanism inhibits pluripotency and decrease cellular reprogramming efficiency. The authors propose that this mechanism could reset the pluripotent state of mouse ESCs at each cell cycle thereby allowing for a short period of time the cells to differentiate.</p><p>These data are interesting and novel. They offer new insights concerning the mechanisms by which cell cycle could control cell fate choice in stem cells. Nonetheless few aspects could be clarified.</p><p>The precise timing by which Oct-4 is on the chromatin is unclear. Indeed, it would be expected that Oct-4 may leave naturally its binding site to allow DNA replication during S phase. So, It would be interesting to check if Oct-4 is binding DNA in S phase? What happening to its phosphorylation state in S phase? How does it relate to the S229 phosphorylation?</p><p>The authors should cite the recent manuscript published by Huck Hui Ng and colleagues PMID: 26232226. How do their results relate to these mechanisms described in this publication?</p><p>In addition, the authors only look at few OCT-4 binding site in G2/M. Indeed, their data suggest that Oct-4 can still bind DNA during this phase of the cell cycle. It would be interesting to identify the genomic regions bound by Oct4 in G2/M and M/G1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> In this study, Shin et al. demonstrated that Oct4, a key regulator of pluripotent stem cells, is phosphorylated at S229 at G2/M phase but dephosphorylated at G1 phase of each cell cycle. The authors convincingly demonstrated that the Aurora kinase B and PP1, which play critical roles in kinetochore assembly and disassembly, regulate this modification. The authors argue that dephosphorylation of S229 at each G1 phase allows resetting the core transcriptional network. Overall, this study discovered a novel and interesting post-translational modification of Oct4, however, the biological consequence/relevance of this regulation is not established.</p><p>The main concerns are:</p><p>1) Data demonstrating that p-Oct4 dissociates from chromatin is not convincing. The main evidence supporting this point is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, where the authors performed ChIP-qPCR demonstrating that p-Oct4 cannot bind to Oct4 or Nanog promoter. However, because it is not clear whether the p-Oct4 antibody enables chromatin immunoprecipitation, the lack of p-Oct4 binding can also be explained as the antibody lacks ChIP capacity. Furthermore, if p-Oct4 cannot bind to chromatin and is poor in target gene transactivation, one should expect decreased expression of Oct4 target genes in ESCs treated with nocodazole (e.g. 10 hrs). Has this been observed?</p><p>2) Because suppression of PP1 by OKA affects activities of many other PP1 substrates, the observed differences in cell cycle progression, chromatin binding, and nascent mRNA transcription in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> cannot be simply attributed to Oct4 S229 phosphorylation. It is known that PP1 activity is required for kinetochore disassembly and mitotic exit, which may explain the delayed G1 re-entry in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Furthermore, PP1 activates Rb family proteins at G1 phase, which may directly contribute to the difference in nascent mRNA transcription in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>. Similarly, the ChIP-PCR data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> may also be explained by differences in cell cycle profile and phosphorylation status of certain Oct4 co-factors. These data failed to directly address the roles of p-Oct4. To better establish functional relevance of this modification, the authors may characterize Zhbtc4 cells expressing the S229A or S229D mutant.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, the cell cycle profile of ESCs expressing the F271A mutant is quite different from ESCs expressing the S229D mutant, which is unexpected according to the proposed model. Does the S229D mutant retain some level of transactivation activity? Is the F271A mutant dominant negative?</p><p>4) It is difficult to fully appreciate the functional relevance of S229 modification. It seems that WT Oct4 is better than both S229A and S229D mutants in self-renewal and/or reprogramming assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Why phosphorylation of Oct4 at S229 at G2/M is important? Is S229D more stable than S229A in mitosis? Is the S229A as good as WT Oct4 in activating target genes and supporting self-renewal? Are great majority or only a small fraction of Oct4 molecules phosphorylated by Aurkb at G2/M?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the phosphorylation sites on the core pluripotency factor Oct4 and associated one of the phosphorylation site S229 with Aurora B and PP1 which are key cell cycle kinases and phosphatase. Interestingly, the phosphorylation status on Oct4 S229 seems to modulate Oct4 chromatin binding activity. And the authors proposed that the dynamic phosphorylation of Oct4 is important for its ejection and rebinding before and after mitosis. Although the precise role of Oct4 ejection and rebinding within a cell cycle is not clear, the authors hinted that this could be important to maintaining Oct4 transcription and pluripotency.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript which links cell cycle kinase/phosphatase with the controlling of the activity of the key pluripotency factor Oct4. The authors performed nice biochemical and functional experiment to investigate this novel phosphorylation site on Oct4. Although some of the experiments are more correlative, overall the experiments support their conclusions.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) Does the concentration of nocodazole used in this study arrest cells in G2 phase or M phase? Aurora B is known to be most active in M phase; besides, M phase chromatin condensation are known to cause transcription factors ejection from chromatin. Thus it is better to perform FACS staining for a mitotic marker, so that the authors may be able to precisely locate M phase as the time in the cell cycle when Oct4 gets phosphorylated.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> only shows there is reduced Oct4 binding to chromatin in nocodazole treated cells. This data cannot lead to the conclusion that phosphorylated Oct4 has reduced chromatin binding in nocodazole.</p><p>3) Aurora B plays an important role in maintaining mitotic arrest caused by spindle disrupting agents, like nocodazole. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>, was the depletion or inhibition of Aurora B causing cells to exit from mitotic arrest, and therefore indirectly lead to the dephosphorylation of Oct4? Similarly, the use of OKA seems to enrich cells towards 4N, will this indirectly promote Oct4 phosphorylation?</p><p>4) If Aurora B kinase is activated exogenously during interphase, will this trigger premature Oct4 phosphorylation and ejection from chromatin during interphase?</p><p>5) The conclusion on Oct4 phosphorylation and chromatin ejection based on experiments using nocodazole treatment is only correlative. Authors only showed that during mitosis Oct4 gets phosphorylated by Aurora B which correlates with its cytoplasmic localization. However, the majority of transcription factors are ejected from chromatin during mitosis due to chromatin condensation.

Therefore, at this stage, we cannot exclude the possibility of physical dissociation of Oct4 during replication.

In this study, we showed that Aurkb directly phosphorylates Oct4(S229) and PP1 directly dephosphorylates Oct4(S229), therefore, implying that OKA treatment can accumulate the phosphorylation of Oct4 by blocking the PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of Oct4.</p><p><italic>4) If Aurora B kinase is activated exogenously during interphase, will this trigger premature Oct4 phosphorylation and ejection from chromatin during interphase?</italic> </p><p>It has been reported that Aurkb is tightly regulated in a cell cycle dependent manner (Carmena et al., 2012). Usually, Aurkb in cancer cells is activated during G2/M phase by INCENP-hespin kinase. In addition, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Aurkb is reported to be active during S-G2/M phase (Mallm and Rippe, 2015). We also showed that Aurkb begin to phosphorylate Oct4 at S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, to activate Aurkb completely, Aurkb should binds and phosphorylates to INCENP (Carmena et al., 2012), implying that constitutively-active Aurkb does not exist. Therefore, we do not believe that Aurkb can be activated during G1 interphase. Thus, we showed that Oct4(S229D), a mimic of Aurkb-phosphorylating Oct4, retards the resetting at G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which hopefully answers the reviewer’s question.</p><p><italic>5) The conclusion on Oct4 phosphorylation and chromatin ejection based on experiments using nocodazole treatment is only correlative. Authors only showed that during mitosis Oct4 gets phosphorylated by Aurora B which correlates with its cytoplasmic localization. However, the majority of transcription factors are ejected from chromatin during mitosis due to chromatin condensation. Thus, the ejection of Oct4 from chromatin during mitosis could be due to the physical condensation of chromatin rather than the phosphorylation by AuroraB.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this concern. We found several lines of evidence implying that dissociation of phosphorylated Oct4 from chromatin proceeds to mitotic chromatin condensation and explained detailed descriptions in response to question #1. We agree with the reviewer’s opinion that M phase chromatin condensation partly contributes the ejection of Oct4 from chromatin.</p><p><italic>6) Is S229A mutant more potent in binding to Oct4 target genes even with PP1 inhibition? Alternatively, will S229A mutant constitutively bind to chromatin even in M phase? If Oct4 S229A mutant is more potent is chromatin binding, then why does it seem to possess weaker activity and also caused a reduction in reprogramming efficiency?</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s comment’s, we compared DNA binding ability of Oct4(S229A) to Oct4(WT). Oct4(S229A) binding is slightly higher than Oct4(WT) at G2/M phase and G1 phase with OKA treatment. While, Oct4(S229A) have lower reporter activity in NIH-3t3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) than Oct4(WT). This effect can be explained with O-GlcNacylation of Oct4. In our previous study about significance of serine 228 O-GlcNacylation of Oct4 to maintaining pluripotency (Jang et al., 2012), we found that Oct4 (S229A) mutation led to significant reduction of Oct4-O-GlcNAcylation which is critical for Oct4 activity, thereby S229A may reduce DNA binding of Oct4 and reprogramming efficiency.</p><p><italic>References</italic></p><p>Carmena, M., Wheelock, M., Funabiki, H., and Earnshaw, W.C.
