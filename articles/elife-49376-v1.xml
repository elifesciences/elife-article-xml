(<italic>OCLN</italic>) mutations cause human microcephaly and cortical malformation. A tight junction component thought absent in neuroepithelium after neural tube closure, OCLN isoform-specific expression extends into corticogenesis. Full-length and truncated isoforms localize to neuroprogenitor centrosomes, but full-length OCLN transiently localizes to plasma membranes while only truncated OCLN continues at centrosomes throughout neurogenesis. Mimicking human mutations, full-length OCLN depletion in mouse and in human CRISPR/Cas9-edited organoids produce early neuronal differentiation, reduced progenitor self-renewal and increased apoptosis. Human neural progenitors were more severely affected, especially outer radial glial cells, which mouse embryonic cortex lacks. Rodent and human mutant progenitors displayed reduced proliferation and prolonged M-phase. OCLN interacted with mitotic spindle regulators, NuMA and RAN, while full-length OCLN loss impaired spindle pole morphology, astral and mitotic microtubule integrity. Thus, early corticogenesis requires full-length OCLN to regulate centrosome organization and dynamics, revealing a novel role for this tight junction protein in early brain development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome regulation</kwd><kwd>cortical neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>microcephaly</kwd><kwd>OCLN</kwd><kwd>tight junction protein</kwd><kwd>brain malformation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01HD067244</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>M Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS105477</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>M Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Training Fellowship (T32HD060600)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bendriem</surname><given-names>Raphael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>That early cortical neural progenitor divisions strictly require OCLN isoform expression is a paradigm shift in the functional consideration of this protein best known for promoting between-cell barrier functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in the occludin (<italic>OCLN)</italic> gene cause a recessively inherited severe human disorder of microcephaly and band-like calcifications with polymicrogyria (BLC-PMG) characterized by loss of cortical convolutions, shallow or absent sulci, and multiple small gyri giving the cortex surface a roughened irregular appearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdel-Hamid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Driscoll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elsaid et al., 2014</xref>). The integral tight junction (TJ) protein, occludin, is recognized as part of epithelial and endothelial junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Itallie and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>) and while not required for tight junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulzke et al., 2005</xref>), recent data indicates occludin regulates barrier properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Raleigh et al., 2011</xref>). In the embryonic cerebral cortex, OCLN is localized both at TJs between epithelial cells and at the apical surface of the ventricular zone (VZ) in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>). However, OCLN function in cortical development is virtually unexamined, as its VZ expression was thought to be turned off around the neuroepithelial to radial glial cell (NE-to-RGC) transition (embryonic day 11â12 (E11-E12) in the mouse), at the onset of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sahara and O'Leary, 2009</xref>). A mouse model presumed to be an <italic>Ocln</italic>-null displayed postnatal growth retardation, brain calcification, and chronic inflammation. However, vascular endothelial TJs were still present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Ocln</italic> is important for regulation of TJs but not for junction formation. Cortical phenotypes of this mouse model were not explored beyond scattered calcification in the brain.</p><p>Interestingly, mutations in other TJ protein-encoding genes such as <italic>JAM3</italic> produce brain hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mochida et al., 2010</xref>) rather than the congenital microcephaly and PMG associated with the <italic>OCLN</italic> mutation phenotype in humans, suggesting that OCLN may have developmental functions unanticipated for a TJ protein. Microcephaly, defined as head circumference of â2 standard deviations below the mean or smaller, can occur when expansion of the neural progenitor pool and subsequent generation of neurons is restricted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaindl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manzini and Walsh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mahmood et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Thornton and Woods, 2009</xref>). Among the extensive list of genes now causally linked to microcephaly, many have in common a role in regulating centrosome dynamics and mitotic spindle stabilization of progenitors in the ventricular neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilmore and Walsh, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faheem et al., 2015</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jayaraman et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we use human and mouse models of corticogenesis to explore the role of OCLN in the developing cortex, specifically to investigate its potential interaction with the centrosome and elucidate mechanisms through which its loss-of-function produces microcephaly.</p><p>We use mouse and human models to show that OCLN functions in cortical development, playing a previously unappreciated role in neural progenitor proliferation through promoting centrosomal and mitotic spindle integrity. Specific loss of the full-length OCLN isoform results in altered spindle and astral microtubules, prolonged M-phase, premature cell cycle exit and early neuronal differentiation. These defects are consistent with observed microcephaly and PMG associated with human <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>OCLN localizes to interphase and mitotic centrosomes in embryonic mouse cortex</title><p>It is widely held that OCLN functions in tight junctions and its expression in the embryonic cortex is limited to neuroepithelial (NE) junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GÃ¶tz and Huttner, 2005</xref>) prior to the NE-to-RGC transition at the onset of neurogenesis, at which point OCLN expression is believed to be turned off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sahara and O'Leary, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">GÃ¶tz and Huttner, 2005</xref>). This limited OCLN expression at tight junctions would be counterintuitive to the severe human microcephaly associated with <italic>OCLN</italic> mutation, since primary microcephaly is predominantly caused by defects in progenitor proliferation in cortex during the neurogenetic epoch, E11-E18 in the mouse [reviewed in 24]. We therefore sought to determine whether alternative subcellular expression of mouse OCLN (mOCLN) existed in the VZ before and after the NE-to-RGC transition. At E10.5, mOCLN is localized to the neuroepithelial plasma membranes and at the centrosome during interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). By E14.5, mOCLN was absent at the cell membrane, in accordance with previous studies in which TJs are replaced by adherens junctions as neurogenesis begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996</xref>). Surprisingly, mOCLN expression at both interphase and mitotic centrosomes persisted throughout and beyond the NE-to-RGC transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Several mouse <italic>Ocln</italic> transcripts are annotated in the Ensembl database: (1) full-length transcripts with varying 3â and 5âUTR lengths, all encoding wild-type OCLN (mOCLN-FL) with four transmembrane domains, two extracellular loops with intracellular N- and C-termini, and (2) one truncated transcript (ENSMUST00000159459) lacking exons 2 and 3, resulting in the loss of the N-terminus and three of the four transmembrane domains (mOCLN-ÎN; UniProt E0CZ73) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Centrosomal localization of both isoforms was further supported by centrifugation-based subcellular fractionation of whole brain E12.5 lysates, which showed mOCLN-FL residing in both membrane and soluble nuclear fractions, with the latter fraction also containing centrosomal proteins Î³-tubulin and phosphorylated-Î²-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, truncated mOCLN-ÎN could only be found in the soluble fraction. Together, these results indicate both OCLN isoforms localize to the centrosome while only mOCLN-FL localizes to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, although mOCLN-FL expression is downregulated after the NE-to-RGC transition, the truncated mOCLN-ÎN isoform is continually expressed during neurogenesis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Differential localization of OCLN isoforms in embryonic mouse cortex.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Confocal microscope images of coronal sections from E10.5 and E14.5 mouse cortices stained with polyclonal (pAb) (<bold>A</bold>) and monoclonal (mAb) (<bold>B</bold>) OCLN antibodies and co-stained with centrosomal markers pericentrin or Î³-tubulin.

However, novel mouse <italic>Ocln</italic> splice forms have been recently annotated in the mouse genome. Using unique 5âUTR primers to distinguish between <italic>Ocln-FL</italic> and <italic>-ÎN</italic> transcripts, we noted a shorter FL transcript in the mutant mouse, whose PCR amplicon sequence revealed a frame shift predicting translation of a nonsense peptide with premature stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Moreover, we further noted in both control and homozygous mutant mice the presence of the shorter ÎN transcript lacking exons 2 and 3 which would not have been targeted for deletion in the mutant mouse. This transcript is translated to mOCLN-ÎN, a 32 kDa protein detectable by western blot using an antibody raised against the C-terminus of OCLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The homozygous mutants were hence named <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> or ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN in mouse data presented. To validate these findings immunohistochemically in the developing cortex, we probed for OCLN using an N-terminus specific antibody that would solely recognize mOCLN-FL and not protein from the mutant mouse lacking the OCLN N-terminus. Unlike the <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> mutant VZ progenitors, mOCLN-FL was detected in wildtype, <italic>Ocln<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mouse brain at E10.5, localized to both plasma membrane and centrosome, and was absent at the plasma membrane by E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Faint, diffuse OCLN labeling was observed in some but not all <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> VZ nuclei in the developing cortex. Immunohistochemical labeling of mOCLN-FL was substantially reduced in VZ progenitor plasma membrane and centrosome at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, mOCLN-FL protein expression on Western blot in E12.5 <italic>Ocln +/+</italic> total brain lysate remained strong, presumably due to the presence of tight junctions in the brain vasculature, choroid plexus and other epithelial and endothelial elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Luissint et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaur et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, both <italic>Ocln<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> mice exhibited centrosomal staining with OCLN C-terminus antibody (detects both mOCLN-FL and mOCLN-ÎN) at E10.5 and E14.5 in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus, the mutant mice still express the shorter isoform mOCLN-ÎN but not mOCLN-FL. These data are in agreement with subcellular fractionation results showing that mOCLN-ÎN only localizes at the centrosome and not at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We observed a robust pulldown of both hOCLN-wt and hOCLN-ex3del isoforms by anti-NuMA antibody and reciprocal pulldown of NuMA by C-terminus OCLN antibody (thus recognizing both hOCLN-wt and hOCLN-ex3del isoforms) from hESC lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similar pulldown results were obtained with anti-RAN antibody and reciprocal pulldown of RAN with anti-OCLN antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). NuMA-OCLN interaction was further supported by immunostaining in which co-localization of both proteins was observed at the mitotic spindle poles during M-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). NuMA-labeled spindle pole morphology appeared rounded more frequently in sg5 and sg11 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7CâF</xref>), specifically exhibiting a circular shape rather than the expected elongated or half-moon shape of normal NuMA immunostaining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nguyen and Munger, 2009</xref>). Since NuMA is known to be important to mitotic spindle stability and chromosome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Silk et al., 2009</xref>) and has also been shown to regulate astral spindle orientation and tethering to the cell cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seldin et al., 2016</xref>), we explored astral spindle morphology and showed that both sg5 and sg11 mutant lines exhibited significantly weaker astral spindle labeling of alpha-tubulin, with shorter and fewer spindles, compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). Finally, we observed a higher frequency of altered mitotic spindle features such as abnormal spindle tilts and asymmetric spindle densities, higher frequency of chromosome misalignment, and reduced intensity of acetylated alpha-tubulin staining, in sg5 and sg11 mutants compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7IâM</xref>). Chromosome misalignments as a result of impaired spindle integrity will likely result in aneuploidy in mutant cells. The karyotype of wild-type undifferentiated hESCs was indistinguishable from that of undifferentiated hESC-sg5 or hESC-sg11 cells. However, the regulation of spindle pole and cleavage plane orientation is especially critical for cortical radial glia making symmetric stem divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huttner and Kosodo, 2005</xref>).

The frequency of one or more abnormal chromosomes per cell was significantly increased in sg5 and sg11 organoids compared to control organoids.

We show that OCLN is located in the embryonic cortical epithelium at tight junctions in the plasma membrane and at the centrosome through the NE-to-RGC transition and only a truncated OCLN splice form is located at the centrosome thereafter. Furthermore, loss of full-length OCLN impairs cortical neurogenesis in both hESC-derived cortical organoids and mutant mouse cortex, recapitulating <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations in humans. Specifically, we show that loss of full-length OCLN in the mouse embryonic cortex leads to microcephaly due to prolonged M-phase, a transient burst of apoptosis, and precocious neuronal differentiation at the expense of the progenitor pool. A more pronounced size deficit was observed in <italic>OCLN</italic> mutant hESC-derived cortical organoids, associated with reduced proliferation, premature differentiation, apoptosis, and increased aneuploidy. Finally, OCLN interacts with mitotic spindle protein NuMA, known to maintain mitotic spindle stability and integrity. Loss of several OCLN isoforms in hESCs produced altered spindle pole morphology, fewer and shorter astral microtubules, and impaired mitotic spindle integrity, indicating apparatus malfunction, as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. We previously showed cell cycle perturbations that disrupt the balance between RGC and intermediate progenitor cell (IPC) neural populations are associated with PMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mirzaa et al., 2014</xref>) and an analogous imbalance is proposed to underlie PMG in this <italic>OCLN</italic> phenotype.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary model of OCLN isoform functions in radial glial cells (RGCs) explored in this study.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49376-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Half of reported human <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations are located on exon 3 and are protein-truncating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdel-Hamid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Driscoll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elsaid et al., 2014</xref>), likely resulting in loss-of-function of full-length OCLN. One might consider that the observed effects on mitotic spindles and impaired cortical neurogenesis are caused instead by a dominant negative effect triggered by the presence of truncated OCLN isoforms. However, a number of features argue against this possibility. First, this human disorder is caused by autosomal recessive mutation, which speaks against a dominant negative effect since heterozygous individuals are asymptomatic. Second, a number of reported insertion/deletion <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations causing BLC-PMG were found on exons 5, 6, or 7, which would result in loss-of-function of all OCLN isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdel-Hamid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Driscoll et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jenkinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elsaid et al., 2014</xref>). Third, there is no indication yet to suggest a genotype-phenotype correlation with clinical severity between the more proximal vs. distal <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations. Together these features strongly indicate that loss-of-function of full-length OCLN is central to the phenotypes observed in this study. What remains to be understood is why expression of the truncated isoform at the centrosome continues to be required after the developmental down regulation of the full-length protein under physiological conditions.</p><p>We utilized a previously characterized <italic>Ocln</italic> mutant mouse model presumed to be an <italic>Ocln</italic>-null (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>). While numerous in vitro studies suggest an important role of occludin in formation or stabilization of the TJ paracellular barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Furuse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balda, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Itallie and Anderson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCarthy et al., 1996</xref>), the <italic>Ocln</italic> mutant mice did not exhibit gross phenotypes that might be expected of impaired TJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saitou et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulzke et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the exact contributions of occludin to TJ formation and maintenance have remained controversial. However, our observation of continued mOCLN-ÎN expression suggests the <italic>Ocln</italic> mutant mouse is actually a hypomorph. Previous studies have shown the OCLN C-terminus to be important for ZO-1 interaction, proper localization to the TJ, and other signaling functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furuse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tash et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the mOCLN-ÎN isoform which still contains the long C-terminal tail and one of four transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) may be poised to contribute to TJ formation or stability and warrants further study.</p><p>Our finding OCLN at the RGC centrosome is consistent with recent studies in which endogenous OCLN localized to the centrosome in endothelial cell culture, in mouse retinal vasculature, and in surgical samples of retinal neovascular endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). ExogenouslyÂ expressed full-length occludin also localized to centrosomes in MDCK cells in vitro and was further shown to regulate mitotic entry and centrosome separation in a phospho-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Runkle et al., 2011</xref>). Here, both full-length and truncated isoforms localized to the cortical RGC centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), suggesting the C-terminal domain of OCLN is important for this localization. This hypothesis is consistent with previous demonstration that OCLN phosphosite S490, located at the distal end of the C-terminus, is important for centrosome localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Runkle et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, neither mouse mOCLN-ÎN nor human hOCLN-ex3del localized to cortical progenitor plasma membranes, likely due to the loss of three of four transmembrane domains in the truncated isoform that lacks a signal peptide for membrane insertion. Our data strongly supports the notion that OCLN has two distinct and role-dependent subcellular localizations. This study also expands the functional repertoire of OCLN to regulation of neural proliferation and brain size. Although OCLN has been previously linked to epithelial and endothelial cell proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bolinger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Runkle et al., 2011</xref>) and mouse retinal neovascularization and angiogenesis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), ours is the first recognition of its role in cortical progenitor proliferation.</p><p>While the presence of mOCLN-ÎN/hOCLN-ex3del isoforms exclusively at the centrosome imply an interesting role in proliferation, the present data particularly emphasize the role of full- length OCLN in mitotic regulation. First, loss of mOCLN-FL during E10.5-E12.5 coincided with aberrant prolonged M-phase and a transient burst of apoptosis, neither of which continued in control or mutant mice beyond the age when OCLN-FL is normally absent. Second, selective loss of mOCLN-FL produced microcephaly in postnatal mice, even with the continued expression of mOCLN-ÎN. Third, both full-length and truncated isoforms bind to NuMA and RAN, proteins important for spindle pole morphology and spindle integrity, structures that are altered by OCLN deficit. Together, these data provide compelling evidence for a role of full-length OCLN in mitotic spindle regulation and mitotic progression at a crucial stage in neural progenitor proliferation. Our data suggest thatÂ there is a âcritical periodâ of mOCLN-FL function in the developing cortical neuroepithelium and lasts through E12.5, spanning the period of the NE-to-RGC transition. The accrued reduction of the progenitor pool, by precocious differentiation and increased apoptosis, severely impacts subsequent neuronal differentiation, leading to cortex thinning by E16.5 and culminating in microcephaly by P7 and P20.</p><p>Faint, diffuse nuclear staining of OCLN was observed in some, but not all, of <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). While this may represent non-specific antibody labeling, a role for one or more OCLN isoforms in the nucleus cannot be ruled out at this time. Indeed, TJ proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 were found to localize to the nucleus in vitro in a cell-confluency-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gottardi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jaramillo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Traweger et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, it is interesting that previous proteomic studies probing for OCLN-associated proteins found that nuclear envelope protein Emerin pulled-down with OCLN in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fredriksson et al., 2015</xref>). Clarification of a possible nuclear function for OCLN awaits further study.</p><p>One prominent mechanistic model of microcephaly proposes that prolonged mitosis of ventricular neural progenitors will alter division outcomes of RGCs, promoting neuronal differentiation and apoptosis at the expense of the progenitor pool and so lead to microcephaly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pilaz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lizarraga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, our results indicate that mitosis is prolonged in both mouse <italic>Ocln</italic><sup>ÎN<italic>/</italic>ÎN</sup> cortex and human 3-D organoids from two independent (sg5 and sg11) genome-edited hESC lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and parallels the human microcephaly phenotype. Similar to the mouse data, loss of the hOCLN-wt, hOCLN-ex4del, and hOCLN-ex7ext isoforms in 3-D cultures resulted in premature neuronal differentiation at the expense of the progenitor pool. Unlike the mouse, HOPX<sup>+</sup> oRGs constitute the majority of the human neural progenitor populationÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LaMonica et al., 2012</xref>) and these were severely affected by OCLN loss in 3-D culture. The paucity of oRG cells in rodents likely contributes to the significant but milder degree of microcephaly in the mouse compared to human patients, who typically display occipital-frontal head circumferences atÂ ~4 standard deviations below the mean or smaller. Importantly, since organoids lack vasculature and inflammatory cells, the significant impact of these OCLN mutations on mitotic spindle integrity, proliferation and survival are shown to be independent of potential deleterious effects from impaired vascular neogenesis, perivascular extravasation and calcification. Finally, our results link OCLN function with mitotic and astral spindle integrity, likely in part through its interactions with proteins like NuMA and RAN. In the present study, astral spindle abnormalities associated with loss of full-length OCLN are consistent with an earlier observation that perturbations in astral spindles by disruption of LGN limited their reach to the apical and basal regions of the cellâs cortical actin meshwork, skewed the cleavage plane and increased the rate of asymmetric, neurogenic divisions of cortical progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mora-BermÃºdez et al., 2014</xref>). Spindle protein LGN is a well-known interaction partner of NuMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morin et al., 2007</xref>), which we show interacts with OCLN in neural progenitors. Together, these data illuminate a new role for OCLN in neurogenesis and survival with a specific requirement for full-length OCLN in the promotion of early progenitor self-renewal through proper neural stem cell mitotic spindle function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

centrosomes/mitotic spindles to regulate the neuroepithelial to radial glial cell transition in vivo in the mouse and in human ESC-derived cortical organoids. Previous work reported localization of OCLN to centrosomes and regulation of mitosis. A seminal finding of this study is the demonstration of the expression characteristics of full length (FL) OCLN and a truncated form lacking the portion encoded by exons 2 and 3. It is the loss of OCLN-FL that impairs cortical development. Presumably via its interaction with the mitotic spindle protein NuMa the investigators nicely show that OCLN functions to stabilize mitotic spindles and thereby impacts M-phase length, apoptosis, and importantly the proper balance between neural progenitor pool size and differentiated neurons.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tight junction protein occludin regulates progenitor self-renewal and survival in developing cortex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sarah Lutz (Reviewer #2), Leslie M Thompson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The results reported in this manuscript provide novel fundamental biological insight regarding the function of the protein OCLN that will be of broad interest for a readership focused on neurodevelopment. Mutations in OCLN, previously believed to be exclusively a tight-junction protein, result in microcephaly and cortical malformation. This study convincingly characterizes a previously unrecognized function for the tight junction protein Occludin (OCLN) at centrosomes/mitotic spindles to regulate the neuroepithelial to radial glial cell transition in vivo in the mouse and in human ESC-derived cortical organoids.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In Figure 2F â legend states that T-test was done. It is suggested that authors use ANOVA with posthoc for statistical analysis of multiple and timepoints groups.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>1) Figure 3F, the X axis should go from 0-100 and Figure 1A &quot;enlarged&quot; lacks a scale bar.</p><p>2) The Discussion could be more focused on the major contribution of this study, i.e. loss of OCLN-FL that impairs cortical development. In this light, what is known about the human OCLN mutations that cause microcephaly â are they consistent with the importance of OCLN-FL in cortical development? In addition, less space in the Discussion should be devoted to aspects of OCLN in tight junctions and role of truncated OCLN, points that are not addressed by data in this manuscript.</p><p>3) The authors interpret their data to suggest that the phenotypes they observe are due to loss-of-function caused by loss of full length OCLN. Could an alternative explanation be that some or all of those phenotypes are caused by or contributed to by gain-of-function of OCLN-ÎN?</p><p>4) The authors interpret previous results showing that &quot;<italic>Ocln</italic> mutant mice did not exhibit gross phenotypes that would be expected of impaired TJs&quot; to mean that &quot;OCLN plays no part in TJ maintenance or formation&quot;. Could an alternative explanation be that OCLN-ÎN is insufficient for TJ formation and maintenance? In general, it would be helpful for the authors to comment specifically about truncated forms of OCLN in both mouse and human and their roles. Especially since it is shown to be mainly nuclear localized and specifically localized at centrosomes.

The authors imply that the nuclear signal observed is accentuated at the higher magnification, however clear nuclear signal is present even at lower magnification, specifically in ÎN/ÎN animals at E10.5 (Figure 2C top left panel). Without proper controls (secondary antibody alone), the response that the nuclear signal (specifically in Figure 2C) is &quot;likely background&quot; cannot actually be verified. Additionally, the statement that nuclei void of OCLN staining in Figure 1 supports these claims cannot be verified â Figure 1 states that mAb and pAb against OCLN were used while Figure 2C states that an N-term OCLN antibody was used.

In this light, what is known about the human OCLN mutations that cause microcephaly â are they consistent with the importance of OCLN-FL in cortical development? In addition, less space in the Discussion should be devoted to aspects of OCLN in tight junctions and role of truncated OCLN, points that are not addressed by data in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agree that a more extensive discussion of the clinical importance of OCLN-FL is necessary â we have updated the discussion accordingly and have shortened the discussion regarding OCLN in the context of tight junctions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors interpret their data to suggest that the phenotypes they observe are due to loss-of-function caused by loss of full length OCLN. Could an alternative explanation be that some or all of those phenotypes are caused by or contributed to by gain-of-function of OCLN-ÎN?</p></disp-quote><p>While the observed phenotypes could be caused, in part, by a dominant negative effect of the truncated protein (OCLN-ÎN) rather than loss-of-function of full-length OCLN, this is unlikely for several reasons. First, this human disorder is associated in half of reported cases with autosomal recessively inherited, truncating mutations in exon 3, which speaks against a dominant negative effect of the truncated isoform, since heterozygous individuals are asymptomatic. Second, a number of reported insertion/deletion <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations causing BLC-PMG were found on exons 5, 6, or 7 that would result in loss-of-function of all OCLN isoforms. Third, there is no indication yet to suggest a genotype-phenotype correlation with clinical severity between the more proximal vs. distal <italic>OCLN</italic> mutations. Together these features strongly indicate that loss-of-function of full-length OCLN underlies the phenotypes observed in this study.</p><p>The Discussion section has been updated to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors interpret previous results showing that &quot;Ocln mutant mice did not exhibit gross phenotypes that would be expected of impaired TJs&quot; to mean that &quot;OCLN plays no part in TJ maintenance or formation&quot;. Could an alternative explanation be that OCLN-ÎN is insufficient for TJ formation and maintenance? In general, it would be helpful for the authors to comment specifically about truncated forms of OCLN in both mouse and human and their roles. Especially since it is shown to be mainly nuclear localized and specifically localized at centrosomes. The authors make a strong case for the full-length protein but a comment in the Discussion about the truncated version and its roles would be interesting to readers particularly if there are thoughts on whether full length is playing similar role at centrosome as truncated.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors did not intend to imply that OCLN plays no part in TJ maintenance or formation. In light of the observations that the OCLN-ÎN is continually expressed in the <italic>Ocln</italic> mouse mutant, a closer look at the role that this truncated isoform may play in TJ formation is warranted. The Discussion has been updated to clarify this point.</p><p>Very little is known regarding the function of OCLN-ÎN and other shorter isoforms. The data and results analyzed in this study revolve around the role of full-length OCLN. Based on recent reports of astral microtubule function and the astral microtubule disruption demonstrated here in cells lacking full-length OCLN, the authors suggest that this isoform is required for proper mitotic centrosomal positioning to ensure a near perpendicular cleavage plane of symmetrically dividing radial glial cells. The authors thought it best to minimize the amount of text dedicated to the presumed roles of truncated isoforms in the absence of data beyond OCLN-interaction with pericentrosomal matrix proteins NuMA and RAN. However, we fully support any future endeavors to tease out the role(s) of these truncated isoforms in neurodevelopment and neurovascular biology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Some OCLN staining presented throughout the manuscript was interpreted to be localization to the plasma membrane, but appears to also localize to the cytosol.
