Thus, X-ray irradiation of tissues composed of diverse cell types can have complex outcomes. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc, a relatively simple tissue composed mostly of epithelial cells. Transcriptomic clustering of cells collected from the wing disc generates clusters that are mainly grouped based on proximodistal cell location. To quantify heterogeneity of gene expression among clusters, we adapted a metric used to study market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Genes involved in DNA damage repair, defense against reactive oxygen species, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis are expressed relatively uniformly. In contrast, genes encoding a subset of ligands, notably cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway, some transcription factors, including <italic>Ets21C</italic>, previously implicated in regeneration, and several signaling proteins are expressed more regionally. Though the radiation-responsive transcription factor p53 is expressed relatively uniformly in the wing disc, several regionally induced genes still require p53 function, indicating that regional and radiation-induced factors combine to regulate their expression. We also examined heterogeneity within regions using a clustering approach based on cell cycle gene expression. A subpopulation of cells, characterized by high levels of <italic>tribbles</italic> expression, is amplified in irradiated discs. Remarkably, this subpopulation accounts for a considerable fraction of radiation-induced gene expression, indicating that cellular responses are non-uniform even within regions. Thus, both inter-regional and intra-regional heterogeneity are important features of tissue responses to X-ray radiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell RNAseq</kwd><kwd>X-ray irradiation</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>apoptosis</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04q48ey07</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122490</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hariharan</surname><given-names>Iswar K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021nxhr62</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cruz</surname><given-names>Joyner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Even in a simple epithelial tissue that is exposed uniformly to X-ray irradiation, cells show marked differences in their transcriptional response based on their location and cell-cycle status.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ionizing radiation (IR) is a damaging form of energy present in trace amounts in many environments and is commonly used at high doses in the form of X-rays to treat cancers. Worldwide, it is estimated that radiation therapy is an important component of treatment for more than 50% of cancers, including those that arise in the breast and lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Delaney et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhu et al., 2024</xref>). Even in the early years of radiation research, it became apparent that different types of cells varied considerably in their sensitivity to radiation. For example, lymphocytes were rapidly depleted from tissues following radiation, while tissues, such as the kidney and liver seemed far more resilient (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McBride and Schaue, 2020</xref>). In general, tissues that turnover rapidly are more sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McBride and Schaue, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, within tissues, stem cells are more sensitive than their differentiated progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fabbrizi et al., 2018</xref>), with the caveat that some types of adult stem cells, notably mesenchymal stem cells are relatively radioresistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2006</xref>). Even within tissues composed of relatively homogenous populations of cells, cells at particular stages of the cell cycle are more radiosensitive; mammalian cells seem most sensitive at G2/M, less so in G1 and least sensitive in late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pawlik and Keyomarsi, 2004</xref>). Additionally, cells that are more hypoxic tend to be radioresistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Withers, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jain, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Most of our mechanistic understanding of how cells react to ionizing radiation comes from genetic studies of the DNA damage response (DDR) in yeast and from biochemical studies of cultured mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harper and Elledge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pizzul et al., 2022</xref>). These studies have identified the sequence of biochemical reactions that are activated by double-stranded breaks in DNA and culminate in DNA damage repair. They have also highlighted the importance of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by ionizing radiation that contribute to the damage inflicted on cellular macromolecules. Importantly, cellular damage can result in the activation of mechanisms that arrest the cell cycle to enable a restoration of cellular homeostasis or, failing that, to activate pathways that promote apoptotic cell death. A key player in mammalian cells is the p53 protein which is stabilized following DNA damage and activates the transcription of genes that promote both cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Levine, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have made important contributions to our understanding of the deleterious effects of IR. Indeed, the discovery that X-rays generated mutations in a dose-dependent manner was first discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller, 1927</xref>). Subsequent genetic studies identified loci that made flies more susceptible to the effects of DNA-damaging agents; many of these genes encode proteins now known to function in the DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sekelsky, 2017</xref>). The wing imaginal disc, the larval precursor of the adult wings and part of the thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tripathi and Irvine, 2022</xref>), emerged as an attractive model for studying the effects of IR on a relatively simple tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haynie and Bryant, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James and Bryant, 1981</xref>). The wing disc derives from a precursor population of approximately 30 cells in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Worley et al., 2013</xref>) and, because of cell proliferation, is composed of more than 30,000 cells by the end of the larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín et al., 2009</xref>). Most of the wing disc is composed of epithelial cells and a small fraction of myoblasts which are precursors of the adult flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haynie and Bryant, 1977</xref> irradiated larval imaginal discs and used clone-marking techniques to show that IR at a dose of 1000 rad (10 Gy) kills 40–60% of cells and irradiation with 4000 rad kills approximately 85% of cells. Despite this, compensatory proliferation allowed for the development of wings of normal size and shape. In a study using gamma irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">James and Bryant, 1981</xref>), it was shown that cell death is observed as soon as 4 hr (hr) after irradiation and continues for up to 44 hr. In parallel, there is a dramatic decrease in the number of cells undergoing mitosis within 1 hr with a resumption after 8 hr. More recent studies using flow cytometry and FUCCI have shown that cells accumulate preferentially in the G2 phase of the cell cycle after irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Losada et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, as in mammalian cells, the two obvious cellular responses to IR are cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. A key difference, however, is that unlike in mammalian cells where p53 functions in both pathways, <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 promotes apoptosis but does not seem to function in arresting the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodsky et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ollmann et al., 2000</xref>). In <italic>p53</italic> mutants, the expression of genes that function in a wide variety of cellular responses to DNA damage is reduced, and apoptosis within 4 hr of exposure to IR does not occur. Instead, there is a delayed phase of cell death that involves multiple pathways and aneuploid cells persist in the tissue even into the pupal phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akdemir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wells et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wells and Johnston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wichmann et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Even in a relatively simple tissue, such as the wing disc, cells display considerable heterogeneity in their response to radiation. While high levels of cell death are observed in the wing pouch, the dorsal hinge shows reduced levels. The relative radioresistance of this region is dependent upon Wnt and STAT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). In more mature discs, more cell death is observed in the intervein regions of the pouch than in regions fated to generate veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moon et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, even in regions of the disc where there are no obvious morphological differences between cells, the response to radiation can differ considerably. Several studies have documented transcriptional changes at a genome-wide level in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akdemir et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kurtz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ogura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) and in imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ledru et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">van Bergeijk et al., 2012</xref> following irradiation. However, because these studies have prepared RNA either from whole embryos, entire discs, or from cells from specific regions without retaining the single-cell origin of transcripts, they cannot be used to assess the heterogeneity of transcriptional responses throughout the disc.</p><p>We and others have used single-cell transcriptomics to characterize differences in the transcriptome of cells from different parts of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everetts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zappia et al., 2020</xref>). Since the dominant sources of transcriptional variability between cells, or stratifying factors, reflect differences in cell location along the proximodistal (PD) axis, cells from different regions of the disc can easily be identified. Additionally, we and others have characterized transcriptional changes at the single-cell level after ablation of the wing pouch using the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ortholog <italic>eiger</italic> (<italic>egr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Floc’hlay et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Worley et al., 2022</xref>) and we have previously identified a pathway downstream of the Ets21C transcription factor that functions during regeneration but not during wing disc development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Worley et al., 2022</xref>). These studies provide a foundation for characterizing transcriptional responses of the wing disc to IR and to examine the level of transcriptional heterogeneity between cells.</p><p>Here, we present a comparison, at the single-cell level, of the transcriptomes of unirradiated and irradiated wing discs from late third-instar larvae. Our studies reveal heterogeneity at two different levels – between territories in the disc and between cells in individual territories. We show that regional heterogeneity is more a feature of some classes of genes over others and use quantitative approaches to investigate heterogeneity more generally.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>X-ray irradiation induces widespread DNA damage, but apoptosis and cell cycle arrest occur nonuniformly</title><p>The wing disc consists of three major regions that span its PD axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): The notum, which generates most of the adult thorax, the hinge, which develops into an adult structure of the same name that connects the wing blade to the thorax, and the pouch, which develops into the wing blade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Klein, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayala-Camargo et al., 2013</xref>). We first characterized the primary effects of X-rays on these regions. In order to confirm that X-rays induce DNA damage in each of the major PD regions, we used immunofluorescence to visualize phosphorylated histone H2Av (p-H2Av), a modified histone variant generated after DNA damage that serves as an early mark of double-strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madigan et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effects of X-ray irradiation on DNA damage, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon overlay of wing disc showing proximodistal (PD) regions.

Thirty minutes (min) after irradiation, a time point conducive to capturing an initial response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Madigan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Porrazzo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apostolou et al., 2025</xref>), we observed an increase in p-H2Av signal in each of the PD regions, with some inter-regional variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test for X-ray induced cell death, we performed immunofluorescence (IF) staining using an antibody that targets cleaved Dcp-1, an effector caspase that is active during apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Song et al., 1997</xref>). Unirradiated discs showed low levels of Dcp-1 signal, likely associated with normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Four hours (hr) after X-ray exposure, discs showed a marked increase in Dcp-1 signal in each of the major regions of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When compared to p-H2Av fluorescence, anti-DCP1 signal is less uniform. High levels of apoptosis were observed in the wing pouch, but cells along the dorsoventral boundary were spared. Additionally, apoptosis is reduced in portions of the wing hinge, as has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To examine the proliferative effects of X-ray exposure, we used IF against phosphohistone H3 (PHH3), a modified H3 histone state associated with chromatin condensation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hendzel et al., 1997</xref>). PHH3-stained chromosomes were observed across all regions of unirradiated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In irradiated discs, we observed a global reduction in the number of PHH3-stained chromosomes as soon as 15 min after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) with greater reduction at 2 and 4 hr after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>). This is consistent with prior observations that cells accumulate in G2 following IR exposure and fail to enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Song et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Losada et al., 2022</xref>). As an additional measure of proliferation, we visualized DNA synthesis using EdU labeling, where positive labeling is associated with an active S-Phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Salic and Mitchison, 2008</xref>). Like PHH3 staining, EdU labeling was observed in all regions of the tissue in unirradiated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Up to 2 hr after irradiation, the distribution of EdU labeling resembled that of unirradiated discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>), while at 4 hr after exposure, there was a consistent reduction in EdU labeling in the notum and pouch regions of the tissue, while the hinge was partially spared from this reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). The persistence of EdU incorporation in the hinge could either indicate that a proportion of cells in this region continue to enter S-phase or, alternatively, that there are higher levels of DNA synthesis related to DNA repair in this region. Taken together with previous studies, our observations indicate that different regions of the disc show differences in response to radiation both in terms of parameters related to cell cycle progression and to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cells of unirradiated and irradiated wing discs show similar patterns of expression of many regionally expressed genes</title><p>Since we have observed differences in cell death and DNA synthesis across the disc, it is likely that there are transcriptomic differences between regions. To explore changes in gene expression on a genome-wide basis across the disc, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Previous scRNA-seq studies of the disc have shown that genes with patterns of expression restricted to different regions of the PD axis can be used as markers to estimate the approximate anatomical location of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everetts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zappia et al., 2020</xref>).

For both samples, two replicates were collected. To generate datasets containing high-quality cells, several filtering steps were applied. In brief, cells that were positively stained with propidium iodide, indicating a compromised cell membrane, were removed via FACS. After sequencing, cells within each dataset that had low numbers of captured genes were removed from further analysis. While cells from all major PD regions of the disc were present in our analysis, our filtering approach presumably removed cells that were furthest along the pathway to cell death. Therefore, filtering our 4000 rad samples may have removed those cells which were most damaged by X-rays or were most sensitive to them resulting in an inherent bias in the type of cells that were analyzed. For analysis, all four datasets were integrated using Seurat v5’s anchor-based canonical correlation analysis (CCA) integration process (see Methods for details). Cells were grouped into clusters in the integrated dataset using the Louvain algorithm (default in Seurat v5) with a resolution parameter of 2, resulting in 35 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Each dataset was individually stratified across its PD axis, as well as when integrated, as indicated by a separation of PD markers between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–H</xref>). Clusters were classified as belonging to one of seven broad PD regions based on marker expression: the pouch, hinge-pouch, hinge, hinge-notum, notum, PE, and myoblasts. For the pouch, hinge-pouch, and hinge: <italic>nub+, zfh2-</italic> clusters were annotated as pouch, <italic>nub+, zfh2 +</italic> + clusters as hinge-pouch, and <italic>nub-, zfh2 +</italic> + as hinge.

The one <italic>twi</italic> + cluster was annotated as myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The classification of clusters into broad regions is imperfect, as there are some examples of clusters expressing moderate levels of individual marker genes belonging to the region that neighbors the one that they were classified into (e.g. <italic>zfh2</italic> is expressed at moderate levels in some cells belonging to pouch cluster 2, P2).</p><p>To identify unique cluster markers, we performed differential gene expression analysis on each individual cluster compared to all other clusters and compared to all other clusters within the same broad region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Unique markers indicated that some clusters likely correspond to contiguous places in the wing disc with regionally restricted gene expression of one or more genes, e.g., pouch cluster 5 (P5), marked by <italic>Optix,</italic> a gene restricted in expression to a small region of the anterior pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seimiya and Gehring, 2000</xref>). Other clusters likely correspond to non-contiguous regions in the wing disc with restricted gene expression of one or more genes, e.g., Pouch cluster 7 (P7), marked by <italic>Doc1</italic>, a gene expressed in two separate locations of the dorsal and ventral pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Butler et al., 2003</xref>) and by previous observations that cells from the anterior and posterior compartments can both be found in several clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bageritz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everetts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zappia et al., 2020</xref>). In two cases, clusters did not correspond to specific regions of restricted gene expression: pouch cluster 9 (P9), which was enriched for cells with S-phase markers, and pouch cluster 3 (P3), which was enriched in irradiated cells expressing the cell cycle gene <italic>tribbles (trbl</italic>) (later discussed at length).

There are a variety of ways that heterogeneity is quantified in economics and the social sciences (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steele et al., 2022</xref>). To quantify the heterogeneity of X-ray-induced genes across cell clusters, we implemented a variation of the formula used in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a measure of market concentration used in economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herfindahl, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirschman, 1945</xref>) (here used to measure the ‘concentration’ of gene expression across clusters). If the share of total expression in each cluster is calculated and if those numbers are simply all added, the overall total would be 1. If, however, the share of expression in each cluster is squared and then those numbers are added, the total would depend upon the distribution of expression between the clusters. If expression was distributed evenly among N clusters, then each cluster would have 1 /N of the total expression. In that case, the HHI would be 1 /N which is the lowest possible value. In contrast, if all expression was concentrated in one cluster, then the HHI would be 1, which would be the highest possible value and which would be indicative of maximal heterogeneity between clusters. To calculate the HHI score for a given gene, the average gene expression under the irradiated condition for each of the 35 clusters was individually divided by the sum of all average expressions across clusters, squared, and then added together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, formula on top). Thus, in the case of 35 clusters, the minimum possible score is 0.0286, and the maximum possible score is 1. We consider HHI scoring to be a useful heuristic method for ranking expression concentration in clustered data. HHI applied to clusters here, which are primarily defined by genes with spatially restricted expression, allows us to rank genes in terms of their spatial heterogeneity.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Heterogeneity of gene expression across the wing disc following radiation exposure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 521 genes across nine functional categories plotted as points by their HHI score at 4000 rad.

A small number of genes that encoded phosphatases, kinases, or receptors were also expressed relatively heterogeneously. Another way to visualize the relative heterogeneity of expression is to show the proportion of mRNA of each gene in each of the 35 clusters.

Importantly, irradiated discs with no induced <italic>dysf</italic> expression did show increased <italic>Ets21C</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> expression similar to those with X-ray-induced <italic>dysf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and I</xref>), supporting the fact that they weren’t excluded from X-ray exposure. These discs also displayed the developmentally regulated expression pattern of <italic>dysf</italic> present in unirradiated discs, indicating that the HCR probes used in this experiment were capable of detecting <italic>dysf</italic> RNA. The reason for the dramatic difference in <italic>dysf</italic> induction between subsets of discs is not known. From the scRNA-seq datasets, we know that X-ray-induced <italic>dysf</italic> is present in cells from both male and female larvae. One possible explanation is that discs may vary slightly in maturity and that <italic>dysf</italic> might simply not be induced in discs that are slightly more mature, as has been observed for several damage-responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, in those discs with additional <italic>dysf</italic> expression at 4000 rad, X-ray induced <italic>dysf</italic> RNA was localized to nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> for higher magnification). In contrast, the regions of <italic>dysf</italic> expression present at 0 rad had no discernible biased subcellular localization of the RNA in either condition.

Together, these results indicate that the pattern of <italic>dysf</italic> expression found in unperturbed wing discs is <italic>p53</italic> independent and the RNA is not restricted to the nucleus.

However, from prior studies, we know that there must be heterogeneity in cellular responses to radiation even within territories. This is because, at the dose of radiation used, some cells die while the remaining cells survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haynie and Bryant, 1977</xref>) and typically resume proliferation. It is likely that these two classes of cells are interspersed among each other. For clustering thus far, we have used Seurat v5’s standard pipeline, which calls upon the 2000 most variable genes in the dataset for clustering and dimensionality reduction, including UMAP. This results in clusters that are stratified based on the greatest sources of transcriptional variation at the global level. In the wing disc, the major sources of variation appear to be in genes that differ in expression along the PD axis, and thus the UMAP bears some similarities to the layout of the wing disc itself, where individual clusters are drawn from particular regions of the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In such an approach, cells that differ in response to radiation are likely to be found in each cluster.</p><p>We, therefore, considered other methods of clustering that might emphasize differences in transcriptional response that are not dependent upon the location of the cell within the disc. One approach would be to base the clustering on genes that are known to vary between cells in a location-independent manner. Our previous work has shown that in populations of relatively homogeneous cells, such as the myoblasts of the wing disc, cell cycle genes can drive cell clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Everetts et al., 2021</xref>), and IR is known to affect the distribution of cells within the cell cycle.</p><p>To explore the relationship between cell-cycle state and X-ray response in our data, we applied a cell-cycle-based clustering approach. We performed dimensionality reduction and clustering on a manually curated list of 175 cell-cycle genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). We note that separating cells into distinct phases of the cell cycle based on transcriptional profile alone is a notoriously difficult task for which several approaches have been developed (comprehensively reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guo and Chen, 2024</xref>). One type of approach, like the one used here, relies upon manually selected cell cycle marker genes to classify cells into different cell cycle phases. The 175 cell cycle genes used here are drawn from several sources (see methods) and represent our best guess at genes with core functions in different phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>For clustering, we applied the Louvain algorithm with a resolution parameter of 0.5, using the first 30 principal components (PCs, cell embeddings transformed with CCA-based integration) of the 175 cell cycle genes as variables, resulting in 6 total clusters.

For these plots, we used transformed HHI scores where the original HHI scores, which ranged from 1 /N to 1 (where N represents the number of clusters), were re-mapped to a range from 0 to 1. Importantly, the two parameters cannot be truly orthogonal since the cell cycle state likely makes some contribution to the clustering using the standard pipeline and because a cell’s location in the disc might affect its behavior with respect to the cell cycle. Additionally, the distribution of HHI scores with respect to any parameter changes with the number of clusters being analyzed - thus, the values on the two axes are not directly comparable. With these caveats in mind, these plots provide us with a sense of the extent of heterogeneity of expression that each gene displays when assessed in each of these two ways and allows us to compare the relative HHI scores of genes on each axis to each other.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HH)I scoring of categorical genes in standard clusters vs cell-cycle-based clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>I</bold>) Transformed HHI scores calculated using the 35 standard clusters (y-axis) and the six cell-cycle-based clusters (x-axis).

This applies at multiple levels – from molecules to cells. At the level of cells, even individual cells in microbial communities have considerable phenotypic diversity, especially in response to changes in environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Thus, it is likely that cells in mammalian tissues, which are often composed of many different types of cells, will display diverse responses to external stressors, such as ionizing radiation. Only recently have single-cell approaches been used to study the effects of ionizing radiation on complex tissues, for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mills et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morral et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mukherjee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sheng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yuan et al., 2023</xref>). These studies have mostly focused on changes in cellular composition following radiation, or on characterizing particular subpopulations of cells, rather than attempting to address the overall types of heterogeneity in IR response within and between cell types.</p><p>To make the study of heterogeneity of cellular responses to radiation more tractable, we have used a relatively simple and homogenous tissue, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc which is mostly composed of two different cell types (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tripathi and Irvine, 2022</xref>). Each wing disc is composed of a little over 30,000 epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Martín et al., 2009</xref>) and approximately 2500 myoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gunage et al., 2014</xref>). This has allowed us to look for differences in the way cells in different parts of the wing disc respond to radiation without the complication of diverse cell types. Our studies have uncovered two kinds of heterogeneity: inter-regional and intra-regional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Inter-regional heterogeneity is where some genes are upregulated far more in some territories of the wing disc than in others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Intra-regional heterogeneity is manifest in all major PD regions of the wing disc. Here, cells with different types of radiation-responsive transcriptomes are interspersed among each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Two types of heterogeneity following X-ray irradiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inter-regional heterogeneity.

To rank genes with respect to heterogeneity of expression between clusters, we have used the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is a simple mathematical tool most typically used by economists to study market concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herfindahl, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hirschman, 1945</xref>). This and other mathematical ways of calculating heterogeneity are summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Steele et al., 2022</xref>. In the context of our application, a low HHI score indicates a lower level of concentration or more homogenous expression, while a higher score indicates that most of the expression occurs in one or a few clusters. While the score of the index for any given gene is not particularly useful in isolation, ranking genes with the HHI has allowed us to identify those genes that are expressed more homogeneously among clusters as opposed to those that are expressed primarily in a few clusters. When we have used the conventional Seurat pipeline, a higher HHI score typically identifies genes that are expressed in a subset of territories in the wing disc, i.e., inter-regional heterogeneity. When applied to clusters generated using a curated set of cell cycle genes, a high HHI score indicates that a given gene is preferentially expressed in a subset of cells with a particular transcriptome state of cell cycle genes. This type of intra-regional heterogeneity is observed in all PD regions of the disc. Thus, these two types of heterogeneity can be shown simultaneously using a two-dimensional plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Given that the same tissue can be analyzed using a variety of cellular parameters (e.g. chromatin accessibility, proteomic approaches), cells can be clustered using each of these approaches, and an HHI score for each gene could be calculated with respect to that parameter. In principle, each gene could then be assigned a multi-dimensional HHI score that reflects its heterogeneity with respect to each parameter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Characterization of inter-regional heterogeneity</title><p>Since DNA damage, as assessed by p-H2Av immunofluorescence, is distributed throughout the disc, it is unsurprising that most genes upregulated in response to DNA damage are also expressed in most regions of the disc. These include genes encoding proteins that repair DNA damage, inactivate ROS, as well as those that regulate cell cycle responses and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. This also applies to the key transcription factor considered to regulate many of the transcriptional responses to DNA damage, p53. We find that heterogeneous expression with respect to geographical territories in the wing disc is most evident among genes encoding transcription factors and secreted ligands and is also found occasionally among receptors and signal transducers, such as kinases and phosphatases.</p><p>Why are these genes expressed heterogeneously? By manually inspecting gene expression, we find that in many cases, the expression pattern following irradiation is similar to that in unirradiated discs. Like our approach using the HHI, we have used a Euclidean distance measure in seven-dimensional space to rank the difference in expression pattern with respect to the seven major regions of the disc under the two conditions (unirradiated versus irradiated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Genes with an especially low Euclidean distance have more similar patterns of expression between the two conditions. Clear examples of this are <italic>dawdle</italic> (<italic>daw</italic>) which encodes a ligand for an activin receptor, and <italic>upd1</italic> which encodes a ligand upstream of the JAK/STAT pathway. Both genes have similar patterns of expression under the two conditions but are expressed at higher levels in the same regions after irradiation. Why might this happen? One possibility is that the increased expression of these genes requires both a region-specific transcription factor and a transcription factor induced by irradiation. An alternative possibility is that the chromatin state of such genes might reflect their pattern of expression in the unirradiated disc; a radiation-induced transcription factor might bind more readily to genes that already have more accessible chromatin. Both explanations are consistent with our observation that the non-uniform upregulation of several radiation-induced genes, including <italic>upd2</italic>, <italic>upd3,</italic> and <italic>Ets21C</italic> requires the function of <italic>p53,</italic> which is induced by X-ray irradiation yet expressed in all territories of the disc.</p><p>For genes, such as the JAK/STAT ligands <italic>upd2</italic> and <italic>upd3</italic>, expression is clearly non-uniform after radiation. Yet in the unirradiated condition, expression is minimally present or not detected. This pattern of induction is more difficult to explain. It is possible that <italic>upd2</italic> and <italic>upd3</italic> might be expressed at extremely low levels in unirradiated discs in patterns similar to their pattern of induction. Also possible is that the chromatin state of these genes, even if they are not expressed in the unirradiated disc, shows inter-regional heterogeneity. This non-uniform induction was also observed with the transcription factor <italic>Ets21C</italic>, which is known to be necessary for regeneration of the wing pouch after its ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Worley et al., 2022</xref>). Our identification of many genes that likely play an important role in IR response with inter-regional differences in their induction indicates that this phenomenon is relatively widespread and that its mechanistic basis merits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Intra-regional heterogeneity: cells with a particular cell cycle transcriptome have the highest levels of expression of damage-responsive genes after irradiation</title><p>Since the standard Seurat pipeline, when applied to the wing disc, generated clusters that most reflect a cell’s location in the wing disc, we tried alternative approaches that could separate cells into clusters that were agnostic to their location in the disc. Using a curated set of cell cycle genes, we were able to separate cells into six clusters. One cluster accounted for only 2% of cells in the unirradiated state but 18% of cells following irradiation. This cluster was marked by high expression of the <italic>trbl</italic> gene which encodes a pseudokinase that promotes the degradation of the Cdc25 ortholog String (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mata et al., 2000</xref>). Based on their transcriptome, cells in this cluster are likely to be in G2 and prevented from entering mitosis.</p><p>Unexpectedly, <italic>p53</italic>, as well as genes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and inactivation of ROS were all most highly expressed in this cluster at 4000 rad, as were the majority of radiation-induced genes. Thus, rather than being expressed uniformly in all cells, expression of many radiation-induced genes shows strong intra-regional heterogeneity with the highest expression found in a subpopulation that occupies a particular cell cycle transcriptome state. This same high-<italic>trbl</italic> cluster also expresses higher levels of the transcription factor <italic>Ets21C</italic> as well as genes encoding a variety of secreted ligands, such as <italic>Pvf2, upd2, upd3,</italic> and <italic>spz</italic>. Studies of regeneration in recent years have identified situations where subsets of cells function to organize regenerative proliferation by secreting factors that promote the survival and proliferation of other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aztekin et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, following ablation of the wing pouch, a localized subpopulation of cells likely arrested in G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosolo et al., 2019</xref>) promotes the proliferation of surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Worley et al., 2022</xref>). In the case of diffuse damage, such as that elicited by X-ray exposure, the analogous population of organizing cells could be dispersed throughout the disc and interspersed with other cells. Cells belonging to the high-<italic>trbl</italic> cluster could potentially represent such a population.</p><p>We have also shown that increasing <italic>trbl</italic> expression reduces the extent of apoptosis suggesting that the cells in the high-<italic>trbl</italic> cluster could also be more radioresistant. This is consistent with previous work that has shown that cells that seem stalled in G2 after exposure to the TNF ortholog <italic>egr</italic> are relatively resistant to JNK-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cosolo et al., 2019</xref>) and that reducing activity of <italic>string</italic>, which promotes G2/M progression, confers some level of protection from X-ray-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ruiz-Losada et al., 2022</xref>). We also found that increasing <italic>trbl</italic> expression did not increase the expression of two other HIX genes implying that other factors, that may or may not be cell-cycle dependent, are necessary for their upregulation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional consequences of heterogeneity</title><p>Many of the genes that display inter-regional heterogeneity have been implicated previously in regulating cell survival and proliferation, as well as in activating mechanisms that function during regeneration. These include the <italic>upd2</italic> and <italic>upd3</italic> genes, and the transcription factor <italic>Ets21C</italic>. Previous work has shown that a region of the wing disc, the dorsal hinge, is more resistant to apoptosis following irradiation, and that this resistance is dependent upon increased JAK/STAT signaling in that region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Verghese and Su, 2016</xref>). It is, therefore, likely that many of the examples that we have observed of inter-regional heterogeneity have functional consequences. A systematic disruption of all genes that display heterogeneous patterns of expression would give us a more complete view of this phenomenon.</p><p>The observation that the majority of HIX genes are most expressed in a subset of cells defined by the expression of particular cell cycle genes was an unexpected finding of our analysis. This could imply that cells must be in this state to most effectively turn on these genes. Alternatively, the suite of genes that are expressed most after irradiation could push the cells to a particular cell cycle state. Such a state might be more conducive to the repair of cellular damage and to promote local and systemic responses to radiation that facilitate recovery. Further study of this phenomenon could enable ways of using cell cycle manipulations to alter radiosensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our studies have focused on one time point at one developmental stage in a relatively simple tissue. The levels of heterogeneity that we have uncovered here suggest that heterogeneity in response to radiation must be far more widespread and complex in tissues, such as mammalian organs that are composed of many different types of cells. The approach and the methods of analysis used here should be applicable, with appropriate modifications, to these more complex situations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Oregon R</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">Stock #25211;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:BDSC_25211">BDSC_25211</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">p53[5 A-1-4]</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">Stock #6815;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:BDSC_6815">BDSC_6815</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">UAS-trbl</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">Stock #58493;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:BDSC_58493">BDSC_58493</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">UAS-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">Stock #4776;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:BDSC_4776">BDSC_4776</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">trbl-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="top">Stock #61654;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:BDSC_61654">BDSC_61654</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit anti-H2AvD-pS13<break/>(polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rockland</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #600-401-914;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_828383">AB_828383</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">(Dilution used = 1:250)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit anti-Dcp-1<break/>(polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #9578;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_2721060">AB_2721060</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">(Dilution used = 1:250)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit anti-PHH3<break/>(polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat #06–570;<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:AB_310177">AB_310177</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">(Dilution used = 1:500)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rat anti-Zfh2<break/>(polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Chris Doe;

After recovery, 9–15 larvae were picked and dissected in Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> Medium (Thermo Fisher 21720024) at room temperature. Discs were incubated in EdU for 30 min. After incubation, discs were fixed in 4% PFA for 15 min. The Click-iT EdU Cell Proliferation Kit, Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher C10340) reagents were used and protocol followed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In situ hybridization chain reaction</title><p>All larvae were reared at 25 °C. For each experiment, about 50 third instar larvae for each condition were placed into vials containing Bloomington formula food for irradiation. Half of the vials were then irradiated at a dose of 4000 rad while the other half were left outside of the irradiator. Larvae were given a 4 hr recovery time at 25 °C after irradiation before the beginning of the dissection period. Dissections took approximately 1 hr to complete, and carcasses were kept on ice until fixation. Our HCR protocol was adapted from Molecular Instruments for use on larval carcasses and used Molecular Instruments reagents. In brief, after fixing in 4% formaldehyde, samples were permeabilized in detergent solution and pre-hybridized in ‘Probe Hybridization Buffer’ for 30 min at 37 °C. After pre-hybridization, samples were incubated in a probe solution consisting of ‘Probe Hybridization Buffer’ and probe sets overnight (12–24 hr) at 37 °C. Probe sets for any given gene were made against mRNA sequences conserved between all predicted gene isoforms. Following hybridization, samples were washed using ‘Probe Wash Buffer’ and SSCTween. Samples were then pre-incubated in ‘Amplification Buffer’ for 30 min. After pre-incubation samples were left in hairpin solution consisting of ‘Amplification Buffer’ and hairpins in the dark at room temperature overnight (12–24 hr). Samples were then washed, incubated with DAPI, and mounted using Invitrogen’s Diamond Antifade Mountant. Slides were imaged using a confocal microscope and images were processed using Fiji. For image processing, a max-projection was generated of all images and the signal from each channel of the irradiated samples were auto-adjusted. These adjustments were propagated to all other wing-disc images of the same genotype.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Top markers for each cluster.</title><p>Contains the following columns (Column; description): Subregion; cluster name Marker_Integrated_Global; Top marker gene when comparing cluster to all other cells in the integrated data.

A key advance here is the focus on quantitatively expressing various measures of heterogeneity, leveraging single-cell RNAseq approaches. To achieve this goal, the manuscript creatively uses a metric from the social sciences called the HHI to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of expression of individual genes across the identified cell clusters. Inter- and intra-regional levels of heterogeneity are revealed. Some highlights include identification of spatial heterogeneity in expression of ligands and transcription factors after IR. Expression of some of these genes shows dependence on p53. An intriguing finding, made possible by using an alternative clustering method focusing on cell cycle progression, was the identification of a high-trbl subset of cells characterized by concordant expression of multiple apoptosis, DNA damage repair, ROS related genes, certain ligands and transcription factors, collectively representing HIX genes. This high-trbl set of cells may correspond to an IR-induced G2/M arrested cell state.</p><p>Overall, the data presented in the manuscript are of high quality but are largely descriptive.

By transferring larvae for 24 h from 18oC to 31oC, we were able to induce <italic>trbl</italic> expression in the wing pouch. When these larvae were irradiated at 4000 rad, we found reduced levels of apoptosis in the wing pouch of discs that overexpressed <italic>trbl</italic> (Figure 7-figure supplement 1). This indicated that upregulation of <italic>trbl</italic> is radioprotective. Consistent with our findings, others have previously shown that upregulation of <italic>trbl</italic> and stalling in the G2 phase of the cells cycle protects cells from JNK-induced apoptosis (Cosolo et al., 2019, PMID:30735120) or that downregulating the G2/M progression promoting factor <italic>string</italic> protects cells from X-ray radiation induced apoptosis (Ruiz-Losada et al., 2021, PMID:34824391).</p><p>As suggested by the Reviewing Editor, we also examined the effect of <italic>trbl</italic> overexpression on the induction of two “highly induced by X-ray irradiation (HIX)” gene, <italic>Swim</italic> and CG15784. Increasing <italic>trbl</italic> expression had no effect on the induction of <italic>Swim</italic> and only a modest decrease in the induction of CG15784 (Figure 7-figure supplement 2). Thus, increasing <italic>trbl</italic> expression, is in itself, insufficient to promote HIX gene expression indicating that other factors are necessary for HIX gene induction.</p><p>We also attempted to reduce <italic>trbl</italic> expression, using three different RNAi lines. While some of these lines have been used previously by others to reduce <italic>trbl</italic> expression under unirradiated conditions (Cosolo et al., 2019, PMID:30735120), we nevertheless wanted to check if they reduced <italic>trbl</italic> induction following irradiation. For each of the three lines, we observed no obvious reduction in <italic>trbl</italic> RNA following irradiation when visualized using HCR (Author response image 1). Thus, any effects on gene expression that we observe could not be attributed to a decrease in <italic>trbl</italic> expression. We have therefore included the images showing a lack of knockdown in this Response to Reviews document but not included these experiments in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RNA in situ hybridizations using the hybridization chain reaction performed using probes to <italic>trbl</italic>.</title><p>In A-F, the RNAi is expressed using <italic>nubbin-Gal4</italic>.

Since boosting this channel would make the signal from the channels more difficult to see, we left the images as they were.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3, Figure Supplement 2, panel B.

A key advance here is the focus on quantitatively expressing various measures of heterogeneity, leveraging single-cell RNAseq approaches. To achieve this goal, the manuscript creatively uses a metric from the social sciences called the HHI to quantify the spatial heterogeneity of expression of individual genes across the identified cell clusters. Inter- and intra-regional levels of heterogeneity are revealed. Some highlights include the identification of spatial heterogeneity in the expression of ligands and transcription factors after IR. Expression of some of these genes shows dependence on p53. An intriguing finding, made possible by using an alternative clustering method focusing on cell cycle progression, was the identification of a high-trbl subset of cells characterized by concordant expression of multiple apoptosis, DNA damage repair, ROS-related genes, certain ligands, and transcription factors, collectively representing HIX genes. This high-trbl set of cells may correspond to an IR-induced G2/M arrested cell state.</p><p>Overall, the data presented in the manuscript are of high quality but are largely descriptive. This study is therefore perceived as a resource that can serve as an inspiration for the field to carry out follow-up experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your assessment of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I suggest two major points for improvement:</p><p>(1) It is important to test whether manipulation of trbl levels (i.e., overexpression, knockdown, mutation) would result in measurable biological outcomes after IR, such as altered HIX gene expression, altered cell cycle progression, or both. This may help disentangle the question of whether high trbl expression and correlated HIX gene expression are a cause or consequence of G2/M stalling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have described these experiments at the beginning of this Response to Reviews document when addressing the comments made by the Reviewing Editor. Please see Figure 7, figure supplements 1 and 2. These experiments suggest that upregulation of <italic>trbl</italic> offers some protection from radiation-induced death, yet it is itself insufficient to induce expression of two HIX genes tested. As we have also described earlier, three different RNAi lines tested did not reduce <italic>trbl</italic> upregulation after irradiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A more extensive characterization of the high-trbl cell state would also be appropriate, particularly in terms of their relationship to the cell cycle.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to address this issue in two ways. First, we used the expression of a <italic>trbl-gfp</italic> transgene and RNA in-situ hybridization experiments to visualize the distribution of the high-<italic>trbl</italic> cells (shown in new manuscript figure, Figure 6-figure supplement 3). When examining <italic>trbl</italic> RNA in irradiated discs, there is no obvious demarcation between cells that express high levels of <italic>trbl</italic> and other cells. This is also apparent in the UMAP shown in Figure 6A and A’. Most cells seem to express <italic>trbl</italic>; cells in the “high <italic>trbl</italic>” cluster simply express more <italic>trbl</italic> than others. We observed cells expressing <italic>trbl</italic> and <italic>PCNA</italic> as well as cells expressing only one of those two genes at detectable levels. Thus, it was not possible to distinguish the “high <italic>trbl</italic>” cells from other cells by this approach.</p><p>We decided instead to focus on examining the expression of other cell-cycle genes in the high-<italic>trbl</italic> cluster. We have added a paragraph in the Results section that details our findings. Many transcriptional changes are indeed consistent with stalling in G2 such as high levels of <italic>trbl</italic> and low levels of <italic>string</italic> (stg). Additionally, that the cells are likely in G2 is consistent with reduced levels of genes that are normally expressed at other stages of the cell cycle: G1 genes such as <italic>E2f1</italic> and <italic>Dp,</italic> S-phase genes such as several Mcm genes, <italic>PCNA</italic> and <italic>RnrS,</italic> and genes that encode mitotic proteins such as <italic>polo</italic>, <italic>Incenp</italic> and <italic>claspin</italic>. There are however, several anomalies such as slightly increased expression of the early-G1 cyclin, <italic>CycD</italic>, and the retinoblastoma ortholog <italic>Rbf</italic>. Thus, at least as assessed by the transcriptome, this cluster may not correspond to a cell state that is found under normal physiological conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Minor: p. 12, line 3. Figure 5A is mentioned, but it seems that it should be 4A instead.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have addressed this in our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the manuscript makes a compelling case for heterogeneity in gene expression changes that occur in response to uniform induction of damage by X-rays in a single-layer epithelium. This is an important finding that would be of interest to researchers in the field of DNA damage responses, regeneration, and development.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This work would be more useful to the field if the authors could provide a more comprehensive discussion of both the impact and the limitations of their findings, as explained below.</p><p>Propidium iodide staining was used as a quality control step to exclude cells with a compromised cell membrane. But this would exclude dead/dying cells that result from irradiation. What fraction of the total do these cells represent? Based on the literature, including works cited by the authors, up to 85% of cells die at 4000R, but this likely happens over a longer period than 4 hours after irradiation. Even if only half of the 85% are PI-positive by 4 hr, this still removes about 40% of the cell population from analysis. The remaining cells that manage to stay alive (excluding PI) at 4 hours and included in the analysis may or may not be representative of the whole disc. More relevant time points that anticipate apoptosis at 4 hr may be 2 hr after irradiation, at which time pro-apoptotic gene expression peaks (Wichmann 2006). Can the authors rule out the possibility that there is heterogeneity in apoptosis gene expression, but cells with higher expression are dead by 4 hours, and what is left behind (and analyzed in this study) may be the ones with more uniform, lower expression? I am not asking the authors to redo the study with a shorter time point, but to incorporate the known schedule of events into their data interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these important comments. The generation of single-cell RNA-seq data from irradiated cells is tricky. Many cells have already died. Even those that do not incorporate propidium iodide are likely in early stages of apoptosis or are physiologically unhealthy and likely made it through our FACS filters. Indeed, in irradiated samples up to 57% of sequenced cells were not included in our analysis since their RNA content seemed to be of low quality. It is therefore likely that our data are biased towards cells that are less damaged. As advised by the reviewer, we will include a clearer discussion of these issues as well as the time course of events and how our analysis captures RNA levels only at a single time point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If cluster 3 is G1/S, cluster 5 is late S/G2, and cluster 4 is G2/M, what are clusters 0, 1, and 2 that collectively account for more than half of the cells in the wing disc? Are the proportions of clusters 3, 4, and 5 in agreement with prior studies that used FACS to quantify wing disc cells according to cell cycle stage?</p></disp-quote><p>Work by others (Ruiz-Losada et al., 2021, PMID:34824391) has shown that almost 80% of cells have a 4C DNA content 4 h after 4,000 rad X-ray irradiation. The high-<italic>trbl</italic> cluster accounts for only 18% of cells and can therefore account for a minority of cells with a 4C DNA content.</p><p>Thus clusters 0, 1 and 2 could potentially contain other populations that also have a 4C DNA content. Importantly, similar proportions of cells in these clusters are also observed in unirradiated discs.</p><p>We expect that clusters 1 and 2 are largely comprised of cells in G2/M. Together, these clusters are marked by some genes previously found to be higher in FACS separated G2 cells compared to G1 cells (Liang et al., 2014, PMID: 24684830). These genes include <italic>Det, aurA,</italic> and <italic>ana1</italic>. Strangely, cluster 0 is not strongly marked by any of the 175 cell cycle genes used in our clustering (<italic>eff</italic> being the strongest marker) and has a lower-than-average expression of 165/175 cell cycle genes. Cluster 0 is however marked by the genes <italic>ac</italic> and <italic>sc</italic>, which are known to be expressed in proneuronal cell clusters interspersed throughout the disc that stall in G2 and form mitotically quiescent domains (Usui &amp; Kimura 1992, Development, 116 (1992), pp. 601-610 (no PMID); Nègre et al., 2003, PMID: 12559497). Given these observations, we hypothesize that cluster 0 is largely comprised of stalled G2 cells like those found in ac/sc-expressing proneural clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The EdU data in Figure 1 is very interesting, especially the persistence in the hinge. The authors speculate that this may be due to cells staying in S phase or performing a higher level of repair-related DNA synthesis. If so, wouldn't you expect 'High PCNA' cells to overlap with the hinge clusters in Figures 6G-G'? Again, no new experiments are needed. Just a more thorough discussion of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have found that the locations of elevated PCNA expression do not always correlate with the location of EdU incorporation either by examining scRNA-seq data or by using HCR to detect PCNA. PCNA expression is far more widespread as we now show in Figure 6-figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Trbl/G2/M cluster shows Ets21C induction, while the pattern of Ets21C induction as detected by HCR in Figures 5H-I appears in localized clusters. I thought G2/M cells are not spatially confined. Are Ets21C+ cells in Figure 5 in G2/M? Can the overlap be confirmed, for example, by co-staining for Trbl or a G2/M marker with Ets21C?</p></disp-quote><p>The data show that the high-<italic>trbl</italic> cells are higher in <italic>Ets21C</italic> transcripts relative to other cell-cycle-based clusters after irradiation. This does not imply that high-<italic>trbl</italic>-cells in all regions of the disc upregulate <italic>Ets21C</italic> equally. <italic>Ets21C</italic> expression is likely heterogeneous in both ways – by location in the disc and by cell-cycle state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Induction of dysf in some but not all discs is interesting. What were the proportions? Any possibility of a sex-linked induction that can be addressed by separating male and female larvae?</p></disp-quote><p>We can separate the cells in our dataset into male and female cells by expression of <italic>lncRNA:roX1/2.</italic> When we do this, we see X-ray induced <italic>dysf</italic> expressed similarly in both male and female cells. We think that it is therefore unlikely that this difference in expression can be attributed to cell sex. Another possibility is that <italic>dysf</italic> upregulation might be acutely sensitive to the developmental stage of the disc. This would require experiments with very precisely-staged larvae. We have not investigated this further as it is not a central issue in our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Please check the color-coding in Figure 1A.
