Of all cellular macromolecules, the bacterial proteome is by far the most important resource and its size is limited. Here, we investigated how the highly versatile 'knallgas' bacterium <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> reallocates protein resources when grown on different limiting substrates and with different growth rates. We determined protein quantity by mass spectrometry and estimated enzyme utilization by resource balance analysis modeling. We found that <italic>C. necator</italic> invests a large fraction of its proteome in functions that are hardly utilized. Of the enzymes that are utilized, many are present in excess abundance. One prominent example is the strong expression of CBB cycle genes such as Rubisco during growth on fructose. Modeling and mutant competition experiments suggest that CO<sub>2</sub>-reassimilation through Rubisco does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth, but is rather an investment in readiness for autotrophy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Cupriavidus necator</kwd><kwd>Ralstonia eutropha</kwd><kwd>resource balance analysis</kwd><kwd>substrate limitation</kwd><kwd>co2 fixation</kwd><kwd>gene fitness</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-06160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crang</surname><given-names>Nick</given-names></name><name><surname>Kimler</surname><given-names>Kyle</given-names></name><name><surname>Asplund-Samuelsson</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-01491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001862</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council Formas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015-939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jahn</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF20OC0061469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Janasch</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name><name><surname>Hudson</surname><given-names>Elton Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proteomics and metabolic modeling revealed that the 'knallgas' bacterium <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> utilizes only a fraction of its proteome and keeps large enzyme reserves as an adaption to variable environments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> (formerly <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic>) is a model aerobic lithoautotroph and formatotroph, and is notable for production of the storage polymer polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yishai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brigham, 2019</xref>). <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 (hereafter abbreviated <italic>C. necator</italic>) is a soil-dwelling bacterium with a large genome (~6600 genes) distributed on two chromosomes and one megaplasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pohlmann et al., 2006</xref>). It features a wide arsenal of metabolic pathways for xenobiotics degradation, hydrogen and formate oxidation, carbon fixation via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle, and utilization of nitrate/nitrite as alternative electron acceptors (de-nitrification; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cramm, 2009</xref>). Several operons for substrate assimilation are present in multiple copies, often on different chromosomes (e.g. <italic>cbb</italic> operon, hydrogenases, formate dehydrogenases). A detailed reconstruction of its metabolic network suggested that it can metabolize 229 compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>C. necator</italic> prefers organic acids as growth substrate over sugars. The only sugars that support growth are fructose and N-acetylglucosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cramm, 2009</xref>), which are metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alagesan et al., 2017</xref>). Although the metabolic versatility of <italic>C. necator</italic> is interesting from a biotechnological point of view, this benefit could come at a considerable cost for the cell. For example, it is not known if the expression of the various substrate assimilation pathways is efficiently regulated under different conditions, and if gene expression is optimal to maximize growth or rather another trait such as environmental readiness. The 'cellular economy' concept entails that an organism has a limited pool of (enzyme) resources and must re-allocate resources to different functions in order to meet the current environmental needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molenaar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui et al., 2015</xref>). A prime example is the switch from energy-efficient, high-enzyme-cost respiration to energy-inefficient, but low-enzyme-cost fermentation during overflow metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basan et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>). The protein economy has been studied experimentally and with dedicated metabolic models in heterotrophic microorganisms like <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Brien et al., 2016</xref>) and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metzl-Raz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>). More recently, resource allocation was studied in photoautotrophic bacteria (<italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zavřel et al., 2019</xref>). There, a large investment in the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation (2–7% protein mass is Rubisco) and photosynthesis machinery (20–40% protein mass are antennae and photosystems) may reduce proteome space for ribosomes, resulting in lower growth rates than heterotrophs.</p><p>Previous studies of <italic>C. necator</italic> grown in different trophic conditions have shown that gene expression is regulated in a condition-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwartz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kohlmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kohlmann et al., 2014</xref>). For example, CBB cycle genes are strongly expressed during autotrophic growth but were also upregulated on fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>), prompting the question of whether such expression confers any evolutionary advantage. To date, protein allocation and utilization has not been investigated. It is unclear if and how <italic>C. necator</italic> would reallocate protein resources when confronted with different types or degrees of substrate limitation, or to what extent a versatile soil bacterium would express unutilized or underutilized proteins. To address these questions, we designed a multivariate set of growth experiments. <italic>C. necator</italic> was cultivated in bioreactors at steady state conditions using four limiting substrates and five different growth rates. We quantified the cellular proteome using LC-MS/MS and trained a genome-scale resource allocation model with our data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulović et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goelzer et al., 2015</xref>). We found that <italic>C. necator</italic> allocates its resources in response to the imposed environmental challenges, but invests more than 40 % of its protein mass in genes that are either unlikely to be utilized or have no known function. Enzyme utilization in the central carbon metabolism was markedly different between pathways, with enzymes in the proximity of substrate assimilation (upper glycolysis, CBB cycle) showing higher variability, higher absolute abundance, and higher utilization than enzymes involved in supply of biomass precursors (tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle, pyruvate metabolism). CO<sub>2</sub>-assimilation enzymes expressed in heterotrophic growth regimes were unlikely to provide a fitness benefit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>C. necator</italic> expresses most of its annotated genes</title><p>In order to access cellular states that were optimally acclimated to a nutrient limitation, we cultivated <italic>C. necator</italic> in chemostat bioreactors. We selected four limiting growth substrates as interesting entry points to metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Fructose was chosen as a glycolytic substrate because <italic>C. necator</italic> does not naturally utilize glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orita et al., 2012</xref>). It is taken up via a specific ABC transporter and metabolized in the ED pathway. Succinate was chosen as an entry point to the TCA cycle. Formate was chosen because formatotrophic growth closely resembles lithoautotrophic growth regarding the utilized enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cramm, 2009</xref>). Formate (COOH<sup>-</sup>) is first oxidized by formate dehydrogenases (FDH) to CO<sub>2</sub> with simultaneous reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH. The CO<sub>2</sub> is then fixed via the CBB cycle. Finally, growth on fructose with limiting ammonium was chosen as we expected a dedicated response to N-limitation by adjustment of gene expression and flux ratios between different pathways. For each limitation, four independent bioreactor cultivations were performed with dilution rate (equalling growth rate µ) increasing step-wise from 0.05 to 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, and 0.25 hr<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and subsequent sampling for proteomics. The substrate limitation in chemostats was verified by determining the residual carbon concentration in culture supernatants using HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). For ammonium limitation, a high concentration of residual fructose was determined, as expected when nitrogen is limiting. All other conditions showed no or very low concentration of residual substrate. Quantification of dry cell weight (DCW) and PHB content revealed that only ammonium-limited cells produced a significant amount of PHB, approximately 80 % of total biomass for the strongest limitation (µ = 0.05 hr<sup>–1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>C. necator</italic> expresses most of its annotated genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Four different limitations were chosen covering different entry points to central metabolism.

We employed a label-free quantification strategy with a feature propagation approach, allowing us to significantly increase the coverage of protein quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Weisser and Choudhary, 2017</xref>). More than 4000 proteins were quantified in each individual sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Altogether, 5357 proteins out of 6614 annotated genes were quantified in at least one condition (81.0 %), and 4260 proteins were quantified with at least two peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The proteomics data can be accessed through an interactive web application at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://m-jahn.shinyapps.io/ShinyProt">https://m-jahn.shinyapps.io/ShinyProt</ext-link>. Based on the distribution of protein abundance 99 % of the proteome by mass was quantified. An analysis of sample similarity based on expression revealed that low growth rates are more similar to each other, and that growth on formate is most unlike the other conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Gene expression in terms of proteome mass fraction was unequally distributed over the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>): 78.7 % of protein mass was encoded by chromosome 1, 16.4 % encoded by chromosome 2, and 5.4 % by pHG1. Chromosome 2 and pHG1 thus encode predominantly specialized functions, as predicted by <italic>in silico</italic> analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pohlmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricke et al., 2009</xref>). On chromosome 2, highly expressed genes were the <italic>cbb</italic> operon (CBB Cycle, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>), glycolysis-related genes (<italic>pgi, zwf</italic>), and the methionine synthase <italic>metE</italic>. On pHG1, highly expressed were the second copy of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon as well as <italic>hox</italic>/<italic>hyp</italic> operons (soluble and membrane bound hydrogenases, up to 3 % of proteome by mass). The majority of pHG1 encoded protein mass is therefore related to autotrophic growth. Note that the two copies of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon are 99 % identical on amino acid sequence level and can not be distinguished well by LC-MS/MS (abundance of ambiguous peptides was allocated to both copies). Promoter activity studies have shown that expression levels from both operons were similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2017</xref>). As we also cultivated <italic>C. necator</italic> on formate, we were interested in the expression of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). <italic>C. necator</italic> is equipped with two types of FDH, soluble S-FDH (operons <italic>fds</italic> and <italic>fdw</italic> on chromosome 1 and 2, respectively) and membrane-bound M-FDH (<italic>fdo</italic> and <italic>fdh</italic> operons, the latter present in two copies on chromosome 1 and 2, respectively).

The RBA model predicts optimal flux distributions as in flux balance analysis (FBA), but also takes kinetic parameters and enzyme abundance into account (Materials and methods). DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein folding were included as lumped reactions (macromolecular machines) with protein subunit composition and rate estimates taken from the literature (Materials and methods). Each enzyme or macromolecular machine imparts a protein cost, with the total protein pool being limited. RBA models can predict trade-offs between high- and low-enzyme-cost pathways, increase of ribosome abundance with growth rate, and upper boundaries on growth in substrate-replete conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goelzer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sánchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salvy and Hatzimanikatis, 2020</xref>). The <italic>C. necator</italic> RBA model was constrained using a set of parameters obtained from proteomics data, the UniProt database, and literature (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A critical parameter for RBA is the enzyme efficiency <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> of each reaction, which links the reaction rate to the abundance of its catalyzing enzyme. These were obtained by estimating the metabolic flux boundaries per reaction (using flux sampling), and then dividing maximal flux by unit enzyme allocated to the reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goelzer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidi and Milo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulović et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>We used the constrained resource allocation model to analyze the non-utilized and the under-utilized fraction of the <italic>C. necator</italic> proteome. The non-utilized proteome fraction consists of enzymes that do not carry flux in any of the tested conditions. To quantify this fraction, we performed a series of RBA model simulations corresponding to the experimental conditions of the chemostats. The model predicted optimal flux distribution and enzyme abundance to maximize growth rate for each of the four different substrate limitations. The model was generally able to reproduce experimentally determined protein allocation using fitted (optimal) <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, these simulations may predict one out of many possible solutions to the protein allocation problem. In order to estimate the total number of usable reactions independent from the optimal set of <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic>, we performed 200 simulations per substrate limitation where <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> was randomly sampled from the <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> distribution. This converged to maximally 550 utilized reactions per condition. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In total, 587 of 1360 reactions were utilized at least once in all simulations, 280 reactions were used in all simulations on all substrates (core reactions), and 28 reactions were used in only one particular limitation. We mapped the <italic>C. necator</italic> proteome quantification data onto RBA model reactions to categorize proteins as: (1) not included in the model, (2) included but non-utilized enzymes, (3) utilized enzymes, and (4) utilized machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The non-modeled proteome fraction comprised on average 38 % of the proteome mass (0.26 g/gDCW, 4041 proteins), and was slightly dependent on condition. Non-utilized enzymes were low-abundant in mass (0.03 g/gDCW, 400 proteins) compared to the utilized enzyme fraction (0.27 g/gDCW, 823 proteins). Macromolecular machinery averaged 0.12 g/gDCW for 93 annotated proteins. Non-utilized enzymes were not enriched in a particular functional category, while the non-modeled protein fraction was enriched in functions for transport, transcription (factors), and post-translational modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). A large group of proteins has no annotated function. Taking non-modeled and non-utilized proteins together, 43 % of the <italic>C. necator</italic> proteome (by mass) is unlikely to be utilized in the tested conditions, or involved in processes not covered by the RBA model. We also estimated the protein mass encoded by essential genes per utilization category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, shaded area). Gene essentiality was determined by sequencing a randomly barcoded transposon library with 60,000 mutants after growth on rich medium (RB-TnSeq workflow) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>). Transposon insertion density of a gene was used to sort it into one of three different categories, 'essential' (496 genes), 'probably essential' (149), or 'non-essential' (4,712). On average, 47 % of utilized enzymes (by mass) were encoded by essential genes, while only 19 % and 3 % of the non-modeled and non-utilized protein mass, respectively, was essential. Based on the calculated large fraction of non-modeled and non-utilized proteome, and the observation that approximately half of the enzyme mass is non-essential, we conclude that a large portion of the <italic>C. necator</italic> proteome is associated with nutrient scavenging and regulatory adaptation to new environments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The non-modeled and non-utilized proteome of <italic>C.</italic> <italic>necator</italic> is related to environmental readiness.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A series of model simulations was conducted with randomly sampled enzyme efficiency k<sub>app</sub> (n = 200) to obtain the maximum number of potentially utilized reactions in each growth condition.

Under steady-state conditions, optimal gene expression would adjust enzyme abundance proportional to the flux that it is supposed to carry (metabolic demand), keeping utilization of the enzyme constant. If enzyme abundance and flux do not change proportionally between different conditions or growth rates, utilization changes. To estimate the degree of utilization, we compared experimental protein allocation to model predictions at different growth rates. The RBA model predicts the minimal required enzyme abundance to drive a metabolic reaction, assuming full substrate saturation of the enzyme.

Only two of these, ribosomes and chaperones, had a considerable protein mass allocated to them. The abundance of ribosomal proteins increased linearly with growth rate, as observed in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peebo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>). The RBA model simulations accurately predicted expansion of ribosomes with increasing growth rate, but failed to predict incomplete reduction of ribosomes at low growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This can be explained by the evolutionary benefit that cells gain from keeping a ribosome reserve for nutrient upshifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori et al., 2017</xref>). The ribosome reserve led to a decrease in utilization at low growth rate regardless of the limiting substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined metabolic enzyme utilization by comparing experimental and simulated protein abundance. All metabolic reactions/enzymes of the RBA model that had associated proteins quantified by MS were included in the analysis (n = 1012). For each enzyme, the average utilization in the four limiting conditions (µ = 0.25 hr<sup>–1</sup>) was determined, and then used to group enzymes into three categories: low ( ≤ 33 %, n = 710), moderate (33–66 %, n = 153) and high utilization ( &gt; 66 %, n = 149). Highly utilized enzymes are therefore predominantly enzymes utilized in several of the four limiting conditions. There were significant differences between these three groups: Highly utilized enzymes were on average more abundant in terms of protein mass (g/gDCW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also calculated variability in enzyme abundance by determining the coefficient of variation (CV) of allocated protein mass across the four different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For example, formate dehydrogenase (FDH) was strongly expressed in only one out of four conditions (growth on formate) and therefore showed high variability (CV = 1.25), and low average utilization (23 %). Altogether, variability was significantly lower for moderately and highly utilized enzymes. These observations support the notion that <italic>C. necator</italic> optimizes the cost-benefit ratio of gene expression by keeping utilization high for highly abundant enzymes. Similarly, low variation in gene expression of highly utilized enzymes could provide a fitness benefit in conditions changing on a short time scale. Constitutive expression of such genes can buffer substrate and metabolite surges. Finally, we wondered if utilization of enzymes is also correlated to essentiality of the associated gene(s) as determined by RB-TnSeq from our transposon mutant library. Enzymes were sorted into, 'essential', 'probably essential', or 'non-essential' based on the essentiality of their associated genes (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

The enzymes in upper glycolysis (PGK, GAPDH, FBA, FBP) and the CBB cycle showed a clear condition-dependent trend, with high expression and utilization on formate, and low expression and utilization on succinate. The enzymes of lower glycolysis (PGM, ENO, PYK, PDH) showed low expression, low variability and moderate to high utilization in all conditions, clearly distinct from the enzymes in upper glycolysis. This trend continued with reactions down-stream of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, such as the reactions of pyruvate metabolism and the TCA cycle (low, invariable expression). The ED pathway was only expressed and utilized when fructose was used as carbon source. Gene expression regulation in <italic>C. necator</italic> is thus hierarchically organized: Enzymes close to the entry point of substrates into central metabolism are expressed 'on demand', and show high variability, high absolute abundance, and high utilization in some growth regimes. Enzymes downstream of substrate assimilation show lower expression and variability, perhaps owing to their universal role in providing biomass precursors (TCA, pyruvate metabolism). A lower protein investment per catalytic activity allows for larger reserves of these enzymes. The low utilization of many TCA and pyruvate metabolism enzymes may provide a benefit for robustness by avoiding full saturation. We also inspected the enzymes of the PHB biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), Acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (<italic>phaA</italic>), Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (<italic>phaB</italic>), and PHB synthase (<italic>phaC</italic>). <italic>PhaA</italic> and <italic>phaB</italic> were highly abundant while <italic>phaC</italic> abundance was comparatively low.

While phosphoribulokinase (PRUK) and Rubisco (RBPC) are specific for the purpose of CO<sub>2</sub>-fixation, the other enzymes overlap with sugar phosphate metabolism (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway) providing precursors that are essential for growth. We wondered if the expression of these enzymes is optimally regulated based on the metabolic demands of the four different substrate limitations. We compared the predicted (optimal) abundance with the experimentally measured abundance for important enzymes of the CBB cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Rubisco was highly abundant even during growth on fructose where the model did not predict flux through the CBB cycle (up to 0.02 g/gDCW or 3 % of the proteome by mass).

We conclude that <italic>C. necator</italic> keeps large amounts of underutilized CBB enzymes (0.024–0.04 g/gDCW, or 3.5 % to 5.9 % of the proteome depending on substrate) whose abundance is not warranted by the expected fluxes from glycolysis/gluconeogenesis or nucleotide biosynthesis.

Phosphoglycolate salvage becomes necessary when the intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentration is low and the Rubisco oxygenation reaction is more prominent, producing 2-PGly.

Knock out of Rubisco reduced PHB yield on fructose by 20 % during nitrogen starvation. We wondered if activity of the CBB cycle could improve total carbon yield (biomass including PHB) at the cost of lower growth rate, representing a yield-growth rate trade-off. To test if reassimilation of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> improves carbon yield, we performed RBA model simulations on fructose and forced flux through Rubisco (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-F</xref>). We simulated five different CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates (0–5 mmol gDCW<sup>–1</sup> hr<sup>–1</sup>) at a fructose uptake rate of 4.0 mmol gDCW<sup>–1</sup> hr<sup>–1</sup>. However, neither biomass yield nor growth rate was improved in any of the simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). Metabolic flux was diverted from the ED pathway towards the non-oxidative PPP in order to provide ribulose-5-phosphate precursors for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Simultaneously, the high energy requirement for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation led to higher flux through the TCA cycle in order to generate additional NADH and ATP.

Simulations suggested instead that the cells emit more CO<sub>2</sub> when CO<sub>2</sub> fixation is enforced, an apparent paradox caused by the lack of additional energy. This can also be inferred from the similar degree of reduction for fructose and biomass (4.0 and 4.12 per C-mol, respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shuler and Kargi, 2002</xref>), leaving no extra redox power for gratuitous CO<sub>2</sub> reassimilation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Reassimilation of CO<sub>2</sub> is unlikely to provide a fitness benefit on fructose.</title><p>RBA model simulations were performed for a fixed fructose uptake rate combined with five different CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rates.

To this end, the barcoded transposon library (pool of 60,000 mutants) was cultivated in fructose-, succinate-, and formate-limited chemostat bioreactors (dilution rate of 0.1 hr<sup>–1</sup>). The continuous feed fixes the growth rate and selects cells with higher substrate affinity or biomass yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wides and Milo, 2018</xref>). The composition of the mutant pool was checked after 8 and 16 generations of growth using next-generation sequencing. The fitness contribution of each gene was estimated by the degree of enrichment or depletion of mutants over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref>). Surprisingly, fitness of <italic>cbb</italic> mutants was largely unchanged, even during growth on formate where the activity of the CBB cycle is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results show that knockout of <italic>cbb</italic> genes are fully compensated by the second copy of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon. A notable exception was <italic>cbbR</italic>, the transcriptional regulator of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon. Knockout of <italic>cbbR</italic> leads to a 100-fold down-regulation of <italic>cbb</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>). Although two copies of the <italic>cbbR</italic> regulator are present, only the chromosome 2 copy is functional, the pHG1-encoded copy is inactive due to a 26 bp deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowien and Kusian, 2002</xref>). C<italic>bbR</italic> mutants had a strong fitness penalty on formate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, fitness ≤ –6) but no significant fitness penalty on fructose or succinate; the observed fitness effects of –1 to –2 were within the typical variation for neutral genes. This suggests that the activity of the CBB cycle is either neutral to growth or the effect is too small to detect with our method. We reproduced these experiments with a cultivation regime that primarily selects for faster growth rate (medium pulses every 2 hr) and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that (re-) fixation of CO<sub>2</sub> during heterotrophic growth is unlikely to convey a growth benefit without additional energy, such as from H<sub>2</sub> oxidation or during growth on substrates that are more reduced than biomass. We hypothesize that the up-regulation of Rubisco on fructose is a 'byproduct' of up-regulation of other glycolysis related genes of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The central metabolism of <italic>C. necator</italic> is highly redundant</title><p>We have previously established that several enzymes in the central carbon metabolism of <italic>C. necator</italic> are encoded by strictly essential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, most reactions are annotated with more than one (iso-) enzyme. We therefore expanded our gene fitness analysis to all enzymes of central carbon metabolism in order to find conditionally essential genes. The reactions of central carbon metabolism were grouped into four different pathways, CBB cycle including FDH, ED pathway, pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle, and the fitness of all genes associated with these reactions was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, replication experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The majority of genes showed no significant fitness penalty (or benefit) when knocked out. Only a few genes showed a significant decrease in fitness, and the effect on fitness was substrate-specific. Four genes encoding subunits of a soluble FDH (<italic>fdsABDG</italic>) showed significantly reduced fitness on formate. This demonstrates that <italic>fds</italic> encodes the dominant FDH activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). No other annotated FDH genes had a similar fitness penalty. Another conditionally essential gene on formate was <italic>ppc,</italic> encoding the PEP-carboxylase (PPC). The reaction has no other annotated (iso-) enzymes and was predicted by RBA to carry substantial flux towards the TCA cycle on formate and fructose, but not on succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>). The fitness penalty of <italic>ppc</italic> knock-out mutants reflected the relative importance of the reaction for growth on the different substrates (formate: –4.2, fructose: –2.7, succinate: –0.1). On fructose, genes for four consecutive enzyme reactions had significantly reduced fitness, <italic>pgl</italic>, <italic>edd1,</italic> and <italic>eda</italic> from the ED pathway, as well as <italic>pdhA</italic> encoding the E1 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). For EDD another isoenzyme is annotated (<italic>edd2</italic>) that could not compensate for the <italic>edd1</italic> knockout. For PDH, five alternative loci are annotated, all of which did not rescue <italic>pdhA</italic> knockout. On succinate, only two gene knockouts have significantly reduced fitness, malic enzyme <italic>maeA</italic> and <italic>pdhA</italic>. Both associated reactions (ME and PDH) carry significant flux on succinate according to RBA simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Malic enzyme has one more annotated gene, <italic>maeB</italic>, with different cofactor specificity (NADPH instead of NADH), which could not compensate for the loss of <italic>maeA</italic>. We conclude that the central carbon metabolism of <italic>C. necator</italic> has a very high degree of redundancy. Apart from a core set of essential genes encoded on chromosome 1, many enzyme functions can be compensated by alternative copies. The genes that were found to be conditionally essential were either present with only one copy (<italic>pgl</italic>, <italic>eda</italic>, <italic>ppc</italic>), or the alternative enzymes could not compensate for their loss (<italic>edd2</italic>, <italic>maeB, pdhA2,</italic> alternative FDHs).

Comparative genome analysis suggested different evolutionary origins of the <italic>C. necator</italic> chromosomes, with chromosome 1 more conserved among related species than chromosome 2 and pHG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricke et al., 2009</xref>). We found that the largest fraction of protein mass (78.7%) can be attributed to chromosome 1, while chromosome 2 and the pHG1 megaplasmid only show strong expression at a few selected loci responsible for alternative lifestyles (lithoautotrophy, denitrification). Chromosome 1 also showed predominantly constitutive expression across different trophic conditions, while the few highly expressed loci on chromosome 2 and pHG1 were transcriptionally regulated. This supports the hypothesis that <italic>C. necator</italic> may have acquired chromosome 2 and pHG1 at a later stage of its evolutionary history and highlights the 'accessory' character of both replicons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fricke et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Of the 5357 quantified proteins only 1,223 are associated with enzymes and another 93 with central dogma machinery in the <italic>C. necator</italic> RBA model. Yet, utilized enzymes and machinery summed up to 57 % of the protein mass, while 43 % of the proteome was non-utilized, including all proteins not covered by the RBA model. Our estimate for the non-utilized protein mass in <italic>C. necator</italic> is higher than a previously reported estimate for <italic>E. coli</italic> of 26–39 %, particularly regarding the non-modeled protein fraction (39 % in <italic>C. necator</italic> compared to maximally 26 % in <italic>E. coli</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Brien et al., 2016</xref>). Another estimate for the proportion of non-utilized enzymes for <italic>E. coli</italic> obtained about 30 % of the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidi and Milo, 2017</xref>). We conclude that <italic>C. necator</italic> not only has a larger genome compared to for example <italic>E. coli</italic>, but also expresses many genes without utilizing them in the controlled, homogeneous environments that are typical in biotechnology applications. The large non-utilized protein fraction may be related to environmental readiness and may increase fitness of <italic>C. necator</italic> in the variable and mixed substrate conditions typical of soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hewavitharana et al., 2019</xref>). Further work is necessary to test this hypothesis, for example by subjecting <italic>C. necator</italic> to laboratory evolution experiments in a constant environment with a defined carbon source. Such a selection could lead to inactivation of superfluous substrate assimilation pathways, freeing protein resources and eventually increasing growth rate.</p><p>It is important to note that estimation of protein utilization is not straight-forward and prone to several sources of error. For example, many proteins in <italic>C. necator</italic> are not functionally annotated but could be catalytically active, eventually leading to underestimation of the utilized protein fraction. On the other hand, enzymes can have 'moonlighting' activities so that the calculated utilization is underestimated for some enzymes and overestimated for others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cotton et al., 2020</xref>). Proteins involved in cell motility, cell cycling, sensing of and responding to environmental changes are generally not a part of the metabolic model, yet have vital functions for cellular fitness and are thus utilized in some way. Another challenge is to assign enzyme abundance accurately to reactions that have several annotated proteins, or a protein that is assigned to several enzymatic reactions. In these cases, we divided protein abundance between different enzymes and <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p><p>Bearing these limitations in mind, we used the RBA model to investigate the <italic>under</italic>utilization of enzymes. Underutilization as used in this study serves as a proxy for the relation between maximum attainable reaction rate (<italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic>) and actual reaction rate, with the latter being shaped by substrate saturation, reverse flux as well as potential allosteric effectors. The estimated enzyme efficiency <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> is influenced by these factors and can deviate from in vitro measured maximum turnover <italic>k<sub>cat</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidi et al., 2016</xref>). A general observation regarding utilization is the dependency on growth rate. Flux of metabolic enzymes is directly proportional to growth rate, given that all other cultivation parameters are kept constant. At low growth and low flux through metabolism, bacteria optimize fitness by reallocating protein resources from growth functions (ribosomes) to substrate assimilation (transporters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>). However, this reallocation is only a gradual response and neither results in full reduction of superfluous proteome sectors, nor the shrinking of the protein pool (g protein/gDCW). The consequence is that enzyme utilization becomes low at low growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">O’Brien et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>C. necator</italic> also shows this pattern: ribosomal proteins are incompletely reduced at low growth rates, and enzymes of central metabolism generally remain highly abundant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), effectively creating an underutilized enzyme reserve.</p><p>Underutilization of enzymes represents an 'efficiency sacrifice' for host fitness. Expression of excess non-metabolic proteins such as LacZ or YFP reduces bacterial growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahn et al., 2018</xref>). However, several recent experimental studies have shown that enzyme underutilization in <italic>E. coli</italic> central metabolism, such as in the OPP pathway and amino acid biosynthesis, provides a buffer against perturbations in environmental conditions or gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davidi and Milo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christodoulou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sander et al., 2019</xref>). The importance of underutilized enzymes for metabolic stability has also been shown for metabolic networks such as the CBB cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barenholz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janasch et al., 2018</xref>). We observed that highly abundant enzymes are better utilized and less variable across conditions. This is most likely a result of the evolutionary pressure on enzyme reserve costs, which increase proportionally with the abundance of enzymes.</p><p>It is of interest to compare enzyme utilization in <italic>C. necator</italic> to <italic>E. coli,</italic> a model bacterium with a different environmental niche. The central carbon metabolism pathways of <italic>C. necator</italic> showed differences in enzyme abundance, variability, and utilization. Abundance of enzymes for the upper EMP pathway, PPP, and CBB cycle was on average higher than for the enzymes of the ED pathway, pyruvate metabolism or TCA. This is similar to <italic>E. coli</italic>, where higher abundance of glycolysis enzymes was explained by high flux demand and low thermodynamic driving force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noor et al., 2016</xref>). But enzymes of the upper EMP pathway and PPP also showed strong transcriptional regulation (variability in gene expression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which is a marked difference to <italic>E. coli</italic>, where enzyme levels show low variation across multiple growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>), and flux is mainly regulated through allosteric interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>). Of all central carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle enzymes showed on average lowest abundance, variability and -for most enzymes- utilization. This is similar to <italic>E. coli</italic>, where a simple enzyme cost minimization model suggested lower enzyme abundance than what was measured experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noor et al., 2016</xref>). Only when reverse fluxes (for reactions with low thermodynamic driving force) and low enzyme saturation ([S]&lt; K<sub>M</sub>, estimated from metabolite levels), were taken into account, was the calculated enzyme demand similar to the measured levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Noor et al., 2016</xref>). The RBA framework does not take thermodynamic driving forces into account and may therefore underestimate enzyme demand for such reactions.</p><p>How was the regulatory network in <italic>C. necator</italic>’s central carbon metabolism shaped by its native environment? <italic>E. coli</italic> is adapted to regular nutrient upshifts every 2–3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mori et al., 2017</xref>). It therefore evolved allosteric regulation to deal with quickly changing fluxes through the EMP pathway, its prime catabolic route (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>). For <italic>C. necator</italic>, sugars are likely not the preferred substrate as the only sugars it utilizes are fructose and N-acetylglucosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cramm, 2009</xref>). Flux through the upper EMP pathway is low as it uses the low-yield ED pathway to catabolize sugars. A slow but more resource efficient transcriptional regulation of glycolysis could therefore provide a fitness benefit for an environment with limited and irregular substrate supply. Interestingly, only the glycolysis/PPP enzymes located on the phylogenetically young <italic>cbb</italic> operons are transcriptionally regulated, while the ancestral enzymes on chromosome 1 are constitutively expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These enzymes are also scattered over the chromosome and therefore not collectively regulated. The diverging regulation for glycolysis-related genes could mark a branching point in the evolutionary history of <italic>C. necator</italic>. The pHG1 plasmid was likely acquired recently, based on its transmissibility and proven ability to confer hydrogenotrophic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedrich et al., 1981</xref>). <italic>Cbb</italic> genes could either get lost or take over the function as main glycolysis enzymes from their chromosome 1 orthologs.</p><p>The two copies of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon in <italic>C. necator</italic> are of hybrid nature as CBB cycle enzymes functionally overlap with EMP glycolysis and PPP. Expression of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon depended on the supplied substrate and was highest for growth on formate, where CBB cycle genes are essential. However, a more complex picture emerged for <italic>cbb</italic> expression during other substrate limitations (increasing with µ on fructose, decreasing with µ on succinate). The <italic>cbb</italic> operon is transcriptionally regulated by two systems, CbbR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowien and Kusian, 2002</xref>) and RegA/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2017</xref>). RegA/B guarantees a basic level of constitutive expression, while CbbR senses the intracellular PEP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2017</xref>). PEP is an important allosteric regulator responsible for the switch between glycolytic and gluconeogenic flux in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>C. necator</italic>, growth on fructose leads to low PEP concentration, triggering <italic>cbb</italic> expression, while it is the other way around for succinate. This prompts the question which evolutionary benefit cells gain from <italic>cbb</italic> expression during heterotrophic growth? On substrates with a higher degree of reduction than biomass, such as glycerol, there will be sufficient redox power to fix emitted CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alagesan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guadalupe-Medina et al., 2013</xref>). On substrates with a lower degree of reduction, such an excess is not expected. It has also been shown that reassimilation of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> by Rubisco improves PHB yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shimizu et al., 2015</xref>). We generalized this hypothesis and tested if CBB activity could also provide a biomass yield or growth benefit. Our model simulations suggested that CO<sub>2</sub>-reassimilation is unlikely to provide such a benefit as long as there is no additional energy source (Rubisco activity even causes a higher net CO<sub>2</sub> emission). Down-regulation of the <italic>cbb</italic> operon (<italic>cbbR</italic> mutant) caused no significant fitness change on fructose or succinate, suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in these conditions provides no benefit. The resolution of the transposon library experiments was however too low to exclude that CBB activity does not confer a small growth advantage. We propose that the conserved PEP-dependent transcriptional regulation of <italic>cbb</italic> leads to a collateral expression of Rubisco in conditions where it is not required, such as fructose. This is a remarkable example of suboptimality, where one benefit could be readiness for lithoautotrophic growth when hydrogen or formate become available. Probing the effect of <italic>cbb</italic> gene knockouts with the transposon library also revealed that <italic>C. necator</italic> can compensate the loss of any <italic>cbb</italic> gene by expressing the respective second copy. This finding applies to central carbon metabolism in general. Almost all enzyme functions are covered by several gene loci, so that knockout did not result in fitness loss. Notable exceptions are the reactions of the ED pathway, PEP carboxylase (<italic>ppc</italic>), and malic enzyme (<italic>maeA</italic>), that showed significantly reduced fitness in conditions where these reactions carry high flux.</p><p>Our results highlight the metabolic flexibility of <italic>C. necator</italic> and its robustness to changing environmental conditions. Its high degree of genomic redundancy makes it tolerant to gene loss, but may also lead to regulatory conflicts exemplified by <italic>cbb</italic> expression. A comparison of microbial genomes showed that the CBB cycle is accompanied by a metabolism-wide range of adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asplund-Samuelsson and Hudson, 2021</xref>). Considering a possibly recent acquisition of the CBB cycle <italic>via</italic> pHG1, it is likely that <italic>C. necator</italic> is currently evolving to make best use of the <italic>cbb</italic> genes. Our results also imply that <italic>C. neactor</italic> is in its current state far from being an ideal host for biotech applications. This is because (1) gene duplications and iso-enzymes complicate genetic engineering, (2) expression of unutilized pathways is protein-inefficient, (3) a large pool of uncharacterized enzymes makes it difficult to control metabolic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Strategies to tackle these problems could include both targeted and untargeted approaches. The systematic deletion of undesired functions could result in higher enzyme efficiency and therefore higher product yield. One example is the removal of costly hydrogenase expression for growth on formate. Alternatively, laboratory evolution could be employed to select mutants with beneficial traits such as tolerance to formic acid.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H16 (wild type)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, DSM-428</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI:txid381666</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/DSM-428">https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/DSM-428</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H16 PHB<sup>-</sup>4(mutant deficient in PHB synthesis)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, DSM-541</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H16 PHB<sup>-</sup>4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/DSM-541">https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/DSM-541</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">H16, transposon mutant library (60,000 individual mutuants)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI:txid381666</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained by conjugation with <italic>E. coli</italic> APA766</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">APA766, transposon donor strain (pKMW7 Tn5)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wetmore et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WM3064</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Obtained from the original authors (Adam Deutsch- bauer lab)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cultivation</title><p><italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> H16 was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, strain number DSM-428.

The remaining 1173 genes were either essential (no viable insertion mutant), probably essential (number of transposon mutants in the surrounding region too low to determine essentiality), or fitness could not be quantified with sufficient confidence (low read count). A significance threshold of |F| ≥ 3 after at least eight generations was chosen based on the bulk fitness distribution of mutants (–2≤ F ≤ 2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Resource balance analysis model</title><p>The resource balance analysis (RBA) model for <italic>C. necator</italic> H16 was generated using the RBApy package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulović et al., 2019</xref>).

Amino acid sequence, subunit stoichiometry and cofactor requirements for all proteins associated with model reactions were automatically retrieved from uniprot (organism ID: 381666). Fasta files detailing the composition of the ribosome (3 rRNA and 68 proteins), chaperones (eight proteins), DNA polymerase III (eight proteins), and RNA polymerase II (nine proteins) were added manually. Rates for these macromolecular 'machines' were adopted from published values for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Rates for ribosome and chaperone were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bulović et al., 2019</xref>, rate of RNA polymerase was taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Epshtein and Nudler, 2003</xref>, and rate of DNA polymerase was the average of several published values obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu">https://bionumbers.hms.harvard.edu</ext-link> (IDs 102052, 104938, 109251, 111770).

For enzymes without estimated <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> (no flux, or no protein abundance available), the median of the <italic>k<sub>app</sub></italic> distribution was used (5770 hr<sup>–1</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz serving as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jörg Toepel (Reviewer #1); Nico Claassens (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Determine biomass per OD600 for different conditions.</p><p>– Examine PHB production, particularly if the authors want to include the ammonia condition. Otherwise maybe they should leave out claims regarding growth on that condition.</p><p>– As detailed in the individual reviews, the text would be improved by some rewriting, including some tempering of conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Introduction:</p><p>Try to replace wondering at least some times, it sounds very repetitive.</p><p>Results:</p><p>Figure 3: The significant tests are just reveal that the differences are just between two groups and not between all of the groups, please indicate that, or did I miss something?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>The conclusion regarding the up-regulation of the cbb cycle under heterotrophic growth is weak and not supported by the data and controversy to the cited paper. The authors should state that in detail (as they did but it i am not sure if sufficient).</p><p>What are the consequences for biotechnological applications? Deletion of large parts of the genome? Please explain and give some ideas.</p><p>Delete the last sentence of the discussion it is somehow arbitrary. You also can explain it in a separate paragraph in more detail</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Biomass per OD highly depends on the growth condition and bears the risk or error</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is well-written , and could be interesting for the readership of <italic>eLife</italic> if several major issues are tackled by the authors first.</p><p>1. One of the only clear ' questions' the researchers are after is to determine if co-utilization of the CCB cycle for growth on fructose is useful. The RBA and fitness analysis shows this is not the case for fructose and any of the other (even more oxidized) substrates. This could also be already expected theoretically. If you consider fructose has a reduction degree per carbon of 4 and biomass about 4.2, it is clear that no 'electrons' are left over to reduce extra CO2. This would only be interesting on very reduced substrates like glycerol (degree of reduction &gt; biomass). However, real biology may behave differently than what 'theoretical stoichiometries predict', <italic>C. necator</italic> may perform' overoxidation in the TCA cycle, and this could potentially explain a benefit of the CO2 refixation, even though on paper it's a wasteful detour. Other papers suggest this overactivity of TCA cycle, also in autotrophic growth of <italic>C. necator</italic> on hydrogen (10.1016/j.procbio.2017.07.007), where limiting the oxygen concentration increased biomass yields. A similar situation may be going on in heterotrophic growth and explain observations on a small impact. I suggest the authors look at that more closely and revisit some conclusions on this.</p><p>2. The authors state that the deletion of ccbR has no fitness cost for growth on fructose, however in Figure 5F I still observe a minor, but significant fitness cost for growth on fructose, hence I suggest to rephrase the text slightly to better reflect that. This may actually change the conclusion of the paper on the 'useless' role of the CCB on fructose and sucrose.</p><p>3. The authors should better explain the differences between their findings and Shimizu et al., 2015 paper in Scientific reports.</p><p>4. Page 16, line 19 and 32: please check if you are not referring to figure 4 instead.</p><p>5. P21 L17 &quot; Another conditionally essential gene on formate was ppc,</p><p>encoding the PEP-carboxylase (PPC). The reaction has no other annotated (iso-) enzymes and was predicted by RBA to carry most flux on formate compared to the other carbon sources (Figure 6 B).&quot; It would be interesting to explain the biochemical logic why this anaplerotic reaction would be used more than in other conditions, where anaplerosis is also needed. I guess it has to do with the fact that there is generally lower TCA flux during growth on formate, NADH is generated directly from NADH rather than the TCA cycle. However, anaplerosis is needed in all conditions to generate oxaloacetate etc. So interesting to explain this.</p><p>6. P25 L14 &quot; P25 L14 &quot; Of all central carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle enzymes</p><p>showed on average lowest abundance, variability and utilization. This is similar to <italic>E. coli</italic>, where the sole flux capacity demand suggested lower enzyme abundance than what was measured experimentally [Noor et al., 2016]. Only when reverse flux (reactions with low thermodynamic driving force) and l ow enzyme saturation, estimated from metabolite levels was taken in to account, was the calculated enzyme demand similar to the measured levels [Noor et al., 2016].&quot;</p><p>This is an important point the authors raise in the discussion, and also makes wonder why the authors did not take into account reverse fluxes in their RBA analysis, is this because the lack of kinetic parameters known, thermodynamic parameters to perform this also for <italic>C. necator</italic> should be available generally, right? Good to specify this (or repeat that analysis including reverse fluxes, e.g. only based on thermodynamics).</p><p>7. Be clearer about what sugars <italic>C. necator</italic> can use. On P25 L25 you state &quot; For <italic>C.</italic></p><p><italic>necator</italic>, hexose sugars are only one out of many possible substrate classes and the flux&quot; However, it can only accept one hexose sugar (fructose) as is stated before twice:</p><p>– &quot; The only sugar that supports growth 27 is fructose, which i s metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway [Alagesan et al., 28 2018].&quot;</p><p>– &quot; Fructose was chosen as it is the only known sugar (apart from sugar alcohols) that <italic>C. necator</italic> utilizes [Orita et al., 2012].&quot;</p><p>Overall, this is not so clear, Orita et al. do not discuss sugar alcohols and I am not sure which sugar alcohols <italic>C. necator</italic> can consume (it can consume some sugar acids, but that's something different, at least glycolate). In addition, <italic>C. necator</italic> does consume N-acetylglucosamine, which is defined as sugar. Maybe just rephrase that <italic>C. necator</italic> is only known to grow on one hexose sugar, being fructose and not on glucose. And a better reference could be the 2008 review of Cramm, which states &quot; Organic carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic growth include TCA cycle intermediates, sugar acids, fatty acids, amino acids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds, while utilization of sugars is restricted to fructose and N -acetylglucosamine [Johnson and Stanier, 1971; Kersters and De Ley, 1984]&quot;</p><p>8. The authors speculate about the evolutionary nature of the two copies of the Calvin cycle operon, as well as their data show the key role of cbbR. Can the authors maybe also mention and discuss the presence of an inactive ccbR copy in the 2nd CCB operon on pHG1, which is now not mentioned, but also indicates the 'recent' and ' unoptimized' acquisition of these CBB operons. Would also be good to know what is the abundance of this inactive cbbR copy from pHG1 in the proteome?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study dealt with comprehensive analyses regarding protein quantitation and enzyme utilization in the versatile chemolithoautotrophic bacterium <italic>C. necator</italic>. The experiments and analyses were well considered and designed, and the authors obtained quite interesting information such as presence of many under-utilized enzymes as well as excess amount of utilized enzymes, suggesting the highly robust properties of this bacterium against environmental perturbations.</p><p>I have no comments in the experiments, results, and discussion obtained by carbon-limited chemostat cultivation, although I here address a few concerns in the nitrogen-limited cultivation as below, which should be considered by the authors before publication.</p><p>1) It has been well known that <italic>C. necator</italic> H16 synthesizes and accumulates PHB with in the cells under nitrogen-limited conditions. In many cases of PHB-producing cells, the accumulation of intracellular PHB granule reflects on apparent OD owing to the changes in cell size and morphology. In the nitrogen-limited cultivation in this study, I think that the constant OD was a result of steady states of both cell growth and PHB synthesis. Did the authors determine PHB accumulation under the nitrogen-limited condition?</p><p>2) PHB is a water-insoluble polyester, thus it can be escaped from cytosolic equilibrium once after polymerized from water-soluble monomers. Did the RBA model used in this study include PHB synthesis? That is, in the nitrogen-limited condition, did the biomass yield calculated by RBA simulation contain PHB?</p><p>3) The authors concluded that reassimilation of CO2 by CBB pathway does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth. I agreed with this conclusion, because it is feasible that energy- and reducing equivalents-consuming CBB cycle is not required when carbons other than CO2 are available. While, I read the previous report by Shimizu et al. They demonstrated advantage of CBB cycle under heterotrophic growth in synthesis of the storage polyester unassociated with cell growth, and never proposed advantage in the heterotrophic growth. It is not adequate to discuss about this matter by applying the results in the current study focusing on growth to the previous study focusing on growth-unassociated PHB synthesis. I recommend the authors to correct/modify the relevant descriptions in order to avoid readers' misunderstanding.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Protein allocation and utilization in the versatile chemolithoautotroph <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz serving as Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>I very much appreciate the effort you have taken to carefully address the previous reviews. There are just a few more points outlined below that should be considered in the final version for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors did a very good job in revising the manuscript and adding additional experiments and modelling on dry weight and PHB production.</p><p>The only answer that puzzled us was the answer on PEP carboxylase, we were puzzled by the explanation that oxaloacetate flux goes to glycine via reserve GCV operation (does that mean that this goes via threonine).</p><p>Furthermore, they satisfied all our queries well, so I recommend publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I respect the authors' great effort in re-examination of bioreactor experiment and replacement of metabolic modeling regarding the N-limitation condition. I agree with the most revisions so think that the revised manuscript is valuable for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>, but I have still a few concerns as below, which are expected to be considered by the authors prior to the publication.</p><p>1) Were the g-DCW values used for calculation of m-protein (g/g-DCW) in Figure 4, Y (gDCW/g-S) in Figure 5C (and so on) under the N-limitation condition the cell mass excluding PHB (PHB-subtracted biomass)? The m-protein graph under the N-limitation in Figure 4 in the revised manuscript looks like to be the same as the previous version.</p><p>2) The rate of intracellular PHB synthesis usually becomes maximum when the cell growth has been stopped by nitrogen depletion, so the increase in PHB production by the function of CBB cycle during the heterotrophic condition on fructose, reported by Shimizu et al., may become significant during the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis. The authors carried re-simulation to estimate the advantage of the heterotrophic CBB cycle (lines 373-385 in the revised manuscript), but this re-simulation was done still under growth conditions. Is it possible to simulate the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis on fructose under N-depletion? Fructose-uptake by <italic>C. necator</italic> was supposed to be weakened after the growth phase due to marked down-regulation of expression of EM and ED pathway genes (reported in previous transcriptome analyses). Considering this, I'm not sure whether the constant fructose uptake rate of 4.0 mmol/gDCW/h was adequate or not for the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69019.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– Determine biomass per OD600 for different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The biomass in g dry cell weight (DCW) was determined for all substrates. For fructose, succinate and formate, biomass yield was determined using shake flask experiments, as the biomass yield was constant in previous chemostat cultivations (no change in optical density at different growth rates). For nitrogen limitation, such a change in optical density was observed, indicating an increase in total biomass with increasing N-limitation rate due to the production of PHB. The ammonium-limited cultivations were therefore reproduced in chemostats and DCW as well as PHB concentration determined for each growth rate individually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Examine PHB production, particularly if the authors want to include the ammonia condition.

The reason we used OD measurement as a proxy for biomass concentration was the limited volume of our chemostat cultures (65 mL); dry cell weight measurement makes it necessary to sacrifice a substantial amount of culture volume. We have now performed a new set of cultivations for all carbon and nitrogen limitations (fructose, succinate, formate in shake flasks, ammonium in chemostat), and determined g DCW and PHB from these cultures. The updated substrate uptake rates and the PHB production were included in the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The paper is well-written , and could be interesting for the readership of eLife if several major issues are tackled by the authors first.</p><p>1. One of the only clear ' questions' the researchers are after is to determine if co-utilization of the CCB cycle for growth on fructose is useful. The RBA and fitness analysis shows this is not the case for fructose and any of the other (even more oxidized) substrates. This could also be already expected theoretically. If you consider fructose has a reduction degree per carbon of 4 and biomass about 4.2, it is clear that no 'electrons' are left over to reduce extra CO2. This would only be interesting on very reduced substrates like glycerol (degree of reduction &gt; biomass). However, real biology may behave differently than what 'theoretical stoichiometries predict', C. necator may perform' overoxidation in the TCA cycle, and this could potentially explain a benefit of the CO2 refixation, even though on paper it's a wasteful detour. Other papers suggest this overactivity of TCA cycle, also in autotrophic growth of C. necator on hydrogen (10.1016/j.procbio.2017.07.007), where limiting the oxygen concentration increased biomass yields. A similar situation may be going on in heterotrophic growth and explain observations on a small impact. I suggest the authors look at that more closely and revisit some conclusions on this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that theoretical considerations like degree of reduction and reaction stoichiometry can already give hints on the usefulness of the CBB cycle on different substrates. We have included a comment on the degree of reduction for substrate (fructose) and product (biomass). Other factors such as utilization of more protein-(in-)efficient pathways can under some circumstances improve growth rate on the cost of biomass yield, or vice versa (Basan et al., Nature, 2015). In our study we did not find evidence for such a growth rate/biomass yield tradeoff.</p><p>Another factor influencing biomass yield is the activity of futile cycles or other energy-wasting reactions. The reference from Lu et al., 2017, falls in this category. Their results show that only O<sub>2</sub> but no other limitation resulted in higher energy efficiency (H<sub>2</sub> consumed per CO<sub>2</sub>) during lithoautotrophic growth (see also Yu et al., Int J Hyd Energy, 2013, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2013.04.153). The final biomass yield was unchanged between different limitations (~1 g DCW / g H<sub>2</sub>). We also note that their reported yield and H<sub>2</sub> energy efficiency was highest in non-limited growth, so that O<sub>2</sub> limitation only improved yield in relative comparison to other limitations. The authors speculated about changes in energy efficiency being caused by a shift in membrane bound- versus soluble hydrogenase (affecting NADH/ATP ratio), or increased TCA cycle flux oxidizing biomass precursors for energy (p. 155, last paragraph). Unfortunately neither of these hypotheses were tested experimentally.</p><p>From our own simulations (Figure 5D), increased flux through the TCA cycle was in fact one of the predicted consequences of forcing CBB activity during growth on fructose. <italic>C. necator</italic> seems to have no yield or rate benefit from that alone. The idea of an overactive TCA cycle is intriguing, where fixed carbon is reoxidized and NADH used in respiration. However, when we tested the effect of O<sub>2</sub> limitation on <italic>C. necator</italic> cultivated in fructose- and formate-fed turbidostats we did not see increased yield (OD<sub>600 nm</sub>) or growth rate during oxygen limitation, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. To us, this data would go against the occurrence of wasteful oxidation of fixed carbon in the TCA cycle during normal conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>O<sub>2</sub>-limitation does not increase biomass yield, but reduces growth rate.</title><p><italic>C. necator</italic> was grown in fructose or formate-fed turbidostats (0.5 and 1.5 g/L substrate, respectively).

The authors state that the deletion of ccbR has no fitness cost for growth on fructose, however in Figure 5F I still observe a minor, but significant fitness cost for growth on fructose, hence I suggest to rephrase the text slightly to better reflect that.

P21 L17 &quot; Another conditionally essential gene on formate was ppc, encoding the PEP-carboxylase (PPC). The reaction has no other annotated (iso-) enzymes and was predicted by RBA to carry most flux on formate compared to the other carbon</p><p>sources (Figure 6 B).&quot; It would be interesting to explain the biochemical logic why this anaplerotic reaction would be used more than in other conditions, where anaplerosis is also needed. I guess it has to do with the fact that there is generally lower TCA flux during growth on formate, NADH is generated directly from NADH rather than the TCA cycle. However, anaplerosis is needed in all conditions to generate oxaloacetate etc. So interesting to explain this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. In order to answer it, we have closely inspected the fluxes from PEP to oxaloacetate (OA) <italic>via PPC</italic> and further down to different amino acid biosynthesis routes. On formate, 75% of flux from PEP went to OA while only 12% proceeded to pyruvate. Flux through the TCA was generally low on formate. As the reviewer points out, OA is a hub for amino acid biosynthesis reactions and around 90% of it was transaminated to aspartate, which was used for protein biosynthesis (23%), but also further metabolized to other amino acids (thr, ala, lys, ile, met, asn) and peptidoglycan. However, we also noticed that a large portion of the flux from OA (40%) went to the serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the glycine cleavage system (reactions <italic>GHMT3</italic> and <italic>GLYAMT</italic>), generating glycine and serine by running reverse of the canonical direction. While this is thermodynamically possible as recently demonstrated by engineering the reductive glycine cycle in <italic>C. necator</italic> (Claassens et al., Met Eng, 2020), it is unlikely to happen without a high concentration of methyl-THF &quot;pushing&quot; these reactions. This error was corrected by constraining the reaction directionality in the model.</p><p>With this change, the flux from PEP to OA on formate is lower (45% from PEP to OA, 55% to pyruvate, see updated Figure 6B). <italic>PPC</italic> nevertheless has a more important role on formate compared to fructose, which could explain its stronger effect on fitness. It carries 70% of the total flux towards the TCA cycle while it only carries 35% on fructose (50% of flux from ED pathway goes to pyruvate and enters the TCA downstream of <italic>PPC</italic>). In line with this, the <italic>ppc</italic> knock-out did not only affect growth on formate (fitness = -4.2, table in Supplementary file 2), but also on fructose (fitness = -2.7), while there was no effect on succinate (fitness = -0.1). The fitness associated with <italic>ppc</italic> is therefore directly correlated to the predicted flux through <italic>PPC</italic>. We have updated the respective text section and Figure 6B-D with the corrected results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. P25 L14 &quot; P25 L14 &quot; Of all central carbon metabolism, the TCA cycle enzymes showed on average lowest abundance, variability and utilization. This is similar to <italic>E. coli</italic>, where the sole flux capacity demand suggested lower enzyme abundance than what was measured experimentally [Noor et al., 2016]. Only when reverse flux (reactions with low thermodynamic driving force) and l ow enzyme saturation, estimated from metabolite levels was taken in to account, was the calculated enzyme demand similar to the measured levels [Noor et al., 2016].&quot;</p><p>This is an important point the authors raise in the discussion, and also makes wonder why the authors did not take into account reverse fluxes in their RBA analysis, is this because the lack of kinetic parameters known, thermodynamic parameters to perform this also for C. necator should be available generally, right? Good to specify this (or repeat that analysis including reverse fluxes, e.g. only based on thermodynamics).</p></disp-quote><p>Protein constrained metabolic modeling is a relatively recent development, and only a handful of frameworks exist. Of the four ones we know (ME-model, RBA, EFTL, GECKO), only one -EFTL- currently supports thermodynamic constraints. However, the effort to set up such a model is considerable and the availability of input parameters is limited. In this work we chose RBA for its good documentation, numerical efficiency and semi-automated model generation, although it does not include thermodynamic constraints. Such constraints may be included in future updates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Be clearer about what sugars C. necator can use. On P25 L25 you state &quot; For C. necator, hexose sugars are only one out of many possible substrate classes and the flux&quot; However, it can only accept one hexose sugar (fructose) as is stated before twice:</p><p>– &quot; The only sugar that supports growth 27 is fructose, which i s metabolized via the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway [Alagesan et al., 28 2018].&quot;</p><p>– &quot; Fructose was chosen as it is the only known sugar (apart from sugar alcohols) that C. necator utilizes [Orita et al., 2012].&quot;</p><p>Overall, this is not so clear, Orita et al. do not discuss sugar alcohols and I am not sure which sugar alcohols C. necator can consume (it can consume some sugar acids, but that's something different, at least glycolate). In addition, C. necator does consume N-acetylglucosamine, which is defined as sugar. Maybe just rephrase that C. necator is only known to grow on one hexose sugar, being fructose and not on glucose. And a better reference could be the 2008 review of Cramm, which states &quot; Organic carbon and energy sources for heterotrophic growth include TCA cycle intermediates, sugar acids, fatty acids, amino acids, alcohols, and aromatic compounds, while utilization of sugars is restricted to fructose and N -acetylglucosamine [Johnson and Stanier, 1971; Kersters and De Ley, 1984]&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have changed the respective paragraphs to make clear that fructose and N-acetylglucosamine are the only consumed sugars in the wild type. <italic>C. necator</italic> can also grow on glycerol, which is a sugar alcohol albeit a short chain one [Alagesan et al., 2018]. The reference to sugar alcohols was nevertheless removed because it is of no importance for this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors speculate about the evolutionary nature of the two copies of the Calvin cycle operon, as well as their data show the key role of cbbR. Can the authors maybe also mention and discuss the presence of an inactive ccbR copy in the 2nd CCB operon on pHG1, which is now not mentioned, but also indicates the 'recent' and ' unoptimized' acquisition of these CBB operons. Would also be good to know what is the abundance of this inactive cbbR copy from pHG1 in the proteome?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a sentence mentioning the inactive, truncated cbbR<sup>P</sup> copy on pHG1 to the discussion.

It is possible though that identical peptides of the cbbR<sup>P</sup> protein contribute to the measured abundance of cbbR<sup>C</sup> if it is expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study dealt with comprehensive analyses regarding protein quantitation and enzyme utilization in the versatile chemolithoautotrophic bacterium C. necator. The experiments and analyses were well considered and designed, and the authors obtained quite interesting information such as presence of many under-utilized enzymes as well as excess amount of utilized enzymes, suggesting the highly robust properties of this bacterium against environmental perturbations.</p><p>I have no comments in the experiments, results, and discussion obtained by carbon-limited chemostat cultivation, although I here address a few concerns in the nitrogen-limited cultivation as below, which should be considered by the authors before publication.</p><p>1) It has been well known that C. necator H16 synthesizes and accumulates PHB with in the cells under nitrogen-limited conditions. In many cases of PHB-producing cells, the accumulation of intracellular PHB granule reflects on apparent OD owing to the changes in cell size and morphology. In the nitrogen-limited cultivation in this study, I think that the constant OD was a result of steady states of both cell growth and PHB synthesis. Did the authors determine PHB accumulation under the nitrogen-limited condition?</p></disp-quote><p>There was indeed a subtle change in optical density over the course of the original cultivation, from higher OD (~0.4) to lower OD (~0.2) when limitation was relieved (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Revisiting this result, it suggests a different PHB content at different levels of limitation. As commented before, we redid the nitrogen limitation experiment and determined absolute biomass in g DCW/L and PHB content in g/g DCW (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) PHB is a water-insoluble polyester, thus it can be escaped from cytosolic equilibrium once after polymerized from water-soluble monomers. Did the RBA model used in this study include PHB synthesis? That is, in the nitrogen-limited condition, did the biomass yield calculated by RBA simulation contain PHB?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the RBA model contains the pathway to synthesize PHB. For simplification, the chain length of the PHB polymer is not taken into account, so that the molar PHB concentration is identical to the molar concentration of the 3-hydroxybutyrate-CoA monomer. PHB is then secreted <italic>via</italic> an exchange reaction and does not count as biomass. In our previous version of the RBA model, we had included a constant growth-rate dependent flux towards PHB in order to match the simulated biomass yield with experimentally determined biomass yield. In our revised manuscript, this inaccurate behavior was replaced with a more realistic simulation of PHB production based on the new measurements of biomass and PHB concentration. The flux towards PHB during nitrogen limitation is now explicitly included in the model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors concluded that reassimilation of CO2 by CBB pathway does not provide a fitness benefit for heterotrophic growth. I agreed with this conclusion, because it is feasible that energy – and reducing equivalents-consuming CBB cycle is not required when carbons other than CO2 are available. While, I read the previous report by Shimizu et al. They demonstrated advantage of CBB cycle under heterotrophic growth in synthesis of the storage polyester unassociated with cell growth, and never proposed advantage in the heterotrophic growth. It is not adequate to discuss about this matter by applying the results in the current study focusing on growth to the previous study focusing on growth-unassociated PHB synthesis. I recommend the authors to correct/modify the relevant descriptions in order to avoid readers' misunderstanding.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Our previous discussion of the findings from Shimizu et al. could make the impression that the authors claimed a general yield or fitness benefit of the CBB cycle on fructose. The picture is more nuanced in that the study from Shimizu et al. found an increase in PHB yield (+20.6% compared to a Rubisco knockout strain), without commenting on total biomass yield. The authors showed that during growth on sugar, the emitted and reassimilated CO<sub>2</sub> was preferentially incorporated into PHB, and likely caused an increase in PHB-synthesis. Here, we find that fixation of emitted CO<sub>2</sub> does not improve biomass yield on sugar.</p><p>Our results suggest that any additional activity of the CBB cycle during metabolism of fructose is a wasteful process, regardless if the carbon is invested into biomass or PHB. It is possible that the increased PHB yield that the authors reported when Rubisco is present is achieved on the cost of the (PHB-subtracted) biomass yield. However, our results did not allow us to draw conclusions on the effect of heterotrophic CBB activity on PHB or biomass yield. We deem the resolution of the transposon library experiments too low to decide if loss of CBB activity (<italic>cbbR</italic> knock-out) confers a fitness advantage or not. We have therefore toned down our claims regarding the fitness benefit of CBB cycle and corrected our interpretation of the results from Shimizu et al. as suggested by the reviewers (see Results section 5, and discussion).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I very much appreciate the effort you have taken to carefully address the previous reviews. There are just a few more points outlined below that should be considered in the final version for eLife.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors did a very good job in revising the manuscript and adding additional experiments and modelling on dry weight and PHB production.</p><p>The only answer that puzzled us was the answer on PEP carboxylase, we were puzzled by the explanation that oxaloacetate flux goes to glycine via reserve GCV operation (does that mean that this goes via threonine).</p><p>Furthermore, they satisfied all our queries well, so I recommend publication.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current manuscript the flux towards serine and glycine is taking the expected route, that means the canonical pathway starting from the glycolysis intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG) to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, O-phosphoserine, serine, and glycine + methyl-THF. The methyl-THF is ligated with CO<sub>2</sub> by the glycine cleavage system to form one additional glycine.</p><p>Before we corrected this error (in our original submission), flux towards serine was taking the route from oxaloacetate to aspartate, aspartate semialdehyde, homoserine, phospho-homoserine, threonine, 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, and finally glycine + acetyl-CoA. Serine would then be synthesized from 2 molecules glycine (one of it converted to methyl-THF via the glycine cleavage system). While probably possible, we deem this route unlikely to have flux in reality because it is much longer, and requires several enzymatic steps where the enzyme abundance and thermodynamic driving force might not be sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I respect the authors' great effort in re-examination of bioreactor experiment and replacement of metabolic modeling regarding the N-limitation condition. I agree with the most revisions so think that the revised manuscript is valuable for publication by eLife, but I have still a few concerns as below, which are expected to be considered by the authors prior to the publication.</p><p>1) Were the g-DCW values used for calculation of m-protein (g/g-DCW) in Figure 4, Y (gDCW/g-S) in Figure 5C (and so on) under the N-limitation condition the cell mass excluding PHB (PHB-subtracted biomass)? The m-protein graph under the N-limitation in Figure 4 in the revised manuscript looks like to be the same as the previous version.</p></disp-quote><p>The protein mass in g/gDCW was calculated by multiplying the relative protein mass fraction (%) with the average total protein content of 0.68 g / gDCW (Park et al., BMC, Sys Bio, 2011), with DCW being dry cell weight without PHB. The graph in Figure 4 looks similar to the previous version because the protein quantification is relative and only depends on the estimated protein content per DCW, which did not change. The experimentally measured gDCW was only used to determine the substrate uptake rate but does not influence the proteomics results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The rate of intracellular PHB synthesis usually becomes maximum when the cell growth has been stopped by nitrogen depletion, so the increase in PHB production by the function of CBB cycle during the heterotrophic condition on fructose, reported by Shimizu et al., may become significant during the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis. The authors carried re-simulation to estimate the advantage of the heterotrophic CBB cycle (lines 373-385 in the revised manuscript), but this re-simulation was done still under growth conditions. Is it possible to simulate the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis on fructose under N-depletion? Fructose-uptake by C. necator was supposed to be weakened after the growth phase due to marked down-regulation of expression of EM and ED pathway genes (reported in previous transcriptome analyses). Considering this, I'm not sure whether the constant fructose uptake rate of 4.0 mmol/gDCW/h was adequate or not for the growth-unassociated PHB synthesis.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer wonders if PHB production can be modeled when growth has stopped completely. This is an interesting question, but it would require a different modeling framework. The RBA model that we used here assumes steady state growth (which we achieved with chemostat bioreactors) and currently only supports maximizing growth as objective. The flux towards PHB was forced by constraining the respective reactions. A model with the ability to predict flux towards PHB without forcing it would require a dynamic (time-dependent) setup. The objective would need to be maximizing final biomass, not growth rate, for simulation of a growth experiment. Such a model would then incentivize storing additional carbon as PHB during nitrogen limitation, because this strategy would generate more biomass as soon as nitrogen becomes available again.</p><p>Regarding the constant uptake rate of 4 mmol fructose h<sup>-1</sup> gDCW<sup>-1</sup> (Figure 4 A-D), we have also tested different nitrogen/fructose uptake rates in combination with different CO<sub>2</sub> refixation rates in the RBA model but the results were similar, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Here, we simulated a stepwise reduction of the nitrogen concentration which reduces growth and triggers PHB formation. The model simulations suggest that any additional CBB activity reduces growth rate and biomass yield even further, and has no advantage for PHB production. The reason is that – from a purely stoichiometric perspective – the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> re-fixation to fructose uptake rate determines the energetic efficiency, which decreases with increasing flux through the CBB cycle. In reality, an increase in PHB yield is nevertheless possible on the cost of the non-PHB biomass yield.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Simulation of the combined effect of nitrogen limitation and CO<sub>2</sub> refixation via the CBB cycle.</title><p>Simulations were carried out using the resource balance analysis (RBA) model for <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> as described previously.
