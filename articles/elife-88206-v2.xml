and severe neurodevelopmental disorder associated with severe and medically refractory early-life epilepsy, motor, cognitive, visual, and autonomic disturbances in the absence of any structural brain pathology. Analysis of genetic variants in CDD has indicated that CDKL5 kinase function is central to disease pathology. <italic>CDKL5</italic> encodes a serine-threonine kinase with significant homology to GSK3β, which has also been linked to synaptic function. Further, <italic>Cdkl5</italic> knock-out rodents have increased GSK3β activity and often increased long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, development of a specific CDKL5 inhibitor must be careful to exclude cross-talk with GSK3β activity. We synthesized and characterized specific, high-affinity inhibitors of CDKL5 that do not have detectable activity for GSK3β. These compounds are very soluble in water but blood–brain barrier penetration is low. In rat hippocampal brain slices, acute inhibition of CDKL5 selectively reduces postsynaptic function of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in a dose-dependent manner. Acute inhibition of CDKL5 reduces hippocampal LTP. These studies provide new tools and insights into the role of CDKL5 as a newly appreciated key kinase necessary for synaptic plasticity. Comparisons to rodent knock-out studies suggest that compensatory changes have limited the understanding of the roles of CDKL5 in synaptic physiology, plasticity, and human neuropathology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LTP</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>CDKL5</kwd><kwd>GSK3</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS112770</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castano</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Children's Hospital Colorado Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ponzio Family Chair in Neuroscience Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Castano</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Structural Genomics Consortium</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>Carrow I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NC Biotechnology Center Institutional Support Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-IDG-1030</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drewry</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U24DK116204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drewry</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R44TR001916</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drewry</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silvestre</surname><given-names>Margaux</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silvestre</surname><given-names>Margaux</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silvestre</surname><given-names>Margaux</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018252</institution-id><institution>LouLou Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silvestre</surname><given-names>Margaux</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Current experience demonstrates that epilepsy in CDD is very medically refractory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demarest et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Olson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leonard et al., 2022</xref>; with rare exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aznar-Laín et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MacKay et al., 2020</xref>]); a newly approved therapy (ganaxolone, a neuroactive steroid that enhances GABAergic inhibition) provides modest improvements but not seizure freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knight et al., 2022</xref>). Hemizygous males and heterozygous females can be equally and severely affected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demarest et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wong et al., 2023</xref>). These severe symptoms are in the absence of any structural brain pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pini et al., 2012</xref>). CDKL5 is a key mediator of synaptic and network development and physiology. Recent analysis of genetic variants in CDD has indicated that CDKL5 kinase function is central to disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demarest et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector et al., 2017b</xref>). In other words, loss of kinase function seems functionally equivalent to loss of the protein.</p><p>In rodent models, CDKL5 is expressed throughout the CNS primarily in neurons, increases postnatally, and is stabilized at peak levels in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hector et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>), indicating roles during development and into adulthood. These features make it impossible to tease apart the precise role of altered CDKL5 function in mediating these symptoms in CDD. It remains unclear whether symptomatic abnormalities are due to chronic CDKL5 dysfunction, acute CDKL5 dysfunction during an earlier critical developmental time point, worsened by epilepsy, or any combination. Adult rodent models of CDD are associated with abnormal behaviors, visual disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhu and Xiong, 2019</xref>), and multiple abnormal signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schroeder et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ren et al., 2019</xref>). CDKL5 is localized to the dendritic spines of excitatory synapses as well as the nucleus of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rusconi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oi et al., 2017</xref>). CDKL5 functions in the formation of excitatory synapses with partners that include PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), NGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ricciardi et al., 2012</xref>), Shootin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nawaz et al., 2016</xref>), and actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Previous work had suggested CDKL5-specific substrates, including MeCP2, DNMT1, AMPH1, NGL-1, and HDAC4, but reliable antibodies have not been available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhu and Xiong, 2019</xref>). Recent work has identified MAP1S and microtubule end binding protein 2 (EB2) as physiological CDKL5 substrates in brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>). A phosphospecific antibody for EB2-S222 has been used to report CDKL5 activity in mouse models and human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Terzic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Nardo et al., 2022</xref>).

Inhibitory synapses appear to be unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ricciardi et al., 2012</xref>), although inhibitory synaptic currents are affected in some CDKL5 mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Rosa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tang et al., 2017</xref>). Embryonic knock-out of <italic>Cdkl5</italic> rodents either enhanced long-term potentiation (LTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Okuda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Oliveira et al., 2022</xref>) or did not affect LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yennawar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Oliveira et al., 2022</xref>) in an age-dependent fashion. Reports so far do not fully explain the presumed excitation/inhibition imbalance in epilepsy. Further, immature CDKL5-deficient mice do not have seizures or epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amendola et al., 2014</xref>) and appear insensitive to pro-convulsants such as kainate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). This paradox highlights a big gap in our understanding of CDKL5 function: early developmental onset of medically resistant epilepsy in CDD contrasts with a complete lack in experimental models. The reasons for this mismatch are unclear and include possible developmental or other rodent-specific compensations, which typically involve transcriptional changes. Finally, the role of acute CDKL5 kinase dysfunction at any developmental time point is unknown. To address this, we sought to develop a sensitive and specific inhibitor of CDKL5.</p><p><italic>CDKL5</italic> is an X-linked gene encoding a 115 kDa serine-threonine kinase and member of the CMGC family that includes cyclin-dependent kinases (<underline>C</underline>DK), <underline>M</underline>AP-kinases, glycogen synthase kinases (<underline>G</underline>SK), and cyclin-dependent kinase-like (<underline>C</underline>DKL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manning et al., 2002</xref>).

Inhibition of GSK3β in CDKL5 (young but not old) knock-out mice normalizes expression of β-catenin and S9-phospho-GSK3β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>). While upstream signaling is also affected (mTOR and AKT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), it is unclear how CDKL5 and GSK3β activities are linked in CDKL5 knock-out mice. GSK3β mediates a yin-yang interaction of LTP and LTD. Activation of GSK3β is required for the induction of GluN-LTD while inhibition occurs with the induction of LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peineau et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, development of a specific CDKL5 inhibitor must be careful to exclude cross-talk with GSK3β activity.</p><p>Here, we synthesized and characterized specific high-affinity inhibitors of CDKL5 that do not have detectable activity for GSK3β. These compounds are very soluble in water, but blood–brain barrier penetration is low. When applied directly to rat hippocampal brain slices, acute inhibition of CDKL5 selectively reduces postsynaptic function of AMPA-type glutamate receptors in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits a key form of synaptic plasticity, hippocampal LTP. These studies provide new insights into the role of CDKL5 in neuronal function and pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of CDKL5 inhibitors that lack GSK3β activity</title><p>SNS-032 and AT-7519 were initially identified as potent CDK inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vasta et al., 2018</xref>).

Radiometric enzymatic assays that measure phosphorylation of a validated substrate in the presence of [gamma-33P]-ATP were executed for all other kinases at Eurofins.

Weaker inhibition of CDK7 as well as both GSK3α and GSK3β was noted. Analysis of biochemical data reveals potent binding/inhibition of CDKL5, CDK9, CDK16, CDK17, and CDK18, and a 44-fold selectivity window between CDKL5 and the next most potently inhibited kinase (CDK7). NanoBRET data reflects a window for potent engagement of CDKL5 at which CDKs are only weakly bound by <bold>B1</bold> (≤100 nM).

As the binding pockets share a high degree of similarly, the selectivity of <bold>B1</bold> within the CDKL family was further profiled via thermal shift and enzymatic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The highest change in melting temperature (ΔTm, &gt;5°C) was noted for CDKL5, while a modest ΔTm of 3–4°C was observed for CDKL2. Radiometric enzyme assays were run for CDKL1–4 to corroborate and expand on this in-family selectivity assessment.

Inhibition of CDKL3 and CDKL4 by <bold>B1</bold> was modest (IC<sub>50</sub> = 2.1–2.7 µM), and this compound did not inhibit CDKL1. We propose that only at higher concentrations (&gt;500 nM in a biochemical assay) would inhibition of these kinases become significant, and, based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, that an even larger window may exist between CDKL5 and CDKL2 when cells are dosed with <bold>B1</bold>.

These selectivity scores correspond with high-affinity binding (PoC &lt; 10) to eight kinases for <bold>B4</bold> and four kinases for <bold>B12</bold> when profiled at 1 µM. Kinases with PoC &lt; 10 in the DiscoverX <italic>scan</italic>MAX panel when <bold>B4</bold> was screened were profiled using orthogonal binding (CDKL5) or enzymatic (remaining kinases) assays. This orthogonal profiling of <bold>B4</bold> confirmed high-affinity binding to CDKL5, GSK3α, and GSK3β (green in nested table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2B</xref>), with slightly weaker affinity for GSK3α/β than CDKL5 evaluated via the respective cellular target engagement (NanoBRET) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>).

In this approach, the time course of loss of CDKL5 function is expected to occur over several days. To clarify the more acute role of CDKL5 in regulating excitatory synaptic transmission, we applied CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) (10–100 nM) to hippocampal slices while measuring field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) in the CA1 hippocampus. While varying the stimulation strength applied to presynaptic Schaffer-collateral pathway inputs, we were able to measure the input–output responsiveness through measuring the input (fiber volley size) versus output (fEPSP slope). The slope of this relationship was reduced in a dose–response relationship by CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) within 30 min of application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In other words, for a similar input (fiber volley amplitude), the postsynaptic responsiveness (fEPSP slope) was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) in a time- and dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that the effect of acute CDKL5 inhibition by CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) on glutamatergic synaptic transmission is primarily postsynaptic. Determination that amphiphysin-1, a presynaptic protein, is phosphorylated by CDKL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sekiguchi et al., 2013</xref>) suggested a role of CDKL5 in presynaptic function. However, <italic>Cdkl5</italic> knock-out studies showed that amphiphysin-1 was not phosphorylated by CDKL5 in vivo, suggesting an alternative amphiphysin-1-independent mechanism is responsible for observed presynaptic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kontaxi et al., 2023</xref>). To investigate the presynaptic role of CDKL5 kinase function, the paired-pulse ratio across several paired-pulse intervals was measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) (100 nM × 1 hr) had no effect on the paired-pulse ratio, confirming the acute effects of CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) are restricted to the postsynapse. fEPSP slopes are mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors with NMDA-type glutamate receptors largely silent under these conditions.

While CDKL5 is a key mediator of synaptic and network development and physiology, the precise role of this kinase as explored through genetic manipulations in rodent models remains unclear. This knowledge gap prevents a full understanding of the role of CDKL5 across development and has implications for determining and interpreting when protein and gene replacement strategies may be most efficacious. As CDKL5 kinase function is central to disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demarest et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hector et al., 2017b</xref>), our development of a specific CDKL5 kinase inhibitor aims to address this gap.</p><p>Following identification of existing inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vasta et al., 2018</xref>), detailed analysis of the activity of analogs of these inhibitors in a range of assays identified three compounds with significant selectivity over GSK3β, a key requirement due to structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2011</xref>) and linkage of GSK3β to both synaptic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peineau et al., 2008</xref>) and CDKL5-related signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fuchs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fuchs et al., 2014</xref>). Like their parent inhibitors, SNS-032 for <bold>B1</bold> and AT-7519 for <bold>B4</bold> and <bold>B12</bold>, the selectivity profiling of these analogs revealed them to retain potent affinity for several CMGC family kinases. The lead compound, <bold>CAF-382 (B1</bold>), demonstrated potent activity in multiple assays, including target-based in vitro biochemical assays and functional assays utilizing both rodent neuronal cultures and brain slices. The results across all assays are consistent and align with the hypothesis that compound <bold>B1</bold> inhibits CDKL5 and blocks phosphorylation of a known CDKL5 substrate, EB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Terzic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Di Nardo et al., 2022</xref>). Several CDKs that are potently (IC<sub>50</sub> ≤ 100 nM) inhibited (CDK9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu and Cortez, 2011</xref>], PCTK1/CDK16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mikolcevic et al., 2012</xref>], PCTK2/CDK17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2017</xref>], and PCTK3/CDK18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Oliveira Pepino et al., 2021</xref>]) by <bold>B1</bold> are expressed in the brain (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org">http://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>). However, none of these have been demonstrated to have synaptic activity or localization; each are largely involved in replication and nuclear functions. Furthermore, the NanoBRET data for <bold>B1</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) supports that it is highly specific for CDKL5 when used at a proper concentration in a cellular context. Based on the NanoBRET IC<sub>50</sub> values for CDKL5 (10 nM) versus off-target CDKs (240–390 nM), at concentrations of ≤100 nM only CDKL5 is engaged by <bold>B1</bold> in cells. Thus, the effects of <bold>B1</bold> as used here are likely highly selective for CDKL5.</p><p>The biochemical activity of <bold>CAF-382</bold> (<bold>B1</bold>) against CDKL5 is &lt;5 nM, based on in vitro activity studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and for studies investigating cellular target engagement as well as activity in neuronal cultures and brain slices at the specific substrate, EB2, and synaptic physiology we observe a tenfold shift in potency (~50 nM). A loss in potency, albeit modest, when moving from a biochemical to cell-based assay is commonly observed, mostly due to suboptimal cell penetrance of the small molecule, and has been observed for several orthogonal chemical series of kinase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Drewry et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wells et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Drewry et al., 2022b</xref>). As the in vitro assay eliminates the contribution of phosphatases (and the phosphatases specific for EB2 are currently unknown), the apparent mismatch could also be due to residual presence of phosphatase-dependent and previously phosphorylated EB2 balanced with active phosphorylation by CDKL5. Nevertheless, CDKL5 kinase function is clearly necessary for the induction and/or expression of LTP, adding to the very short list of kinases required for this essential process linked to learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collingridge and Abraham, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoll, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giese and Mizuno, 2013</xref>) and finally clarifying previous genetic studies. The increased LTP seen in genetic studies suggests that observations of increased LTP in these models are compensatory and not directly due to loss of CDKL5. One interpretation of those prior studies is that CDKL5 provided a limiting ‘brake’ on LTP, with genetic loss resulting in more LTP, which is in contradistinction to our findings. The role of CDKL5 at inhibitory synapses was not specifically examined. Nevertheless, synaptic function at the developmental age studied (P20–30) requires CDKL5 activity for synaptic plasticity, suggesting that strategies that boost function at this age-equivalent in humans may be clinically important. Selective stability and plasticity-dependent insertion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors at CA1 hippocampal synapses likely require a balance between active CDKL5 kinase and phosphatases. Further studies are needed to determine this balance more specifically and continue to clarify CDKL5 function at presynapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kontaxi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>While CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) was well tolerated by mice, its short half-life (&lt;1 hr, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) would make frequent dosing a necessity. For in vitro studies, however, this compound has demonstrated excellent selectivity and potency in cells as well as brain slices. CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) is one of the best available chemical probes for interrogating CDKL5 activity in vitro, where we envision the greatest utility for future studies. While no clinical abnormalities were observed with in vivo administration of CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>), this is likely due to low brain penetration. Due to low brain penetration of CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>)<bold>,</bold> strategies that optimize brain penetration or different administration routes (such as direct brain infusion via an implantable osmotic pump) could be considered in future studies investigating the role of CDKL5 in vivo. A hit-to-lead campaign would be one approach to improve the pharmacokinetic and brain penetrance of improved analogs of CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>), furnishing others that may be better suited to study the role of CDKL5 in CDD in vivo. These studies, behavioral and perhaps with electrical assessments of seizure activity, may clarify the apparent mismatch of rodent knock-out with clinical observations. Using CDKL5 inhibitors both in vitro as done here and in vivo across developmental stages can help ascertain possible therapeutic windows for CDD. More broadly, CDKL5 inhibition is beneficial for cell survival upon ischemia or nephrotoxin-induced kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2020a</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitors we characterized here may prove useful to evaluate the promise of CDKL5 inhibition in other disease models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (human)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1573</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Routinely subjected to extensive quality control and physiological and molecular characterization (STR profiling).

The <italic>scan</italic>MAX assays are cell-free, ATP-free, and employ proprietary active site competition to quantitatively measure binding between a test compound and a kinase. Different kinase constructs, truncates or full-length, are used to enable different assays for mutant, lipid, and atypical human kinases as well as pathogen kinases. Since these assays do not require ATP, values generated are reflective of thermodynamic interaction affinities and span a large dynamic affinity range. In total, 403 wild-type (WT) human kinases were included in these analyses. Percent of control (PoC) values were generated, which allowed for the calculation of selectivity scores (S<sub>10</sub> [1 µM]) noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 2011</xref>). Selectivity scores (S<sub>10</sub> [1 µM]) were calculated using the PoC values for only WT human kinases in the DiscoverX <italic>scan</italic>MAX panel. The S<sub>10</sub> score expresses selectivity and corresponds with the percent of the kinases screened that bind with a PoC value &lt;10. A lower S<sub>10</sub> score indicates enhanced kinome-wide selectivity as a lower percentage of kinases bind with high affinity (PoC values closer to zero). Binding to a single kinase would generate an S<sub>10</sub> score of 0.002, while binding to 10 kinases yields an S<sub>10</sub> score of 0.025.

His Pur cobalt spin columns (Thermo Scientific) were used to purify the in vitro-translated proteins. To execute the in vitro kinase assays, myelin basic protein (Active Motif, 31314) was employed as a substrate for recombinant CDKL5. Myelin basic protein is used as a substrate for multiple kinases, both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, to enable in vitro kinase assays due to the presence of multiple sites for phosphorylation. As such, we and others have used this protein as a kinase substrate for evaluating kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kameshita et al., 2014</xref>).

Pregnant females were culled using cervical dislocation, embryos were removed from the uterus, and the brains were taken out. Cortices were dissected out, pooled from multiple animals, and washed three times with HBSS. An incubation with 0.25% trypsin for 15 min at 37°C was followed by four times washing with HBSS. Cells were dissociated and then counted using a hemocytometer. Neurons were plated on 12-well culture plates at a density of 300,000 cells per well. The wells were coated with 0.1 M borate buffer containing 60 µg/mL poly-D-lysine and 2.5 µg/mL laminin and placed in the incubator overnight. Neurons were plated with minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% FBS, 0.5% dextrose, 0.11 mg/mL sodium pyruvate, 2 mM glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. After 4 hr, cultures were transferred to neurobasal medium containing 1 mL of B27 (Gibco), 0.5 mM GlutaMAX, 0.5 mM glutamine, 12.5 µM glutamate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Primary neuronal cultures were kept at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Every 3–4 d, 20–30% of the maintenance media was refreshed. Between DIV14-16, neurons were treated with 5 nM, 50 nM, 500 nM, and 5 µM of the different compounds for 1 hr. The compounds were added directly to the media and the plates were placed at 37°C for the time of the treatment. DMSO was added to the well for the control condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Western blotting: TFCI</title><p>After treatment, neuronal cultures were lysed in 300 µL of 1× sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing 0.1 M DTT.

Proteins were transferred onto a Immobilon PVDF membrane (Millipore), which was then blocked in 4% milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 30 min. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C overnight, and HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature (RT) for 2 hr. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-CDKL5 (1:1000; Atlas HPA002847), rabbit anti-pS222 EB2 (1:2000; Covalab, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>), rat anti-EB2 (1:2000; Abcam ab45767), mouse anti-tubulin (1:100,000; Sigma T9026), rabbit anti-β-catenin (1:1000; Cell Signaling 9562), and rabbit anti phospho-β-catenin (Ser33/37 Thr41) (1:250, Cell Signaling 9561).

Following removal of CA3, slices were recovered in a submersion-type chamber perfused with oxygenated artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF: 124 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.2 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM D-glucose and bubbled with 95%/5% O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub>) at 28°C for at least 90 min and then submerged in a recording chamber perfused with recirculated ACSF. All electrophysiology was performed in the CA1 region at 28°C. Drugs were added to ACSF. Two twisted-tungsten bipolar-stimulating electrodes were offset in the CA1 to stimulate one or two independent Schaffer collateral-commissural pathways using a constant current source (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with a fixed duration (20 µs), each at a rate of 0.033 Hz. fEPSPs were recorded from the stratum radiatum (or stratum pyramidale region where indicated) region of CA1 using a borosilicate glass (WPI) microelectrode (pulled [Sutter, Novato, CA] to 6–9 MΩ when filled with ACSF), amplified 1000× (WPI and Warner, Hamden, CT), and digitized (National Instruments, Austin, TX) at 20 kHz using winLTP-version 2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Collingridge, 2001</xref>) to follow fEPSP slope (averaged over four EPSPs), measured using 20–80% rise times, expressed as percent of baseline, during the course of an experiment. To be sure only ‘healthy’ slices were included in our studies, responses had to meet several criteria: fiber volleys less than 1/3 of response amplitude and peak responses larger than 0.5 mV; responses and fiber volley must be stable (&lt;5% drift). Following baseline stabilization of fEPSP slope at ~50% of maximal slope for at least 30 min, measurements of synaptic physiology were performed. Stimulation was adjusted to make 4–6 measurements from ~10 to 90% maximal slope to measure input-output (I/O) curves; recordings that deviated from linear slope were rejected. Paired-pulse ratios of slopes and peaks were measured at ~50% of maximal slope. For measurements of NMDA-receptor-dependent population spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coan and Collingridge, 1985</xref>), Mg<sup>2+</sup> was omitted from recording ACSF, the recording electrode was placed in stratum pyramidale, stimulation was adjusted to evoke a first population spike &gt;2 mV, and stabilization of the second NMDA-receptor-dependent population spike (measured from the coastline of the fEPSP) for &gt;30 min was allowed prior to measuring the effect of antagonists. Theta burst LTP was induced at test strength of 2 trains, separated by 20 s, of 10 trains of 4 stimuli at 100 Hz, separated by 200 ms. Potentiation was statistically compared over the last 5 min.</p><p>For whole-cell, voltage-clamp electrophysiological recordings of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), 350 μm horizontal hippocampal slices were prepared from rats at P 20–30 similar to previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sanderson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sanderson et al., 2016</xref>). After 15 min recovery at 34°C, slices were maintained at RT until recording in modified ACSF containing (in mM) 126 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, and 2 N-acetyl cysteine. Slices were incubated in either CAF-382 (<bold>B1</bold>) (100 nM) or vehicle (water) in modified ACSF for at least 1 hr prior to recording. Using infrared–differential interference contrast microscopy for visualization, whole-cell recordings (Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp software [Molecular Devices]) from CA1 pyramidal neurons (series resistance between 3 and 6 MΩ) were performed at 29–30°C with an intracellular solution containing (in mM) 130 Cs gluconate, 1 CsCl, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4 MgATP, 0.4 MgGTP, spermine (0.01), and 2 QX-314, pH 7.3. AMPA-type EPSCs, evoked using a bipolar tungsten-stimulating electrode as above, at a holding potential of −65 mV were pharmacologically isolated using picrotoxin (50 μM; Tocris). EPSC peaks were evoked every 20 s. After establishing whole-cell access, a 3 min baseline recording at −65 mV was followed by LTP induction using a pairing protocol: cells were depolarized to 0 mV for 90 s and stimulated every 20 s then followed by delivery of 1 s × 100 Hz high-frequency stimulation. Evoked EPSC amplitudes were subsequently monitored at –65 mV. Potentiation was statistically compared over the last 5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Western blotting: UC-SOM</title><p>Hippocampal slices were prepared and recovered as for electrophysiology with the addition of cuts to isolate CA1 from the remaining hippocampus; after recovery, the slices from a given rat were incubated in inhibitor or vehicle (water) in ACSF for 2 hr. Following this, slices were suspended in STE buffer, sonicated, boiled for 5 min, and then frozen until further use. To minimize the effects of slice preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Osterweil et al., 2010</xref>) and control for slice quality, only slices that came from a preparation that met electrophysiological criteria were used. All concentrations were quantified with BCA and then loaded in duplicate on 10% polyacrylamide gel and a five-point dilution series of naive rat hippocampal homogenate was included on each gel as a standard curve for quantification of immunoreactivity/μg loaded protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grosshans and Browning, 2001</xref>). Following transfer to PolyScreen PVDF transfer membrane (Genie, Idea Scientific Company, Minneapolis, MN), blots were blocked in BSA or Carnation nonfat dry milk for 1 hr and incubated either 1 hr at RT or overnight at 4°C with antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used: sheep anti-CDKL5 (1:2000; University of Dundee, anti-CDKL5 [350-650]), rabbit anti-pS222 EB2 (1:1000; Covalab, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baltussen et al., 2018</xref>), and rat anti-EB2 (1:1000; Abcam ab45767). Blots were then subjected to three 10 min washings in Tris-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris pH 7.6) plus 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS), before being incubated with anti-sheep, anti-rat, or anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:5000) in 1% BSA or milk for 1 hr at RT, followed by three additional 10 min washes preformed with TTBS. Immunodetection was accomplished using a chemiluminescent substrate kit (SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate; Pierce) and the Alpha Innotech (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) imaging system. Quantification was performed using AlphaEase software (Alpha Innotech) and Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Immunoreactivity was reported as the density of sample bands relative to the standard curve. For phospho-proteins, ratios of immunoreactivity/μg to totals are reported without standardization. Only values falling within the standard curve generated from the dilution series included on each gel were incorporated into the final analysis. Some of the blots were then stripped (Restore PLUS Western Blot Stripping Buffer; Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and reblotted if needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis: OSU</title><p>Data were analyzed via GraphPad Prism 9.

All subsequent time points demonstrated concentrations of &lt;320 ng/mL and decreased over time.</p><p>We have made a note about this Tmax value as well as the Cmax value in the corresponding Methods section. The abbreviations used in Figure S10 are now all defined in the legend. The data included in Figure S10 was provided by Pharmaron as mean values only, without dispersion. We have indicated this in the figure legend as well as in the corresponding Methods section. We were aiming for a dose of 5 mg/kg but then had to adjust slightly given that the compound was prepared as a TFA salt. 5 mg/kg is a similar, but slightly lower dose than what has been used in mice for the parent compound of SNS-032 for cancer (xenograft model, 15 mg/kg[1]). We wanted to see if we could achieve efficacy at a slightly lower dose with our compound.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How were the doses used for the brain/plasma partitioning chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>We selected the same dose as was used for the Snapshot PK (2.29 mg/kg) to be able to have a more comprehensive profile of the compound at that dose. Since brain penetration was anticipated to be low, a higher concentration was also elected. Given the potency of B1 in vitro and to avoid potential toxicities caused by inhibition of off-targets, we chose to use lower concentrations than have been reported for SNS-032 (15 mg/kg[1]). Our goal is not to kill cancer cells, so we would like to find an efficacious dose without associated toxicity. Some of these details have been noted in the Analysis of Brain/Plasma Concentration Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details on the housing and feeding of the laboratory animals at The Francis Crick Institute should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional information to the Methods: “Animals were housed in a controlled environment with 12-hour light/dark cycle.

Please elaborate further.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this section to include additional data supporting that at the concentrations used (≤100 nM) that only CDKL5 is efficiently engaged by B1 in vitro. While this does not exclude the possibility that other kinases not included in the selectivity profiling are involved, the “unscreenable” kinome or other ATP competitive proteins would be required to bind B1 at ≤100 nM in order to influence the biology observed. While possible since we are screening ~80% of the kinome, this seems less likely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors indicate that brain penetration of B1 is rather low. Do they see this as an obstacle to using their inhibitor to further study the role of CDKL5 in CDD using in vivo assays? What about determining the kpuu, which is much more relevant pharmacologically speaking? (the shift in potency from biochemical to cell-based assays also suggests a permeability problem). Haven´t the authors considered a hit-to-lead campaign to improve B1 PK profile?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion we have further qualified the use of B1 as a cellular tool to study the pathophysiology associated with CDKL5 dysfunction in vitro.</p><p>There are other processes outside the brain (ie, acute kidney injury), where CDKL5 inhibition via an inhibitor that does not cross the BBB would be of greater utility[2, 3]. Future in vivo studies using B1 via implantation of minipumps that are capable of stable dosing (and inhibition) over extended periods of time are still possible. In this instance, the effect of CDKL5 inhibition on behavior and seizure susceptibility could be directly studied. Furthermore, we have added text to indicate that a hit-to-lead campaign could furnish an analog better suited for in vivo studies. A hit-to-lead campaign would benefit from determining the kpuu for leads, as the reviewer suggests. The IC<sub>50</sub> of B1 in cell-free assays (Luceome KinaseSeeker and CDKL5 enzymatic assays) is nearly equivalent to its IC<sub>50</sub> in the cell-based CDKL5 NanoBRET and Western blot assays: all between 1–10 nM. This supports that there is no shift in potency from biochemical to cell-based assays or permeability problems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The potential utility of B1 could be further highlighted towards the concluding section of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have highlighted in the last paragraph of the Discussion that B1 is one of the best available chemical probes for interrogating CDKL5 activity in cells and brain slices, especially across development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggest indicating the statistically significant differences in the means in Figure 6 graphically. Can the authors explain the apparent lack of a clear dose-response behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to Figure 6. While a dose-response relationship is clear with cultured neurons (Figure 5), it is not readily apparent in brain slices as presented in Figure 6. There are possible reasons. Both 45nM and 100 nM are highly effective in bringing pEB2 close to background levels, thus comparison between these doses may be problematic. Also, monolayer cultures have immediate access to inhibitors which may result in lower variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Seemingly, the authors have not observed their code to indicate different levels of statistical significance in Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 7 has been adjusted for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What conclusion(s) can the authors draw from the similar microsomal stability observed with and without NADPH? Are the differences between 0 and 30 min statistically significant? Please provide a wider interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional relevance of running the assay in the presence and absence of NADPH has been added to the Methods section. The Results section was supplemented with some additional clarification that non-NADPH dependent enzymatic degradation was not observed when B1 was analyzed. The differences between 0 and 30 min are statistically significant based on what we have observed in analyzing other published and unpublished kinase inhibitory scaffolds that significantly degrade after just 30 minutes. For example, after 30 min incubation with mouse liver microsomes, only 12.6% of a PIKfyve chemical probe and 40% of a CK2 chemical probe remained. We have added a relevant reference to support this in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have several questions to clarify some descriptions.</p><p>1.

We have supplemented the Methods section that describes the DiscoverX scanMAX panel with details about how selectivity score is calculated and what it means. Some additional perspective and examples were added to further qualify the selectivity scores. To further address the concerns raised, we have also clarified in the legend that the dots represent kinases that bind with high affinity to the compound being assayed. Furthermore, we have labeled all red dots with the corresponding kinase. We have added a sentence to the discussion to highlight the important point about these compounds retaining CMGC family potency. Finally, the tables in Figure 3 have been reconfigured to have separate columns for biochemical (binding or enzymatic) and NanoBRET data.

To execute the in vitro kinase assays, myelin basic protein (Active Motif, 31314) was employed as a substrate for recombinant CDKL5. Myelin basic protein is used as a substrate for multiple kinases, both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases, to enable in vitro kinase assays due to the presence of multiple sites for phosphorylation. As such, we and others have used this protein as a kinase substrate for evaluating kinase activity[2, 4]. MBP does not contain a CDKL5 consensus site of RPXS/T*, and as such could be considered a less than ideal substrates to study CDKL5 activity, however for in vitro kinase assays MBP is still suitable as it can be phosphorylated by CDKL5. In addition, CDKL5 is known to phosphorylate substrates that do not contain a consensus motif[3].</p><p>References</p><p>Wu, Y., et al., Cyclin-dependent kinase 7/9 inhibitor SNS-032 abrogates FIP1-like-1 platelet-derived growth factor receptor α and bcr-abl oncogene addiction in malignant hematologic cells.
