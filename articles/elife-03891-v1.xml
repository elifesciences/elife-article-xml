Often these essential elements are in short supply, and so millions of tons of fertiliser are applied to agricultural land each year to maintain crop yields. Another way for plants to gain access to scarce nutrients is to form symbiotic relationships with microorganisms that live in the soil. Plants pass on carbon-containing compounds—such as sugars—to the microbes and, in return, certain fungi provide minerals—such as phosphates—to the plants. Some plants called legumes (such as peas, beans, and clovers) can also form relationships with bacteria that convert nitrogen from the air into ammonia, which the plants then use to make molecules such as DNA and proteins.</p><p>To establish these symbiotic relationships with plants, nitrogen-fixing bacteria release chemical signals that are recognized via receptor proteins, called NFR1 and NFR5, found on the surface of the plant root cells. These signals trigger a cascade of events that ultimately lead to the plant forming an organ called ‘root nodule’ to house and nourish the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. A similar signalling mechanism is thought to take place during the establishment of symbiotic relationships between plants and certain soil fungi.</p><p>A plant protein called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (or SYMRK for short) that is also located on the root cell surface is required for both bacteria–plant and fungi–plant associations to occur. However, the exact role of this protein in these processes was unclear. Ried et al. have now investigated this by taking advantage of a property of cell surface receptor proteins: if some of these proteins are made in excessive amounts they activate their signalling cascades even when the initial signal is not present.</p><p>Ried et al. engineered plants called <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> to produce high levels of SYMRK, NFR1, or NFR5. Each of these changes was sufficient to trigger the plants to develop root nodules in the absence of microbes. Genes associated with the activation of the signalling cascade involved the formation of root nodules were also switched on when each of the three proteins was produced in large amounts. In contrast, only an excess of SYMRK could activate genes related to fungi–plant associations. Ried et al. also found that, while SYMRK can function in the absence of the NFRs, NFR1 and NFR5 need each other to function. These data suggest that the receptor proteins play a key role in the decision between the establishment of an association with a bacterium or a fungus.</p><p>As an excess of symbiotic receptors caused plants to form symbiotic structures, Ried et al. propose that this strategy could be used to persuade plants that usually do not form symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to do so. If this is possible, it might lead us to engineer crop plants to form symbiotic interactions with nitrogen-fixing bacteria; this would help increase crop yields and enable crops to be grown in nitrogen-poor environments without the addition of extra fertiliser.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03891.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03891.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Lotus japonicus</italic></kwd><kwd>plant root symbiosis</kwd><kwd>receptor-like kinase</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>plant development</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parniske</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ectopic expression of Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) in roots of the legume <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> resulted in spontaneous activation of nodule organogenesis and mycorrhiza-related gene expression in the absence of microbial symbionts or signalling molecules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Plants circumvent nutrient deficiencies by establishing mutualistic symbioses with arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi or nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and <italic>Frankia</italic> bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gutjahr and Parniske, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldroyd, 2013</xref>). One of the first steps in the reciprocal recognition between rhizobia and the legume <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> is the perception of bacterial lipo-chitooligosaccharides, so called nodulation factors, by the two lysin motif (LysM) receptor-like kinases (RLKs) Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1) and NFR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Madsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Broghammer et al., 2012</xref>). Nodulation factor application induces two genetically separable calcium signatures in root hair cells; an early transient influx into the cytoplasm and within minutes calcium-spiking - periodic calcium oscillations in and around plant cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ehrhardt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miwa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oldroyd, 2013</xref>). (Lipo)-chitooligosaccharides have also been isolated from AM fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maillet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Genre et al., 2013</xref>) and a NFR5-related LysM-RLK from <italic>Parasponia</italic> has been pinpointed as a likely candidate for their perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Op Den Camp et al., 2011</xref>). The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for AM and root nodule symbiosis. A subset of these genes is essential for either the generation or the decoding of calcium-spiking. In <italic>L. japonicus</italic>, the former group encodes the RLK Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stracke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>), two cation-permeable ion channels CASTOR and POLLUX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Imaizumi-Anraku et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Charpentier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Venkateshwaran et al., 2012</xref>) as well as the nucleoporins NUP85, NUP133, and NENA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanamori et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groth et al., 2010</xref>). The latter group encodes Calcium Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase (CCaMK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tirichine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2013</xref>) and CYCLOPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yano et al., 2008</xref>), which form a complex that has been implicated in the deciphering of calcium-spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kosuta et al., 2008</xref>). Phosphorylation by CCaMK activates CYCLOPS, a DNA-binding transcriptional activator of the <italic>NODULE INCEPTION</italic> gene (<italic>NIN</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schauser et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Singh et al., 2014</xref>). NIN itself is a legume-specific and root nodule symbiosis-related transcription factor and regulates the <italic>Nuclear Factor-Y subunit</italic> genes <italic>NF-YA1</italic> and <italic>NF-YB1</italic> that control the cell division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soyano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yoro et al., 2014</xref>). The paradigm of a common signalling pathway for both symbioses bears important open questions about the molecular mechanisms that ensure the appropriate cellular response for AM fungi on the one hand and for rhizobia on the other hand.</p><p>SYMRK carries an ectodomain composed of a malectin-like domain (MLD), and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) region that experienced structural diversification during evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Markmann et al., 2008</xref>) and is cleaved to release the MLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>). Although SYMRK has been cloned several years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stracke et al., 2002</xref>), its precise function in symbiosis is still enigmatic. While <italic>nfr</italic> mutants lack most cellular and physiological responses to rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>), including nodulation factor-induced calcium influx and calcium-spiking, root hairs of <italic>symrk</italic> mutants respond with calcium influx to nodulation factor but not with calcium-spiking, and do not develop infection threads with rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stracke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miwa et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these phenotypic observations, <italic>SYMRK</italic> was positioned downstream of the <italic>NFRs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Radutoiu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miwa et al., 2006</xref>). Importantly, it has not been conclusively resolved whether <italic>SYMRK</italic> plays an active signalling role in symbiosis or, alternatively, is involved in mechanical stress desensitisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Esseling et al., 2004</xref>). To approach this issue, we built on the observation that specific mutations in, or over-abundance of mammalian receptor tyrosine kinases on the cell surface is linked with the development of some cancers caused by spontaneous receptor complex formation and inappropriate initiation of signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schlessinger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shan et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that similar behaviour could be triggered by overexpression of symbiosis-related plant RLKs, providing a tool to further dissect the specific signalling pathways they address.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Symbiotic <italic>RLKs</italic> trigger spontaneous formation of root nodules</title><p>To achieve overexpression, we generated constructs expressing functional SYMRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>), NFR5, or NFR1 under the control of the strong <italic>L. japonicus Ubiquitin</italic> promoter and added C-terminal mOrange fluorescent tags for detection purposes (<italic>pUB:SYMRK-mOrange, pUB:NFR5-mOrange, pUB:NFR1-mOrange</italic>). The functionality of the <italic>NFR</italic> constructs was confirmed by their ability to restore nodulation in the corresponding, otherwise nodulation deficient, <italic>nfr</italic> mutant roots to the level of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> wild-type roots transformed with the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intriguingly, transgenic expression of any of the three symbiotic RLK versions in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> roots was sufficient to spontaneously activate the entire nodule organogenesis pathway as evidenced by the formation of nodule-like structures in the absence of rhizobia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The presence of peripheral vascular bundles instead of a central root vasculature unambiguously identified these lateral organs as spontaneous nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Spontaneous nodule primordia or nodules were present on 90% (116 out of 129), 23% (30 out of 133), 11% (16 out of 182), and 0% (0 out of 164) of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> root systems at 60 days post transformation (dpt) with, respectively, <italic>pUB:SYMRK-mOrange, pUB:NFR5-mOrange, pUB:NFR1-mOrange,</italic> or the empty vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A total of 810 empty vector roots generated throughout the course of this study did not develop spontaneous nodules in any of the genetic backgrounds and time points tested. Roots expressing functional <italic>SYMRK-RFP</italic> from its native promoter (<italic>pSYMRK:SYMRK-RFP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kosuta et al., 2011</xref>) and grown in the absence of rhizobia did not develop spontaneous nodules, indicating that spontaneous nodulation was triggered by <italic>SYMRK</italic> expression from the <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> promoter and not by the addition of a C-terminal tag alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Moreover, the expression of non-tagged <italic>SYMRK</italic> under the control of the <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> promoter triggered the formation of spontaneous nodules. In comparison to roots transformed with the tagged <italic>SYMRK</italic> version, a lower number of roots transformed with non-tagged <italic>SYMRK</italic> contained spontaneous nodules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). One explanation for this observation is that the C-terminal mOrange tag might result in alterations in the relative amount of signalling-active SYMRK. Another possibility is that the presence of the tag improves homo- and/or hetero-dimerization, which subsequently leads to downstream signalling. Our results demonstrate that overexpression of <italic>NFR1-mOrange</italic>, <italic>NFR5-mOrange</italic>, or <italic>SYMRK</italic> results in the activation and execution of the nodule organogenesis pathway in the absence of external symbiotic stimulation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03891.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Symbiotic <italic>RLKs</italic> mediate spontaneous formation of root nodules.</title><p>Hairy roots of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> Gifu wild-type transformed with the empty vector (EV), <italic>pUB:NFR1-mOrange</italic> (<italic>NFR1</italic>), <italic>pUB:NFR5-mOrange</italic> (<italic>NFR5</italic>), or <italic>pUB:SYMRK-mOrange</italic> (<italic>SYMRK</italic>) were generated.

Alternatively, spontaneous SYMRK-mediated signalling might be independent of any LysM-RLK, however, given the large number of LysM-RLKs in legumes (17 in <italic>L. japonicus</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lohmann et al., 2010</xref>), it is difficult to test the latter hypothesis conclusively.</p><p>SYMRK undergoes cleavage of its ectodomain, resulting in a truncated RLK molecule called SYMRK-ΔMLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>).

As our SYMRK antibody does not recognise endogenous SYMRK-ΔMLD, we were not able to assess whether overexpressed NFR1 or NFR5 also associates with this truncated SYMRK variant in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> roots. In a hypothetical scenario, the SYMRK-ΔMLD complex with NFR5 forms constitutively to prevent inappropriate signalling, for example in the absence of rhizobia. The recruitment of NFR1, a hypothetical signal initiation event, would be promoted by the presence of nodulation factor. Our observation that upon overexpression in <italic>L. japonicus</italic> both NFR1 and NFR5 seem to interact with full-length SYMRK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggests the formation of a ternary complex. This hypothetical complex has dual functionality: it signals through SYMRK on one hand to activate CCaMK and through the NFR1-NFR5 complex on the other hand to trigger the infection-related parallel pathways discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Madsen et al. (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayashi et al. (2010)</xref>. It is possible that SYMRK has a dual—positive and negative—regulatory role: on the one hand SYMRK promotes signalling but on the other hand SYMRK-ΔMLD may be involved in preventing inappropriate signalling. A negative regulatory role would explain the exaggerated root hair response of <italic>symrk</italic> mutants to rhizobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stracke et al., 2002</xref>), since NFR1–NFR5 interaction is no longer under governance by SYMRK-ΔMLD.

Since a LysM-RLK closely related to NFR5 has been implicated in AM signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Op Den Camp et al., 2011</xref>), this finding also provides a conceptual mechanism for the integration of signals from the rhizobial and fungal microsymbiont through alternative complex formation between SYMRK and NFRs or AM factor receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Specificity originates from the receptors</title><p>One question that has puzzled the community since the postulate of a common symbiosis pathway is how the decision between the developmental pathways of AM or root nodule symbiosis is made when the signalling employs identical signalling components.

Candidates for such regulators include the identified interactors of the kinase domains of NFR1, NFR5, and SYMRK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kevei et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lefebvre et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mbengue et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Den Herder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toth et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yuan et al., 2012</xref>).

It is important to avoid free water at the bottom of the Weck jar. Plants were grown in Weck jars in a growth chamber (16 hr light/8 hr dark; 24°C) for 1.5–6 weeks. For complementation experiments, plants were transferred from FP plates to open pots containing 300 ml dried sand/vermiculite and 75 ml FP medium at 23 dpt. After 1 week, plants were inoculated with 25 ml per pot of a <italic>M. loti</italic> MAFF303099 <italic>Ds</italic>RED suspension in FP medium set to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.05. Roots were phenotyped 15 days after inoculation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Non-denaturing protein extraction from <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> leaves and immunoprecipitation experiments</title><p>Protein extraction and immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Non-denaturing protein extraction from <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> hairy roots and immuno-enrichment experiments</title><p>Plant tissue was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle.

Samples were incubated for 10 min at 4°C with 20 rpm end-over mixing, and subsequently centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C and 16,000 RCF. 30 µl of each protein extract was mixed with 10 µl 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (input; 25% (vol/vol) 0.5 M Tris–HCl (pH 6.8), 35% (vol/vol) 20% SDS, 40% (vol/vol) 100% Glycerol, 0.03 g/ml DTT, dash of Bromphenol blue). For immuno-enrichment procedures, 30 µl RFP binder coupled to magnetic particles (rtm-20; Chromotek, Germany) were washed in wash buffer (WB; 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X 100). Between 500 and 1000 µl of the protein extract was added to the beads and immuno-enrichment was performed for 4 hr at 4°C with 20 rpm end-over mixing, followed by 15 min magnetic separation at 4°C. Supernatant was removed and beads were washed twice with WB. 40 µl 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the beads and both beads and input were incubated 10 min at 56°C. After heating, beads were magnetically collected at the tube wall for 5 min and 40 µl of the supernatant (eluate) was taken. For SDS-PAGE, 20 µl of the input or eluate were loaded on each gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antolín-Llovera et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>T90, <italic>NIN, SbtM1,</italic> and <italic>SbtS</italic> promoter analysis in <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic></title><p>GUS activity originating from the activation of promoter:<italic>GUS</italic> reporters was visualized by X-Gluc staining as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Groth et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Expression analysis</title><p>Transgenic root systems of <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants were harvested 40 dpt. 80 mg root fresh weight per sample was applied for total RNA extraction using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA kit (Sigma–Aldrich, Germany).
