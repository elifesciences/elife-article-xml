Here, we a generate single-cell atlas of the developing chick epiblast from late gastrulation through early neurulation stages to define transcriptional changes in the emerging ‘neural plate border’ as well as other regions of the epiblast. Focusing on the border territory, the results reveal gradual establishment of heterogeneous neural plate border signatures, including novel genes that we validate by fluorescent in situ hybridization. Developmental trajectory analysis infers that segregation of neural plate border lineages only commences at early neurulation, rather than at gastrulation as previously predicted. We find that cells expressing the prospective neural crest marker <italic>Pax7</italic> contribute to multiple lineages, and a subset of premigratory neural crest cells shares a transcriptional signature with their border precursors. Together, our results suggest that cells at the neural plate border remain heterogeneous until early neurulation, at which time progenitors become progressively allocated toward defined neural crest and placode lineages.

The neural plate ultimately generates the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the surrounding non-neural ectoderm forms the epidermis of the skin as well as the epithelial lining of the mouth and nasal cavities. At the interface of these tissues is a territory referred to as the ‘neural plate border’ which in vertebrates contains precursors of neural crest, neural, and placodal lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ezin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Streit, 2002</xref>). Neural crest and ectodermal placodes share numerous common features including the ability to migrate or invaginate and form multiple cell types. During neurulation, neural crest cells come to reside within the dorsal neural tube where they undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Subsequently, they delaminate and migrate throughout the embryo, settle at their final destinations and differentiate into numerous derivatives including neurons and glia of the peripheral nervous system as well as cartilage, bone, and connective tissues elements of the head and face. Like neural crest cells, cranial placode cells become internalized, and then differentiate into sensory neurons and sense organs (nose, ears, lens) of the head. Aberrant neural crest or placode development causes a number of developmental disorders affecting craniofacial structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siismets and Hatch, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vega-Lopez et al., 2018</xref>), the enteric nervous system (e.g. Hirschsprung’s disease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler Tjaden and Trainor, 2013</xref>), and the heart (e.g. Persistent Truncus Arteriosus; CHARGE syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pauli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gandhi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, a number of malignancies, including melanoma, neuroblastoma. and glioma, are known to arise from neural crest derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tomolonis et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An ongoing question is whether individual neural plate border cells are specified toward a particular lineage (i.e. neural crest, placode, or CNS) or if they have the potential to become any cell type that arises from the border. It has been suggested that progenitors of these different lineages may be regionalized within the neural plate border, with the more lateral cells contributing to the placodes and the more medial region giving rise to neural and neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlosser, 2008</xref>). Such segregation has been proposed to result from the influence of graded expression of signalling factors emanating from surrounding tissues, for example Wnts and FGFs, on multipotent neural plate border cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schille and Schambony, 2017</xref>). Alternatively, individual neural plate border cells predetermined toward a particular lineage may be intermingled within the border. A recent study in the chick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roellig et al., 2017</xref>) showed that while medial and lateral regions of the border can be discerned by lineage markers, there is significant co-expression of markers characteristic of multiple lineages (neural crest, neural plate, and placodal) across the epiblast. Moreover, this overlap of lineage markers within the neural plate border is maintained from gastrulation through neurulation suggesting that these cells may maintain plasticity through neurulation stages. Thus, while some neural plate border cells may be predisposed toward a particular fate, others retain the ability to generate multiple lineages. However, the timing at which neural plate border cells emerge and become distinguishable from neural and non-neural ectoderm has not been conclusively characterized, complicating the assessment of cell heterogeneity within the neural plate border territory. Here, we provide single-cell transcriptomes of the developing chick epiblast from late gastrulation through early neurulation, allowing us to annotate the neural plate border region and explore heterogeneity therein. The results expand knowledge of transcriptional changes in the border as a function of time, revealing the full complexity of co-expressed genes in this multipotent tissue. Moreover, by using whole epiblast tissue, we have generated the first single-cell atlas of early chicken development enabling a contextual view of neural plate border emergence from surrounding tissues.</p><p>One study using an ex ovo culturing method of explants from the chicken embryos proposed that a pre-neural plate border region is established as early as stage Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Prasad et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, an in vitro model to derive neural crest cells from human embryonic stem cells shows that pre-border genes can be induced by Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung et al., 2016</xref>). However, these observations have not been thoroughly addressed in vivo. Therefore, the questions of how and when neural plate border cells establish/retain multipotency and the comprehensive gene dynamics underlying these processes remain open.</p><p>Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides a unique platform to address the intriguing question of when a neural plate border transcriptional signature arises in an in vivo context. To this end, we examined single-cell transcriptomes from the epiblast of gastrulating to neurulating chick embryos to determine the time course of emergence of the neural plate border. The chick represents an ideal system for these studies since avian embryos develop as a flat blastodisc at the selected time points, highly reminiscent of human development at comparable stages. Interestingly, our results show that the border is not transcriptionally distinct until the beginning of neurulation (HH7), when neural plate border markers define a discrete subcluster of the ectoderm. Furthermore, RNA velocity measurements imply that segregation of the neural plate border commences at HH6, but is more profoundly underway at HH7, with definitive neural crest clusters only emerging in the elevating neural folds. Velocity analysis also suggests that <italic>Pax7</italic>+ cells are not restricted to a neural crest fate but rather are capable of giving rise to all derivatives of the neural plate border. The data also reveal numerous novel factors dynamically expressed across the developing epiblast as well as indicating putative drivers of neural plate border trajectories. Taken together, the data reveal dynamic changes in an emerging neural plate border that becomes progressively segregated into defined lineages, that is complete only late in neurulation. Furthermore, the data can be further interrogated to examine transcriptional changes in other regions emerging from the epiblast.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell analysis of the avian epiblast during gastrulation (HH4 – 5)</title><p>To resolve the transcriptional signatures of individual neural plate border cells in the context of the developing embryo, we first performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of the epiblast of gastrulating chick embryos at stages HH4-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamburger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>).

To address this question, we used scVelo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergen et al., 2020</xref>) to resolve gene-specific transcriptional dynamics of these embryonic populations across time. This method is derived from RNA velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">La Manno et al., 2018</xref>), which measures the ratio of spliced and unspliced transcripts and uses this information to predict future cell states, incorporating a critical notion of latent time that allows reconstruction of the temporal sequence of transcriptional steps. By generalizing the RNA velocities through dynamic modelling, this method is ideally suited to our analysis, as it reflects transitions in progressing, non-stationary embryonic populations such as neural crest, placode and neural plate progenitors under study here.</p><p>To assess the progression of ectodermal progenitors across time-points from epiblast to onset of neural crest emigration, we first integrated the ectoderm clusters from each stage namely; HH5-Cl4, HH6-Cl3 + 9 and HH7-Cl8 + 10.

This suggests successful inter-sample incorporation into a single reference with no resultant batch bias. Ectoderm cells from HH5 were spread amongst the neural plate and the non-neural ectoderm clusters from HH6 and HH7. The neural crest clusters were more discrete, with the bona fide neural crest cluster clearly segregated from neural and mesenchymal neural crest clusters as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). The HH8+ dataset also included a neuroepithelial-like cluster, characterized by <italic>Cdh1, Epcam,</italic> and <italic>FoxG1</italic> expression.

This enabled us to follow the transcriptional velocity of individual genes and resolve their dynamics at the single-cell level. Significantly this provides a high-resolution temporal dimension to our understanding of the changing ontology of the neural plate border and its derivatives. The results suggest that the ectoderm is initiating the division of trajectories between neural and non-neural progenitors at HH5, but the neural plate border is not yet transcriptionally distinct. At HH6 and HH7, the neural plate border population is emerging at the interface of these tissues, from which multiple lineages manifest by HH7. This analysis also shows neural-neural crest cells are the first to surface from the neural plate border and neural plate. From these, the bona fide neural crest emerges followed by mesenchymal neural crest. Furthermore, this analysis shows a subset of premigratory neural crest cells share signatures with their precursors from neural plate border cells from HH6 and HH7, demonstrating that some early neural crest cells are not yet restricted to a particular lineage.</p><p>Taken together our data show that cells of the emerging neural plate border are not characterized by unique transcriptional signatures, but share features with cells of the surrounding ectoderm. This highlights the heterogeneity of the neural plate border whereby <italic>Pax7</italic>+ cells are integrated with other ectoderm populations. While Pax7 is the predominant factor in the neural plate border and has been suggested to label neural crest precursors as early as HH5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basch et al., 2006</xref>), the complexity and co-expression signatures are what endow neural plate border cells with their unique multipotency compared to neural plate and ectoderm cells. Interestingly, we note that neural plate border signatures are not apparent until HH7, later than previously suggested. By contrast, placodal trajectories were discernible from HH6. Moreover, we uncover the possibility that <italic>Pax7</italic>+ cells give rise to all neural plate border lineages, but lose multipotency signatures at the onset of lineage specific trajectories. Our analysis provides important insights into genes underlying the progressive segregation of the emergence of early neural crest and placode progenitors at the neural plate border. By revealing lineage trajectories over developmental time, this resolves the timing of neural plate border lineage segregation whilst also informing on dynamics of multipotency programmes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fertilized hens eggs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sunstate Ranch Sylmar CA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3 Library</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 X Genomics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat. #1000075</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Seurat v3CellRanger v3.1.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stuart et al., 2019</xref> Doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031">10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031</ext-link><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zheng et al., 2017</xref> DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14049">10.1038/ncomms14049</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chick embryos</title><p>Fertilized chicken eggs, obtained from Sunstate Ranch Sylmar CA, were incubated at 37°C with approximately 40% humidity.

the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Segregation of neural crest specific lineage trajectories from a heterogeneous neural plate border territory only emerges at neurulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consideration of the reviewers' feedback and following further consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. While this manuscript has not reached the benchmark of a Research Article, on noting the potential value of the dataset for future study of the development of the neuroectoderm, the neural crest cells and the ectodermal placode, we are keen to provide the opportunity for publishing this paper as Resource Article. Resubmission of a new manuscript would require addressing the critiques raised by the reviewers in this round of review, which are paraphrased below and outlined in the three reviewer reports.</p><p>The reviewers recognised that this study has collated a potentially useful dataset of the stage-resolved single-cell transcriptome of chick epiblast/ectoderm cells that may inform the development of the epiblast to neural folds and the molecular characteristics of the neural plate border cell population from which neuroepithelium, ectodermal neural placode and neural crest cells emerge. The findings reiterate the concept of lateral neural plate border harbours a heterogenous population of ectoderm cells and members of this population are precursors of the neural crest cell lineage during neurulation. The new knowledge gleaned from the transcriptome data is that the neural plate border cells are specified (and acquire the neural border signature, which includes novel marker genes identified in this study) progressively/dynamically during neurulation, but no insight is provided on how the neural border cells establish multipotency (e.g., re-gaining pluripotency factor activity). The data further showed that the segregation of the neural crest cell lineage and the placodal ectoderm lineage from the neural plate borders cells may occur at early neurulation, which is later than previously anticipated. Mining the transcriptome data of the emerging cell lineages has inferred the putative molecular drivers of the trajectory of neural plate border cells to neural crest cell lineage and placodal ectoderm lineage. There is no follow-up verification of the functional attributes of these drivers or the molecular network in the development of these two lineages. The merit of this study would be enhanced if functional analysis has been undertaken to identify which are the key drivers and their functional role in the segregation of the two divergent neural border cell lineages and the early steps of differentiation of the neural crest cells.</p><p>Re-submission as a resource report will require provision of the missing detail of the experimental design of the single-cell transcriptome analysis and the data analytics pipeline, improving the style of presentation to allow a better comprehension of the important novel findings of data mining. addressing the utility and limitation of the transcriptome dataset to gains knowledge that enables the formulation of testable hypothesis on the molecular activity driving neural plate development. emergence of the neural plate border cell lineages.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The work by Williams et al. represents a significant effort to understand the lineages that emerge from the epiblast, which is the layer of cells that will give rise to the chick embryo, during the period from gastrulation through neurulation. Previously published work has addressed the question of when and where cells in the epiblast at the neural plate border become specified, but the authors strive to refine such data further and more precisely by using single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the signatures of these lineages in vivo. The authors focus on identifying cells that generate the placodes, neural crest, and neural tissues. Studying these populations of cells is well justified because of their relevance to human disease phenotypes particularly in the craniofacial complex, heart, gut, and malignancies more broadly. Another important contribution of the work is the descriptions of novel markers, which may ultimately result in identifying new genes associated with human disease.</p><p>A strength is that the manuscript is concise, clear, and well-written. Additionally, the figures are nicely organized and easy to follow. The images of embryonic gene expression (both known markers and validation of novel genes) are excellent in terms of tissue quality and confocal microscopy, and they provide robust support for the conclusions. The strategies employed for single-cell RNA-seq analysis represent a technical advance, and the results generated by this study will be of broad interest to the community. The use Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) with multiplexed probes to validate the RNA-seq dataset adds significant depth to the analysis.</p><p>A weakness is that the study is primarily descriptive with no experimental test of a hypothesis. For example, the work could benefit from some loss-of-function analyses for any of the novel genes identified. On this point, the authors have an excellent track record using high-throughput screening with chick embryos and morpholinos either in terms of characterizing gene regulatory networks (GRNs) or assaying for developmental phenotypes related to the neural crest. Moreover, work from the Bronner and Sauka-Spengler labs has previously contributed much in the way of our understanding of the GRNs that direct the delineation of the neural and non-neural lineages in the ectoderm. A discussion of how the current results fit into the larger framework of GRNs (both for known and novel genes) would provide a more complete context for the work. A schematic figure that maps these genes onto a GRN could be quite informative and clarifying.</p><p>Nonetheless, the results are significant in that they advance our understanding of the spatial and temporal expression of genes that are associated with cell specification and lineage restriction during the embryonic time course from gastrulation to neurulation. The conclusions are further supported by a modified RNA velocity analysis that reconstructs the temporal sequence of transcriptional steps and resolves gene-specific transcriptional dynamics over time. Importantly, based on this analysis, the authors find that cells from the emerging neural plate border are more heterogeneous than previously believed and they do not see the emergence of neural crest cells as a distinct lineage until later than what has been suggested by other studies.</p><p>Overall, the authors could do more in both the Introduction and the Discussion to emphasize exactly how their current study advances the field beyond simply describing the timing of specification and lineage restriction. This would be especially helpful since the authors cite earlier work from the Bronner lab (Roellig et al. 2017), which demonstrates that significant co-expression of neural crest, placode, and CNS markers persists in the neural plate border from gastrulation through neurulation. In fact, this earlier work has a similar conclusion that cells at the neural plate border contribute to multiple ectodermal lineages throughout neurulation and even after neural tube closure.</p><p>The sample sizes of embryos and numbers of cells collected are unclear. For example, the authors state that they isolate 2398 cells from 8 embryos (i.e., epiblasts?) at stage HH4. Does this total number consist of approximately 300 cells per embryo? The authors should explain why this number is sufficient as a representative and unbiased sample size in light of some reports that estimate up to 50,000 epithelial cells in the epiblast at this stage (see for example: Serrano Nájera G, Weijer CJ. Cellular processes driving gastrulation in the avian embryo. Mech Dev. 2020;163:103624). In the Methods section they state that &quot;approximately 10,000 cells/stage were collected&quot; and so it is hard to make sense of the sample sizes, etc. The authors should include the total number of embryos (n) for each RNA-seq analysis performed along with the number of cells (e.g., p. 15, lines 468-472).</p><p>Moreover, how can the authors claim with certainty that they are &quot;profiling the majority of neural plate border cells&quot; (p. 2, line 62)? Could there be other cells in the neural plate border that do not express Pax7 and Tfap2A?

The main impact of the study is the first detailed single-cell analysis of early chick embryos, which should complement similar studies in human, mouse, and other vertebrates. Major cell types are described at each stage, and this is coupled with in situ hybridization for a set of known and novel genes, as well as RNA velocity to deduce cell trajectories (based on the ratio of old cytoplasmic to new nuclear transcripts). Based on the absence of a distinct Pax7/Tfap2a cluster during gastrulation stages, the authors make an argument that the neural plate border and placode/neural crest does not emerge until later stages (i.e. neurulation), later than previously reported. However, the study largely falls short of making significant new insights into the timing and lineage trajectories of placodes and neural crest. The manuscript is very dense with descriptive data of gene expression in numerous clusters, which makes it difficult to extract big picture messages about lineage emergence. There are also numerous typos and figure errors that make the reading difficult. The RNA velocity analysis is not particularly convincing as to lineage emergence, and there are numerous overstatements about the ability of such single-cell genomics approaches to define in vivo lineages in the absence of experimental confirmation. While some new genes with neural plate border expression are presented, others are already well known or are shown to have very broad expression, thus limiting their utility in defining domains. There is a feeling that this work is quite preliminary in terms of its analysis of neural plate border lineages, though it is clearly an important resource for the chick embryology community.</p><p>1. Several statements are made as to lineage analysis, e.g. with relation to Pax7+ cells. Single-cell analysis can only make predictions about lineages, which need to be experimentally confirmed. These statements should therefore be removed or more carefully explained. For example, lines 51-52 (and also lines 276-277 and line 407) : &quot;We further demonstrate that Pax7+ cells are not restricted to a neural crest fate and are capable of giving rise to all derivatives of the neural plate border.&quot;</p><p>2. In the Intro, it stated that the study identifies numerous novel factors, but the in situs presented show a combination of novel factors and many known factors (e.g. Dlx6, Msx1, Gbx2), with several of the &quot;novel&quot; genes (e.g. Ing5) being much broader than just prospective NPB territory. Similarly in Figure 4, many of the in situ markers are quite broad and therefore it is hard to determine their utility in defining specific domains (e.g. Gbx2 and Znf703). It is also an overstatement to say the study has identified key drivers of NPB trajectories in the absence of functional assays.</p><p>3. The known roles of Irf6 and Grhl3 in driving periderm fate should be better integrated in the single-cell analysis. The in situs confirm that these are expressed quite broadly and mainly in the overlying periderm.</p><p>4. The scVelo in Figure 5 is not particularly informative.

Specifically, they provide an atlas of whole embryo epiblast at stages 4,HH, 5HH, 6HH and 7H. They further subcluster the ectoderm cells and use cVelo algorithm (based on velocity of RNA splicing) to infer trajectories and lineages in this dataset.</p><p>Description of each stage and each cluster of cells is carefully done and retrieves the canonical markers for each territory. The neural plate border is found expressing pax7 early on, as previously described in chick embryos (Basch et al., 2006) but a specific clustering of these cells is not found, suggesting that the identity of the neural plate border is rather the overlap of gene signatures from adjacent tissues and that the neural crest and the placode signatures arise at the early neurula stage, in the elevating neural folds of the embryo.</p><p>From previous lineage tracing studies done at the gastrula stage, it was shown that the border between the prospective neural plate and the future non-neural ectoderm gives rise to four main cell fates: dorsal neural tube cells, neural crest cells, posterior placodal cells and non-neural ectoderm cells (e.g. Steventon et al., 2009). Genetically, this territory has previously been defined by the overlap between gene expressions defining the non-neural ectoderm and the neural ectoderm (e.g. De Crozé et al., 2011, Grooves and Labonne 2014)</p><p>Previous transcriptomic studies have pointed out the high similarity of the neural plate border territory compared to adjacent ectoderm regions, the failure of &quot;classical&quot; biostatistics tools to evidence a specific signature and the need for tailored strategies to do so (Plouhinec et al., 2017). Using those, the neural plate border could be defined from gastrula stage by its expression of pax3/pax7 ortholog and a couple of other genes, then by a more extended signature at neurulation stage.</p><p>In conclusion, although this study explores the same question with the latest tools of single cell transcriptomics, it is mostly descriptive and brings little novel insight into the biology of neural and neural plate border induction. However, it highlights a series of additional genes that could be of interest for further functional study.</p><p>In order to increase the impact of this study, functional analysis of some key genes should be added.

Given the pandemic, we feel that these experiments would not be feasible in a reasonable amount of time. Moreover, the present manuscript is already overly long.

A schematic figure that maps these genes onto a GRN could be quite informative and clarifying.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. To address this, we have added discussion of how some of the genes identified here fit into the broader neural crest gene regulatory network using previously published data (Williams et al., 2019) (lines 384-386 and 392-394). While the idea of putting some of the novel genes described here into a GRN is very attractive, it is premature in the absence of functional data since it is not possible to construct a GRN on expression data alone; this would require epistatic/regulatory data which is outside the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors could do more in both the Introduction and the Discussion to emphasize exactly how their current study advances the field beyond simply describing the timing of specification and lineage restriction. This would be especially helpful since the authors cite earlier work from the Bronner lab (Roellig et al. 2017), which demonstrates that significant co-expression of neural crest, placode, and CNS markers persists in the neural plate border from gastrulation through neurulation. In fact, this earlier work has a similar conclusion that cells at the neural plate border contribute to multiple ectodermal lineages throughout neurulation and even after neural tube closure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this lack of information. To address this point, we have amended parts of the introduction and discussion as suggested. In particular we emphasize how our analysis expands on previous work (lines 38-41) and how our whole epiblast sc-RNA-seq data sets provide a contextual environment for understanding how the neural plate border emerges during early neurulation and diverges from the surrounding neural and non-neural ectoderm (line 381). We also further discuss how the genes identified here might fit into the broader neural crest GRN (lines 382-394) and we highlight the notion that neural plate border cells are not a unique population characterized by an exclusive gene expression signature, but rather that they share features with the surrounding tissues (lines 409-415).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sample sizes of embryos and numbers of cells collected are unclear. For example, the authors state that they isolate 2398 cells from 8 embryos (i.e., epiblasts?) at stage HH4. Does this total number consist of approximately 300 cells per embryo? The authors should explain why this number is sufficient as a representative and unbiased sample size in light of some reports that estimate up to 50,000 epithelial cells in the epiblast at this stage (see for example: Serrano Nájera G, Weijer CJ. Cellular processes driving gastrulation in the avian embryo. Mech Dev. 2020;163:103624). In the Methods section they state that &quot;approximately 10,000 cells/stage were collected&quot; and so it is hard to make sense of the sample sizes, etc. The authors should include the total number of embryos (n) for each RNA-seq analysis performed along with the number of cells (e.g., p. 15, lines 468-472).</p><p>Moreover, how can the authors claim with certainty that they are &quot;profiling the majority of neural plate border cells&quot; (p. 2, line 62)? Could there be other cells in the neural plate border that do not express Pax7 and Tfap2A? For each experiment, the authors should try to estimate how many cells (or what percentage) are not included in their analyses and discuss what the implications are for the interpretation of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. We have now added the number of embryos and cells used in the analysis to the text (lines 71, 84, 97 and 102) and also provide a supplemental table detailing the number of embryos/cells used at each stage. Along with the CellRanger output.</p><p>It is likely that the epiblast contains up to 50,000 cells; however approximately 50% of cells may be lost during the dissociation/FACS process. Furthermore, the 10X Chromium platform has limited loading capacity (46.6ul), and as it is not advisable to spin down cells and resuspend in a smaller volume, the number cells loaded is restricted. Moreover, the 10X Chromium platform can only recover up to 10,000 cells, so overloading is not advantageous. The percentage of cells we recover is largely within the 10X guidelines of 45-60%, the exception was HH4 (30%) however this was performed with v2 10X chemistry.</p><p>Given that we resolve numerous clusters that clearly represent each germ layer and sub-divisions thereof, we believe these are sufficient numbers of cells to construct an unbiased single-cell atlas at each stage. Moreover, we record high quality gene expression metrics indicating the cells were of good quality (see supplemental table). We have now clarified these points in the text and apologize that this was not clearer in the first version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A supplemental data table with total number of cells collected for each embryo at each stage in each experiment, would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion.

While HCR can be quantitative if performed at nonsaturating levels, embryos must be processed concomitantly and under exactly the same conditions to make accurate comparisons. As we did not prepare the whole mount embryos in this way, it would be no trivial undertaking to repeat all the HCR’s, imaging and quantification. Furthermore, in the broader context of this work, the HCR analysis was done to provide validation of novel genes identified in the sc-RNA-seq data sets, and to uncover putative candidates for further investigation. However, we recognize the need for quantification here, as such we now provide the fold change values where applicable from the sc-RNA-seq data for genes shown in HCR. This information has been added on the relevant feature plots in figures 3 and 4.
