Structural and biochemical studies aiming to understand binding of small-molecules to conformationally dynamic transporters like SERT often require thermostabilizing mutations and antibodies to stabilize a specific conformation, leading to questions about relationships of these structures to the bonafide conformation and inhibitor binding poses of wild-type transporter. To address these concerns, we determined the structures of ∆N72/∆C13 and ts2-inactive SERT bound to paroxetine analogues using single-particle cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography, respectively. We synthesized enantiopure analogues of paroxetine containing either bromine or iodine instead of fluorine. We exploited the anomalous scattering of bromine and iodine to define the pose of these inhibitors and investigated inhibitor binding to Asn177 mutants of ts2-active SERT. These studies provide mutually consistent insights into how paroxetine and its analogues bind to the central substrate-binding site of SERT, stabilize the outward-open conformation, and inhibit serotonin transport.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>structural biology</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>antidepressants</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37MH070039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gouaux</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UF140161</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bull</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000288</institution-id><institution>Royal Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG150444</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bull</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and biochemical analysis of the mechanism of paroxetine binding to the serotonin transporter provides a framework for transporter inhibition and design of small-molecule inhibitors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a chemical messenger which acts on cells throughout the human body, beginning in early development and throughout adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2009</xref>). 5-HT acts as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone that regulates blood vessel constriction and intestinal motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger et al., 2009</xref>). In the central nervous system, 5-HT is released from presynaptic neurons where it diffuses across the synaptic space and binds to 5-HT receptors, promoting downstream signaling and activating postsynaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gether et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>).

SERT resides in the plasma membrane of neurons and belongs to a family of neurotransmitter sodium symporters (NSSs) which also includes the dopamine (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters (NET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gether et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kristensen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rudnick et al., 2014</xref>).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a class of drugs which inhibit SERT and are used to treat major depression and anxiety disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cipriani et al., 2018</xref>). Using x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, we have determined structures of thermostabilized variants of human SERT complexed with SSRIs, which together explain many of the common features and differences associated with SERT-SSRI interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>).

In addition to the central binding site, the activity of SERT and NSSs can also be modulated by small-molecules which bind to an allosteric site located in an extracellular vestibule, typically resulting in non-competitive inhibition of transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wennogle and Meyerson, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plenge and Mellerup, 1985</xref>).</p><p>Paroxetine is an SSRI which exhibits the highest known binding affinity for the central site of SERT (70.2 ± 0.6 pM) compared to any other currently prescribed antidepressants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cool et al., 1990</xref>). Despite its high affinity, paroxetine is frequently associated with serious side effects including infertility, birth defects, cognitive impairment, sexual dysfunction, weight gain, suicidality, and cardiovascular issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nevels et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, the mechanism of paroxetine binding to SERT has been studied extensively in order to design drugs with higher-specificity and less adverse side-effects. Despite these efforts, however, the binding pose of paroxetine remains a subject of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Paroxetine is composed of a secondary amine which resides in a piperidine ring, which in turn is connected to benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). X-ray structures of the SERT-paroxetine complex revealed that the piperidine ring binds to subsite A while the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups occupy subsite B and C in the central site, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>) (ABC pose, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, recent mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, and binding studies with paroxetine analogues suggest that paroxetine might either occupy ABC pose as observed in the crystal structure, or an ACB pose where the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups occupy subsite C and B of the central site respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Paroxetine is also thought to interact with the allosteric site of SERT, albeit with low-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Plenge and Mellerup, 1985</xref>). We have, however, been unable to visualize paroxetine binding at the allosteric site using structural methods. Our x-ray maps, by contrast, resolve a density feature at the allosteric site which instead resembles a molecule of detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>To resolve the ambiguity of paroxetine binding poses at the central binding site, we turned to paroxetine derivatives whereby the 4-fluoro group is substituted with either a bromine or an iodine group. Using transport and binding assays, anomalous x-ray diffraction, and cryo-EM, we have examined the binding poses of these paroxetine analogs and their interactions at the central site. Our studies provide key insights into the recognition of high-affinity inhibitors by SERT and the rational design of new small-molecule therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To provide a robust molecular basis for the interaction of paroxetine (<bold>1</bold>) with SERT, we devised synthetic routes for two derivatives of paroxetine where the 4-fluoro moiety is substituted with either bromo (Br-paroxetine, 2) or iodo (I-paroxetine, 3) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>).

Transition metal-catalyzed C–H functionalization can promote the reaction of unactivated C(sp<sup>3</sup>)–H bonds with the aid of a directing group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rej et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antermite and Bull, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O' Donovan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maetani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Here, C–H functionalization enabled installation of the appropriate aryl group on the pre-existing piperidine ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antermite et al., 2018</xref>), providing an attractive and short route to vary this functionality with inherent control of enantiomeric excess. In contrast, common methods for (–)-paroxetine synthesis can require the aromatic substituent to be introduced before stereoselective steps or ring construction, reducing flexibility of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krautwald et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubota et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amat et al., 2000</xref>).

The ts2-active variant contains two thermostabilizing mutations (Ile291Ala, Thr439Ser) which allows for purification of the apo transporter for binding studies and has kinetics of 5-HT transport (K<sub>m</sub>: 4.5 ± 0.6 μM, V<sub>max</sub>: 21 ± 5 pmol min<sup>−1</sup>) that are in a similar range as wild-type SERT (K<sub>m</sub>: 1.9 ± 0.3 μM, V<sub>max</sub>: 23 ± 1 pmol min<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2015</xref>). The ts2-inactive variant (Tyr110Ala, Ile291Ala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>), by contrast, is unable to transport 5-HT but can be crystallized due to the stabilizing Tyr110Ala mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Green et al., 2015</xref>) and binds SSRIs with high-affinity. The ΔN72/ΔC13 SERT variant used for cryo-EM is otherwise wild-type SERT which has been truncated at the N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and yet retains transport and ligand-binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>).

We assayed the ability of the Br- and I-paroxetine derivatives to inhibit 5-HT transport in HEK293 cells expressing wild-type SERT, observing that upon substituting the 4-fluoro group with 4-bromo or 4-iodo groups, the potency of inhibition of 5-HT transport in wild-type SERT decreased significantly from 4 ± 1 for paroxetine to 40 ± 20 for Br-paroxetine and 180 ± 70 nM for I-paroxetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

A decrease in the binding affinity upon substituting the 4-fluoro group of paroxetine with 4-bromo or 4-iodo groups was observed in the competition binding assays. However, the difference in the binding affinities between paroxetine variants measured by the competition binding assay was not as pronounced as the difference in the inhibition potencies observed in the 5-HT transport assays (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>).

A recent study suggested that binding affinity and potency to inhibit the transport of Br-paroxetine was only moderately affected upon mutating a non-conserved residue Ala169 to Asp in subsite B of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We recently also identified a conserved residue, Asn177 in the subsite B, which upon mutation exhibited differential effects on the inhibitory potency of ibogaine and noribogaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>). To further probe the role of Asn177 in subsite B, we studied the binding of paroxetine and its derivatives to selected Asn177 mutants designed in the ts2-active background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We observed that the affinity of paroxetine to ts2-active SERT decreased by three-fold when Asn177 is substituted with small non-polar or polar residues such as valine and threonine, while only a 2-fold change in K<sub>i</sub> was observed for glutamine (Asn177Gln) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In the case of Br-paroxetine, the Asn177 variants (K<sub>i</sub> between 4 and 5 nM) display up to a 10–13 fold decrease in K<sub>i</sub> when compared with ts2-active SERT (0.4 ± 0.2 nM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The Asn177 variants show 2–4 fold decrease in affinity to I-paroxetine, with ts2-active SERT exhibiting a K<sub>i</sub> of 1.7 ± 0.3 nM and the mutants a K<sub>i</sub> of 4–7 nM. In the case of all three paroxetine variants, the reduction in affinity was the lowest for glutamine substitution. Irrespective of the SERT variant used, substitution of fluoro group with bromo or iodo group invariably decreased the affinity of paroxetine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>To define the binding poses of paroxetine and its analogues to SERT, we solved the structures of the ΔN72/ΔC13 and the ts2-inactive SERT variants complexed with Br- and I-paroxetine using single particle cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). We began by collecting cryo-EM data sets for ΔN72/ΔC13 SERT-8B6 Fab complexes with each ligand. The TM densities in all three reconstructions were well-defined and contiguous allowing for clear positioning of the main chain in an outward-open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). Large aromatic side-chains were well-resolved for all three complexes, also suggesting that the aromatic moieties of paroxetine and its analogues could be identified and positioned in our cryo-EM maps. In addition, the particle distribution and orientations of SERT-Fab complexes in presence of Br- and I-paroxetine were similar to paroxetine, allowing for uniform comparison between the maps.</p><p>The ~ 3.3 Å resolution map of the ΔN72/ΔC13 SERT-8B6 paroxetine complex allowed us to locate a density feature for the inhibitor at the central site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The resolution of the Br- and I-paroxetine complexes was comparatively lower at ~ 4.1 Å and ~ 3.8 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Nevertheless, these ligands could also be modeled into the density at the central site with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.75 and 0.77, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–e</xref>). To compare paroxetine in the ABC <italic>vs.</italic> the ACB pose, we flexibly modeled paroxetine in both poses at the central site followed by real space refinement. We observed that in the ACB pose, paroxetine could be positioned with a CC of 0.70 compared with 0.84 for the ABC pose suggesting that while ABC pose is clearly preferred under the conditions we tested, the possibility of an ACB pose cannot be excluded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5a,b</xref>). Based on the higher CC value, and the binding pose information from the ts2-inactive and ts3 SERT x-ray structures, the density in cryo-EM maps for paroxetine at the central site was interpreted to best accommodate ABC pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>). We also compared the reconstructed complexes by calculating difference maps, attempting to identify features associated with the scattering of bromine and iodine at the central and allosteric sites. However, the resulting difference maps did not contain any interpretable difference densities and thus did not further assist in ligand modeling. In the cryo-EM maps, the maltose headgroup of a DDM molecule could also be visualized in the allosteric site with the detergent tail inserted between TMs 10, 11, and 12. In contrast, in the X-ray maps only the head group of the octyl-maltoside detergent could be modeled due to the weak density of the hydrocarbon chain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structures of SERT-paroxetine complexes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cryo-EM reconstruction of SERT bound to paroxetine where the shape of the SERT-8B6 Fab complex and detergent micelle is shown in transparent light grey.

No detectable anomalous peaks were observed in either subsite B or in the allosteric site and there were no other peaks in any other location above 2.5σ, suggesting that under these conditions, Br-paroxetine and I-paroxetine do not bind substantially in the ACB orientation or to the allosteric site. Next, we calculated isomorphous difference maps (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>o</sub>) using the ts2-inactive paroxetine dataset (PDB: 6AWN) and either the Br-paroxetine or I-paroxetine datasets. The F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)-F<sub>o</sub>(Br-paroxetine) map also revealed a difference peak in subsite C near the halogenated groups while no significant peaks were detected in subsite B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6a</xref>). Similarly, the F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)-F<sub>o</sub>(I-paroxetine) map also contained a difference peak which overlapped with the position of the halogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6b</xref>) while the F<sub>o</sub>(Br-paroxetine)-F<sub>o</sub>(I-paroxetine) difference map did not contain any interpretable features, likely due to the low resolution of both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6c</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><title>X-ray data collection statistics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Br-paroxetine <break/>(PDB 6W2B)</th><th valign="top">I-paroxetine <break/>(PDB 6W2C)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Data collection</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Space group</td><td valign="top">C222<sub>1</sub></td><td valign="top">C222<sub>1</sub></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell dimensions</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>a</italic>, <italic>b</italic>, <italic>c</italic> (Å)</td><td valign="top">128.0, 161.9, 139.7</td><td valign="top">127.7, 161.9, 140.8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">α, β, γ (°)</td><td valign="top">90, 90, 90</td><td valign="top">90, 90, 90</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Resolution (Å)</td><td valign="top">20.45–4.69 (4.82–4.69)*</td><td valign="top">25.98–6.12 (6.30–6.12)*</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>R</italic><sub>merge</sub></td><td valign="top">13.60 (339.3)</td><td valign="top">7.9 (292.9)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>I</italic> / σ<italic>I</italic> <break/>CC<sub>1/2</sub></td><td valign="top">5.51 (0.49) <break/>99.9 (16.5)</td><td valign="top">5.01 (0.32) <break/>99.8 (20.0)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Completeness (%)</td><td valign="top">99.2 (100.0)</td><td valign="top">92.6 (89.7)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Redundancy</td><td valign="top">6.8 (6.2)</td><td valign="top">1.8 (1.7)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>Values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We next compared the cryo-EM structure of the SERT-paroxetine complex to the X-ray structure of the ts3 SERT paroxetine complex. Overall comparison of the transporter revealed only minor variation between structures solved by each method, with a Cα root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) of 0.68 Å. The most significant differences between the cryo-EM and the X-ray structures were found at the extracellular and intracellular sites of TM12 and also in EL2, while the core of the transporter (TM1-10) was largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). These changes can largely be explained on the basis of a crystal packing interface formed by TM12 and a highly flexible EL2 that is bound to the 8B6 Fab. We also compared central site residues involved in paroxetine binding, finding that the best fit to the cryo-EM density revealed only minor differences in the side-chains of Asp98, Tyr176, and Phe335 when compared to the x-ray structure (all atom RMSD: 0.91 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Finally, we compared the cryo-EM structures of the SERT 15B8 Fab/8B6 scFv paroxetine complex (PDB: 6DZW) to the SERT 8B6 Fab paroxetine complex to understand if these antibodies induce changes in transporter structure. Here we found that the most significant differences occurred in the extracellular domain and involved localized regions of EL2 and EL4 that interact with the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The transporter core was largely unchanged, with the only other significant differences being found in EL6, TM12, and IL4.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the X-ray and cryo-EM structures of the SERT-paroxetine complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Superposition of the x-ray ts3-SERT-8B6 paroxetine structure (PDB: 5I6X) with the SERT-8B6 paroxetine complex determined by cryo-EM.

The first X-ray structure of the ts3-SERT variant demonstrated that the binding pose is such that the piperidine, benzodioxol, and fluorophenyl groups occupy subsites A, B, and C respectively, in the ABC pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Competition binding experiments using a variant of SERT containing a central binding site that has been genetically engineered to possess photo-cross-linking amino acids corroborated that paroxetine binds in a fashion which is similar to that observed in crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coleman et al., 2016a</xref>), where the fluorophenyl group is in proximity to Val501 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rannversson et al., 2017</xref>). However, computational docking experiments using wild-type SERT predicted that the position of benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups of paroxetine are ‘flipped’, with paroxetine occupying an ACB pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Subsequent studies involving wild-type and mutant SERT variants, that include modeling, mutagenesis, and Br-paroxetine docking experiments suggested that paroxetine could bind in both ABC and ACB poses. These studies also suggested that bromination of paroxetine and certain mutations near the central site, such as Ala169Asp, favored ABC pose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>). Hence, the authors in these studies hypothesized that the ABC pose observed in the crystal structure could be because of the crystallization conditions and thermostabilizing mutations.</p><p>One of the thermostabilizing mutations in ts3-SERT, Thr439Ser, is near the central binding site and Thr439 participates in a hydrogen bonding network in subsite B that, in turn, includes the dioxol group of paroxetine. To probe the role of the Thr439Ser mutation in modulating the binding pose of paroxetine, we solved the X-ray structure of ts2-inactive (Tyr110Ala, Ile291Ala) SERT, wherein the residue at position 439 was the wild-type threonine. Paroxetine could be modeled in the ABC pose in the X-ray structure of ts2-inactive SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>). MD simulations of ts2-inactive SERT suggested that the Thr439Ser mutation weakens the Na2 site. Furthermore, MD simulations and binding and uptake kinetics experiments using wild-type SERT in presence of paroxetine and a variant of paroxetine where in the 4-fluoro group is substituted with 4-bromo group suggested that the paroxetine binding pose in SERT could be ambiguous because of the pseudo symmetry of the paroxetine molecule. It was noted that paroxetine could occupy both ABC and ACB poses with almost equivalent preference. Upon substituting the 4-fluoro with a bulkier 4-bromo group, the ABC pose was favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Structural studies of SERT in complex with paroxetine and its analogues were thus required to resolve the uncertainty in paroxetine binding pose at the central site. Previously, we had demonstrated that cryo-EM can be used to define the position of ligands at the central site of SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coleman et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we employed a similar methodology using the ΔN72/ΔC13 SERT variant complexed with 8B6 Fab to study binding of paroxetine at the central site. The density feature of paroxetine in the cryo-EM map at ~ 3.3 Å clearly resolved the larger benzodioxol and smaller fluorophenyl groups in subsite B and C, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Though this reconstruction suggests that paroxetine binds in the ABC pose, we also considered the possibility that the inhibitor density feature may represent an average of the ABC and ACB poses. We expected that if Br- and I-paroxetine were suitable surrogates for paroxetine, their binding pose would be unaffected by their reduced electronegativity and the size of the halogenated groups and therefore that they would also be associated with a comparable density feature at this site, as demonstrated by our cryo-EM maps. To further explore if there was a fraction of Br- or I-paroxetine in the ACB pose, we examined the position of the Br- or I- atoms at the central site by X-ray crystallography. If Br- and I-paroxetine were to bind in both the ABC or ACB poses, we expected to observe two anomalous peaks in our x-ray maps in subsites B and C; for both ligands, however, only a single detectable peak was observed in subsite C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,g</xref>). Thus, our direct biophysical observations reveal that under the conditions that we tested the ABC pose of paroxetine is preferred over the the ACB pose.</p><p>Paroxetine is stabilized at the central binding site by aromatic, ionic, non-ionic, hydrogen bonding, and cation-π interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>). In the ABC pose, the amine of the piperidine ring of paroxetine binds with Asp98 (3.5 Å) and also makes a cation-π interaction with Tyr95 of subsite A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The benzodioxol group of paroxetine, a catechol-like entity, occupies a position in subsite B which is similar to the binding of catechol derivative groups of sertraline and 3,4-dichlorophenethylamine in SERT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Gouaux, 2018</xref>) and dDAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2015a</xref>) structures, respectively. In subsite B, the ring of Tyr176 makes an aromatic interaction with the benzodioxol while the hydrogen-bonding network in subsite B formed by Asn177, Thr439, backbone carbonyl oxygens, and amides are likely responsible for stabilization of the dioxol. The side-chain of Ile172 inserts between the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl, while the rings of Phe341 and Phe335 stack on either side of the fluorophenyl, ‘sandwiching’ it within subsite C. The halogen group of paroxetine and its analogues reside adjacent to the side-chain of Thr497 (4.0 Å), which may act to stabilize these groups through hydrogen bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The larger atomic radius, the longer length of the carbon-halogen bond, and the difference in electronegativity of bromine (radius: 1.85 Å, bond-length: 1.92 Å, electronegativity: 2.96) and iodine (radius: 1.98 Å, bond-length: 2.14 Å, electronegativity: 2.66) relative to fluorine (radius: 1.47 Å, bond-length: 1.35 Å, electronegativity: 3.98) would explain why the fluorine analogue binds with greater affinity than Br-paroxetine and I-paroxetine.</p><p>We also explored the effect of conservative and non-conservative mutations in subsite B of SERT at Asn177 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Asn177 participates in a hydrogen-bond network with the hydroxyl group of noribogaine and with the dioxol of paroxetine. However, this network of interactions is also important for binding halogenated inhibitors in subsite B, as in the case for <italic>S</italic>-citalopram, fluvoxamine, and sertraline. All the mutants that we tested at Asn177 resulted in a loss of binding affinity to paroxetine and its analogues. Furthermore, the Ala169Asp mutation in subsite B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>) also reduced paroxetine inhibition and binding, likely also disrupting these interactions. Although the effects were less severe when compared to paroxetine, Br-paroxetine binding and inhibition was also reduced for Ala169Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Slack et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, these mutations highlight the importance of subsite B interactions in paroxetine binding but they cannot be used to demonstrate the inhibitor pose because, in the ABC or ACB poses, either the dioxol or fluorine of paroxetine could act as a hydrogen-bond acceptor in subsite B.</p><p>Using a combination of chemical biology, cryo-EM, and X-ray crystallography we observed that under the conditions that we studied, the SSRI paroxetine preferably occupies the ABC pose at the central site, where it is involved in numerous interactions. However, the data presented in the manuscript does not completely exclude the possibility of an ACB pose at the central site. Our studies of the mechanism of paroxetine binding to SERT provide a robust framework for the design of experiments to identify new highly specific small-molecule SERT inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human serotonin transporter</td><td valign="top">cDNA</td><td valign="top">NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001036.1</td><td valign="top">Dr. Randy D.

All SERT constructs were cloned into BacMam vector system to be expressed as C-terminal GFP fusion using baculovirus-mediated transduction of HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells. Cells were solubilized in 20 mM Tris pH 8 with 150 mM NaCl, containing 20 mM n-dodecyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and 2.5 mM cholesteryl hemisuccinate (CHS), followed by purification using Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography in 20 mM Tris pH 8 with 100 mM NaCl (TBS), 1 mM DDM, and 0.2 mM CHS.</p><p>For cryo-EM of the ΔN72/ΔC13 SERT, 1 mM 5-HT was added during solubilization and affinity purification to stabilize SERT. GFP was cleaved from SERT by digestion with thrombin and the SERT-8B6 complex was made as described in the previous paragraph. The complex was separated from free Fab and GFP by SEC in TBS containing 1 mM DDM and 0.2 mM CHS, and the peak fractions were concentrated to 4 mg/ml followed by addition of either 200 μM paroxetine, Br-paroxetine or I-paroxetine.</p><p>For crystallization, no ligands were added during purification of ts2-inactive SERT, and 5% glycerol and 25 μM lipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol at a molar ratio of 1:1:1) were included in all the purification buffers. Following affinity purification, the fusion protein was digested by thrombin and EndoH and combined with recombinant 8B6 Fab at a molar ratio of 1:1.2. The SERT-8B6 complex was isolated by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 200 column in TBS containing 40 mM n-octyl β-D-maltoside, 0.5 mM CHS.

Anhydrous solvents were obtained by filtration through drying columns (THF, MeCN, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> and DMF) or used as supplied (α,α,α-trifluorotoluene). Reactions in sealed tubes were run using Biotage microwave vials (2–5 ml or 10–20 ml recommended volumes). Aluminum caps equipped with molded butyl/PTFE septa were used for reactions in α,α,α-trifluorotoluene and toluene. Simple butyl septa were used for reactions in other solvents. Chromatographic purification was performed using 230–400 mesh silica with the indicated solvent system according to standard techniques. Analytical thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated, glass-backed silica gel plates. Visualization of the developed chromatogram was performed by UV absorbance (254 nm) and/or stained with a ninhydrin solution in ethanol. HPLC analyses were carried out on an Agilent 1260 Infinity Series system, employing Daicel Chiracel columns, under the indicated conditions. The high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analyses were performed using electrospray ion source (ESI). ESI was performed using a Waters LCT Premier equipped with an ESI source operated either in positive or negative ion mode.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Lucy Forrest as the Reviewing Editor and by José Faraldo-Gómez as the Senior Editor. Reviewers #2 and #3 have agreed to reveal their identity: Poul Nissen and Amy Newman, respectively. Based on the reviewers' comments, included below, and on subsequent discussions among reviewers and editors, I am glad to inform you that we believe that your manuscript is potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, provided you make a number of revisions to address the reviewers' concerns and recommendations, to the extent possible.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data. Our hope is that authors will eventually carry out those additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Gouaux and colleagues contains an analysis of the binding arrangement of the highest-affinity antidepressant, paroxetine, to human serotonin transporter. This ligand has been the subject of a number of previous studies, which suggested that it might adopt one of two alternate arrangements the so-called ABC and ACB poses, in which the two arms of the v-shaped ligand are flipped between the &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; sub-sites of the central binding site. Prior X-ray crystallographic data however, was limited by the fact that the protein constructs used were of mutants than were modified in key locations.</p><p>The combination of cryo-EM, x-ray structural analysis with synthesis of brominated and iodinated compounds, binding (*Citalopram competition) and 5HT uptake assays is impressive. Anomalous diffraction identifies some signal for the halogenated group in the location consistent with the ABC pose; however, computational analyses by Abagayan suggested the bromination itself tends to favor this pose. The most compelling data therefore comes from the ~3.3Å cryo-EM structures of the wild-type protein bound to paroxetine, which indicate differences in the correlation coefficient for fitting the ligand in the two orientations. Unfortunately, at this resolution, I believe this data cannot be used to rule out the possibility that both orientations are occupied, especially if ACB has a lower occupancy.</p><p>I conclude that these data are further suggestive of the ABC pose being the primary arrangement, but do not categorically rule out that paroxetine also adopts the ACB pose.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The anomalous diffraction densities are poorly defined (at 4 sigma), albeit appearing in the general region expected for the position of paroxetine that the authors identify. I am also concerned by the large fraction of residues that are defined as containing a poor fit to the EM map (all-atom inclusion &lt;40%). Is this some kind of model bias, because of using the previously obtained X-ray structures as starting points for refinement? (MR using 6AWN = S439T/3.6Å).</p><p>2) Discussion paragraph four starting: &quot;Paroxetine is stabilized...&quot;. These arguments read as self-fulfilling. Close contact in a structure does not mean that all interactions are stabilizing; it neglects entropic contributions and the fact that some contacts may be disfavored in order to optimize the overall free energy. Perhaps it would be useful to separate the descriptions of the interactions with the discussion of the nature of the ABC and ACB orientations. For example, the arguments regarding the ABC and ACB orientations seem to relate to the presence of aromatic groups and hydrogen-bonding of the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl moieties; but wouldn't both types of interactions be present also in the ACB mode? Similarly, why are differences in electronegativity between C-F, C-Br and C-I more relevant for subsite C rather than subsite B?</p><p>3) Remarkably, and somewhat disturbingly, in the new cryo-EM structures the tail of DDM protrudes between helices TM11/10 and TM12, which are in turn more separated. How is it possible that the same tail is not observed/modelled in any of the previous X-ray structures, even though the maltose group is modeled in the same position in e.g. 6AWN? This discrepancy should be described and mentioned in the Results when comparing the cryo-EM and x-ray structures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Coleman et al. present a study of paroxetine (pax) binding investigated with different methods (single-particle cryo-EM, X-ray crystallography, binding studies) using five different constructs of SERT – i) wild-type with C-term GFP, ii) ts2 active with Ile291Ala, Thr439Ser and C-term GFP, iii) same ts2 active with in addition Asn177 mutations, iv) inactive ts2 with Tyr110Ala, Ile291Ala and v) ΔN72, ΔC13 SERT plus an antibody 8B6. They investigate the binding of Br- and I-pax derivatives (Br and I substituting F in the fluorophenyl-group of pax), the synthesis of which is also described here. These derivative compounds bind and inhibit SERT, although with a somewhat reduced affinity (going from low to high nM range). Crystal structures and cryo-EM structures of different construct and complexes are overall very consistent on how pax binds to SERT.</p><p>The study is motivated by ambiguities in the literature on how pax binds, represented by ABC or ACB poses to subsites A,B, and C at the central site of SERT. Earlier structural studies also from the Gouaux lab as well as the new studies presented here show the ABC pose, while docking studies and MD simulation from the Shi group indicate a more dynamic binding mode featuring both ABC and ACB poses that through proposed entropy effects for the pseudosymmetry of pax would explain a high affinity. The study presented in this manuscript is important and relevant to a large readership, and to applied uses of the structural information for further drug development.</p><p>Subsite A of SERT binds an amine functionality, here the piperidine ring of pax. The B asubsite attracts bulky groups with electronegative substituents such as halogenated aromatic groups, catecholes and the benzodioxol group of pax. Site C occupies other groups, in pax a halogenated aromatic group (fluoro-phenyl). Pax thus has two aromatic/heterocylic groups with electronegative substituents – the fluoro-phenyl group and the benzodioxol, and according to the structural studies the benzodioxol &quot;wins&quot; the B-subsite. Studies of the ABC vs. ACB pose dynamics through derivative compounds should perturb the balance of how the two subsites B and C are occupied – e.g. by making the benzodioxol group bind weaker to the B-subsite or the fluorophenyl group potentially binding stronger to it. The study design however decreases the electronegativity of the fluorophenyl group by substituting F for Br or I – this will presumably make it bind weaker to both subsites B and C. The structures, therefore, and perhaps not surprisingly, confirm the ABC pose found in earlier structural studies. Studies of Asn177 mutants in the ts2 active background show similar consistency to this binding mode and the study leaves little doubt that the ABC pose may be a dominating pose.</p><p>Another question has been raised on the use of the thermostabilizing mutation Thr439Ser, which according to the Shi group obscures the dynamic nature of pax binding by ABC/ACB poses and again the authors find no major differences based on this mutant form.</p><p>Major points</p><p>1) It is rather difficult to keep track of the SERT constructs used throughout the report – please include/add a table and perhaps also a figure that the reader can refer to and be careful that the text is always clear on which construct is now described/discussed</p><p>2) It may be argued that the study design does not really challenge the ambiguity of earlier studies. It would be critical to include other pax derivatives, eg. some that reduce the electronegativity of heteroatoms of the benzodioxol group, which will then likely loose affinity to the subset B, or that increase the B-subsite affinity of the fluoro-phenyl group (e.g. as a 3,4-difluorophenyl).</p><p>Alternatively, the manuscript must be rewritten into a report that confirms the ABC pose of pax observed under the given set of conditions – that rather than opposing the ACB pose model.</p><p>3) The cryo-EM structures represent only a small fraction of total particles in the cryo-EM data sets (about 10%). What else is observed from the remaining 90% of the datasets? Could other classes of the cryo-EM study of ΔN72, ΔC13 represent more flexible structures with ACB poses of pax?</p><p>4) The anomalous difference map analysis is scarcely described and therefore difficult to review. Anomalous difference maps must be carefully assessed to obtain a maximal signal-noise ratio, which on the other hand is crucial for any statements to be made on the absence of minor sites (which will disappear in the noise of a suboptimal fourier analysis). The S/N ratio might for example (conveniently) be assessed by a comparison of the highest positive (signal) compared to the highest negative peaks (noise) in a map. Table 4 indicate that the resolution of the data has been stretched to a maximum (and remains low resolution), and that atomic models have been refined against these very low resolution data for Br-pax and I-pax (compared to the earlier ts3-pax data at 3.14 Å resolution in a similar crystal form). Reading from the manuscript, model phases have been derived then from these low-resolution refined structures and used for the anomalous difference Fourier map. This is not necessarily the way to get the highest S/N ratio, where higher quality model phases from a higher-resolution isomorphous structure can also be applied, perhaps combined with an appropriate blurring of the phases at higher resolution by a negative temperature factor approach – this must be tested. Furthermore, the exact choice of resolution of the input anomalous data must be established by trial-and-error searching again for the maximal S/N ratio of the anomalous difference map, and also other parameters (such as a maximum threshold allowed for F+/-F- differences). The maps must be shown for both subsites B and C</p><p>5) All paroxetine crystal forms seem more or less isomorphous – an isomorphous difference Fourier map analysis (Fo-Fo maps) would be very useful, and will often show minor sites well. Any relevant isomorphous pair of paroxetine crystals (Br-pax/pax; Br-pax/I-pax, I-pax/pax) should be analysed. Again, the model phases used for the Fourier analysis should be selected carefully and probably come from the higher resolution &quot;native pax structure&quot;. Similar to the anomalous difference maps, the isomorphous difference maps must be shown for subsites B and C</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors combined a novel chemical synthesis of previously described Br-paroxetine and its I-analogue, cryo-EM, and crystallography to further probe the SSRI paroxetine binding pose at the central site of SERT. While the experimental design and the data collection are solid, the deduction toward the conclusion does not entirely resolve the controversy originally described in the Introduction for paroxetine itself.</p><p>Substantive but addressable concerns:</p><p>1) Overall the cryo-EM structures are of low resolution and the authors could not &quot;identify features associated with the scattering of bromine and iodine&quot;. The crystal structures in the &quot;ts2-inactive&quot; background are of even lower resolutions (4.69 and 6.12Å), though there were &quot;clear density for Br- and I- atoms of the paroxetine derivatives in subsite C&quot;. Thus, given that the CC of ACB pose, 0.70, is not unacceptably low, there is no definitive evidence presented to specifically argue for the ABC and against the ACB pose. In addition, as -F to -Br and -I may significantly change the properties of the compound (see Abramyan, et al., 2018), it is not safe to assume that Br- or I-paroxetine are in the same pose as paroxetine. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27982595. Indeed, it is difficult for the cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography work to consider dynamics, thus the authors should not completely exclude the possibility of an ACB pose (see Discussion).</p><p>2) Importantly, there appear to be some misinterpretations of the studies described in Abramyan et al., 2018 and Slack et al., 2019, that must be addressed:</p><p>• &quot;However, recent mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, and binding studies with paroxetine analogues suggest that paroxetine may occupy two distinct poses in which the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups reside in subsite B or C, depending on the rotameric position of Phe341 and the presence of the thermostabilizing mutation Thr439Ser18,20 (ACB pose, Figure 1C).&quot; The main points in Abramyan et al., 2018 and Slack et al., 2019, were that the favored entropy component may play a significant role in paroxetine's high affinity, which include the dynamics in the S1 site (e.g., the dynamics of Phe341 in the presence of paroxetine but not Br-paroxetine) and potential pose ambiguity. The mutations may disrupt such dynamics but not necessarily associated with a specific pose.</p><p>• Regarding the synthesis of Br- and I-paroxetine analogues, this alternative approach is indeed new, however the authors should acknowledge that Br-paroxetine was previously synthesized and fully characterized in Slack et al., 2019.</p><p>• &quot;In this study, the authors hypothesized that the difference could be because of the crystallization conditions and thermostabilizing mutations.&quot; It is not clear what &quot;this study&quot; is referring to. Davis et al., 2016, did not discuss the crystal structures, while Abramyan et al did not hypothesize that WT should be in the ACB pose (see above).</p><p>• Importantly, the dominant occupation of Br-paroxetine in the ABC pose is consistent with the findings in Slack et al., 2019 and should be acknowledged, as the studies in the present report for this compound were why it was synthesized in the first place. Based on the molecular dynamics studies in Abramyan et al, the studies in the present report neither support nor refute that paroxetine may bind in either pose in the native hSERT.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56427.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript by Gouaux and colleagues contains an analysis of the binding arrangement of the highest-affinity antidepressant, paroxetine, to human serotonin transporter.

We sorted the picks by different methods using 3D and 2D classification and then combined them for refinement. About 120K particles were removed using 3D classification for the paroxetine data set because reconstructions derived from these particles were poorly resolved and it was not possible to observe a density feature for paroxetine. It is possible that these particles are more flexible with an ACB pose, though it is also likely that they did not produce higher resolution reconstructions due to other factors such as denaturation at the air-water interface, thick or poor quality ice, or difficulties in determination of accurate particles parameters.

The S/N ratio might for example (conveniently) be assessed by a comparison of the highest positive (signal) compared to the highest negative peaks (noise) in a map. Table 4 indicate that the resolution of the data has been stretched to a maximum (and remains low resolution), and that atomic models have been refined against these very low resolution data for Br-pax and I-pax (compared to the earlier ts3-pax data at 3.14 Å resolution in a similar crystal form). Reading from the manuscript, model phases have been derived then from these low-resolution refined structures and used for the anomalous difference Fourier map. This is not necessarily the way to get the highest S/N ratio, where higher quality model phases from a higher-resolution isomorphous structure can also be applied, perhaps combined with an appropriate blurring of the phases at higher resolution by a negative temperature factor approach – this must be tested. Furthermore, the exact choice of resolution of the input anomalous data must be established by trial-and-error searching again for the maximal S/N ratio of the anomalous difference map, and also other parameters (such as a maximum threshold allowed for F+/-F- differences). The maps must be shown for both subsites B and C</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. Although we had already performed many of these analyses to improve the S/N ratio of the anomalous maps in the initial submission, we had not described what we had done in sufficient detail. Furthermore, we had not tried to blur the phases at higher resolution, this was a helpful suggestion and improved the quality of the Brparoxetine map substantially (maximum peak intensity 5.5 vs. 6.0σ). We have also written a paragraph in the Materials and methods section to describe what we have done in more detail:</p><p>“Anomalous difference maps</p><p>X-ray data sets were processed with XDS; Friedel pairs were allowed to have different intensities. Molecular replacement was performed with coordinates from the previously determined ts2-inactive SERT-paroxetine structure (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 6AWN) using PHASER. B-factors were refined using PHENIX followed by generating anomalous difference maps using the phases derived from the higher resolution structures. To maximize the signal-to-noise ratio of the Br-paroxetine anomalous difference density, the high-resolution phases were blurred with a B-factor of 500 with a high-resolution cutoff of 5.5 Å. Using these optimized parameters for the Fourier analysis of the Br-paroxetine diffraction data, we obtained an anomalous map with the largest difference peak being present at 6.0σ and the noise level estimated at ~2.5σ. To maximize the signal-noise-ratio of the I-paroxetine anomalous difference density, a high-resolution and low-resolution cutoff of 6.3 and 30 Å was applied during the generation of the anomalous maps. Using these optimized parameters for the Fourier analysis of the I-paroxetine diffraction data, we obtained an anomalous map with the largest difference peak being present at 4.5σ and the noise level estimated at ~2.5σ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) All paroxetine crystal forms seem more or less isomorphous – an isomorphous difference Fourier map analysis (Fo-Fo maps) would be very useful, and will often show minor sites well. Any relevant isomorphous pair of paroxetine crystals (Br-pax/pax; Br-pax/I-pax, I-pax/pax) should be analysed. Again, the model phases used for the Fourier analysis should be selected carefully and probably come from the higher resolution &quot;native pax structure&quot;. Similar to the anomalous difference maps, the isomorphous difference maps must be shown for subsites B and C</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this constructive suggestion. The paroxetine crystal forms are indeed fairly isomorphous with &lt;1% difference in unit cell dimensions. When we analyzed the suggested Fo(paroxetine)-Fo(Br-paroxetine) and Fo(paroxetine)-Fo(I-paroxetine) maps, we found that they did contain density features of the halogens. The Fo(Br-paroxetine)-Fo(I-paroxetine) maps, did not have meaningful features, perhaps because of the low resolution of both datasets. Like the anomalous difference maps, we have also shown both subsite B and C in Figure 4—figure supplement 6 and have displayed the difference density with a radius covering subsite B and C. We added the following text:</p><p>“Next, we calculated isomorphous difference maps (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>o</sub>) using the ts2-inactive paroxetine dataset (PDB: 6AWN) and either the Br-paroxetine or I-paroxetine datasets. The F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)F<sub>o</sub>(Br-paroxetine) map also revealed a difference peak in subsite C near the halogenated groups while no significant peaks were detected in subsite B (Figure 4—figure supplement 6A). Similarly, the F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)-F<sub>o</sub>(I-paroxetine) map also contained a difference peak which overlapped with the position of the halogen (Figure 4—figure supplement 6B) while the F<sub>o</sub>(Brparoxetine)-F<sub>o</sub>(I-paroxetine) difference map did not contain any interpretable features, likely due to the low resolution of both datasets (Figure 4—figure supplement 6C).”</p><p>We have added a section in the Materials and methods to describe in detail how this analysis was performed,</p><p><bold>“</bold>Fo-Fo isomorphous difference maps</p><p>Isomorphous difference (F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>o</sub>) maps were calculated in PHENIX by analyzing isomorphous pairs of crystals.

High- and low-resolution cutoffs of 6.0 and 30.0 Å were applied for the F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)- F<sub>o</sub>(Br-paroxetine) map and cutoffs of 6.3 and 30.0 Å were used for the F<sub>o</sub>(paroxetine)- F<sub>o</sub>(I-paroxetine) and F<sub>o</sub>(Br-paroxetine)- F<sub>o</sub>(Iparoxetine) maps.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors combined a novel chemical synthesis of previously described Br-paroxetine and its I-analogue, cryo-EM, and crystallography to further probe the SSRI paroxetine binding pose at the central site of SERT. While the experimental design and the data collection are solid, the deduction toward the conclusion does not entirely resolve the controversy originally described in the Introduction for paroxetine itself.</p><p>Substantive but addressable concerns:</p><p>1) Overall the cryo-EM structures are of low resolution and the authors could not &quot;identify features associated with the scattering of bromine and iodine&quot;. The crystal structures in the &quot;ts2-inactive&quot; background are of even lower resolutions (4.69 and 6.12Å), though there were &quot;clear density for Br- and I- atoms of the paroxetine derivatives in subsite C&quot;. Thus, given that the CC of ACB pose, 0.70, is not unacceptably low, there is no definitive evidence presented to specifically argue for the ABC and against the ACB pose. In addition, as -F to -Br and -I may significantly change the properties of the compound (see Abramyan, et al., 2018), it is not safe to assume that Br- or I-paroxetine are in the same pose as paroxetine. See https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27982595. Indeed, it is difficult for the cryo-EM and X-ray crystallography work to consider dynamics, thus the authors should not completely exclude the possibility of an ACB pose (see Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and given the moderate resolution of the x-ray data, the reviewer is correct that we would not expect to see the ACB pose if it is present at low occupancy. The CC of the ACB pose is 0.7 compared to 0.84 of the ABC pose and thus we agree that we cannot exclude the possibility of the ACB pose. We note that both via x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM that all three variants of paroxetine occupy a pose that could be best described as ABC pose, under the conditions of structure determination. Nonetheless, we agree that it is not possible to exclude ACB pose based on the data that we presented in the manuscript. The Discussion section has been edited to reflect these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Importantly, there appear to be some misinterpretations of the studies described in Abramyan et al., 2018 and Slack et al., 2019, that must be addressed:</p><p>• &quot;However, recent mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, and binding studies with paroxetine analogues suggest that paroxetine may occupy two distinct poses in which the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups reside in subsite B or C, depending on the rotameric position of Phe341 and the presence of the thermostabilizing mutation Thr439Ser18,20 (ACB pose, Figure 1C).&quot; The main points in Abramyan et al., 2018 and Slack et al., 2019, were that the favored entropy component may play a significant role in paroxetine's high affinity, which include the dynamics in the S1 site (e.g., the dynamics of Phe341 in the presence of paroxetine but not Br-paroxetine) and potential pose ambiguity. The mutations may disrupt such dynamics but not necessarily associated with a specific pose.</p></disp-quote><p>This statement in the Introduction, has now been edited to read as follows “However, recent mutagenesis, molecular dynamics, and binding studies with paroxetine analogues suggest that paroxetine might either occupy the ABC pose as observed in the crystal structure, or an ACB pose where the benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups occupy subsite C and B of the central site respectively (Abramyan et al., 2019; Slack et al., 2019) (Figure 1C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Regarding the synthesis of Br- and I-paroxetine analogues, this alternative approach is indeed new, however the authors should acknowledge that Br-paroxetine was previously synthesized and fully characterized in Slack et al., 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now acknowledged the previous reports mentioning synthesis and complete characterization of Br-paroxetine in the Results section. We added a statement that says “In contrast, common methods for (–)-paroxetine synthesis can require the aromatic substituent to be introduced before stereoselective steps or ring construction, reducing flexibility of the process (Slack et al., 2019; Johnson et al., 2001; Hughes, Kimura and Buchwald, 2003; Brandau et al., 2006; Krautwalk et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Kubota et al., 2016; Amat et al., 2000), nevertheless, Br-paroxetine and other analogues of paroxetine have been previously synthesized by these methods and binding to SERT has been extensively studied (Slack et al., 2019; Brandau et al., 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• &quot;In this study, the authors hypothesized that the difference could be because of the crystallization conditions and thermostabilizing mutations.&quot; It is not clear what &quot;this study&quot; is referring to. Davis et al., 2016, did not discuss the crystal structures, while Abramyan et al. did not hypothesize that WT should be in the ACB pose (see above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the last paragraph to read:</p><p>“However, computational docking experiments using wild-type SERT predicted that the position of benzodioxol and fluorophenyl groups of paroxetine are “flipped”, with paroxetine occupying an ACB pose (David et al., 2016) (Figure 1C). Subsequent studies involving wild-type and mutant SERT variants that include modelling, mutagenesis, and Br-paroxetine docking experiments suggested that paroxetine could bind in both ABC and ACB poses. These studies also suggested that bromination of paroxetine and certain mutations near the central site, such as A169D, favored ABC pose (Abramyan et al., 2018; Slack et al., 2019). Hence, the authors in these studies hypothesized that the ABC pose observed in the crystal structure could be because of the crystallization conditions and thermostabilizing mutations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Importantly, the dominant occupation of Br-paroxetine in the ABC pose is consistent with the findings in Slack et al., 2019 and should be acknowledged, as the studies in the present report for this compound were why it was synthesized in the first place. Based on the molecular dynamics studies in Abramyan et al., the studies in the present report neither support nor refute that paroxetine may bind in either pose in the native hSERT.</p></disp-quote><p>In multiple SERT structures, solved using both x-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, all three (F-, Br-, and I-) variants of paroxetine at the central site could be interpreted to be in an ABC pose. Based on these observations, we believe that bromination alone is not the reason for the ABC pose. However, we have now edited the text in Discussion and Results to indicate that while the ABC pose is favored in the conditions that we solved the structures, the possibility of the ACB pose cannot be excluded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
