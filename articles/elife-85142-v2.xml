The large fusion GTPase Sey1/atlastin is implicated in ER dynamics, ER-derived lipid droplet (LD) formation, and LCV maturation. Here, we employ cryo-electron tomography, confocal microscopy, proteomics, and isotopologue profiling to analyze LCV-LD interactions in the genetically tractable amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic>. Dually fluorescence-labeled <italic>D. discoideum</italic> producing LCV and LD markers revealed that Sey1 as well as the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> T4SS and the Ran GTPase activator LegG1 promote LCV-LD interactions. In vitro reconstitution using purified LCVs and LDs from parental or Δ<italic>sey1</italic> mutant <italic>D. discoideum</italic> indicated that Sey1 and GTP promote this process. Sey1 and the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> fatty acid transporter FadL were implicated in palmitate catabolism and palmitate-dependent intracellular growth. Taken together, our results reveal that Sey1 and LegG1 mediate LD- and FadL-dependent fatty acid metabolism of intracellular <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>host-pathogen interaction</kwd><kwd>intracellular bacteria</kwd><kwd>large GTPase</kwd><kwd>Legionella</kwd><kwd>lipid droplet</kwd><kwd>pathogen vacuole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Dictyostelium</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_175557</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilbi</surname><given-names>Hubert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_207826</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilbi</surname><given-names>Hubert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008483</institution-id><institution>NOMIS Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilhofer</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intracellular growth of the bacterial pathogen <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> in the amoeba <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> implicates a bacterial fatty acid transporter as well as dynamic interactions of the distinct membrane-bound replication compartment with host cell lipid droplets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The causative agent of Legionnaires’ disease, <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>, is a facultative intracellular bacterium, which adopts a similar mechanism to replicate in free-living protozoa and lung macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Newton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boamah et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mondino et al., 2020</xref>).

Proteomics and lipidomics analysis of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> LDs revealed that the lipid constituents are similar to mammalian LDs and comprise mainly triacylglycerol (57%), free fatty acids (22 %) and sterol esters (4%). LDs are coated by a polar phospholipid monolayer and distinct proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Du et al., 2013</xref>), such as perilipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Miura et al., 2002</xref>), and small GTPases, as well as ER proteins (reticulon C, RtnlC; protein disulfide isomerase, PDI; lipid droplet membrane protein, LdpA; and 15 lipid metabolism enzymes), the latter reflecting their cellular organelle origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Du et al., 2013</xref>).

While the incorporation of label into amino acids was comparable for fraction 1–3, the incorporation of label into 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB) was only seen in fraction 2, since 3-HB is specific for bacterial anabolism and not produced by eukaryotic cells. <sup>13</sup>C-Excess (mol%) in key metabolites was analyzed by gas chromatography/MS and is shown for the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

A major enrichment of <sup>13</sup>C-label occurred in the PHB hydrolysis product 3-HB. Interestingly, the enrichment was significantly lower in absence of Sey1 or FadL, and lowest in absence of both, Sey1 and FadL.

We reveal that LCVs intimately interact with palmitate-induced LDs in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Palmitate is transported by FadL inside the bacteria and metabolized to acetyl-CoA, which is further aerobically catabolized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle to CO<sub>2</sub> and/or anabolized to the storage compound polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB).

LegG1 belongs to a family of RCC1 repeat domain-containing <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors, which activate the small GTPase RanA at different sites in the cell (LCV, plasma membrane) and consequently stabilize non-centrosomal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rothmeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Swart et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Swart et al., 2020c</xref>). Intriguingly, RanA as well as the Ran-binding protein RanBP1 was also identified on LDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since RanBP1 only binds to activated, GTP-bound RanA, the small GTPase is likely activated on LDs. Accordingly, LegG1 might not only activate RanA on LCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rothmeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Swart et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Swart et al., 2020c</xref>) but also on LDs, leading to a further stabilization of microtubules, along which the LCV-LD interactions occur. In agreement with this notion, GFP-LegG1 shows a punctate localization in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and appears to accumulate in the vicinity of LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Among the more than 300 different <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effectors, LegG1 and others might (directly) target LDs. An attractive candidate is RalF, which acts as an Arf1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), thus activating the small GTPase Arf1 on LCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nagai et al., 2002</xref>). Activated, GTP-bound Arf1 regulates through perilipin-2 the phospholipid monolayer that stabilizes LDs and controls the cellular availability of neutral lipids for metabolic purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pauloin et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, upon activation, Arf1 and the coat complex COPI form LD-ER membrane bridges for targeting catabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wilfling et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, by acting as an Arf1 GEF, the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> effector RalF might regulate LD-dependent processes during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection.</p><p>While LDs undergo homotypic interactions and fusions, they do not seem to fuse with other organelles. LDs are formed within and released from the ER bilayer. The release is reversible, and accordingly, cytosolic LDs interact with and re-integrate into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Thiam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wilfling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wilfling et al., 2014</xref>). The process is dependent on the small GTPase Arf1 and the coatomer complex-I (COPI), but otherwise is ill defined, and specific ‘integration factors’ have not been identified. Using an analogous mechanism, LDs might interact with and integrate into the LCV limiting membrane.</p><p>In addition to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, several intracellular bacterial pathogens accumulate LDs on their pathogen vacuoles to get access to and metabolize fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Walpole et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bosch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brink et al., 2021</xref>). Pathogenic <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> species, such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>M. leprae</italic>, trigger LD formation during infection, to exploit lipids derived from these organelles as carbon and energy source. <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> actively evokes LDs in macrophages, thus promoting the ‘foamy’ appearance of these host cells, to employ lipids as primary energy source in the ‘dormant’ state during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mehrotra et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, LDs accumulate around <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-containing vacuoles (MCVs) harboring <italic>M. marinum</italic> in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barisch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barisch and Soldati, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barisch and Soldati, 2017b</xref>). These LDs cross to the lumen of the MCV and form ‘intracytosolic lipid inclusions’ (ILIs) within the bacteria. However, during the <italic>D. discoideum-M. marinum</italic> encounter, ILI formation and lipid catabolism apparently do not lead to dormancy of the bacteria.</p><p>The obligate intracellular pathogen <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> forms a pathogen vacuole termed the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fields and Hackstadt, 2002</xref>). The inclusion accumulates various host lipids, such as sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hackstadt et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elwell et al., 2011</xref>) and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Carabeo et al., 2003</xref>), and sphingomyelin promotes intracellular bacterial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Ooij et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elwell and Engel, 2012</xref>). The <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusions also capture LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>), which transverse across the inclusion membrane to the lumen of the pathogen compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cocchiaro et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, LD uptake into <italic>Chlamydia</italic> inclusions proceeds through the formation of an effector protein-mediated LD-inclusion contact site, followed by what appears to be an endocytic uptake leading to membrane-coated, intra-luminal LDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cocchiaro et al., 2008</xref>). LDs seem to be a source of lipids for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, but they are not essential as a delivery carrier of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). Fatty acids are activated by host long chain fatty acid Acyl-CoA synthases, which are recruited to the inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Recuero-Checa et al., 2016</xref>). Membrane-coated, intra-luminal LDs have not been observed in the lumen of LCVs, and hence, it is presently unclear how the LDs translocate into the LCV lumen and how the neutral lipids are made available to intra-vacuolar <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</p><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> FadL promotes the catabolism of palmitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but overall, the degradation of lipids by <italic>Legionella</italic> is not well understood. Analogously to <italic>M. marinum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barisch and Soldati, 2017b</xref>), <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> might hydrolyse triacylglycerols; however, rather than building up ILIs, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> accumulates the storage compound PHB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> produces at least 19 phospholipases (15 phospholipases A, three phospholipases C, and one phospholipase D), which act as virulence factors during intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kuhle and Flieger, 2013</xref>), and some of which might metabolize lipids stored in LDs. While some of the lipases are T2SS substrates and thus are presumably secreted to the LCV lumen, others are Icm/Dot T4SS substrates and translocated to the host cytoplasm. Type II-secreted phospholipases comprise phospholipases A, such as the GDSL lipase family members PlaA and PlaC, or PlaB and PlaD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bender et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lang et al., 2017</xref>), as well as the zinc metallophospholipases C, such as PlcA and PlcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurass et al., 2013</xref>). PlcC (CegC1/Lpg0012) is a type IV (Icm/Dot)-translocated zinc metallophospholipases C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurass et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, or additionally, some of these phospholipases might be involved in degrading the limiting LCV membrane to promote the escape of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> from the pathogen vacuole and the host cell. In agreement with this notion, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> triple mutant strains lacking phospholipases A or C were impaired for LCV rupture in <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, indicating that phospholipases A and C are indeed involved in membrane lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Striednig et al., 2021</xref>). Further studies will address the role of these phospholipases for <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> LD utilization and lipid metabolism. In any case, lipid metabolism and LDs seem to be important for optimal intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, but not essential for bacterial replication and infection.</p><p>Mechanistically, the fusion of LDs with distinct pathogen vacuoles is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, it is unknown whether and how LDs tether and cluster on LCVs and how they cross the pathogen vacuole membrane and translocate inside the pathogen vacuole. As outlined above, RanA and RanBP1 were identified with high probability on LDs isolated from the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> parental strain Ax3 as well as from ∆<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> RanA activator LegG1 promotes LCV-LD interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The underlying mechanism of other factors implicated in LCV-LD interactions is less clear. Given the role of Sey1 for the recruitment, accumulation and contact time of LDs on LCVs, the large fusion GTPase might also play a role in later steps of LCV-LD fusion and membrane crossing. Overall, the proteomics analysis revealed similar proteomes of the LDs isolated from the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> parental strain Ax3 versus ∆<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Sey1 was identified with low probability by proteomics on LDs purified from the <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 parental strain, and Sey1 does not seem to significantly affect the number and size of LDs in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Accordingly, the fatty acid and lipid content of LDs isolated from these two different <italic>D. discoideum</italic> strains might likely also be similar. Taken together, these findings are in agreement with a direct role of Sey1 on LDs for the LCV-LD fusion process. However, Sey1 might also indirectly affect LCV-LD fusion. <italic>D. discoideum</italic> ∆<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba show pleiotropic phenotypes, such as an altered ER architecture, a partially disrupted tubular ER network and defects in intracellular proteolysis, cell motility, and growth on bacterial lawns as well as an impaired LCV expansion and intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hüsler et al., 2021</xref>). On the other hand, the loss of <italic>sey1</italic> does not have major consequences for organelles other than the ER or the architecture of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Since Sey1 affects a number of cellular functions, the large GTPase might also have an effect on the formation and composition of LDs.</p><p>The LD protein perilipin was shed upon uptake of LDs into LCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Perilipin reversibly interacts with the LD surface via amphipathic helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kory et al., 2016</xref>), and therefore, it might be rather easily shed and distributed to the cytoplasm upon LD translocation to the LCV lumen. The mechanism and biological function of perilipin shedding upon pathogen vacuole transfer of the LDs is unknown. Future investigations using the LCV-LD model system for in vivo and in vitro studies by confocal microscopy and reconstitution approaches will provide further insights on the underlying cell biological and infection biological processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

After filtering, we ended with a list of 192 proteins that were either differentially abundant on LDs from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 (39 proteins) or Δ<italic>sey1</italic> (76 proteins), or that belonged to the ‘on’ (7 proteins) / ‘off’ (22 proteins) categories or to the 50 most abundant proteins (48 additional proteins) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We then functionally mapped these proteins manually according to dictyBase classification, resulting in 135 functionally assigned and 57 unassigned proteins, and generated Voronoi treemaps (Paver v2.1, Decodon) to visualize functional clusters and abundance differences between LDs from <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 and Δ<italic>sey1</italic>. Voronoi diagrams were chosen as the output, because this visualization allows a functional clustering of proteins and at the same time is more intuitive by correlating protein abundancies to the sizes of the mosaic tiles in the plot. Individual iBAQ values of proteins on <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 LDs were represented by the area of the mosaic tiles (large tiles: more abundant, small tiles: less abundant). Comparison of protein abundance on Ax3 LDs with abundance of proteins on Δ<italic>sey1</italic> LDs is represented by the color gradient of the mosaic tiles (orange: more abundant on Ax3 LDs, grey: equally abundant on Ax3 and Δ<italic>sey1</italic> LDs, blue: more abundant on Δ<italic>sey1</italic> LDs).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Isotopologue profiling</title><p>To label <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> intracellularly growing in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with <sup>13</sup>C-substrates, we used previously published protocols with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heuner and Eisenreich, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heuner et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 or Δ<italic>sey1</italic> mutant producing calnexin-GFP (CnxA-GFP) were cultivated in eight T75 cell culture flasks per bacterial strain. After the cells reached confluency (~2×10<sup>7</sup> cells per flask), the amoeba were infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> JR32 or Δ<italic>fadL</italic> (MOI 50), by adding bacteria grown in AYE to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 5 at appropriate dilutions. The flasks were then centrifuged to synchronize infection (500 <italic>g</italic>, 10 min) and incubated for 1 hr at 25 °C. To remove extracellular bacteria, cells were washed once with 10 ml SorC buffer (RT), overlaid newly with 10 ml SorC buffer and further incubated at 25 °C. At 5 hr p.i., 200 µM [U-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>16</sub>]palmitate was added to the flasks, and the cells were further incubated for 10 hr.</p><p>At 15 hr p.i., the amoeba were detached using a cell scraper, transferred into 50 ml Falcon tubes, frozen at –80 °C for 1 hr and again thawed to RT. The suspension was then centrifuged at 200 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to new 50 ml Falcon tubes. The pellet, representing eukaryotic cell debris (F1) was washed twice with 50 ml and once with 1 ml cold SorC buffer. The supernatant harvested after the first centrifugation step contained <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> bacteria (F2). This fraction was centrifuged at 3500 <italic>g</italic> for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellet was washed twice with 50 ml and once with 1 ml cold SorC buffer. The supernatant of F2 was filtered through a 0.22 µm pore filter to remove bacteria, and then 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was added to a final concentration of 10%. The supernatant was incubated on ice for 1 hr and centrifuged at 4600 <italic>g</italic> for 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting pellet (F3) contained cytosolic proteins of <italic>D. discoideum</italic>. The pellets of F1, F2, and F3 were autoclaved at 120 °C for 20 min, freeze-dried and stored at –20 °C until analysis. To monitor cell lysis and the purity of F1 and F2, samples were analyzed by light microscopy.</p><p>For isotopologue profiling of amino acids and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), bacterial cells (approximately 10<sup>9</sup>) or 1 mg of the freeze-dried host protein fraction were hydrolysed in 0.5 ml of 6 M HCl for 24 hr at 105 °C, as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Eylert et al., 2010</xref>). The HCl was removed under a stream of nitrogen, and the remainder was dissolved in 200 µl acetic acid. The sample was purified on a cation exchange column of Dowex 50Wx8 (H<sup>+</sup> form, 200–400 mesh, 5×10 mm), which was washed previously with 1 ml methanol and 1 ml ultrapure water. The column was eluted with 2 ml distilled water (eluate 1) and 1 ml 4 M ammonium hydroxide (eluate 2). An aliquot of the respective eluates was dried under a stream of nitrogen at 70 °C. The dried remainder of eluate 2 was dissolved in 50 µl dry acetonitrile and 50 µl <italic>N</italic>-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-<italic>N</italic>-methyltrifluoroacetamide containing 1% tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (Sigma) and kept at 70 °C for 30 min. The resulting mixture of tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivates (TBDMS) of amino acids was used for further GC/MS analysis. Due to acid degradation, the amino acids tryptophan and cysteine could not be detected with this method. Furthermore, the hydrolysis condition led to the conversion of glutamine and asparagine to glutamate and aspartate. PHB was hydrolysed to its monomeric component 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB). For derivatization of 3-HB, the dried aliquot of eluate 1 was dissolved in 100 µl <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>N</italic>-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (Sigma) and incubated in a shaking incubator at 110 rpm (30 min, 40 °C). The resulting trimethylsilyl derivative (TMS) of 3-HB derived from PHB was used for GC/MS analysis without further treatment.</p><p>GC/MS-analysis was performed with a QP2010 Plus gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer (Shimadzu) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (Equity TM-5; 30 m×0.25 mm, 0.25 µm film thickness; SUPELCO) and a quadrupole detector working with electron impact ionization at 70 eV. A volume of 0.1–6 µl of the sample was injected in 1:5 split mode at an interface temperature of 260 °C and a helium inlet pressure of 70 kPa. With a sampling rate of 0.5 s, selected ion monitoring was used. Data was collected using LabSolution software (Shimadzu). All samples were measured three times (technical replicates). <sup>13</sup>C-excess values and isotopologue compositions were calculated as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Eylert et al., 2008</xref>) including: (i) determination of the spectrum of unlabeled derivatized metabolites, (ii) determination of mass isotopologue distributions of labeled metabolites and (iii) correction of <sup>13</sup>C-incorporation concerning the heavy isotopologue contributions due to the natural abundances in the derivatized metabolites. For analysis of amino acids, the column was kept at 150 °C for 3 min and then developed with a temperature gradient of 7 °C min<sup>–1</sup> to a final temperature of 280 °C that was held for 3 min. The amino acids alanine (6.7 min), aspartate (15.4 min), glutamate (16.8 min) were detected, and isotopologue calculations were performed with m/z [M-57]<sup>+</sup> or m/z [M-85]<sup>+</sup>. For the detection of 3-HB derived from PHB, the column was heated at 70 °C for 3 min and then developed with a first temperature gradient of 10 °C min<sup>–1</sup> to a final temperature of 150 °C. This was followed by a second temperature gradient of 50 °C min<sup>–1</sup> to a final temperature of 280 °C, which was held for 3 min. The TMS-derivative of 3-HB, was detected at a retention time of 9.1 min, and isotopologue calculations were performed with m/z [M-15]<sup>+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>If not stated otherwise, data analysis and statistics were performed in GraphPad Prism (Version 5.01, GraphPad Software Inc) using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main concerns and essential experiments required are listed below:</p><p>1) Perform experiments to understand better how Sey1 or LegG1 promote LD recruitment to LCVs. And provide further demonstrations that LDs indeed enter the LCV and how this uptake occurs.</p><p>2) Address concerns about the experiments performed with cells continuously treated with palmitate.</p><p>3) Perform additional experiments to confirm that Sey1 localizes to LDs and address the concerns about contaminations in the mass spec data.</p><p>4) perform experiments to test the alternative hypothesis that LD localizes only with damaged LCV.</p><p>5) In addition, please address the comments related to all technical concerns raised by the reviewers. For example, validate the main differentially expressed proteins by western blot along with Plin as control, among others.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In general, is it necessary to continuously feed the cells with 200uM palmitate? There are plenty of LDs present even in unfed cells (Figure S1B). I assume it is to increase the number of LDs per cell, but at the same time, it may result in the emergence of artifacts that are not normally observed in &quot;non-obese&quot; cells. Related to this (FigS1), is the effect specific for palmitate, or does the addition of other charged or neutral lipids have a similar effect, which would suggest that any well-fed <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> population might promote <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth?</p><p>In Figure 1A, the authors show instances where LDs associate with LCVs, and they propose &quot;integration or even dissolution of the limiting membrane&quot;. Do they envision this to be the precursor for LD uptake? If so, what is the extent to which LDs show this type of 'dissolution' vs normal association? Related to this and the LD uptake proposed in Figure 5, what do the authors envision this membrane dissolution would be good for? Given that LDs are surrounded only by a lipid monolayer, fusion with the outer leaflet of the LCV would not result in LDs entering the lumen. Instead, they would be sandwiched between two lipid monolayers with nowhere to go. If the authors claim that LDs enter the LCV they need to provide molecular evidence for some sort of uptake mechanism, which I consider the main selling point of the paper.</p><p>Searching the literature, I could not find any information about LDs fusing with other cell organelles (except homotypic fusion between LDs). LDs typically engage in &quot;kiss-and-run&quot; or &quot;anchoring' interactions. If no natural fusion machinery exists for LDs, it is highly unlikely that Lp has &quot;invented&quot; one as pathogens usually exploit existing mechanisms /machineries. Again, if uptake really happens then it is imperative to define the mechanism and maybe show the actual uptake process in real time.</p><p>Figure 1C, S2: Given that the signals for Sey1, RanBP, and RanA are so abundant within cells, it is difficult to determine what organelles they do or do not colocalize with. It would be more convincing if negative examples were provided (and quantified) for comparison – organelles (maybe mitochondria or lysosomes) that are not expected to colocalize with Sey1. Another potential control would be to tag different ER proteins and see how they compare. Without such reference points, the data shown here for LCVs are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Figure 1B: I am unfamiliar with the Voronoi diagram and am not sure what additional information it is giving us over something like a volcano plot or heatmap arranged by the function of the proteins. I also don't understand the distinction of the &quot;black frames&quot; which I also have a difficult time differentiating from the other lines.</p><p>More importantly, the authors claim that the mass spec data confirmed that Sey1 localizes to LDs. The data for that are not very convincing. The 'rank abundance' of Sey1 is so low even in the WT sample, and hardly different from the rank abundance of Sey1 in what is purportedly a sey1 KO. I am perhaps missing something or not understanding their mass spec data, but combined with their microscopy data, I am skeptical about their claim that Sey1 is present on LDs. Was it confirmed that the density gradient LDs were pure with nothing contaminating them?</p><p>Likewise, in Figure 4 the authors state that the difference in their +/- Sey1 experiments is due to Sey1 being present in LD fractions promoting the process in a GTP-dependent manner. They should probe the LD fractions by western blot to see if (how much) Sey1 is present in LD fraction from wt cells vs KO cells. Also, what happens if LDs are isolated from cells producing Sey1 mutants that constitutively bind either GDP or GTP? This should render the experiment insensitive to GTP addition and address if the stimulatory effect of GTP indeed acts through Sey1 or maybe some other protein that binds GTP.</p><p>The authors make use of a sey1 KO cell line. Since Sey1 is of such central importance for ER function, it would be recommended to examine how deleting sey1 globally affects protein levels, not just those related to the LDs. This goes back to the initial criticism noted above regarding how to distinguish direct from indirect effects. Another point to consider is that sey1 deletion might affect the lipid composition of LDs. Is there a difference in fatty acid content between the Ax3 and ∆sey1 LDs that might explain why Lp grows less proficiently?</p><p>In various figures, the authors quantify LCV-LD dynamics. It would help if the authors could define exactly what they count as &quot;contact&quot;. Second, I personally do not see the utility of the Contact or Mean LD number/LCV metrics. I think all experiments should instead have LD number/ LCV and if the microscopy is live, also include the retention time if desired.</p><p>At this point, I would also like to see complementation of the ∆legG1 phenotypes, both with the wild-type protein and known mutant forms that lack certain activities. This goes back to the criticism stated above that the underlying molecular mechanism of their model has not been examined in detail. Also, do LegG1 mutants fail to recruit RanA which would be expected given the reduction in LD contacts? Can deletion of legG1 be rescued by producing constitutively active Ran GTPase? These types of experiments would help to solidify the molecular details of the proposed recruitment mechanism.</p><p>Related to this, it is a bit surprising to see that the effects of deleting Sey1 and LegG1 are additive (Figure 2E, F). If LegG1/RanGTPase and Sey1 function in the same pathway as the authors propose, then deletion of either of those genes should lead to a complete loss of LD recruitment.</p><p>Since Lpg1810 has not been characterized before, the authors should confirm in synthetic media if FadL indeed mediates lipid uptake by L. pneumophila.</p><p>Lastly, the authors should experimentally exclude the possibility that LDs are detected only within LCVs whose integrity has been compromised. It is known from earlier studies that LCVs, especially during isolation from cells, can rupture, which would render them permissive to cell organelles, including LDs. I realize that most of the lumenal LDs lack perilipin, but that could have a reason other than shedding during uptake.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The involvement of Type 3 and Type 4 secretion system factors has been observed in the induction of lipid remodeling and LD biogenesis in several bacterial infections (PMID: 34783412, PMID: 18333886, PMID: 18486438, PMID: 29390006). Since one of the main objectives of the article is to understand the phagosome/lipid droplets relationship, it is important to add the LD/phagosome dynamic also in control cells not treated with palmitate to figure 1.</p><p>2. Still in this context, a high level of fatty acid is very cytotoxic for many cells, please add evidence that this concentration of palmitate does not interfere with the D. discoideum cell viability.</p><p>3. Bacterial replication data are one of the bases supporting the authors' hypothesis that LDs favor bacterial replication. I strongly suggest that this data be included in Figure 1.</p><p>4. The conditions used for LD purification for proteomic studies were not clearly described in the methods section. Was the purification performed in palmitate-stimulated cells or not?</p><p>5. One of the challenges of analyzing the proteome of isolated LDs is the degree of enrichment of that organelle. Due to the limitations of the model, I recommend that authors highlight the bona fide LD-resident proteins found in the LD proteome. Furthermore, it would be important to validate the main differentially expressed proteins by western blot along with Plin as control. Did the authors observe any protein related to the pathogen/host interaction in the proteome of this organelle?</p><p>6. The phospholipase PldA is one of the main proteins differentially expressed in D. discoideum Δsey1. It would be highly informative to use phospholipase inhibitors to assess the contribution of phospholipases to L. pneumophila LD utilization and lipid metabolism.</p><p>7. Another control that needs to be included in the manuscript is 13C-Excess (mol%) in key metabolites of amoeba. This control is important for distinguishing the metabolites that are the result of L. pneumophila metabolism and those that are obtained from the host cell.</p><p>8. Some of the legends do not include the number of replicates and n of samples used. The information should be included in all experiments.</p><p>9. In Figure 6, the fold change of bacterial replication should be included. Still in this context, it is important to include in the discussion that the LDs and lipid metabolism seem to be important for optimal bacterial replication, but not essential for L. pneumophila replication and infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85142.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main concerns and essential experiments required are listed below:</p><p>1) Perform experiments to understand better how Sey1 or LegG1 promote LD recruitment to LCVs.

There are plenty of LDs present even in unfed cells (Figure S1B). I assume it is to increase the number of LDs per cell, but at the same time, it may result in the emergence of artifacts that are not normally observed in &quot;non-obese&quot; cells. Related to this (FigS1), is the effect specific for palmitate, or does the addition of other charged or neutral lipids have a similar effect, which would suggest that any well-fed <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> population might promote <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> growth?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. We performed additional experiments to quantify and compare the number of LDs per cell and their size in unfed and in palmitate-fed amoeba (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Uninfected <italic>D. discoideum</italic> strain Ax3 and ∆<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba and the strains infected with either <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> wild-type or ∆<italic>icmT</italic> harbored similar numbers of LDs. Upon feeding the amoeba with 200 µM palmitate, all amoeba contained more LDs, and the infection with wild-type <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> reduced the number of LDs compared to uninfected, palmitate-fed amoeba (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). These results are now outlined in the text (l. 205-229).</p><p>We also performed additional experiments to quantify the ratio of LDs per LCV and LDs per LCV area in unstimulated <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 or ∆<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In unfed <italic>D. discoideum</italic>, the number of LDs per LCV and the number of LDs per LCV area were significantly larger in the parental <italic>D. discoideum</italic> strain Ax2 as compared to Δ<italic>sey1</italic> mutant amoeba. These findings are similar to amoeba stimulated with 200 µM palmitate. However, the overall number of LDs per LCV or LDs per LCV area increased upon feeding the amoeba with palmitate in agreement with an increased overall number of LDs per cell. Taken together, these results indicate that while feeding <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with palmitate increases the total number of LDs, it does not change the positive effect of Sey1 on the ratio of LDs per LCV or LCV area. Accordingly, our findings about LD-LCV interactions in palmitate-fed <italic>D. discoideum</italic> are also valid for unstimulated amoeba. These results are now outlined in the text (l. 219-229).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1A, the authors show instances where LDs associate with LCVs, and they propose &quot;integration or even dissolution of the limiting membrane&quot;. Do they envision this to be the precursor for LD uptake? If so, what is the extent to which LDs show this type of 'dissolution' vs normal association? Related to this and the LD uptake proposed in Figure 5, what do the authors envision this membrane dissolution would be good for? Given that LDs are surrounded only by a lipid monolayer, fusion with the outer leaflet of the LCV would not result in LDs entering the lumen. Instead, they would be sandwiched between two lipid monolayers with nowhere to go. If the authors claim that LDs enter the LCV they need to provide molecular evidence for some sort of uptake mechanism, which I consider the main selling point of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The cryo-tomograms in Figure 1B showing intimate interactions of LDs with the limiting LCV membrane in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 infected with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> JR32 are representative, and we did not observe “normal” associations, i.e., structures that look like membrane contact sites. We now explicitly state this finding in the text (l. 163-165). LDs entering a pathogen vacuole have been previously described for <italic>Mycobacterium marinum</italic> in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and for <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> in HeLa cells. In these studies, the authors show that LDs translocate from the host cytoplasm to the pathogen vacuole lumen. In the case of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, the authors show that LDs enter the pathogen vacuole (inclusion) lumen by invagination of the inclusion membrane, resulting in membrane-decorated intra-luminal LDs. We did not observe such structures of LDs in LCVs. We now outline these results in the Discussion section (l. 466-468) and further discuss the implications of the LD monolayer interacting with the LCV bilayer (l. 435-441). The mechanism of LD translocation of the LCV membrane is certainly an interesting topic, which will be addressed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Searching the literature, I could not find any information about LDs fusing with other cell organelles (except homotypic fusion between LDs). LDs typically engage in &quot;kiss-and-run&quot; or &quot;anchoring' interactions. If no natural fusion machinery exists for LDs, it is highly unlikely that Lp has &quot;invented&quot; one as pathogens usually exploit existing mechanisms /machineries. Again, if uptake really happens then it is imperative to define the mechanism and maybe show the actual uptake process in real time.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting these very interesting mechanistic aspects. While LDs indeed do not seem to fuse with other organelles, they are formed within and released from the ER bilayer. The release is reversible, and accordingly, cytosolic LDs interact with and re-integrate into the ER (Thiam <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013, Wilfling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013, Wilfling <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). The process is dependent on the small GTPase Arf1 and the coatomer complex-I (COPI), but otherwise is ill defined, and specific “integration factors” have not been identified. Analogously, LDs might interact with and integrate into the LCV limiting membrane. We have now outlined these thoughts in the Discussion section (l. 435-441).</p><p>This raises the intriguing possibility that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> might indeed have “invented” an effector protein promoting the LD-LCV integration. We agree with the reviewer that pathogens usually exploit existing mechanisms/machineries. However, <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> also produces effectors, which catalyze seemingly novel cell biological reactions. A prominent example is the SidE family of ubiquitin ligases, which catalyze ubiquitination through a single effector protein showing ADP-ribosylation and nucleotidase/ phosphohydrolase activity thus bypassing the canonical E1-E2-E3 ubiquitin ligase system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C, S2: Given that the signals for Sey1, RanBP, and RanA are so abundant within cells, it is difficult to determine what organelles they do or do not colocalize with. It would be more convincing if negative examples were provided (and quantified) for comparison – organelles (maybe mitochondria or lysosomes) that are not expected to colocalize with Sey1. Another potential control would be to tag different ER proteins and see how they compare. Without such reference points, the data shown here for LCVs are difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been published that in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> GFP-Sey1 localizes to the ER (Steiner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2017), and RanA-GFP as well as RanBP1-GFP localize to LCVs (Rothmeier <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013). In this study, we aimed at validating the localization of these GFP fusion proteins to LDs. We agree with the reviewer that the abundance of the GFP fusion proteins in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> renders it difficult to judge whether they actually co-localize with LDs or not. However, given the abundance of cell organelles like mitochondria or lysosomes, co-localization studies with these organelles would likely also not allow to determine a more precise subcellular localization of the GFP fusion proteins. For a better comparison among each other, we now show all the localization experiments in one figure, new Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Moreover, we now also assess the localization of GFP-LegG1 with regard to LDs in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Ax3 and ∆<italic>sey1</italic> (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2), and we analyze the effect of LegG1 on microtubule formation in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> using GFP-tubulin A (new Figure 4D).

We believe that the Voronoi diagram partially overcomes these shortcomings, as it allows a functional clustering of proteins and at the same time is more intuitive by correlating protein abundancies to the sizes of the different mosaic tiles in the plot.

I am perhaps missing something or not understanding their mass spec data, but combined with their microscopy data, I am skeptical about their claim that Sey1 is present on LDs.

We agree with the reviewer that based on our MS and fluorescence microscopy experiments the evidence that Sey1 localizes to LDs in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is not very strong, and Sey1 might affect the LCV-LD dynamics in a more indirect manner. Unfortunately, there are no antibodies available, which recognize <italic>D. discoideum</italic> Sey1. Taking into consideration these ambiguities, we state in the manuscript (l. 253-256): “Under the conditions used, GFP-Sey1 accumulated in the vicinity of LDs in intact cells as well as in cell homogenates, but apparently did not co-localize with LDs. This staining pattern suggests that Sey1 localizes only in very low amounts to LDs, or that localization of Sey1 to LDs is impaired due to the fluorescent protein tag.” Moreover, we now document in the manuscript the enrichment of mCherry-Plin-positive LDs upon purification by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1, l. 233-236).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, in Figure 4 the authors state that the difference in their +/- Sey1 experiments is due to Sey1 being present in LD fractions promoting the process in a GTP-dependent manner.

Also, what happens if LDs are isolated from cells producing Sey1 mutants that constitutively bind either GDP or GTP? This should render the experiment insensitive to GTP addition and address if the stimulatory effect of GTP indeed acts through Sey1 or maybe some other protein that binds GTP.</p></disp-quote><p>Given the ambiguity of the results, we down-tone the statement that Sey1 localizing to LDs in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> is directly causing the LCV-LD interactions (see above, point 6), text (l. 253-254) and Discussion section (l. 501-515).

Another point to consider is that sey1 deletion might affect the lipid composition of LDs.

Still in this context, it is important to include in the discussion that the LDs and lipid metabolism seem to be important for optimal bacterial replication, but not essential for L. pneumophila replication and infection.</p></disp-quote><p>The bacterial growth rate is determined in the exponential phase. The initial infection of <italic>D. discoideum</italic> with <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is synchronized by centrifugation. The following infection rounds lasting several days are no longer synchronized, and therefore, it is difficult to determine whether and which portion of the intracellular bacteria grow exponentially. Consequently, the fold change of bacterial replication cannot be precisely determined. We now outline in the Discussion section that lipid metabolism and LDs are important but not essential for intracellular replication of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (l. 487-489).</p></body></sub-article></article>
