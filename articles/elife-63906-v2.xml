CCHF is caused by infection with the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and case fatality rates can be as high as 30%. Despite causing severe disease in humans, our understanding of the host and viral determinants of CCHFV pathogenesis are limited. A major limitation in the investigation of CCHF has been the lack of suitable small animal models. Wild-type mice are resistant to clinical isolates of CCHFV and consequently, mice must be deficient in type I interferon responses to study the more severe aspects of CCHFV. We report here a mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV that recapitulates in adult, immunocompetent mice the severe CCHF observed in humans. This mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV significantly improves our ability to study host and viral determinants of CCHFV-induced disease in a highly tractable mouse model.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus</kwd><kwd>CCHFV</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawman</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A mouse-adapted strain of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus that recapitulates human disease in wild-type mice significantly improves our ability to study Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus pathogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the cause of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). CCHFV is among the most widely distributed hemorrhagic fever viruses with cases reported through Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Southern and Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bente et al., 2013</xref>). Ticks of the <italic>Hyalomma</italic> genus are the principal vector and reservoir for CCHFV and cases of CCHF closely follow the geographic range of <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bente et al., 2013</xref>). Climate change is leading to expansion of the range for <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks and recently <italic>Hyalomma</italic> ticks were found as far north as Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grandi et al., 2020</xref>). CCHF begins as a non-specific febrile illness that can rapidly progress to hemorrhagic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ergönül, 2006</xref>), and there are currently no widely approved vaccines nor antivirals for CCHF. Case fatality rates can be as high as 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bente et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To date, mouse models of CCHF have been limited to mice deficient in type I IFN responses, either through genetic deficiency such as interferon alpha receptor knock-out (<italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zivcec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bente et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bereczky et al., 2010</xref>) or through transient deficiency by antibody-mediated blockade of the interferon alpha receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindquist et al., 2018</xref>). Infection of these mice typically results in a rapid onset fatal disease with many similarities to fatal human cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zivcec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bente et al., 2010</xref>), although our group has recently developed a model that recapitulates the convalescent phase of CCHF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hawman et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the lack of type I interferon in these models limits their usefulness for studying innate immunity to CCHFV, the rapid onset lethal disease in most of these models precludes study of later host responses and lack of type I interferon can impact adaptive immunity following infection or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke and Bradfute, 2020</xref>).</p><p>We therefore sought to select a variant of CCHFV that was able to cause disease in fully immunocompetent mice. We serially passaged the clinical isolate, CCHFV strain Hoti, in mice deficient in adaptive immunity (recombination-activating-gene two deficient, <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice to generate a mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV (MA-CCHFV). In contrast to the parental CCHFV strain, MA-CCHFV was able to cause severe disease in WT mice that was associated with replication to high titers in multiple tissues, severe pathology in the liver and a severe inflammatory immune response. Unexpectedly, we identified a significant sex-linked bias in disease severity with female mice largely resistant to severe disease. In addition, we found that both host innate and adaptive immune responses are necessary to survive MA-CCHFV infection. Cumulatively, we report here a mouse-adapted variant of CCHFV that recapitulates in WT mice many aspects of severe human cases of CCHF.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mouse-adaptation of CCHFV strain Hoti</title><p>The ability of human clinical isolates of CCHFV to cause disease in type I IFN deficient but not sufficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hawman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hawman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oestereich et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindquist et al., 2018</xref>) suggests CCHFV is unable to antagonize mouse innate immunity. We hypothesized that chronic infection and serial passage of CCHFV within the livers of <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which possess intact innate immune responses but lack adaptive immunity, would select for CCHFV variants that had adapted to overcome mouse innate restriction factors. This approach has successfully resulted in mouse-adaptation of the unrelated Zika and chikungunya viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hawman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorman et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore infected a <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse with the clinical isolate CCHFV strain Hoti by the intraperitoneal (IP) route and for the first passage collected blood at 4 weeks post-infection (WPI). For passage 2, we inoculated a naive <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse with this blood and for remaining passages collected liver tissue when mice were exhibiting severe clinical signs of disease (hunched posture, piloerection, lethargy, weight loss). Liver tissue was homogenized, clarified of large debris by centrifugation and inoculated IP into naive <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. At each passage, liver tissue from an individual mouse was passed into an individual naive mouse without purification or isolation . This serial passaging in <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice was performed nine times during which we observed a decrease in time of onset of severe disease (&gt; day 28 post-infection (PI) for passage 1 to &lt;day 7 PI passage 9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We performed a final two passages in the liver tissue of wild-type C57BL/6J mice for 11 total passages in mice. To monitor mouse adaptation during passaging, we evaluated inoculation of small groups of wild-type mice with virus stocks grown in tissue culture from homogenized liver tissue after <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> passage 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As soon as passage 4, we observed transient weight loss in wild-type mice infected with passaged virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Weight loss after inoculation with later passages was associated with other clinical signs of disease such as piloerection, hunched posture and lethargy (data not shown) suggesting we had selected for a variant of CCHFV capable of causing severe disease in WT mice. After 11 total passages, we grew a virus stock in vitro on SW13 cells, hereafter termed MA-CCHFV. MA-CCHFV was sequenced by Illumina-based deep sequencing to exclude contamination and titered by SW13 median tissue culture infectious dose assay (TCID<sub>50</sub>). Upon infection of WT mice, this variant caused substantial weight loss and clinical disease in male WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, unexpectedly, infected female mice exhibited milder signs of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MA-CCHFV causes severe disease in male C57BL/6J mice</title><p>To more fully characterize the clinical disease caused by MA-CCHFV, we infected 8-week-old WT C57BL/6J mice with 10,000 TCID<sub>50</sub> of MA-CCHFV via the IP route. For comparison, a group of mice were infected with an identical dose of parental strain CCHFV Hoti or mock infected. As expected, inoculation of WT mice with CCHFV strain Hoti resulted in no clinical disease besides transient weight loss on day 1 PI (&lt;5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, inoculation of male WT mice with MA-CCHFV resulted in severe clinical disease with significant weight loss beginning on day 4 PI and peaking on day 6 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition to weight loss, male mice infected with MA-CCHFV exhibited overt clinical signs such as piloerection, hunched posture, and lethargy. Nearly all mice began to recover beginning on day 7 PI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During our studies with MA-CCHFV in this report, lethal outcome in male mice was occasionally observed in some cohorts (1 of 32, 1 of 8, 2 of 12) indicating that lethal outcome is possible, albeit rare. Again, female WT C57BL/6J mice infected with MA-CCHFV exhibited a milder clinical disease with no significant weight loss compared to mock-infected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and significantly less weight loss compared to male WT C57BL/6J mice infected with MA-CCHFV. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Little-to-no clinical disease was observed in mice infected with 0.01 or 1 TCID<sub>50</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Male mice infected with 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> or greater showed weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and overt clinical signs of disease. Again, female mice infected with similar doses of MA-CCHFV exhibited milder weight loss compared to male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) that was also associated with milder overt clinical signs of disease. We evaluated sero-conversion to CCHFV at day 14 PI by whole-virion ELISA to confirm infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and found that a dose of 0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub> resulted in productive infection of three of five male and four of five female mice. At doses of 1 TCID<sub>50</sub> and higher, all mice had detectable anti-CCHFV immunoglobulin at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, the ID<sub>50</sub> of MA-CCHFV in WT male or female mice is &lt;0.01 TCID<sub>50</sub>. Cumulatively, these results demonstrated that doses of MA-CCHFV as low as 100 TCID<sub>50</sub> could cause disease in male WT C57BL/6J mice, although doses 10,000-fold lower still resulted in productive infection. For the rest of our studies, we infected mice IP with 10,000 TCID<sub>50</sub> of MA-CCHFV, unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MA-CCHFV causes disease in male mice of multiple laboratory strains</title><p>MA-CCHFV was generated by serial passage in mice on the C57BL/6J background. We wanted to determine if the MA-CCHFV phenotype was restricted to C57BL/6J mice or if MA-CCHFV could cause disease in other commonly used laboratory strains of mice. We therefore infected 8-week-old male and female C57BL/6J, C57BL6/NCr, 129S1, BALBc/J, or outbred CD1 mice IP with an intermediate dose of MA-CCHFV (1000 TCID<sub>50</sub>). Similar to C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), male BALBc/J, C57BL6/NCr, and CD1 mice exhibited weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>) that was associated with overt clinical signs such as piloerection, hunched posture, and lethargy. Again, consistent with our data in C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), female mice of these strains exhibited milder clinical disease compared to the male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>) demonstrating the sex-bias toward more severe disease in male mice is not restricted to the C57BL/6J strain.

A lethal model of MA-CCHFV infection would have utility for studies evaluating antiviral therapeutics or therapeutic interventions that seek to prevent CCHFV-induced mortality. For several viral infections, younger mice exhibit more severe disease than older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Couderc et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johnson et al., 1972</xref>) and neonatal but not adult WT mice are susceptible to non-adapted CCHFV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogstraal, 1979</xref>).

These data suggest that passaging of CCHFV in <italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice quickly selected for mouse adapted variants. We also evaluated the conservation of the mutated aa residues in MA-CCHFV among seven divergent CCHFV isolates from all five clades of CCHFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukashev et al., 2016</xref>).

To our knowledge, this represents the first CCHFV variant capable of causing overt disease in wild-type mice. To date, infection of adult immunocompetent mice with CCHFV has resulted in severely restricted viral replication and little to no disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zivcec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bente et al., 2010</xref>). Even strains passaged 27 times in newborn mice failed to cause disease in adult immunocompetent mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hoogstraal, 1979</xref>) and as a result, studies of severe CCHF have required use of mice either genetically deficient in type I IFN signaling (e.g. <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zivcec et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bente et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hawman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hawman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oestereich et al., 2014</xref>) or transiently suppressed by type I IFN receptor blockade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrison et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lindquist et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, until now, the only immunocompetent animal model of CCHF has been cynomolgus macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haddock et al., 2018a</xref>) and ethical and practical considerations limit the use of this model for initial investigations of CCHFV pathogenesis or therapeutics. The ability of MA-CCHFV to cause disease in fully immunocompetent mice represents a significant improvement in our ability to study CCHFV pathogenesis in a highly tractable mouse model. Importantly, MA-CCHFV recapitulates many aspects of severe human CCHF, with MA-CCHFV-infected mice developing high viral loads in multiple tissues, severe liver pathology and an inflammatory immune response consistent with human cases of CCHF. More severe disease in male mice was associated with higher viral loads, increased liver enzymes and increased inflammatory cytokines compared to female mice or mice infected with non-adapted CCHFV Hoti. These parameters have all been shown to correlate with disease outcome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bente et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ergönül, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ergonul et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Papa et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting the spectrum of disease severity in WT mice has similar correlates to human CCHF cases.</p><p>The consistent sex-linked bias toward more severe disease in adult WT male mice was unexpected. Our data show that adult female WT mice are largely resistant to severe disease following infection with MA-CCHFV, exhibiting milder clinical disease, earlier control of viral loads, reduced inflammatory cytokine production and reduced liver pathology compared to male mice. However, MA-CCHFV infection was lethal in young-female WT mice and female <italic>Ifnar1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice demonstrating that resistance to MA-CCHFV by female mice is age-dependent and requires both innate and adaptive host responses. Nevertheless, the relevance of this sex-linked bias in mice toward human disease is unclear. Although some studies have identified human males as more likely to become infected with CCHFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Monsalve-Arteaga et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yagci-Caglayik et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bower et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chinikar et al., 2010</xref>), this is more likely due to cultural practices in which men are more likely to engage in activities such as farming, herding or butchering that place them at higher risk for exposure to CCHFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chapman et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozkurt et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, female mice and humans often exhibit stronger immune responses to vaccinations and pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein and Flanagan, 2016</xref>) and it is possible that female mice exhibit more robust and/or protective responses to the MA-CCHFV infection. Despite similar viral loads between male or female mice infected with MA-CCHFV at day 1 and day 3 PI, male mice had significantly greater production of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, G-CSF, MCP-1, MIP1α, MIP1β, RANTES, and IFNβ than female mice on day 3 PI demonstrating that male mice responded with a much stronger inflammatory response than female mice. This response in male mice was associated with delayed viral control and more severe disease suggesting these responses may contribute to the distinct disease outcome observed between male and female mice. Similar cytokine patterns have been observed in Ebola virus disease where dysregulated host responses significantly contribute to the severe mortality observed in animal models and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bixler and Goff, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, IFNβ has been shown to have immunosuppressive effects leading to impaired viral clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ng et al., 2015</xref>) suggesting the distinct type I IFN response in MA-CCHFV infected male mice may also have consequence during later stages of disease. In contrast to innate responses, male and female mice developed similar B- and T-cell responses to the infection and our data indicate these responses are critical for survival of acute MA-CCHFV infection. Further studies will be needed to determine how these responses limit and/or promote MA-CCHFV pathogenesis. Nevertheless, our findings clearly highlight how MA-CCHFV infection of WT mice provides a suitable model for studying innate and adaptive immune responses to CCHFV infection, including type I IFN responses, studies that have been severely limited with current mouse models of CCHF.</p><p>We also observed differences in disease outcome upon infection of several strains of mice, with 129S1 mice appearing largely resistant to MA-CCHFV. Thus, in addition to sex-linked determinants, there also exist strain-linked determinants of disease outcome. Given the wide-spectrum of disease outcomes in humans and NHPs infected with CCHFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ergönül, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hawman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haddock et al., 2018a</xref>), the spectrum of disease in male vs female WT mice and between different laboratory strains of mice provides a novel opportunity to investigate the host determinants of CCHF disease outcome in a mouse model.</p><p>Cumulatively, we identified five non-synonymous mutations in MA-CCHFV compared to parental CCHFV Hoti strain. The function of the mutations identified in MA-CCHFV will require further study. Two mutations were identified in the viral S segment resulting in two coding changes in NP and one also resulting in a coding change in the opposite sense encoded NSs. The CCHFV NSs has been shown to disrupt the mitochondrial membrane potential and induce apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barnwal et al., 2016</xref>). Given the central role of mitochondria in innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">West et al., 2011</xref>) it is tempting to speculate that the coding mutation identified in the MA-CCHFV NSs may modulate the ability of MA-CCHFV to antagonize mouse innate immune signaling. Indeed, the NSs of several distantly related viruses in the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order have been shown to block the host type I IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billecocq et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wuerth and Weber, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ly and Ikegami, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rezelj et al., 2017</xref>) demonstrating this may be a common function of <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> NSs proteins. However, to date, such a function of the CCHFV NSs has not been described. The NP of CCHFV is responsible for binding the viral RNA but also has functions in promoting translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeeva et al., 2017</xref>), has an endonuclease function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2012</xref>), interacts with human MxA, a potent restriction factor of CCHFV in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2004</xref>) and contains a conserved DEVD caspase 3 cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karlberg et al., 2011</xref>). Structurally, the mutations in NP are in the mobile ‘arm’ domain of NP, proximal (37 and 14aa distant) to the DEVD caspase 3 cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guo et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the mutations in the MA-CCHFV NP could alter several functions of the NP protein.</p><p>One non-synonymous amino acid change, C865Y, was identified within the NSm protein of the CCHFV M segment. The precise function of the CCHFV NSm in the viral life cycle is unknown but the selection for and complete penetrance of the C865Y mutation in the MA-CCHFV NSm suggests CCHFV NSm has critical function in vivo for the MA phenotype. In distantly related Bunyamwera virus, the NSm protein is required for virus assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shi et al., 2006</xref>), although in Rift Valley Fever Virus, also distantly related to CCHFV, it is dispensable for virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerrard et al., 2007</xref>) indicating members of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order encode NSm proteins of varied function. Recently, CCHFV lacking the NSm protein was found to grow to similar titers in vitro and in vivo in IFNAR<sup>-/-</sup> mice demonstrating NSm is not required for viral growth in the absence of type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welch et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement, in vitro virus-like-particle studies showed NSm supported efficient virion assembly and secretion although NSm was not essential for these functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Freitas et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, NSm may also play a role in the tick-vector as growth of a mouse-passaged strain of CCHFV in ticks selected for a mutation in NSm demonstrating tick-specific selective pressures are exerted on NSm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xia et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, we did not identify any coding change in the viral Gn or Gc envelope glycoproteins suggesting MA-CCHFV has not adapted to mice by altering utilization of mouse-specific proteins for binding and entry.</p><p>Four mutations resulting in two non-synonymous mutations in the L protein were found in MA-CCHFV L segment. The L segment of CCHFV is unusually large for viruses of the <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zivcec et al., 2016</xref>) encoding a protein of nearly 4000 amino acids and the two coding mutations found in MA-CCHFV occur in regions without ascribed function. Thus, it is difficult to speculate on the functional consequence of the mutations identified in the L segment and further studies will be needed. Interestingly, despite the function of the L protein OTU domain in modulating innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Scholte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Capodagli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frias-Staheli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">James et al., 2011</xref>) and the hypothesis that poor affinity of the CCHFV OTU domain for mouse ISG-15 could be a barrier to CCHFV infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deaton et al., 2016</xref>), no mutations were identified in or proximal to this domain.</p><p>The availability of a reverse genetics system for CCHFV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bergeron et al., 2015</xref>) will allow for further investigation into the function of these mutations in the MA-CCHFV phenotype. Additionally, although our study was focused on developing a tractable small rodent model for CCHF, MA-CCHFV furthers the suggestion that distinct hosts and reservoirs can influence CCHFV genetics and potential virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gonzalez et al., 1995</xref>). The availability of tools to study CCHFV transmission <italic>in vivo</italic> under requisite biocontainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargili et al., 2013</xref>) may enable studies using MA-CCHFV to explore the evolutionary constraints placed on CCHFV by its tick-mammal life cycle.</p><p>In conclusion, MA-CCHFV represents a significant advancement for research into CCHFV by enabling study of CCHFV infection in adult, immunocompetent mice while importantly still recapitulating many aspects of severe cases of human CCHF. The ability to infect the plethora of genetically manipulated mouse strains available will permit studies investigating pathogenic and protective host responses to the infection, including those requiring intact type I IFN signaling. These studies may identify novel therapeutic intervention strategies to limit the severe morbidity and mortality observed in CCHFV-infected humans. MA-CCHFV will also enable preclinical evaluation of vaccines and antivirals in mice that are fully competent for type I interferon, an improvement over existing models requiring genetic- or transient-IFN deficiency. Lastly, ongoing studies evaluating the function of the identified mouse-adaptive mutations in mediating the mouse-adapted phenotype will further our understanding of the functions of viral proteins in antagonism of host immune responses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Other</td><td>Hoti</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Virus strain</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>MA-CCHFV</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Virus strain</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p><italic>Rag2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Rag1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice on the C57BL/6J background (stock #008449, stock #002216 respectively), wild-type C57BL/6J (stock #000664), BALBc/J (stock #000651), and 129S1 (stock #002448) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

mice. Development of a mouse-adapted strain of CCHFV, along with identification of differences in disease susceptibility based on sex of the animal, represent an important finding in the field of emerging viruses. The work is extremely well done, with defined study aims, clearly presented results and robust data covering the major aspects of disease pathology. Furthermore, the findings presented here are important given the interest and need for an immunocompetent small animal model of CCHFV disease. This work will greatly benefit the field in both basic understanding of CCHFV pathology as well as in ongoing antiviral and vaccine development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Immunocompetent Mouse Model for Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The development of a suitable animal model that mimic the human-specific disease Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever has been difficult since the discovery of the disease in 1944. Immunocompetent small mammalian models are permissive to infection but refractory to disease. As a result, mice with knock outs in the interferon response have been used, which are not ideally suited of the immune system and vaccines. Hawman et al. present and characterize an immunocompetent mouse model for CCHF by adapting the CCHFV to the mouse. This is a valuable tool in pathogenesis, countermeasure, and virus evolution studies. This straightforward, well-written manuscript that also describes important sex differences in susceptibility to disease in mice infected with the mouse-adapted CCHFV. Overall, this study is a significant step forward for the field through its description of an immunocompetent mouse model. Comments to improve the text are listed below.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) One critique of the study is the lack of data detailing the clinical disease of MA-CCHFV itself. While weight loss is a useful metric in this model, I would have liked to have seen an evaluation of clinical signs throughout the challenge period, i.e., clinical scores at each day, which would help the reader better understand any inherent variability in the model. For example, and it is touched upon in the results, the large error bars in Figure 1B indicate that the female mice infected with MA-EBOV have a much more variable disease course than male mice – a representation of clinical scores would help with the reporting of this data. It may also be useful to represent individual animals in these weight loss graphs rather than use the mean, again for clarity. A clearer understanding of the expected disease course and clinical signs in a MA-CCHFV infection from challenge to recovery is would benefit any future research understanding the efficacy of potential antiviral compounds or vaccines.</p><p>2) Why were the passaged viruses not plaque -picked, and can the authors speculate on how the viral swarm/quasi species is influenced by the passaging? The authors comment on the non-synonymous mutations but not really how the SNP change from passage to passage.</p><p>3) Results first paragraph: can the authors include the onset of disease for each passage in the supplementary information?</p><p>4) Was there a reason than an intermediate dose (1,000 TCID50s) of MA-CCHFV was used when infecting multiple mouse strains rather than the 10,000 TCID50s used elsewhere?</p><p>5) While MA-CCHFV was shown to be lethal in the 3wk old mice, do we have comparative data for for wt Hoti?</p><p>6) The authors state that the clinical presentation was milder in females. I might have overlooked this in the manuscript, but is there a statistical side-by-side comparison of males vs. females in their different clinical parameters (weight loss, disease severity/scoring)? Figure 1?</p><p>7) The authors state &quot;NSm is dispensable for virus replication (Gerrard et al., 2007)&quot;. This is true for mammalian systems, however, not in mosquitoes, where it determines vector competence. Han et al., 2016 demonstrated a non-synonymous amino acid change in NSm after the mouse-passaged CCHFV strain IbAr 10200 was passaged back in ticks.

However, our subjective opinion is that weight loss correlated well with overt clinical signs of disease such as ruffled fur, hunched posture and lethargy. In addition to weight loss, we measured viral loads, inflammatory cytokines and liver enzymes that all correlated with disease severity. These objective parameters could be used as read outs for the efficacy of vaccines and antivirals.</p><p>Although the error bars in Figure 1B are larger, cumulatively over the course of the studies we have observed consistently less disease in female mice although on occasion we do have female mice that have disease similar to male mice. We have provided the data as individual mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> however, we believe these graphs make discerning the groups difficult so we have presented them as mean plus standard deviation in the main text figures.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63906-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why were the passaged viruses not plaque -picked, and can the authors speculate on how the viral swarm/quasi species is influenced by the passaging? The authors comment on the non-synonymous mutations but not really how the SNP change from passage to passage.</p></disp-quote><p>We avoided plaque-picking virus as we wished to avoid any growth of virus in tissue culture until final generation of stocks. We had concerns that passaging in tissue culture may select against mouse-adapted variants. For example, a mouse-adapted variant may plaque poorly or not grow at all in human-cell based tissue culture and thus would be “lost” in this approach. We have further specified in the text that liver tissue was passed mouse to mouse without isolation or purification. However, we do agree that the viral swarm may be important and cannot claim that our passaging scheme is the only one that would have resulted in similar mouse adaptation. We have not done formal evaluations of the quasi-species when virus is grown in mouse liver tissue versus tissue culture. In addition, Table 1 does list the prevalence of identified mutations at passage 4, 9 and 11. By passage 4 all mutations except synonymous M A1502G are present at &gt;80% of reads. M A1502G increased in frequency during passages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results first paragraph: can the authors include the onset of disease for each passage in the supplementary information?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included when we collected the sample in updated Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and the weight loss of each passage. Weight loss in these mice correlates with onset of other signs of disease. For this data it is important to consider that we did not weigh the piece of liver collected nor titer the amount of CCHFV in the homogenized sample and therefore inoculating virus dose at each passage is not uniform. It is also limited in that only one mouse was inoculated with each tissue sample at each passage. Thus, we caution drawing conclusions on the virulence of any particular passage based on this data alone. Importantly, we omitted to specify that following the first passage of CCHFV, CCHFV in the blood of the passage 1 mouse was transferred to the naïve passage 2 mouse. Thereafter liver tissue was used for all passages. We have updated the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Was there a reason than an intermediate dose (1,000 TCID50s) of MA-CCHFV was used when infecting multiple mouse strains rather than the 10,000 TCID50s used elsewhere?</p></disp-quote><p>While no inverse correlation between disease severity and virus dose was observed in B6 mice, we still had some concern that this may not hold true for other mouse strains. For example, with MA-EBOV an inverse correlation was seen in B6 but not BALBc mice (Haddock et al., 2018). To minimize the number of mice used, rather than perform dose finding in multiple mouse trains we picked 1000 TCID50 as it was a middle ground between doses we knew to reliably cause disease in B6 mice. For further model development in any of these strains it may be important to perform similar dose finding studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While MA-CCHFV was shown to be lethal in the 3wk old mice, do we have comparative data for for wt Hoti?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not performed similar studies with CCHFV strain Hoti. We expect that infection of young WT mice with parental Hoti would not result in lethal disease as these younger mice still possess an intact, if not fully developed, type I IFN response. However, it is possible that young WT mice may show greater disease or viral replication with parental Hoti compared to adult mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors state that the clinical presentation was milder in females. I might have overlooked this in the manuscript, but is there a statistical side-by-side comparison of males vs. females in their different clinical parameters (weight loss, disease severity/scoring)? Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statistical comparison is important and have included it in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Male mice had significantly greater weight loss than female mice on days 5, 6, 7 and 8 PI in this study. Similar findings were found in Figure 6 and 7 although since the major conclusions of those figures are comparison between WT and KO strains, we have not included the male and female WT statistical comparison in those figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state &quot;NSm is dispensable for virus replication (Gerrard et al., 2007)&quot;.
