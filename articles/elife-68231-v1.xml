neurological disease risk. However, the majority of human evolutionary history occurred in environments with higher pathogenic diversity and low cardiovascular risk. We hypothesize that in high-pathogen and energy-limited contexts, the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele confers benefits by reducing innate inflammation when uninfected, while maintaining higher lipid levels that buffer costs of immune activation during infection. Among Tsimane forager-farmers of Bolivia (<italic>N</italic> = 1266, 50% female), <italic>APOE4</italic> is associated with 30% lower C-reactive protein, and higher total cholesterol and oxidized LDL. Blood lipids were either not associated, or negatively associated with inflammatory biomarkers, except for associations of oxidized LDL and inflammation which were limited to obese adults. Further, <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers maintain higher levels of total and LDL cholesterol at low body mass indices (BMIs). These results suggest that the relationship between <italic>APOE4</italic> and lipids may be beneficial for pathogen-driven immune responses and unlikely to increase cardiovascular risk in an active subsistence population.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes contain the instructions needed for a cell to make molecules called proteins, which perform various roles in the body. Different variants of a gene can affect how the protein works, and in some cases, can increase a person’s risk to develop certain diseases.</p><p>For example, people who carry a version of the apolipoprotein E gene called APOE4 have a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease or heart disease. Individuals with two copies of this genetic variant have a 45% higher risk of heart disease and 12 times higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease. Studies in industrialized countries suggest this increased risk may be the result of higher cholesterol and inflammation in people with APOE4. But if APOE4 is harmful, why does it continue to be so common worldwide?</p><p>One potential explanation is that APOE4, which has been around since before modern humans, may be beneficial in some contexts. Cholesterol is essential for many vital tasks in the body. In physically demanding environments where parasitic infections are common – conditions similar to those experienced by early humans – APOE4 might be beneficial. Under those circumstances, having more cholesterol might help fuel metabolic activities, fight infections, or reduce inflammation caused by infections.</p><p>Garcia et al. investigated the link between the APOE4 genetic variant, cholesterol and inflammation in 1,266 Indigenous Tsimane people from 80 villages in Bolivia. Tsimane people live an active lifestyle foraging and farming for food. Parasite infections are a common problem in their communities, but obesity rates are very low. Garcia et al. found that Tsimane people with at least one copy of the APOE4 have lower levels of inflammation and higher levels of cholesterol than those who have two copies of the APOE3 version of the gene. Very lean people with APOE4 had especially high levels of the so called “bad” low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol compared to people with APOE3 only. However, in this situation, storing a little extra cholesterol may not be so bad.</p><p>The findings contradict other studies that have linked obesity to higher LDL levels and APOE4 to higher levels of inflammation. For the majority of human history, humans lived in more physically strenuous and calorically restrictive environments, with less access to clean water. Garcia et al. suggest that the harmful effects of APOE4 seen in studies in more industrialized societies – where people tend to be more sedentary and have less exposure to pathogens – may reflect a mismatch between a person’s environment and their genes. More studies that capture the diversity of environmental conditions under which people live will help clarify the role of APOE4 health and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>APOE</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG024119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurven</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>Hillard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56AG024119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gurven</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stieglitz</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The relationship between <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and disease risks may be environmentally moderated, with <italic>APOE4</italic> being less harmful and unlikely to increase cardiometabolic risk in a physically active, energy-limited population.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The apolipoprotein <italic>E4</italic> (<italic>APOE4</italic>) allele is considered a major shared risk factor for both cardiovascular disease (CVD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansson and Libby, 2006</xref>) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belloy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2019</xref>), in part due to its role in lipid metabolism and related inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huebbe and Rimbach, 2017</xref>). <italic>APOE4+</italic> carriers consistently show higher levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and oxidized LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Safieh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yassine and Finch, 2020</xref>).

For instance, a prospective U.S.-based cohort study (Framingham Heart Study) found that individuals with <italic>APOE4</italic> and low-grade chronic obesity-related inflammation had higher risk of developing AD, with earlier onset than <italic>APOE3/3</italic> and <italic>APOE4+</italic> carriers without inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, <italic>APOE4</italic> may protect against cognitive loss among those infected with parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oriá et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trumble et al., 2017</xref>) and accelerate recovery from viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mueller et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that interactive influences of <italic>APOE4,</italic> lipids, and immune function on disease risks may be environmentally moderated. However, this is difficult to test because most biomedical research is conducted in controlled laboratory settings using animal models, or in post-industrial populations with low-pathogen burden and high obesity prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gurven and Lieberman, 2020</xref>). Here, we begin to fill this gap by evaluating both immune and lipid profiles of individuals with <italic>APOE3/3</italic> and <italic>APOE4+</italic> genotypes living in a pathogenically diverse, energy-limited environment.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title><italic>APOE</italic>, cholesterols, and immune function</title><p><italic>APOE</italic> has three functionally polymorphic allelic variants: <italic>E4</italic>, <italic>E3</italic>, and <italic>E2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demarchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Safieh et al., 2019</xref>). The most prevalent, <italic>APOE3</italic>, arose ~200K years ago from a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) (C → T) at locus 19q13 from the ancestral <italic>APOE4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fullerton et al., 2000</xref>). The evolutionary success of <italic>APOE3</italic> has been attributed to its greater plasticity in response to environmental changes compared to the ancestral <italic>APOE4</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huebbe and Rimbach, 2017</xref>). However, <italic>APOE4</italic> is maintained at frequencies up to 40%, such as those in some central African populations.</p><p>Maintenance and distribution of <italic>APOE</italic> variants may in part be due to the distinct functional capabilities of allelic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trotter et al., 2010</xref>). Eisenberg and colleagues have suggested that the benefits of <italic>APOE4</italic> may be most appreciable in environments where cholesterol requirements are increased to meet higher metabolic demands, such as at high and low latitudes where there are climatic extremes (e.g. northern Europe and South America) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisenberg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another leading explanation for <italic>APOE4</italic> persistence is based on the theory of antagonistic pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Williams, 1957</xref>), which posits that the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele may persist due to the fitness benefits of lipid buffering in early life relative to <italic>APOE3</italic>, outweighing any harmful health effects that manifest in a post-reproductive life stage (i.e. ‘selection’s shadow’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with the notion of early life fitness advantage, the <italic>APOE4</italic> variant is associated with lower infant mortality and higher fertility among rural Ghanaians experiencing high-pathogen burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Exel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Innate immune responses with fever and systemic inflammation are also energetically expensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Muehlenbein et al., 2010</xref>), and cholesterol and other lipids are necessary for fueling these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2014</xref>). Helminths and some protozoal parasites also require lipids to fuel their own metabolic activities, either pulling them from the host bloodstream, or modulating host metabolic activities like LDL endocytosis or lipid remodeling to gain access to lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bansal et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, in high-pathogen and energy-limited environments, where there may be persistent pathogen-driven immune activation, the ability to maintain peripheral cholesterol levels would presumably be a benefit throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finch and Martin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurven et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Despite <italic>APOE4</italic> being associated with neuroinflammation among those with AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kloske and Wilcock, 2020</xref>), in ‘healthy’ individuals the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele is associated with downregulated innate immunity. Specifically, blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in <italic>APOE4+</italic> carriers are lower in several post-industrial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumsden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martiskainen et al., 2018</xref>), as well as the Tsimane, an Amerindian population in rural Bolivia (and focus of the present study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasunilashorn et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, among the Tsimane, <italic>APOE4+</italic> carriers had lower levels of blood eosinophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trumble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasunilashorn et al., 2011</xref>).

Maintaining lower levels of baseline innate immunity may minimize the accumulative damage caused by low-grade innate inflammation over the long term, while still enabling strong targeted immune responses to pathogens following exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franceschi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trumble and Finch, 2019</xref>), particularly in environments with a diversity of species of pathogens. Further, pathogens like helminthic parasites, may moderate inflammation by triggering Th2-mediated (anti-inflammatory) immunological pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maizels and McSorley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Motran et al., 2018</xref>), which may be important for counterbalancing a strong proinflammatory response.</p><p>In energy-limited, pathogenically diverse environments, <italic>APOE4+</italic> carriers may thus be better able to tolerate energetic costs imposed by infection by having higher concentrations of circulating lipids to fuel immune responses, while also minimizing damage from exposure to generalized systemic inflammation through downregulation of innate immune function. By contrast, in post-industrialized contexts, without the moderating influences of parasites on both cholesterol and immune functions, non-pathogenic stimuli (e.g. obesity) may be more likely to trigger systemic low-grade inflammatory pathways and, in the absence of a brake, lead to arterial and vascular damage and disease. Thus, the link between <italic>APOE4</italic> and inflammatory diseases in post-industrialized contexts may in part be due to an environmental mismatch.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Hypothesis and aims</title><p>In pathogenically diverse environments, innate immune defenses are likely to be activated owing to more frequent encounters with novel pathogens. This more diverse pathogenic setting may increase selective pressure to favor stronger immune regulation. We hypothesize that in such a context, an <italic>APOE4</italic> variant is less harmful because it (a) minimizes damage caused by chronic innate inflammation and (b) maintains higher circulating cholesterol levels, which buffer energetic costs of pathogen-driven innate immune activation. In post-industrial contexts, where there is a relative absence of diverse pathogens and thus reduced pathogen-mediated lipid regulation, coupled with an overabundance of calories, the effect of <italic>APOE4</italic> on circulating lipids may instead incur a cost. Lifestyle factors that promote obesity and excessive circulating lipids may lead to sterile endogenous inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trumble and Finch, 2019</xref>) that overshadows any potentially positive effects of <italic>APOE4</italic> on immune function. Thus, the <italic>APOE4</italic> variant has greater potential to lead to hyperlipidemia and coincide with related inflammatory diseases in high-calorie, low-pathogen, environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypothetical pathways through which the apolipoprotein <italic>E4</italic> (<italic>APOE4</italic>) allele influences lipid processing, immune regulation and disease risk in post-industrialized and non-industrialized contexts.</title><p>In both contexts, the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele leads to increased levels of circulating lipids; however, in post-industrialized contexts (<bold>a</bold>), lipid levels can reach dangerously high levels due to obesogenic diets, and an absence of moderation by parasites and pathogen-driven immune activation. Immune activation by non-pathogenic elements triggers damage-associated molecular pattern pathways, which generates a proinflammatory ‘sterile’ immune response. Obesity and hyperlipidemia can simultaneously fuel sterile inflammation and promote oxidization of cholesterols, which, due to their lack of function, cause further tissue damage associated with cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease risk. In energetically limited, pathogenically diverse contexts (<bold>b</bold>), the pathway between <italic>APOE4</italic> and disease risk is considerably more complex. Briefly, immune responses to parasites and microbes require cholesterol, and there are both direct and indirect effects of different species of parasites which further regulate cholesterol production and utilization. In addition, anti-inflammatory immune responses are generated by ox-LDL (e.g. in response to bacteria and protozoal infections), and helminthic parasites, which balance the immune system’s overall response. It is possible that in contexts where there is higher pathogen diversity, an <italic>APOE4</italic> phenotype may be less harmful because it minimizes the damage caused by upregulated innate immune function, while also maintaining higher cholesterol levels which would buffer the cost of innate immune activation due to infection. Whereas in high-calorie, low-pathogen environments, the utility of having an <italic>APOE4</italic> allele may be muted, and the costs more severe.

Tsimane have high rates of infection across all ages, with 70% helminth prevalence and &gt;50% of adults with co-infections from multiple species of parasite or protozoan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garcia et al., 2020</xref>). Compared to U.S. and European reference populations, the Tsimane have also been found to have upregulated immune function across the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackwell et al., 2016</xref>). In most villages, there is little or no access to running water or infrastructure for sanitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dinkel et al., 2020</xref>). The Tsimane are primarily reliant on foods acquired through slash-and-burn horticulture, fishing, hunting, gathering, and small animal domestication, supplemented with market goods (e.g. salt, sugar, cooking oil) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>). Tsimane are rarely sedentary, instead engaging in sustained low and moderate physical activity over much of their life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gurven et al., 2013</xref>), and have minimal atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>). However, with greater globalization and improvements in technology, the Tsimane are experiencing ongoing lifestyle changes; there is variation in participation in the market economy, and related variation in diet (e.g. access and uptake of processed foods) and activity level. Despite increasing access to markets and towns, infections remain the largest source of morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gurven et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Data include <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and multiple measurements of BMI, lipids, and immune markers in 1266 Tsimane adults.

In support of this hypothesis, we find that Tsimane with an <italic>APOE4</italic> allele have higher levels of lipids, yet lower levels of CRP and eosinophils, compared to individuals that have a homozygous <italic>APOE3</italic> genotype. Overall, <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers also have an adaptive-biased immune profile (as measured by a lower ratio of eosinophils to lymphocytes). These associations remain when controlling for factors known to contribute to differences in inflammation including age, sex, seasonality, and current infection. The most striking example of immunological differences is for CRP, an acute phase protein that functions as part of the complement system and is a marker of generalized inflammation. Though CRP is higher in the Tsimane relative to U.S. and European populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackwell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurven et al., 2008</xref>), we find that CRP levels are 30% lower among <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers than individuals that are homozygous <italic>APOE3/3</italic>. This replicates a similar finding of lower CRP among Tsimane <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers from samples collected over a decade prior to the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasunilashorn et al., 2011</xref>). A study of ‘healthy’ (nondiabetic) Finnish men also found that <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers had higher LDL cholesterol coupled with lower CRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martiskainen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Further, in support of our hypothesis that lifestyle and ecological (e.g. pathogen exposure) factors affect how lipids influence inflammation, we find that BMI significantly moderates relationships between lipids and markers of innate inflammation. Our results are consistent with expectations for a high infection context: Tsimane with high BMI (~1 SD above the mean) show no relationship between total cholesterol or LDL with CRP and ESR, but those with mean or low BMI have <italic>higher</italic> lipid levels that are associated with <italic>lower</italic> CRP and ESR. In contemporary post-industrialized contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), these findings may seem counterintuitive. But in a high-pathogen context, higher concentrations of circulating lipids may allow individuals, especially those that are energy-compromised, to better tolerate infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gurven et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the negative association between cholesterol and inflammatory markers could indicate lower infectious burden. For the Tsimane, higher cholesterol levels are likely an indicator of robust health (e.g. not fighting an infection) rather than chronic disease. Independently, lipids are either neutral or negatively associated with immune markers in this sample. This is consistent with previous research among the Tsimane that found blood lipids varied inversely with IgE, eosinophils, and other markers of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vasunilashorn et al., 2010</xref>). Overall, the Tsimane maintain low levels of cholesterol relative to U.S. and European standards – less than 5% of sample had a total cholesterol higher than 200 mg/dL. The lack of hyperlipidemic cholesterol levels likely also explains in part why cholesterol does not associate with higher inflammation in this population.</p><p>Notably, the moderation effect of BMI indicates that the relationship between ox-LDL and CRP are inverted at the low and high ends of the BMI range. For individuals with low BMI, higher ox-LDL levels are associated with lower CRP, while for those with high BMI, higher ox-LDL is associated with higher CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). One possible explanation for the opposing relationships we find between ox-LDL and CRP is that there may be differences in the underlying causes of oxidization in these groups. Though ox-LDL is often considered a consequence of obesogenic or hyperlipidemic oxidization of LDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neuparth et al., 2013</xref>), ox-LDL is also produced in response to pathogen-mediated immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han, 2009</xref>), and its relationship with downstream immune functions largely depends on the cause of oxidation. For example, while nonpathogenic oxidization of LDL promotes inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neuparth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2014</xref>), during protozoal or bacterial infections, ox-LDL contributes to lower inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han, 2009</xref>). Thus, those with high BMI may represent the transition to sterile inflammation as lifestyles change with greater participation in a market economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trumble and Finch, 2019</xref>). Indeed, other studies have documented what may be the start of a nutritional transition among the Tsimane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kraft et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masterson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosinger et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our finding that innate immune biomarkers are lower among <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers is in line with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lumsden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martiskainen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trumble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasunilashorn et al., 2011</xref>), however the causes are uncertain. One proximate explanation involves the mevalonate pathway, which plays a key role in multiple cellular processes, including modulating sterol and cholesterol biosynthesis and innate immune function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buhaescu and Izzedine, 2007</xref>). One ultimate explanation that we consider relates to the utility of downregulated baseline inflammation in contexts where there is likely chronic exposure to a wide diversity of novel pathogens. In such a context, the costs of inflammation would be amplified, and elements that are involved in regulating innate inflammation may be under stronger selective pressure. This would be plausible so long as downregulating immune function does not compromise one’s ‘ability to respond’ to immunological threats, as has previously been argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Man et al., 2016</xref>). Regarding the main finding for CRP, it is also possible that this is because <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers experience a lower innate immune sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dose et al., 2018</xref>) or have faster clearance following the resolution of an acute spike. While there is currently no direct evidence for the latter, some studies have found that higher circulating lipids were associated with more rapid clearance of active infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pérez-Guzmán et al., 2005</xref>). The current study design did not allow analysis of these potential pathways.</p><p>Though numerous other studies have established links between the <italic>APOE4</italic> polymorphism and neighboring genes (the <italic>APOE</italic> gene cluster) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kulminski et al., 2019</xref>), and increased circulating lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yassine and Finch, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Chaves and Narayanaswami, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Safieh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saito et al., 2004</xref>), to our knowledge, this study is the first to assess whether <italic>APOE</italic> moderates lipid levels under energetic constraints. Specifically, our results show that the <italic>APOE4</italic>+ genotype is marginally associated with higher relative lipids in a low-energy, pathogenically diverse system. In one study conducted in an obesogenic environment (mean BMI 28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), BMI was independently associated with higher total cholesterol, but this relationship did not differ by <italic>APOE</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petkeviciene et al., 2012</xref>). While it is difficult to pinpoint the cause for discrepant findings across studies, one possibility is that the Lithuanian study did not capture moderation at low BMI (the mean BMI was 28 for both <italic>E4 APOE4</italic>+ and <italic>APOE3/3</italic> genotypes). Another possibility is that the low-pathogen context of urban Lithuania led to less moderation of cholesterols at high BMIs. As mentioned in Introduction, one proposal for the persistence of the ancestral <italic>E4</italic> allele despite its deleterious health effects at later ages relies on the fitness benefits of lipid buffering in early life relative to the more recent <italic>E3</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Exel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yassine and Finch, 2020</xref>). The ability to maintain adequate lipid reserves under energetic and pathogenic pressures would also provide additional benefits over the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finch and Kulminski, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Finally, nearly one-fourth of individuals in the sample had at least one copy of <italic>APOE4</italic>. The allelic frequency of <italic>APOE4</italic> reported here is similar to what has been previously documented among other South American and Amerindian populations, which ranges from 5% to 30% and varies widely by region and level of genetic admixture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corbo and Scacchi, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gayà-Vidal et al., 2012</xref>). The distribution of <italic>APOE</italic> allelic variants in populations around the world is likely due to a mosaic of factors, from genetic drift, to antagonistic pleiotropy, to potential differences related to environmentally dependent costs and benefits of functionally distinct variants. Certainly some degree of genetic drift or founder effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gayà-Vidal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2006</xref>), antagonistic pleiotropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Exel et al., 2017</xref>) and other forces (e.g. genetic relatedness) play an important role in determining population and global frequencies and should be considered jointly to make inferences about the frequency of <italic>E4</italic> in the Tsimane population. While pathogen risk and energetic limitations is one context where the typical costs of <italic>E4</italic> may not be expressed, the high frequency of <italic>E4</italic> allele in populations that are appreciably different in terms of latitude, ecology, and population history (e.g. northern European and central African populations) confirms that more is involved in understanding population differences in <italic>E4</italic> frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abondio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eisenberg et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The commonly reported associations between <italic>APOE4</italic> and disease risk in post-industrialized societies may differ from subsistence populations due to environmental mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trotter et al., 2010</xref>). In an environment where calories are limited, and one’s innate immune system is already primed by multiple pathogens, the benefit of having an <italic>APOE4</italic> allele – which facilitates upregulated lipids (sufficient for mounting immune responses) and downregulates innate immune function – may be amplified. Such a phenotype could be beneficial particularly if downregulated immune function did not compromise responses to immunological threats. Further, in such an environment, this phenotype may be energetically conservative, maintaining resources to fuel other systems, such as cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trumble and Finch, 2019</xref>). Indeed, there is some evidence that <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers may be better able to buffer the negative effects of infection. An <italic>APOE4</italic> polymorphism in Brazilian children with a history of infection (measured by bouts of diarrhea in infancy) predicted better scores on cognitive exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oria et al., 2011</xref>). Among Tsimane infected with parasites, only <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers performed better on cognitive tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trumble et al., 2017</xref>). However, in hygienic post-industrialized contexts, the risk of helminthic and protozoal infection is low, and most pathogens can be quickly treated with medication. Thus, the potential benefits of the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele are muted, and the costs of higher lipids are much more severe in these obesogenic environments.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>Though our findings draw from a large sample size and are robust to various controls and model specifications, there are several limitations. First, our findings are correlative and limit causal inference. Because these findings may be important for furthering evolutionary (i.e. why the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele may be maintained) and clinical (i.e. the role of <italic>APOE</italic> in disease pathogenesis) understanding, they require replication and warrant experimental testing. The central thesis presented here – that persistent exposure to pathogens and obesogenic diets moderate the relationship between blood lipids and inflammation – is amenable to experimental manipulation under lab conditions. Specifically, a mammalian model system could be split into two treatments: those raised under sterile conditions versus regimented exposure to non-lethal pathogens. These treatments may then be crossed with dietary or physical activity conditions that produce differential levels of adiposity. Our hypothesis predicts that both decreased adiposity and increased life course pathogen exposure will reduce or even eliminate positive associations between blood lipids and chronic inflammation. Importantly, inflammatory biomarkers can be measured at more frequent intervals in lab conditions to assess long-term differences in the function of both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways between experimental treatments.</p><p>Second, there is some evidence that the <italic>APOE4</italic> allele is positively associated with HDL cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hopkins et al., 2002</xref>), and that higher HDL levels reduce risk of severe infection (measured by infectious hospitalizations) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Trinder et al., 2020</xref>). Inversely, acute infections and systemic inflammation (e.g. acute phase reaction) are associated with a decrease in HDL and HDL remodeling that results in lower cholesterol efflux capacity and higher peripheral levels of LDL cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ronsein and Vaisar, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zimetti et al., 2017</xref>). While we did not find differences in HDL by <italic>APOE</italic> status among the Tsimane, we cannot completely discount the possibility that HDL remodeling plays a role in the higher lipid levels, in addition to <italic>APOE</italic> allelic variation. Further, given the relative lack of, and difficulty in accessing, medical care facilities, it is difficult to assess degrees of infection severity, and thus it is also possible that <italic>APOE4</italic> may mitigate infectious disease burden. However, the current data cannot provide evidence for either of these potentials, and further research is needed to disentangle the roles of <italic>APOE</italic> and lipids in infection.</p><p>Third, proxies for energy availability and pathogen exposures are imperfect. BMI and fat free mass may have a variable relationship across the degree of market integration. However, given that our main goal in the paper – with regard to energy availability – is to investigate <italic>APOE</italic> and lipids at the extreme tails of BMI (lean versus obese), BMI should adequately capture broad differences in energetic availability between these two groups. Because patterns of immune response vary depending on pathogen type and species, the use of a high white blood cell count cutoff as a proxy for current infection overly simplifies immune variation due to different types of infection. To this end, we also adjust for seasonality and cluster by community residence in our models, which should capture additional variation in exposures.</p><p>Finally, we were not able to fully adjust for the time of day that samples were collected for the biomarkers used in this paper. Given that peripheral levels of most immune biomarkers vary diurnally to some extent, it is possible that not adjusting for exact time of day may have introduced some noise into analyses. However, CRP (which the main findings centered around) does not appear to follow a circadian rhythm in healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meier-Ewert et al., 2001</xref>). Further, the largest differences in levels (peak to trough amplitudes) tend to coincide with sleep and wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labrecque and Cermakian, 2015</xref>). Because blood draws routinely occur in the morning, samples are constrained to a narrow window, and thus we are not comparing values across the full range of diurnal variation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In post-industrial settings, <italic>APOE4</italic> is generally considered a purely deleterious allele, increasing inflammation and lipids, and escalating CVD and neurological disease risk.

While <italic>APOE4</italic> carriers do have higher lipid levels, these may be beneficial for immune response and child survival, and unlikely to increase CVD risk in a population without other cardiometabolic risk factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Population and sampling design</title><p>The Tsimane are an Amerindian population that live in the tropical lowlands of Bolivia. As of 2015, the Tsimane Health and Life History Project (THLHP) census estimated a total population size of about 16,000 individuals living across 90+ villages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurven et al., 2017</xref>). Data come from the THLHP, a longitudinal study of health and behavior that has run continuously since 2002 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurven et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sampling design</title><p>Biomarker data used in this paper were collected by the THLHP between 2004 and 2015 (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraft et al., 2020</xref> for details). A Bolivian and Tsimane mobile medical team travel annually or biannually among study communities conducting clinical health assessments and collecting biochemical and anthropometric information from community members that want to participate. This sample includes all data from individuals for whom we have <italic>APOE</italic> genotyping and measurements of age, sex, and BMI – which is the base criteria for this study. Sample size varies by biomarker and over time for several reasons: sampling strategy varies by data type, absent or sick team personnel needed to collect data, the number of study villages and thus enrolled participants has increased over time, and the data types collected have changed over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraft et al., 2020</xref>). There are also fewer repeat measurements for a subset of biomarkers (i.e. CRP and ox-LDL) that were assayed in the United States, due to them being analyzed as part of a prior project. Specific sample sizes are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, and full tables report sample size for each model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>APOE genotyping</title><p>Whole blood samples were stored in cryovials (Nalgene, Rochester, NY) and frozen in liquid nitrogen before transfer on dry ice to the University of California-Santa Barbara, where they were stored at –80°C until genotyping. SNP genotyping was used to identify <italic>APOE</italic> allelic variants in blood samples. Samples were shipped on dry ice to University of Southern California (2010 and 2013) and University of Texas-Houston (2016), where DNA was extracted, quantified, and haplotype-coded for <italic>APO- E2</italic>, <italic>E3</italic>, and <italic>E4</italic> alleles using the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA). Determination of the <italic>APOE2/E3/E4</italic> alleles in the Tsimane derived from two SNPs of 20–30 bp oligonucleotides surrounding the polymorphic site (Cys112Arg/rs429358 and Cys158Arg/rs7412) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trumble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasunilashorn et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Measurement of blood lipids and immune function</title><p>Biomarkers were assayed either in the field at the time of collection or in the Human Biodemography laboratory at UC Santa Barbara in 2016.</p><p>Blood was collected by venipuncture in a heparin-coated vacutainer. Immediately following the blood draw, total leukocyte counts and hemoglobin were determined with a QBC Autoread Plus dry hematology system (QBC Diagnostics), with a QBC calibration check performed daily to verify QBC performance. Relative fractions of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes were determined manually by microscopy with a hemocytometer by a certified Bolivian biochemist. ESR was calculated following the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Westergren, 1957</xref>, method.</p><p>Serum was separated and frozen in liquid nitrogen before transfer to the University of California-Santa Barbara where a commercial immunoassay was used to measure ox-LDL (Mercodia Cat# 10-1143-01, Winston Salem, NC). Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assessed via immunoassay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brindle et al., 2010</xref>) and was cross-validated by the University of Washington laboratory, using the protocols utilized for the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey (NHANES) (Meridian Life Sciences Cat# M86005M, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_150654">AB_150654</ext-link>). Ox-LDL and hs-CRP assays use materials from the same lot across all measures. Total and LDL cholesterol levels from serum samples were measured (Stat Fax 1908, Awareness Technology, Palm City, FL) in the THLHP laboratory in San Borja, Beni, Bolivia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Age estimation and anthropometrics</title><p>Birth years were assigned based on a combination of methods including using known ages from written records, relative age lists, dated events, photo comparisons of people with known ages, and cross-validation of information from independent interviews of kin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gurven et al., 2007</xref>). Each method provides an independent estimate of age, and when estimates yielded a date of birth within a 3-year range, the average was used. Individuals for whom reliable ages could not be ascertained are not included in analyses.</p><p>Weight and height were measured in the field by a member of the THLHP medical team, using a basic digital scale (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL) and stadiometer to the nearest 0.1 cm.

Because Tsimane villages vary in sanitation infrastructure, including access to soap and other hygienic products, and potentially prevalence by pathogen type (e.g. some living very close to the river versus farther out in the forest), individuals were clustered by community to account for variation in such community-level factors. Household-level variation (e.g. cohabitating individuals may have similar exposures) was also tested by including a random household ID as a random variable. However, because inclusion of household ID as a random effect did not alter parameter estimates or p-values, and fit (measured by AIC) was not substantially improved across any model, it was omitted from final analyses. To model moderation effects (sections Does BMI moderate the association between lipids and inflammation? and Does <italic>APOE</italic> genotype moderate the association between BMI and lipids?) interaction terms are included between the main predictor and moderator.</p><p>Immune and lipid measures required transformation to normalize their skewed distributions. Variables were transformed as follows: CRP, BMI, and triglycerides were natural log-transformed; total leukocytes and subsets (lymphocytes neutrophils, eosinophils), ESR, and remaining cholesterols (total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, ox-LDL) were square root-transformed. To compare across models, all dependent variables were then z-scored for analyses, and thus all betas are standardized estimates.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Software, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Project administration, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Project administration, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Project administration, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Investigation, Writing – review and editing, Funding acquisition, Resources, Supervision</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This research has been approved by institutional review boards at the University of New Mexico (#07-157) and University of California Santa Barbara (#3-20-0740), as well as the Tsimane government (Tsimane Gran Consejo) and village leaders.

A long history of abuse and mistrust between researchers and indigenous populations behooves us to prioritize the wishes of Tsimane. Given current ethical restrictions on sharing Tsimane genetic data, we cannot upload Tsimane genetic data to a public server at this time. Individuals interested in accessing the APOE genetic data should submit a request to the co-senior authors. Access will be granted for health focused research, subject to approval by THLHP co-Directors and Tsimane Gran Consejo (Tsimane governing body). All other de-identified data and code are openly accessible on Dryad through the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/share/FqfEp93SdnqklFbfbjBbenHsZh_10gulo8cf_9LMR3o">https://datadryad.org/stash/share/FqfEp93SdnqklFbfbjBbenHsZh_10gulo8cf_9LMR3o</ext-link> While we are strong advocates of open science and believe that inclusion of diverse populations in genomics is critical for advancing the goals of public health and health equality, we also need to ensure that all research participants are protected. Our research team is working toward a long-term solution for data-sharing and a streamlined process for requests. This includes the creation of a locally-based ethics and review board comprised of representatives from Tsimane communities and leadership, research collaborators at the Universidad de San Simon (Cochabamba), and THLHP co-directors. The goal of this board is to ensure genomic (and all) data collected are shared according to both global and culturally-specific ethical standards, and considerations about confidentiality.</p><p>The

They consider the hypothesis that APOE4 may be advantageous in a high pathogen and high physical environment settings (as opposed to a low pathogen industrial lifestyle) through an in-depth characterization of the Tsimane in Bolivia. The study is of broad interest with an insightful dataset; the scope of the project is clear, emphasizing the set of conclusions with appropriate support.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;APOE4 is associated with elevated blood lipids and lower levels of innate immune biomarkers in a tropical Amerindian subsistence population&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It is well organized and interesting for a number of reasons. That said, I have several suggestions (no specific order below) that, I hope, will improve the final version of the paper.</p><p>– I believe that environmentally &quot;moderated&quot; rather than &quot;mediated&quot; should be used on Line 104. Please consider.</p><p>– The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis is well described and interesting. In my opinion, this should be more directly addressed in the Discussion. I am left wondering what more we know about population variation in APOE4 frequency (does it map onto variation in pathogenicity?) and why frequency is almost 4x higher in Central Africa than Tsimane. Drivers of frequency variation among subsistence populations (not just between subsistence and post-industrial) would be helpful to discuss.</p><p>– The choice of using &quot;pathogen-diverse&quot; instead of &quot;high-pathogen&quot; environments or similar throughout the paper should be explained. It is not clear to me what about diversity itself is thought to be important for this analysis.</p><p>– The sample sizes should be better clarified. In the Results text, it sounds like there are &gt;6500 measures for each immune marker. There are, in fact, &lt;1000 for CRP. Given the large variation in sample sizes for each measure and the fact that CRP and oxidized LDL are &lt;1000 each, I suggest the authors find a way to include sample sizes in the main text, not just the SI. We are also told that all individuals included had at least 1 BMI and age measurement, but that is not my reading of Supp Table 1. It would be good to clarify. Please also include information about when the data were collected.</p><p>– I have several concerns and recommendations for the data treatment and analysis. Chiefly, I am concerned about the CRP data. The CRP values themselves that are reported (sample-wide mean listed as approx. 3.5 mg/dL) are not believable. This is likely an error in units reporting as the authors' 2016 paper lists mean Tsimane CRP around 1.5 mg/L ( = 0.15 mg/dL). It is hard to believe these values average 20+ times greater. Even if the actual mean CRP is 3.5 mg/L, this is still much higher than previously reported and requires explanation. The most likely explanation is that acute inflammatory events are likely often being captured as the sample has only &lt;1.5x coverage of CRP measures. The work of McDade (2012) and others has shown that Amazonian subsistence populations have no evidence for chronic/persistent inflammation when measured repeatedly over short intervals. Such findings suggest that inflammation in pathogen-rich environments is not persistent but rather recurrent. This manuscript's argument is based on the CRP data reflecting &quot;baseline&quot; levels. I don't believe that this is the case. The inclusion of all CRP data in the analysis (even high values clearly indicative of active acute phase response) is problematic and makes the analysis of mean CRP levels very difficult to interpret. Are, for example, lower CRP values in APOE4E reflective of lower baseline levels, faster clearance following the resolution of acute CRP spike, or lower absolute magnitude of CRP spike? More information is needed on the WBC cut-off value used to determine current infection status. In general, given the nature of these data and their treatment, I am not convinced that reliable &quot;baseline&quot; measures of CRP are being used in the analysis.</p><p>– Some discussion of the limitations of using BMI as a proxy of energy availability is needed. This is a key measure in this analysis, but presumably BMI and fat mass have a variable relationship across the degree of market integration captured in this sample. Likewise, community as a proxy of pathogen exposure should be better justified. Were some participants from the same households? Is it helpful to also cluster by household in the analysis?</p><p>– Note that Figure 2, 4, etc. have no units listed for the y-axes.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;APOE4 is associated with elevated blood lipids and lower levels of innate immune biomarkers in a tropical Amerindian subsistence population&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The first was whether there was any evidence of selection for the APOE4 allele in the Tsimane population. The authors have reframed their approach to be less reliant on an argument for selection and more within an ecological context and how it relates to a metabolic mediated immune activation. APOE4 fits within that framework with respect to cholesterol and immunity and how it extends largely to a pathogen-driven environment. Furthermore, Dr. Garcia et al., have added a discussion on pages 10 (428-445), that seeks to describe contextually the broad mechanisms that could be responsible for the allele frequencies observed.</p><p>Another concern related to reporting the specifics from their statistical analyses as well as general concerns as to how the study was organized. To address this major concern, the authors have shifted some details earlier in the text, such as to how the genotypes were binned on page 7. This alleviated questions I had throughout reading the paper in the first submission. Furthermore, they have added more details about their statistical models and results into the text of the paper so that their discussion is much clearer.Their table now includes the number of observations used in the analyses. Lastly, they clarified the regression model and stated that they used FDR p-value adjustments to correct for multiple testing.</p><p>My only remaining question about their statistical analyses is whether they tested for any interactions between the variables in their regression models.</p><p>Overall, Dr. Garcia et al.,'s resubmission adequately answers my previous review concerns and I would recommend to acceptance to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68231.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please provide more evolutionary biology context.

We can understand why a reader may wonder if the frequency of APOE4 should be different in a population like the Tsimane where we lay out some conditions where the E4 allele may not have harmful effects on health. With regards to this point –raised also by Reviewer 1– it illuminates the fact that our paper would benefit from some clarification regarding the goals of the paper, and our position on APOE allele frequencies in the Tsimane population. Our goals are primarily focused on (1) questioning the assumptions that APOE4 is a universally deleterious allele, rather than its effects on phenotype being environmentally moderated, and (2) assessing the relationships between APOE, lipids, and innate inflammation in a population living in a relatively unique (and underrepresented) environmental context. It was not our intent to make a purely adaptationist argument for E4, or to suggest that there are no costs to E4 in other aspects of life, or at different ages, but rather to suggest that the relative costs and benefits of E4 may be environmentally-dependent, such that having an E4 allele is more neutral, and/or may provide some benefits (and limited costs), in pathogenically-diverse and energy-limited environments. Certainly some degree of genetic drift, antagonistic pleiotropy and other forces should be considered jointly to make inferences about the frequency of E4 in the Tsimane population. While pathogen risk and energetic limitations is one context where the typical costs of E4 may not be expressed, the high frequency of E4 allele in northern European populations confirms that more is involved in understanding population differences in E4 frequency. Nonetheless, the context we describe and show evidence for in our paper contrasts with the contemporary obesogenic environment with low pathogen diversity more typical of the Global North, where benefits like lipid buffering are no longer needed- and may in fact incur costs.</p><p>We have clarified and reframed the introduction to better couch the paper from an evolutionary biology perspective, and now discuss global variation in APOE allele frequencies, in ecological context, as well as clarifying our position on APOE in relation to adaptation. We include some excerpts below.</p><p>Examples of alterations to the Introduction:</p><p>&quot;The evolutionary success of APOE3 has been attributed to its greater plasticity in response to environmental changes compared to the ancestral APOE4 allele (Huebbe and Rimbach, 2017). However, APOE4 is maintained in many human populations at nontrivial frequencies (as high as 40% in Central Africa) (Huebbe and Rimbach, 2017).</p><p>Maintenance and distribution of APOE variants may be in part due to the distinct functional capabilities of allelic variants (Trotter et al., 2011). Eisenberg and colleagues have suggested that the benefits of APOE4 may be most appreciable in environments where cholesterol requirements are increased to meet higher metabolic demands, such as at high- and low- latitudes where there are climatic extremes (e.g. northern Europe and South America) (Eisenberg et al., 2010).&quot;</p><p>Paragraph added to the Discussion:</p><p>&quot;Finally, nearly 1/4 of individuals in the sample had at least one copy of APOE4. The allelic frequency of APOE4 reported here is similar to what has been previously documented among other South American and Amerindian populations, which ranges from 5 – 30% and varies widely by region and level of genetic admixture (Corbo and Scacchp, 1999; Gayà-Vidal et al., 2012; Velez-Pardo et al., 2015). The distribution of APOE allelic variants in populations around the world is likely due to a mosaic of factors, potentially including differences related to environmentally-dependent costs and benefits of functionally-distinct variants. Certainly some degree of genetic drift or founder effects (Gayà-Vidal et al., 2012; Singh et al., 2006), antagonistic pleiotropy (Smith et al., 2019; Van Exel et al., 2017) and other forces (e.g. genetic relatedness) play an important role in determining population and global frequencies and should be considered jointly to make inferences about the frequency of E4 in the Tsimane population. While pathogen risk and energetic limitations is one context where the typical costs of E4 may not be expressed, the high frequency of E4 allele in populations that are appreciably different in terms of latitude, ecology, and population history (e.g. northern European and central African populations), confirm that more is involved in understanding population differences in E4 frequency (Abondio et al., 2019).&quot;</p><p>Modifications to 1.2 Hypothesis and Aims:</p><p>&quot;We hypothesize that, in pathogenically diverse and energy-limited contexts, an APOE4 variant is less harmful because it (a) minimizes damage caused by chronic innate inflammation, and (b) maintains higher circulating cholesterol levels, which buffer energetic costs of pathogen-driven innate immune activation.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relatedly, the null hypothesis for observed high frequency of the allele should be neutrality/drift until evidence mounts against it. This relates to both the structure/pitch of the study, as well as the statistical tests conducted. The number of statistical tests is high, and it is unclear if a multiple testing correction or other methods to prevent false positives were used. Was the study registered or preplanned tests, etc. Are the effect sizes biologically meaningful for the few tests that are significant?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response to #1 (above) is also relevant to addressing the first point raised here. While we agree that the neutral/drift model should serve as the null hypothesis for allele frequency, it was not our intent to argue that E4 was at a particularly high frequency among the Tsimane, or test for signatures of selection in this paper. While these results could be used as preliminary rationale for those seeking to assess cross-population signatures of selection, we feel that focusing too much on this aspect would distract from the main goals of the paper. Specifically, this paper assesses the relationships between APOE, lipids, and innate inflammation. That being said, we do think it is an important point of discussion to address, and have added a paragraph to the Discussion section that speaks to global and more localized differences in APOE allelic frequencies (see above).</p><p>The high number of statistical tests is due to the broad aims of the paper, which are both descriptive and hypothesis-driven in nature. There are surprisingly few papers (particularly that have larger sample sizes) describing lipid and immune level variation by APOE genotype, and particularly poor coverage and representation of this type of data from non-US or European populations living in diverse ecologies. The inclusion of these descriptive comparisons will hopefully begin to fill a gap in the literature and contribute to understanding the basic science of how APOE interacts with lipids and immune function, as well as evaluating the role(s) of APOE in related diseases.</p><p>Regarding hypothesis-driven aims, we did conduct multiple testing correction for models that were included in testing our hypothesis related to the relationship between innate immune function and lipids under energetic conditions. However, while we do report FDR p-values in the main text, we realized that they were inadvertently left off from the tables. We now clarify what models are included in hypothesis-testing (see excerpt below), and revised tables accordingly, to add FDR p-values. To further improve clarity on this front, apart from Table 1 (which presents sample descriptives and test statistics from models comparing APOE3/3 vs. APOE4), we narrowed the tables and figures of the main text to present findings related to our hypothesis, and have moved the others to the Supplement. To address the final concern, we also now include more discussion on the biological meaningfulness of the tests that were significant:</p><p>In terms of effect sizes, we report on the biological relevance of CRP-differences (i.e. APOE4 carriers have 30% lower CRP compared to APOE33), and now extend this type of reporting to the other models.</p><p>The study was not pre-registered; however, the hypothesis was generated based on synthesizing previously published ideas (Trumble et al., 2017, Finch and Morgan 2007, Yassine and Finch 2020, Finch 2010, Trumble and Finch 2019, Eisenberg et al., 2010, Oria et al., 2005, van Exel et al., 2017). Specific biomarkers included in hypothesis-driven models were chosen either because their relationships with APOE were previously described in publications by co-authors, or based on extensive literature review on APOE and immune function.</p><p>Modification to 1.2 Hypothesis and Aims:</p><p>&quot;This study describes the immunophenotypes and lipid profiles of individuals with APOE3/3 and APOE4+ genotypes living in a pathogenically-diverse, energy-limited environment. For the purpose of hypothesis-testing, we focus on testing genotype-related differences in components of innate immunity-- C-reactive protein (CRP), neutrophils, eosinophils, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) lipids linked to inflammation (total cholesterol, LDL, and oxidized LDL). We evaluate the extent to which body mass index (BMI) moderates the association between lipids and innate inflammation (CRP, neutrophils, ESR). Finally, we test whether the APOE4 allele has a moderating effect on the relationship between BMI and blood lipids to evaluate the role of APOE4 in the maintenance of stable lipid levels under energetic restriction.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify the reporting and/or interpretation of CRP values, and clarify other methodological issues throughout, such as specific sample sizes for each analysis and which alleles are considered, and units on figures.

I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It is well organized and interesting for a number of reasons. That said, I have several suggestions (no specific order below) that, I hope, will improve the final version of the paper.</p><p>– I believe that environmentally &quot;moderated&quot; rather than &quot;mediated&quot; should be used on Line 104.

Changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis is well described and interesting. In my opinion, this should be more directly addressed in the Discussion. I am left wondering what more we know about population variation in APOE4 frequency (does it map onto variation in pathogenicity?) and why frequency is almost 4x higher in Central Africa than Tsimane. Drivers of frequency variation among subsistence populations (not just between subsistence and post-industrial) would be helpful to discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that making inferences about APOE4 frequency across populations is interesting and would be a useful extension, it is unfortunately beyond the scope of this manuscript. As we unpack above, the goal of this paper is to assess associations between APOE variants and immune and lipid physiology in a population facing relatively high pathogen stress. Given the important point raised regarding global variation, we do now briefly address these points in the Introduction and Discussion sections (see above in 'Essential Revisions' for excerpts).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The choice of using &quot;pathogen-diverse&quot; instead of &quot;high-pathogen&quot; environments or similar throughout the paper should be explained. It is not clear to me what about diversity itself is thought to be important for this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up. We do feel that the distinction is an important one, and is somewhat central to our hypothesis regarding how the costs and benefits of APOE are calibrated depending on environmental conditions. We have added a sentence to the introduction (section 1.1), and have aimed to better highlight this point throughout the paper. Just as a note, the importance of pathogen diversity in moderating the effects of APOE variants on metabolic and immune responses is from a theoretical standpoint, and at the population-level; we do not test the effects of different pathogens in this study.</p><p>Sentence added to Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Maintaining lower levels of innate immunity may minimize the accumulative damage caused by low grade innate inflammation over the long term, while still enabling strong targeted immune responses to pathogens following exposure (Franceschi et al., 2000; Trumble and Finch, 2019), particularly in environments with a diversity of species of pathogens. For example, pathogens like helminthic parasites, help regulate and contain inflammation by triggering Th2-mediated (anti-inflammatory) immunological pathways (Maizels and McSorley, 2016; Motran et al., 2018), which may be important for counterbalancing a strong proinflammatory response.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The sample sizes should be better clarified. In the Results text, it sounds like there are &gt;6500 measures for each immune marker. There are, in fact, &lt;1000 for CRP. Given the large variation in sample sizes for each measure and the fact that CRP and oxidized LDL are &lt;1000 each, I suggest the authors find a way to include sample sizes in the main text, not just the SI. We are also told that all individuals included had at least 1 BMI and age measurement, but that is not my reading of Supp Table 1. It would be good to clarify. Please also include information about when the data were collected.</p></disp-quote><p>For clarity, we deleted the text at the start of the Results section (re: &gt;6500 measures for each biomarker), and have added description of the data in the Methods sections (see excerpts below). We also opted to remove Supplemental Table 1, as we realized that it doesn't provide aptly describe the data as applied to models. To this end, all tables in the main text also now includes sample sizes, and we report sample sizes explicitly in the main text.</p><p>Text added regarding when data were collected:</p><p>&quot;Biomarker data used in this paper were collected by the THLHP between 2004 – 2015 (see Gurven et al., 2017; Kraft et al., 2020 for details).&quot;</p><p>Sentences added to explain differences in number of measures per individual for certain biomarkers:</p><p>&quot;There are also fewer repeat measurements for a subset of biomarkers (i.e. C-reactive protein and oxidized LDL) that were assayed in the U.S., due to them being analyzed as part of a prior project. Specific sample sizes are reported in Table 1, and full tables report sample size for each model.&quot; (in Methods subsection: Sampling Design)</p><p>&quot;Oxidized LDL and hs-CRP assays use materials from the same lot across all measures.&quot; (in Methods subsection: Measurement of blood lipids and immune function)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I have several concerns and recommendations for the data treatment and analysis. Chiefly, I am concerned about the CRP data. The CRP values themselves that are reported (sample-wide mean listed as approx. 3.5 mg/dL) are not believable. This is likely an error in units reporting as the authors' 2016 paper lists mean Tsimane CRP around 1.5 mg/L ( = 0.15 mg/dL). It is hard to believe these values average 20+ times greater. Even if the actual mean CRP is 3.5 mg/L, this is still much higher than previously reported and requires explanation. The most likely explanation is that acute inflammatory events are likely often being captured as the sample has only &lt;1.5x coverage of CRP measures. The work of McDade (2012) and others has shown that Amazonian subsistence populations have no evidence for chronic/persistent inflammation when measured repeatedly over short intervals. Such findings suggest that inflammation in pathogen-rich environments is not persistent but rather recurrent. This manuscript's argument is based on the CRP data reflecting &quot;baseline&quot; levels. I don't believe that this is the case. The inclusion of all CRP data in the analysis (even high values clearly indicative of active acute phase response) is problematic and makes the analysis of mean CRP levels very difficult to interpret. Are, for example, lower CRP values in APOE4E reflective of lower baseline levels, faster clearance following the resolution of acute CRP spike, or lower absolute magnitude of CRP spike?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for catching this reporting error: the CRP values are in mg/L. That the mean for this sample (3.5 mg/L) is somewhat higher than the means reported in Blackwell et al. 2016 is not unexpected. This is explained by the fact that CRP was measured only ~1x per individual, and the CRP measurements are mainly from when individuals were over the age of 40 years (the median age at time of CRP measurement for this sample is 54 years old – also see Supplemental Figure 1 which includes raw data points). As seen in Table 2 of Blackwell's 2016 paper, the mean CRP is 2.30mg/L in those 50+. While this is lower what we report, it is in sync, given that CRP increases across age, and our sample is biased to older individuals and extends to 93yrs old.</p><p>However, to address the possibility that we are capturing a high number of acute inflammatory events, which may affect findings, we reran models constraining them to include only observations of CRP &lt; 10mg/L. The median level for CRP for this subset is 2.5mg/L. Constraining the models does not alter the results, however, we report the results for both, and include full output from the constrained model in the Supplement.</p><p>We see the problem of stating that the reported levels for CRP (or any biomarkers) are specifically &quot;baseline&quot;, particularly given the observational nature of the data. A main focus of the paper is in applying an evolutionary lens to understanding relationships between APOE variants, lipids, and immune functions-- including the widely-observed phenomenon that in healthy, non-obese, individuals, APOE4 is consistently associated with lower CRP. We aim to apply an evolutionary theoretical framework to understand this relationship, however, with the existing data, we cannot make strong inferences or rule out the alternate explanations (lower baseline vs faster clearance, etc.) posed. As noted below, we have deleted all uses of the term &quot;baseline&quot; to describe observed levels of immune function. We have also added sentences to the Discussion section to illuminate the possibilities raised by this Reviewer.</p><p>From Discussion: &quot;Our finding that innate immune biomarkers are lower among APOE4 carriers is in line with prior reports (Lumsden et al., 2020; Martiskainen et al., 2018; Trumble et al., 2017; Vasunilashorn et al., 2011), however the causes are uncertain. One proximate explanation involves the mevalonate pathway, which plays a key role in multiple cellular processes, including modulating sterol and cholesterol biosynthesis and innate immune function (Buhaescu and Izzedine, 2007). Regarding the main finding for CRP, it is possible that APOE4 carriers experience a lower innate immune sensing (Dose et al., 2018) or have faster clearance following the resolution of an acute spike. While there is currently no direct evidence for the latter, some studies have found that higher circulating lipids were associated with more rapid clearance of active infections (Andersen, 2018; Pérez-Guzmán et al., 2005).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More information is needed on the WBC cut-off value used to determine current infection status.</p></disp-quote><p>Since there is not a &quot;globally defined&quot; standard for WBC cutoff to determine current infection, we referred to the range described in Williams and McKenzie's Clinical Laboratory Hematology text (2nd edition, 2010), which defines leukocytosis in adults as WBC &gt; 11 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L to help determine the cutoff. However, we chose to use WBC &gt; 12 x 10<sup>9</sup>/L as a cutoff, given the overall heightened immune function (without association with adverse health) among the Tsimane (Blackwell et al., 2016; Kaplan et al., 2017).</p><p>In addition to being described in the Methods section, we added a statement to the first paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>&quot;Mixed effects multiple regression models were used to accommodate for multiple measurements per individual for some biomarkers, as well as community-level differences in pathogen exposures.

This is a key measure in this analysis, but presumably BMI and fat mass have a variable relationship across the degree of market integration captured in this sample. Likewise, community as a proxy of pathogen exposure should be better justified. Were some participants from the same households? Is it helpful to also cluster by household in the analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that BMI is not a perfect proxy for energy availability and have added a sentence to the limitations section to acknowledge this point. However, given that our main goal in the paper -- with regards to energy availability -- was to investigate APOE and lipids at the extreme tails of BMI (overweight vs. lean), we do feel that BMI can adequately capture broad differences in energetic availability between these two groups. For example, a previous paper showed that BMI and body fat were closely associated among adults in this population (Gurven et al., 2012: r=.0.75 in women; r=0.57 in men; Figure S4). Also, though we use BMI as a continuous measure for models, we plot the upper and lower tertiles from these models to distinguish these overweight vs. lean groups.</p><p>Regarding justification for using community as a proxy for pathogen exposure, we have added the following sentence to Methods: &quot;Because Tsimane villages vary in sanitation infrastructure, including access to soap and other hygienic products, and potentially prevalence by pathogen type (e.g. some living very close to the river versus farther out in the forest), individuals were clustered by community to account for variation in such community-level factors.&quot; We would also like to note that we include season and white blood cell count as additional covariates to adjust for differences in current pathogen exposure.</p><p>We appreciate the Reviewer's point regarding household-level differences in pathogen exposure, but given the age structure of the sample, the maximum number of individuals that could be in the same house would be two (married couple).

Below we address the remaining questions and comments from each reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the previous submission, there were a few key elements the authors needed to address in a resubmission. The first was whether there was any evidence of selection for the APOE4 allele in the Tsimane population. The authors have reframed their approach to be less reliant on an argument for selection and more within an ecological context and how it relates to a metabolic mediated immune activation. APOE4 fits within that framework with respect to cholesterol and immunity and how it extends largely to a pathogen-driven environment. Furthermore, Dr. Garcia et al. have added a discussion on pages 10 (428-445), that seeks to describe contextually the broad mechanisms that could be responsible for the allele frequencies observed.</p><p>Another concern related to reporting the specifics from their statistical analyses as well as general concerns as to how the study was organized. To address this major concern, the authors have shifted some details earlier in the text, such as to how the genotypes were binned on page 7. This alleviated questions I had throughout reading the paper in the first submission. Furthermore, they have added more details about their statistical models and results into the text of the paper so that their discussion is much clearer.Their table now includes the number of observations used in the analyses. Lastly, they clarified the regression model and stated that they used FDR p-value adjustments to correct for multiple testing.</p><p>My only remaining question about their statistical analyses is whether they tested for any interactions between the variables in their regression models.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not systematically test for all possible interactions between APOE and covariates (or covariates themselves) in analyses for this paper. We did, however, test for collinearity between variables included in the same model by assessing variance inflation factors (VIF) and correlations between fixed effects. No models had a VIF &gt;2, and no variables had a correlation &gt; ±0.5.</p><p>That being said, interactive effects between APOE and other phenotypic features (e.g. sex, age) are definitely of interest. There are several reasons we did not test for additional interactions here. First, to comprehensively interrogate interactions would require more space and a more targeted analytical approach, which we leave for the focus of a future analysis. Second, we lack a strong theoretical hypothesis at the present for a particular interactive effect, and we would like to avoid a fishing expedition with our observational data. If there is a specific, theoretically motivated interaction effect that the reviewer would like to see included, we would welcome the suggestion for inclusion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
