A major confound attends this approach: biological responses to deprivation may reflect a direct response to the mechanical insult rather than to the loss of sleep. Similar confounds accompany all forms of sleep deprivation and represent a major challenge to the field. Here, we describe a new paradigm for sleep deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that fully accounts for sleep-independent effects. Our results reveal that deep sleep states are the primary target of homeostatic control and establish the presence of multi-cycle sleep rebound following deprivation. Furthermore, we establish that specific deprivation of deep sleep states results in state-specific homeostatic rebound. Finally, by accounting for the molecular effects of mechanical stimulation during deprivation experiments, we show that serotonin levels track sleep pressure in the fly’s central brain. Our results illustrate the critical need to control for sleep-independent effects of deprivation when examining the molecular correlates of sleep pressure and call for a critical reassessment of work that has not accounted for such non-specific effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>deprivation</kwd><kwd>Ethoscope</kwd><kwd>MALDI-TOF MS</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS131939</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>Orie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS077933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>Orie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Controlling for the effects of mechanical stimulation during sleep deprivation reveals substantial multi-cycle sleep rebound in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and reveals serotonin as a potential sleep substance in the fly brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sleep is a fundamental biological need and is homeostatically controlled: when sleep is disrupted an elevated drive to sleep (i.e., sleepiness) is produced that is associated with decreased performance, well-being, and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dijk and von Schantz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Holding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krause et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lane et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer et al., 2022</xref>). Sleep disruption is widespread in the modern age and contributes significantly to a wide array of negative health consequences in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colten and Altevogt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Medic et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore critical to understand the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of sleep. Sleep is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom and sleep-like states likely evolved at least 740 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Campbell and Tobler, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Freiberg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kanaya et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Keene and Duboue, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Webb, 1974</xref>). Being so deeply conserved, mechanisms of sleep regulation uncovered in animals with relatively simple nervous systems can be highly relevant to sleep in mammalian species, including humans. The relative simplicity of invertebrate nervous systems and the existence of invertebrate models for which there are well-established methods of genetic and neuronal manipulations make them amenable to experimental approaches that would be technically and logistically difficult or prohibitively expensive in mammalian model systems. Work in such model systems is therefore an important complement to studies in mammals and other vertebrate models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis and Raizen, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The vinegar fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has proved to be a useful model organism for understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). The powerful genetic tools available in flies, along with the ability to manipulate and measure neural signaling within small groups of defined cell types, have revealed genes and brain networks that mediate the homeostatic regulation of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DeJesúsOlmo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ni et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seidner et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, such work in the fly has revealed mechanisms that also regulate sleep in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>). Just as in humans and other mammalian species, fly sleep is controlled by both a homeostat and a circadian clock, which, during normal sleep cycles, largely account for the timing and amount of daily sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abhilash and Shafer, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borbély et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deboer, 2018</xref>). Future work in the fly will undoubtedly continue to enrich our understanding of sleep regulation in all animals.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are significant challenges to the investigation of sleep regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, the magnitude of sleep rebound in flies is quite modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klose and Shaw, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vaccaro et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, some forms of optogenetic or thermogenetic sleep deprivation produce no apparent homeostatic sleep rebound at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seidner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vaccaro et al., 2020</xref>). As for other animal models of sleep, the action of the fly’s sleep homeostat is assayed by depriving flies of sleep and measuring subsequent increases of sleep (compared to baseline), which reflect a homeostatic discharge of the sleep debt accrued during deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melnattur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). In contrast to mammalian species, however, sleep rebound following deprivation is often quite modest and brief. For example, male flies display variable levels of increased sleep following nighttime sleep deprivation of around 0–25 min, compared to 200–500 min of sleep lost (in 6 and 12 hr deprivation windows) and this is usually detectable only during the first few hours of the day after deprivation has ended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Klose and Shaw, 2021</xref>). Furthermore, homeostatic sleep rebound in <italic>Drosophila</italic> appears to repay a relatively small proportion of the sleep lost during deprivation; 800 min of sleep loss in a full diurnal cycle was followed by only 100 min of recovery sleep (~12.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, mammalian species tend to display higher amounts of increased sleep following deprivation that is observable over more than one circadian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Oswald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mistlberger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakazawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tobler et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Williams et al., 1964</xref>), and such rebound usually accounts for a much larger proportion of lost sleep than the rebound detectable in flies. For example, humans can reclaim around 40% of the sleep lost to deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stroemel-Scheder and Lautenbacher, 2021</xref>). The relatively small rebound measured in the fly is a major challenge to the study of sleep regulation in this species, as it provides a small dynamic range over which to detect changes in homeostatic responses in experimental subjects. These features of fly sleep are somewhat surprising, given the highly conserved nature of sleep in the animal kingdom.</p><p>One possible cause of the relatively small homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation in flies are the sleep-independent effects of the deprivation techniques used by the field. The most commonly used method of fly sleep deprivation is frequent mechanical perturbation, typically shaking or slamming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melnattur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>), to force movement and prevent the attainment of sleep, which in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is defined as any bout of inactivity that is 5 min or longer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). Though effective for the prevention of sleep, these methods are likely to produce many physiological and behavioral effects that are independent of sleep loss. Indeed, mechanical shaking is known to produce the biochemical hallmarks of stress, even when delivered during times of wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbison and Sehgal, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, neurogenetic methods have been employed to deprive flies of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dubowy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vaccaro et al., 2020</xref>). This method involves the strong and chronic excitation of wake-promoting neurons in the brain. Though this method avoids the sleep-independent effects of physical perturbation, the strong non-physiological excitation of central brain neurons is likely to be attended by its own sleep-independent effects. A fundamental challenge, therefore, is to differentiate sleep-pressure-driven changes in behavior and physiology from sleep-independent changes driven by the manipulation used to prevent sleep. We predict that accounting for such sleep-independent effects would improve the sensitivity with which homeostatic sleep responses can be detected in the fly.</p><p>In mammals, sleep consists of multiple, physiologically discrete stages, which differentially respond to sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Achermann et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Oswald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Endo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Everson et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loomis et al., 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rechtschaffen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takahashi et al., 1978</xref>). Following long bouts of wakefulness during normal sleep cycles, slow-wave non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep stages dominate the initial bouts of sleep, suggesting that the daily rise of sleep pressure is discharged first by slow-wave (i.e., deep) sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borbély and Achermann, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Webb, 1974</xref>). Slow-wave sleep is also preferentially increased following sleep deprivation when compared to rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Oswald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borbly and Neuhaus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dijk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Williams et al., 1964</xref>). Thus, differentiating between distinct sleep stages is likely important for assessing the homeostatic responses to sleep deprivation.</p><p>A growing body of evidence indicates the existence of a deep sleep state in flies, which is characterized by distinct patterns of brain signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>), reduced metabolic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>), and waste clearance from the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>). The physiological and metabolic correlates of this deep sleep state are associated with bouts of inactivity that are significantly longer than the 5 min inactivity criterion used to define fly sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that periods of inactivity briefer than the 5 min criterion may represent an ‘active sleep’ state in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthoney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). The existence of multiple sleep states in the fly suggests that treating sleep as a unitary state in this species might obscure homeostatic sleep responses, particularly if, as in mammals, specific states more strongly linked to homeostatic sleep pressure than shallower stages of sleep. Furthermore, our recent analyses suggest that longer bouts of sleep are a better reflection of sleep homeostasis than traditional definitions of sleep in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abhilash and Shafer, 2023</xref>).</p><p>In this study we address the sleep-independent behavioral effects of the most commonly used form of sleep deprivation in the fly and develop a method of accounting for them. We also attempt to address the extent to which the treatment of sleep as a single unitary state in the fly might explain the apparently modest and brief nature of sleep rebound in the fly compared to such rebound in mammalian species. We present evidence that the extent of mechanical perturbation employed during sleep deprivation has significant effects on the amount of subsequent sleep displayed by deprived flies. We describe the development of a yoked control paradigm for flies, based on previous work in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>), that allows us to produce two sets of flies that have experienced identical levels of mechanical perturbation while suffering significantly different amounts of sleep restriction. Furthermore, by differentiating between long bouts of sleep from the traditional unitary definition of sleep, we show that flies display significant and lasting homeostatic sleep increases following sleep deprivation that are only detectable when controlling for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical deprivation. Finally, we illustrate the importance of yoked controls for examining the molecular correlates of sleep pressure and identify serotonin as a molecule that is increased within the brain in proportion to sleep loss but not mechanical perturbation. Our work introduces methodological approaches that are likely to support the discovery of new mechanisms of sleep regulation in the fly, calls for the reevaluation of previous work identifying the molecular, physiological, and cellular correlates of sleep pressure, and suggests that serotonin may act as a sleep substance within the central brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sleep rebound is significantly shaped by the frequency of the mechanical stimulus used to prevent sleep</title><p>The drive to sleep in the face of prolonged sleep deprivation is so strong that significant experimental intervention is necessary to keep animals awake. Such intervention is known to produce sleep-independent changes in behavior and physiology in addition to changes caused by increased sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nollet et al., 2020</xref>). Traditionally, sleep-deprived flies, which have undergone forced wakefulness by means of mechanical or neurogenetic perturbation, are compared to unperturbed flies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, it is not possible to differentiate between sleep-dependent and sleep-independent effects of deprivation, as the experimental flies have experienced both sleep deprivation and experimental insults (typically, physical agitation), whereas control flies have experienced neither. A further complication in assessing sleep rebound is the duration and time of day during which forced wakefulness stimuli are applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>) as both levels of sleep pressure and diurnal/circadian changes in physiology can have complex interactions with the perturbing stimuli.</p><p>Though the minimum criterion for a sleep-like state in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is 5 continuous minutes of inactivity, the most common means of mechanical sleep deprivation in the field consists of the delivery of mechanical stimulation (shaking or slamming) for 2 s randomly within every 20 s interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). Once the permissive window of sleep opportunity is open after the period of sleep deprivation, usually timed to the beginning of the day, sleep is measured across next few hours and the amount of sleep displayed by sleep-deprived flies is compared to unperturbed controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). The amount of baseline sleep displayed by sleep-deprived and control flies before deprivation is also often accounted for in the assessment of rebound to control for small but significant differences in baseline sleep that are often observed between experimental and control flies, even when the two groups are genetically identical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Given the substantial discrepancy between the inactivity duration criterion for sleep (5 min or more) and the frequency of mechanical stimulation used to deprive flies of sleep (multiple times per minute) we first asked how rebound sleep might differ between flies that were sleep deprived with different frequencies of mechanical stimulation. Therefore, we varied the duration of mechanical deprivation to compare our results with previous deprivation studies, which have employed various durations of sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nall and Sehgal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seidner et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Homeostatic sleep rebound is driven by the frequency of mechanical agitation when the amount of sleep deprivation is held constant.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Six hours of sleep deprivation was induced with two different mechanical trigger frequencies using vortexers: 2 s randomized shaking every 20 s or 220 s (each producing similar levels of sleep deprivation).

This reproducibility with previous studies confirmed that our lab population of <italic>Canton-S</italic> flies display homeostatic sleep increases like those described in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melnattur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nall and Sehgal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shafer and Keene, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shaw et al., 2000</xref>). To ask how the extent of mechanical stimulation shapes homeostatic sleep rebound, we decreased the frequency of such stimulation while maintaining the three durations (6 hr, 12 hr, and 24 hr) of sleep deprivation, and ensuring effective prevention of sleep. In order to examine the effects of stimulation frequency on sleep rebound, we decreased the mechanical stimulation frequency to once every 220 s. This low-frequency trigger produced sleep deprivation for all the deprivation durations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E, and H</xref>). Surprisingly, no sleep rebound was observed for 6 hr, 12 hr, or 24 hr deprivation experiments, despite the fact that the lower frequency stimulations effectively deprived sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, F, I</xref>). Lowering the intensity of mechanical stimulation therefore appeared to eliminate sleep rebound, despite having prevented sleep during deprivation.</p><p>Examination of the magnitudes of sleep rebound following high-frequency mechanical deprivation revealed that the 6 hr deprivation protocol produced higher sleep rebound than did 12 hr and 24 hr deprivation, despite the fact that this duration produced the smallest loss of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). To further confirm the role of mechanical disturbance in recovery sleep assessment, we added an additional trigger frequency of random shaking for 2 s within every 120 s interval for 24 hr of sleep deprivation. We compared the sleep rebound produced by 24 hr of sleep deprivation with stimulation frequencies of 20 s, 120 s, and 220 s using a two-way ANOVA and found that there was a significant interaction effect of treatment × trigger frequency on the amount of sleep rebound (total sleep post-deprivation minus total sleep pre-deprivation). Remarkably, we found significant rebound only for the flies deprived with 20 s trigger frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). It is also important to note that although the higher trigger frequency produced a significant rebound, the amount of recovered sleep was very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).</p><p>Thus, lower frequencies of mechanical stimulation failed to produce significant sleep rebounds, despite having produced similar extents of sleep deprivation. To address the extent to which our sleep-deprived flies recovered lost sleep, we estimated how much lost sleep was recovered across the 24 hr following the end of the deprivation window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Donlea et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>). We found that, as expected from previous work in many labs, the flies deprived of sleep using the most frequent mechanical stimulation (every 20 s) displayed apparent homeostatic sleep increases in the hours immediately following deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, D, and G</xref>). In contrast, flies that experienced less frequent stimulation displayed little if any such apparent rebound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E, and H</xref>). The fact that lower levels of mechanical stimulation failed to produce rebound over one full cycle, despite having produced similar amounts of sleep deprivation, suggests that high-frequency physical perturbation produces sleep-independent behavioral effects that might mask bona fide homeostatic sleep increases. Alternatively, it is also possible that during lower stimulation frequencies, flies may increase their levels of the recently hypothesized ‘active sleep’ state (inactivity of between 1 and 5 min in duration associated with physiological changes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthoney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>) and that this may prevent the build-up of sleep pressure and rebound. We examined the levels of such sleep during and after deprivation using 220 s stimulation frequencies and found that the flies do display substantial increases in this short sleep state throughout deprivation using 220 s stimulation frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, given the strong convergent evidence that periods of inactivity of 5 min or more represent a physiologically distinct sleep-like state, it is surprising to see the absence of rebound following deprivation of this sleep state in our experiments using 220 s stimulation frequencies and standard sleep definitions. The absence of rebound in these experiments supports the hypothesis that the apparent homeostatic rebound of fly sleep is strongly shaped by the frequency of mechanical stimulation. Accounting for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical deprivation on sleep and examining the homeostatic control of distinct sleep states are likely to reveal previously hidden characteristics of sleep homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Accounting for mechanical stimulus using a yoked-controlled design uncovers significant sleep rebound in sleep-deprived flies when low-frequency triggers are used</title><p>The mechanical shaking employed to sleep-deprived flies loaded into the DAM system uses near-constant agitation without regard to the flies’ sleep state, delivering mechanical stimulation to both active and inactive flies. To further examine the potential sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation during sleep deprivation experiments, we adopted the Ethoscope, a video-based system for recording fly behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast to the DAM system, which requires the simultaneous mechanical perturbation of all flies within the same DAM, the Ethoscope allows the user to deliver mechanical stimuli to individual flies only when a fly is inactive for a specified amount of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). The ability to track single flies and selectively stimulate individual flies to prevent sleep means that flies can be sleep deprived with significantly fewer mechanical perturbations, and only when flies have been inactive for defined durations.</p><p>We programmed Ethoscopes to track single flies and rotate their tubes at ~420 rpm for 1 s each time a fly had been inactive for 220 s, which resulted in 24 hr of sleep deprivation when using the standard inactivity criterion for fly sleep (5 min or more) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and C</xref>).

This result is also surprising on another account – the use of Ethoscopes to measure sleep does not overestimate and saturate sleep as much as the IR-beam crossing-based method in the DAMs (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), thereby providing a larger dynamic range wherein rebound could have been observed.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Controlling for mechanical stimulation is necessary to observe 24 hr sleep rebound when low-frequency mechanical triggers are used for deprivation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inactivity-dependent sleep deprivation in Ethoscopes with 220 s inactivity triggers fails to generate post-deprivation sleep rebound in wild-type (<italic>Canton-S</italic>) flies when compared with undisturbed controls.

As suggested by our observations above, the mechanical insult experienced by flies during sleep deprivation are likely to exert sleep-independent effects on the behavior observed after deprivation. That is, the mechanical disturbance experienced by the sleep-deprived flies may produce effects on the fly that could obscure sleep-pressure-driven behavioral changes. Second, the 220 s inactivity triggers used to deprive flies of sleep may have allowed brief inactivity bouts recently hypothesized to represent an ‘active sleep’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthoney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>) and such a state prevented the build-up of sufficient sleep pressure to produce a homeostatic response. This would suggest that the 5 min inactivity criterion for sleep may be too long to capture all forms of homeostatically controlled fly sleep. To begin to address these two possibilities, we first considered the effects of mechanical perturbation and therefore sought to produce flies that differed in the extent of their sleep deprivation, despite experiencing identical mechanical stimulation. Comparing sleep in such flies would allow us to examine the specific contribution of sleep pressure to sleep behavior following deprivation.</p><p>To accomplish this, we adopted a paradigm of ‘yoked’ sleep deprivation that was first introduced in the rat model, which produces pairs of rats that have experienced perfectly matched mechanical stimulation, in the form of a rotating platform over water, that nevertheless differed significantly in the amount of sleep deprivation experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>). This approach involved a ‘focal’ animal which was placed on one side of the platform and monitored via electroencephalogram recording. Whenever the focal animal displayed the physiological hallmarks of sleep, the platform would begin to rotate, thereby keeping the focal animal awake. A paired rat, the ‘yoked’ control, was placed on the opposite side of the platform and could sleep when the focal rat was awake. This arrangement produced a pair of rats that experienced identical, time-matched mechanical stimulation while experiencing significantly different amounts of sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>We programmed the Ethoscope platform to produce a paired yoked control fly for every sleep-deprived focal fly. We conducted these experiments for a 24 hr period commencing at lights-on to avoid the circadian confounds of mechanical stimulations given at specific times of the day or night. For each fly that was tracked and stimulated upon being inactive for 220 s, a second fly received matched, time-locked tube rotations, which were delivered independently of its sleep/wake state. This ensured that each focal and yoked pair received identical mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). 220 s inactivity criteria were necessary to provide sufficient time for our yoked controls to attain substantial amounts of sleep, as defined by the standard criterion of 5 min or more of inactivity. Indeed, using the 220 s inactivity trigger allowed yoked flies to attain sleep while the focal fly was active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Yoked controls, therefore, suffered only partial sleep loss compared to focal flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>). This approach, therefore, succeeded in producing two sets of flies that had experienced the same level of physical perturbation while suffering significantly different levels of sleep loss.</p><p>A comparison of total sleep across the entire 24 hr of the post-deprivation day revealed significantly higher levels of sleep in the focal flies compared to yoked controls for both <italic>Canton-S</italic> and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and K</xref>). Thus, the inclusion of yoked controls revealed a homeostatic sleep response that was not apparent when comparing sleep-deprived flies to unperturbed controls, supporting the notion that sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation can mask homeostatic sleep responses. Both <italic>Canton-S</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>) and <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>) strains displayed such rebound, exhibiting increases in both daytime and nighttime sleep during the 24 hr following deprivation. This observation, however, did not answer why sleep-deprived flies fail to show rebound sleep when compared to undisturbed flies. After all, sleep was restricted successfully in both cases of experimental flies. We hypothesized that the mechanical stimulus itself must be inducing unknown, non-specific effects that directly affects long-term sleep or activity. Indeed, we found that mechanical stimulation during deprivation significantly increased the activity levels of sleep-deprived flies a day after mechanical perturbation, when compared to undisturbed controls. This increase was seen immediately after the light-to-dark transition, that is, at the time associated with the transition to nighttime sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and most likely masked the 24 hr sleep rebound when compared to undisturbed flies. This difference was not observed when comparing focal flies with yoked controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), because both of these paired flies received identical mechanical stimuli. Though yoked controls revealed significant sleep-pressure-specific increases in sleep, this homeostatic increase was quite modest, resulting in very little discharge of the sleep pressure built during the 24 hr of sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and K</xref>). Given that most animals display homeostatic sleep increases over multiple sleep/wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mistlberger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakazawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rechtschaffen et al., 1999</xref>), we wondered if the rebound we detected using yoked controls might persist over multiple diurnal cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sleep rebound accumulates over multiple cycles in response to infrequent mechanical deprivation, but little sleep debt is paid off</title><p>The circadian control of sleep thresholds ensures that sleep is gated to occur at the appropriate/adaptive time of the day, even in the presence of increased sleep drive. The action of the circadian system therefore prevents sleep debt from being discharged completely upon the first opportunity to sleep, ensuring that wakefulness will occur during the next diurnal cycle despite the presence of homeostatic sleep pressure. For this reason, sleep debt is typically discharged over several sleep/wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mistlberger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakazawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rechtschaffen et al., 1999</xref>). Current methods in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep field do not typically produce multi-cycle rebound, but instead, reveal fairly modest sleep rebound during the first hours of the daytime following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beckwith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). In our yoked-controlled experiment, we observed only modest sleep rebound that discharged very little of the sleep lost during the previous day’s deprivation, which may have been a product of the smaller but significant deprivation experienced by yoked controls. However, in this case, sleep rebound was apparent across the diurnal cycle, rather than being limited to the first few hours of the recovery day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>). We wondered if the comparison of deprived flies with yoked controls might reveal persistent increases in sleep for deprived flies across subsequent sleep/wake cycles. We therefore assessed the behavior of flies deprived of sleep using the Ethoscope for three full diurnal cycles following 24 hr of sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and compared the sleep of deprived flies with sleep observed in both undisturbed and paired yoked controls.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Sleep pressure is discharged as cumulative sleep recovery across multiple cycles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average sleep time courses of baseline, deprivation (220 s inactivity-dependent trigger), and 3 post-deprivation days in focal and undisturbed flies, and (<bold>B</bold>) focal-yoked pairs for the same days shown in A (the time courses visualized here are extended, multi-day analysis of the focal-yoked experiment reported for <italic>Canton-S</italic> in the previous figure).

In this case, baseline sleep on the days before deprivation was not different between the three groups of flies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and G</xref>). We examined how much lost sleep was recovered across the three post-deprivation cycles by quantifying sleep gain in focal flies, which we calculated as the increase in total post-deprivation sleep compared to baseline sleep and normalized to sleep in undisturbed controls to account for normal changes in sleep during the duration of the experiment (see Methods). Despite this apparent two-cycle rebound, focal flies failed to discharge a substantial portion of the sleep debt accrued during deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result is surprising because when we estimated p(Doze), a recently introduced conditional probability metric for sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wiggin et al., 2020</xref>), we found that the focal flies show sustained increases in sleep pressure for at least 3 days post sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We wondered if the apparent absence of substantial homeostatic payback of sleep lost by focal flies during deprivation might be explained by the fact that current sleep analysis methods do not recognize distinct sleep states, treating sleep as a unitary state in which all bouts of inactivity of 5 min or more are considered to be the same sleep state. Given the growing evidence of physiologically and metabolically distinct sleep states in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>) and the fact that deep sleep stages are most strongly and immediately affected by sleep deprivation in mammals, we turned our attention to how the architecture of sleep might differ between focally deprived flies and their yoked controls across the 3 days following deprivation. Though the number of sleep bouts was not significantly different between focal and yoked flies across any of the three post-deprivation cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), there was a significant increase in bout duration in the focal flies compared to yoked controls across the first 2 days following deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These two groups of flies displayed no differences in these metrics during baseline sleep before deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

This suggested that longer bouts of sleep are most strongly influenced by homeostatic sleep regulation and that sleep bouts lasting 1–24 min are characterized by substantially lower rebound following deprivation. We found no evidence of post-deprivation increases in brief, short sleep epochs (periods of inactivity lasting between 1 and 5 min). This was not surprising given our finding that 220 s inactivity triggers produce increases in such short sleep bouts during deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Five-day long-bout sleep time-series for focal, yoked, and undisturbed flies are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Unperturbed controls displayed two daily peaks of long-bout sleep, with approximately twice as much deep sleep taking place at night, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>). Focal flies were, as expected from 220 s inactivity triggers, completely deprived of sleep bouts consisting of 25 min or more. Yoked flies also, as expected, displayed significantly reduced levels of such long-bout sleep compared to unperturbed controls, but such sleep was in fact attained by these controls, though at levels significantly reduced from those displayed by unperturbed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>When total long-bout sleep across three successive cycles was quantified, focal flies displayed significant increases in such sleep when compared only to yoked controls on days 2 and 3 of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The absence of a difference with yoked flies on day 1 is likely a product of the substantial reduction in long-bout sleep that yoked flies experienced during the deprivation period. Nevertheless, focal and yoked flies revealed differential long-bout sleep rebounds across 3 days of recovery. Remarkably, this rebound was not seen when focal flies were compared to unperturbed controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Once again, this was likely due to the sleep-pressure-independent effects of mechanical disturbance. To confirm that frequent 25 min bouts of inactivity were not an abnormal occurrence induced by the Ethoscope (i.e., that this state was not induced by the rotations delivered by the Ethoscopes), we confirmed that such long bouts of sleep are frequently observed in unperturbed control flies. Indeed, all unperturbed control flies routinely displayed 25 min or longer bouts of inactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The sleep architecture of focal flies after sleep deprivation also changed significantly compared to yoked controls where instances of longer and consolidated sleep bouts were significantly increased in the focal flies, although long-bout sleep durations were not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>).</p><p>These results suggested that longer bouts of sleep are a more sensitive reflection of homeostatically controlled sleep in flies. This conclusion is supported by the significant recovery of lost long-bout sleep that continues across all 3 days of the observed recovery period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, when the analysis focused on long and presumably deep sleep states, a much larger percentage of such sleep is recovered compared to a consideration of all epochs of inactivity lasting longer than 1 min. At least half of all sleep-deprived flies paid back more than 50% of the sleep they lost during the 24 hr of deprivation, and over 25% of flies overshot their sleep debt, thereby displaying a defining hallmark of homeostatic control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These results lend further support for the idea that long bouts of inactivity represent a sleep state that is distinct from shorter bouts of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, robust homeostatic recovery of long-bout suggests that our initial failure to detect rebound when 220 s inactivity triggers were used for deprivation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) was not simply due to increases in short sleep epochs preventing the build-up of homeostatic sleep drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), as long-bout sleep displays clear homeostatic rebound even when 220 s triggers allow for substantial levels of short sleep during deprivation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Long bout sleep is under potent homeostatic control</title><p>In mammals, both REM and NREM stages of sleep are controlled homeostatically, with stage-specific deprivation leading to stage-specific rebound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borbly and Neuhaus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Endo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Endo et al., 1997</xref>).

When using the standard inactivity duration criterion for sleep (5 min or more), this long trigger latency supported what appeared to be largely normal sleep rhythms in both focal and yoked flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Thus, when compared only to unperturbed flies, sleep deprivation in focal flies was accompanied by increases in a large proportion of the molecules examined. However, it is highly likely that the mechanical stimulation associated with sleep deprivation causes many of these molecular changes within the brain and such increases might not track sleep pressure.

Thus, the standard method of comparing sleep-deprived flies to unperturbed controls produced 127 candidate sleep-tracking molecules, whereas the inclusion of yoked controls produced only eight candidates.

One of these had an m/z peak at ~553, and the other at 177.1 m/z in the DHB matrix. The 177.1 m/z peak has previously been shown to correspond to serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moriarty et al., 2011</xref>) and fits the molecular weight range of serotonin (176.2) in a positive ion matrix like DHB, which adds a cation with a single positive charge to the m/z peak, which for serotonin would result in a peak at ~177 m/z. Furthermore, we confirmed that this m/z value reflected serotonin by spotting serotonin on slides imaged by MALDI-TOF MS and confirmed strong peaks at m/z=177 for regions of interest corresponding to these spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, serotonin would appear to be a strong candidate for a molecule whose abundance reflects sleep pressure in the fly’s central brain (see Discussion), that follows the expected pattern across unperturbed, yoked, and focal flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). An unknown molecule with an m/z value of ~553 is likewise also a strong candidate for another such molecule. Although it is impossible to guess the exact nature of this molecule without further extensive experimentation, the m/z ratio indicates that this molecule is larger than amino acids, other biogenic amines, or other neurotransmitters (for instance, dopamine, octopamine, and GABA), and smaller than large peptides, or peptide receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The impact of the sleep-independent effects of mechanical sleep deprivation on the measurement of homeostatic sleep rebound</title><p>In order to study the sleep homeostat, one must prevent sleep through the imposition of prolonged wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bentivoglio and Grassi-Zucconi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henri, 1895</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Patrick and Gilbert, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>). However, the very act of sleep disruption is expected to cause not just the build-up of sleep pressure, but also other potentially confounding responses to the stimulus used to prevent sleep. The specific confounds attending sleep deprivation will depend on the method, duration, and time of day of the sleep-depriving stimulus employed, and all forms of experimental sleep deprivation are expected to produce such confounds, including methods based on chemo-, thermo-, or opto-genetics. Any sleep deprivation method that produces increased locomotion will increase muscular activity, which will be attended by sleep-independent effects. Chronic mechanical agitation also produces stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meerlo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sgoifo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tartar et al., 2009</xref>), and even gentle handling of rodent subjects, a means of deprivation thought to cause little stress, has significant effects on feeding behavior following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dukanovic et al., 2022</xref>). Such confounding, sleep-independent effects can mask homeostatic sleep responses and must therefore be accounted for whenever possible. Here, we have attempted to account for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical sleep deprivation in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the most commonly used method in the field of fly sleep research. Sleep-independent effects of any method of deprivation are likely multi-factorial. The utility of the yoked control paradigm introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>, is that these effects do not need to be completely understood in order to be accounted for. Though it is not within the scope of our study to completely account for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical deprivation, we suggest a partial explanation: the depriving stimuli itself cause increases in locomotor activity in deprived flies that likely antagonize the increased drive to sleep in deprived flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To assess the degree to which the frequency of mechanical agitation affects subsequent sleep rebound in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we examined flies that were sleep deprived for 24 hr with different frequencies of mechanical perturbation. The less frequent agitation produced significantly less sleep rebound, despite having produced similar amounts of sleep loss. Thus, a sleep-pressure-independent effect of mechanical perturbation appeared to be the primary determinant of post-deprivation sleep. An alternative explanation for this result was that short bouts of inactivity may have provided brief but restorative sleep that the longer perturbation frequencies were not effective at depriving. Indeed, 220 s inactivity triggers produced increases in brief (between 1 and 5 min) periods of inactivity during deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such short sleep epochs have been proposed to be a distinct sleep state from the standard sleep traditionally measured in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anthoney et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). However, based on our estimates of p(Doze), a metric of sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is persistently high for three cycles post sleep deprivation, we do not think that this short sleep epoch prevented the build-up of homeostatic sleep drive, at least in this context. Furthermore, based on a large body of work conducted on humans and other mammals, we would not necessarily expect increases in one sleep state to prevent the homeostatic regulation of another.</p><p>Though it is possible that increases in the amount of brief short sleep bouts may have reduced the build-up of sleep pressure during deprivation experiments employing 220 s inactivity triggers, our results strongly support the conclusion that mechanical stimulation produces sleep-independent effects that can mask homeostatic sleep rebound. Six, 12-, and 24 hr of nighttime sleep deprivation using frequent (20 s) triggers failed to produce the expected relationship between the amount of sleep lost and the magnitude of rebound during the recovery day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). The failure of rebound to track the amount of sleep loss indicates that the comparison of sleep-deprived flies and unperturbed controls is not sufficiently sensitive to detect the differential sleep rebounds expected from flies that have suffered significantly different levels of sleep loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>A previous attempt to control for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation delivered mechanical stimuli matched to sleep-deprived flies, but delivered during periods of high activity (i.e., wakefulness), thereby exposing the control flies to mechanical shaking while resulting in negligible amounts of sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbison and Sehgal, 2009</xref>). However, mechanical shaking only during times of wakefulness increased molecular signatures of stress, even when given for relatively short periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbison and Sehgal, 2009</xref>). To minimize the extent of mechanical perturbation necessary to prevent sleep and to control for the sleep-independent effects of such perturbation, we adopted the Ethoscope, a video-based system that tracks single flies and delivers a mechanical stimulus, the rapid rotation of the glass tube containing the fly, only when a fly meets a user-defined inactivity duration criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, rather than agitating all the flies of the sleep-deprived condition at a given frequency throughout the entire deprivation period, the Ethoscope prevents single flies from attaining specific durations of inactivity, just before meeting a user-defined duration. Previous work using this system has revealed remarkably low levels of homeostatic rebound and no sleep deprivation-associated death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Though the Ethoscope produces sleep deprivation using fewer mechanical perturbations, it nevertheless delivers significant mechanical perturbation whose sleep-independent effects might mask homeostatic sleep responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). For this reason, we introduced yoked controls to the Ethoscope platform, allowing us for the first time to disentangle effects associated with sleep pressure from those best explained by the mechanical insult delivered during sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). When flies were prevented from attaining 5 min bouts of inactivity – the standard criteria for a sleep-like state in the fly – using 220 s inactivity triggers in Ethoscopes, they failed to show significant homeostatic rebound when their sleep was compared to unperturbed controls. It is noteworthy here that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Geissmann et al., 2019</xref>, used a 220 s trigger and reported small but significant rebound compared to undisturbed controls. We believe this discrepancy is based on two differences between our studies. First, the rebound analysis window was only 3 hr (ZT0–03) in Geissmann et al. but was for a full 24 hr cycle in our study. Second within Geissman et al.’s rebound analysis window, a regression model was used to derive expected sleep amounts (based on pre-deprivation trends), whereas we compared raw data from undisturbed controls. It is possible that small rebounds may have been detected if Geissman’s methods had been used in our study. In contrast to small or non-existent rebound when comparing deprived and unperturbed flies, the comparison of these deprived flies to their yoked controls revealed a significant, albeit small, increase in sleep following deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Thus, yoking revealed homeostatic rebound that was not apparent when deprived flies were compared to controls that had not experienced mechanical stimulation. However, when compared to yoked controls, the homeostatic response of sleep-deprived flies was quite small, amounting to very little recovery of lost sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Sleep as a non-unitary state in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: long-bout sleep is a distinctly regulated sleep stage</title><p>In mammals, sleep is not a unitary state but rather consists of distinguishable sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loomis et al., 1937</xref>). For example, REM and NREM sleep represent distinct physiological states that differ in their relationship to sleep pressure and the circadian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borbly and Neuhaus, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Czeisler et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Endo et al., 1997</xref>). Slow-wave NREM sleep appears to be the mammalian sleep state most strongly controlled by the daily homeostatic control of sleep: initial sleep cycles following prolonged wakefulness are rich in slow-wave sleep, and this form of sleep is also prevalent following sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Oswald, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Ursin, 1971</xref>). For the majority of studies using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sleep has been treated as unitary state, with all inactivity bouts of five minutes or more being treated as sleep. However, a growing body of works suggests the existence of distinct sleep stages in the fly. For example, in one of the very first papers describing sleep-like states in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hendricks et al. reported differences in durations of sleep bouts consisting of epochs of inactivity lasting 5 min or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>). The longest bout lengths occurred at the beginning of the subjective night under constant conditions between circadian time 13.5 and 16. More recently, quantitative approaches using hidden Markov models have suggested the existence of light and deep sleep states in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wiggin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Xu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Flies display both longer and deeper bouts of sleep at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hendricks et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>) and deeper sleep is associated with distinct patterns of global brain activity when compared to brain activity during wakefulness or during more brief and shallow bouts sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nitz et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>). Longer sleep bouts are also attended by lower metabolic rates, where bout lengths of 60 min were shown to be associated with the lowest rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stahl et al., 2017</xref>), a phenomenon similar to that observed for deeper NREM sleep stages in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berger and Phillips, 1995</xref>). Finally, flies display a stereotyped pattern of proboscis movements that appear to drive waste clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>), reminiscent of the changes in fluid dynamics observed in the cerebrospinal fluid of sleeping mammals, that occur at times corresponding to deep sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fultz et al., 2019</xref>). The time of peak occurrence of these proboscis movements were characterized by a significant reduction of brain wave activity compared to sleep at other times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van Alphen et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Physiological and metabolic signatures of deep sleep in the fly both suggest that they correspond to sleep bouts that are significantly longer than the standard sleep definition of 5 min of inactivity and multiple lines of evidence suggest that deeper sleep states are likely reached upon attaining 15–30 min of inactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, recent work from our lab has suggested that bouts of inactivity longer than anything between 30 and 60 min are stronger reflections of the daily homeostatic control sleep than shorter bouts of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abhilash and Shafer, 2023</xref>). How might such long bouts of inactivity relate to homeostatic sleep rebound?</p><p>Homeostatic sleep rebound, as traditionally measured in flies, appears to differ from mammalian sleep rebound, in that it is relatively modest in magnitude and appears to largely run to completion during the first few hours following the offset of deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Huber et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, mammalian rebound appears to play out over several sleep-wake cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coborn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mistlberger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nakazawa et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rechtschaffen et al., 1999</xref>). Remarkably, when we biased our analysis to bouts of inactivity lasting 25 min or more, clear and prolonged homeostatic rebound of sleep was observed following deprivation. This rebound lasted several days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and discharged a large proportion (&gt;50%) of the long-bout sleep debt suffered during deprivation (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E–4E</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This result further supports the notion that long durations of inactivity more sensitively reflect the action of the sleep homeostat.</p><p>When we deprived flies only of inactivity bouts that were longer than 22 min (see Methods), a duration that we chose based on its effectiveness at reliably preventing 25 min epochs of inactivity, we observed a homeostatic increase in long-bout sleep, while seeing no such homeostatic response in standard sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, the homeostatic rebound of long-bout sleep was apparent on the very first day of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>) as opposed to the rebound seen following deprivation using shorter inactivity triggers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and D</xref>). This is probably due to the fact that long-bout sleep deprivation engaged mechanical triggers only 12–14 times on average over the 24 hr of deprivation, and thereby likely reduced significantly the sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Yoked controls are critical for the examination of molecular and physiological correlates of sleep pressure</title><p>A major goal of sleep science is to identify the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms underlying the build-up of sleep pressure and how such pressure promotes sleep. As has been recognized since the founding of sleep science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kleitman, 1923</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kleitman, 1939</xref>), inescapable confounds attend sleep deprivation experiments. The increased activity caused by most forms of experimental sleep deprivation is likely to have myriad behavioral, physiological, and metabolic effects. Mechanical sleep deprivation through vortexing, the most commonly used method of sleep deprivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> research, is particularly problematic in this regard, as it appears to cause significant physical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harbison and Sehgal, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The sleep-independent effects of deprivation protocols represent a significant confound and pose a major challenge to the identification of the molecular and physiological correlates of sleep pressure. If a molecular or physiological response to deprivation truly represents an increase in sleep pressure, it must be established that it is not simply a response to the stimuli used to prevent sleep. A fundamental challenge for the sleep scientist working in the fly system therefore is to differentiate between the effects of increased sleep pressure from the sleep-independent effects of the stimuli used to prevent sleep. The use of yoked controls and longer duration inactivity triggers in our study appears to be a useful means of accounting for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical sleep disruption on behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). We therefore wondered if this approach would allow us to differentiate molecular changes that were specific to sleep pressure from changes produced directly by the effects of mechanical perturbation.</p><p>Given the extent of disturbance necessary to keep flies awake during prolonged sleep deprivation, we predicted that a large number of molecules whose abundance increases in response to sleep deprivation would reflect responses to mechanical stimulation rather than sleep pressure driven increase. Indeed, when we compared the brains of sleep-deprived files to unperturbed controls, around 70% of all detected molecules showed a significant increase in abundance. However, when we employed yoked controls as an additional control to identify which molecular weights were higher in deprived flies compared to controls that had experienced identical mechanical perturbation but significantly less sleep deprivation, we found that only approximately 4% of detectable molecules reflected sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, many of the molecular changes in response to sleep deprivation can likely be explained by the effects of mechanical disturbance and not by sleep pressure. This result highlights the importance of yoked controls for confirming that specific molecules, genes, and cells mediate sleep homeostasis rather than the behavioral or physiological responses to prolonged mechanical stimulation. Such controls will be critical for the vetting of physiological or cellular correlates of sleep pressure. More specifically, the limited molecular screen we describe here supports the feasibility of using yoked controls to discover sleep substances within the fly brain, molecules whose abundance rises and falls with sleep pressure that are used by sleep control centers to exert homeostatic control of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borbély, 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Serotonin is a candidate sleep substance in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central brain</title><p>The inclusion of yoked controls in our experiments revealed that very few of the molecular changes produced by mechanical sleep deprivation tracked sleep loss. One molecule that reliably tracked sleep pressure in independent experiments was serotonin, which, based on our results, can be considered a strong candidate sleep substance in the fly’s central brain. A previous study using HPLC to examine serotonin levels in dissected brains failed to observe serotonin increases in sleep-deprived flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davla et al., 2020</xref>). However, the spatial resolution provided by MALDI-TOF imaging suggests that sleep loss-driven serotonin increases take place in the central brain and not the optic lobes (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and F</xref>). We therefore suspect that serotonin does not build up throughout the optic lobes and that whole-brain assays might therefore fail to detect the sleep loss-induced changes we describe here. The identification of serotonin as a candidate sleep substance is notable, as convergent evidence in the fly strongly supports the conclusions that serotonin signaling promotes sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Pharmacological increases in serotonin and the excitation of serotonergic neurons produce increases in baseline sleep in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Haynes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pooryasin and Fiala, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, blocking synaptic transmission in single pairs of serotonergic neurons have been reported to reduce baseline sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alekseyenko et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic loss of serotonin synthesis decreases baseline sleep, as does the loss of 5HT-R-1A and 5HT-R-2B serotonin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>). Loss of serotonin and the serotonin receptor 5HT-R-2B also results in a reduction in sleep rebound following deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Qian et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the genetic loss of arylalkylamine <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase, which normally functions to inactivate serotonin and dopamine, is accompanied by both increased homeostatic sleep rebound and brain serotonin levels following sleep deprivation, consistent with serotonin acting as a sleep substance during mechanical deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davla et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, loss of the serotonin transporter dSERT, which normally functions to remove extracellular serotonin, is associated with significant increases in sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Knapp et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, convergent evidence supports the conclusion that serotonin promotes both basal sleep and homeostatic increases in sleep following deprivation.</p><p>According to the two-process model of sleep regulation, basal seep and homeostatic increases in sleep are driven by ‘process S’, which is thought to be mediated by somnogens, molecules that rise and fall with sleep pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borbély, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Borbély, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Borbély and Achermann, 1999</xref>). Our MALDI results, in conjunction with previous work establishing a sleep-promoting role for serotonin in the fly, suggest that serotonin levels build in the central brain during sleep deprivation and increase the pressure to sleep through actions of serotonin receptors. Remarkably, this very model was proposed by Jouvet to reconcile conflicting results regarding serotonin’s role in the control of mammalian sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jouvet, 1999</xref>). A significant body of work has established that increasing serotonin in the mammalian brain produces sleep increases and that the loss of serotonin results in insomnia. These observations were the basis of the serotonergic theory of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jouvet, 1999</xref>). Serotonergic neurons were subsequently shown to be active during wakefulness and this was taken as evidence against the hypothesis that serotonin promotes sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jouvet, 1999</xref>). However, neurons producing a sleep substance would be expected to be active during wakefulness and to thereby promote sleep pressure during prolonged bouts of wakefulness. Serotonin neurons were hypothesized to act in this way by Jouvet in order to reconcile the wake-active nature of serotonin neurons with the serotonergic theory of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jouvet, 1999</xref>). Our work strongly implicates serotonergic signaling as a component of process S in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and sets the stage for future work to test the predictions of the serotonergic theory of sleep in the fly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The work described here provides both new insights into sleep homeostasis in flies and new methodologies that are likely to improve our ability to detect homeostatic sleep responses and identify molecular correlates of sleep pressure in this species. Our work indicates that the mechanical perturbation most commonly used to deprive flies of sleep produces both behavioral and molecular changes that potentially mask the sleep-pressure-specific changes that underly homeostatic sleep control. The results of our work also reveal that long bouts of sleep, which have been shown by several studies to represent a deep sleep state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tainton-Heap et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Alphen et al., 2013</xref>), are a more sensitive indicator of sleep pressure and rebound than the previously used unitary definition of sleep as 5 min or more of inactivity. Remarkably, when analysis is focused on longer (~30 min) bouts of inactivity, homeostatic control of sleep in the fly appears much more similar to that seen in mammals, in that a larger proportion of sleep debt is repaid and is discharged over multiple sleep-wake cycles. We predict that this larger magnitude of sleep rebound will be of great utility to the field, increasing the dynamic range over which the effects of molecular and physiological alterations can be examined and thereby increasing the likelihood of discovering new molecular and cellular components of sleep homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and husbandry</title><p>Flies were reared on Corn Syrup/Soy media made by Archon Scientific (Durham, NC, USA) under a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark (LD) cycle at 25°C and 60–70% humidity.

The MultiTube Vortexer was set at a shaking intensity of four.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Inactivity-dependent sleep deprivation using Ethoscopes</title><p>Using the rotational module, we sleep deprived flies with a 220 s inactivity threshold. DAM tubes were rotated at ~420 rpm for 1 s every time an individual fly was inactive for 220 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Yoked-controlled mechanical deprivation in the Ethoscope</title><p>The Ethoscope rotational module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Geissmann et al., 2017</xref>) was used to develop a yoked-controlled mechanical deprivation platform. The Ethoscope has been used previously to rotate single tubes only when the animal has been inactive for specific durations of time (as opposed to shaking randomly and without regard to behavioral state as is the case of vortexing DAMs). We altered the closed-loop feedback control (see below) in the Ethoscope to rotate two tubes at the same time based on the inactivity state of only one of the two flies. The fly whose behavior determined the rotation of the tubes is referred to here as the focal fly, whereas the paired fly that received identical time-matched rotations without regard to its behavioral state is called the yoked fly. This approach was adapted from the one used for the sleep deprivation of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rechtschaffen et al., 1983</xref>). Two inactivity-dependent rotational triggers were used in this study: 220 s, which prevented the focal fly from attaining the standard definition of sleep (5 min of inactivity or more) and 1320 s, which deprived focal flies of inactivity durations of 22 min or more. Due to logistical issues relating to video-based feedback, the inactivity duration was set to 22 min – this was to make sure that no bouts of inactivity that are longer than 25 min are allowed to occur.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Development of Ethoscope code to support yoked controls</title><p>Yoking was implemented at the level of the Ethoscope’s ‘TrackingUnit’, which is where the connection between the video-based motion tracker and the stimulator (i.e., tube rotator) is located [self._stimulator.bind_tracker(self._tracker)]. The Ethoscope’s program was modified so that the stimulator controlling the tubes containing yoked controls was bound to the tracker of their paired focal flies. This results in the stimulator of the yoked animals responding to the behavior of the focal animals at the same time as the stimulators of the focal flies. The code supporting yoked controls is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/shaliulab/shaferlab-ethoscope">https://github.com/shaliulab/shaferlab-ethoscope</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ortega, 2022</xref>; a fork of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gilestrolab/ethoscope">https://github.com/gilestrolab/ethoscope</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Geissmann and Gilestro, 2022</xref>) with tag v1.0.999, which can be acquired via pip with the command pip install shaferlab-ethoscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>MALDI-TOF analysis</title><p>After 24 hr of sleep deprivation using 220 s immobility triggers for focal flies with their yoked and unperturbed controls, heads from all three conditions were embedded in Optimal Cutting Temperature (Tissue-Tek, Product code: 4583, Sakura Finetek USA Inc) compound, frozen with liquid nitrogen, cryo-sectioned, and prepared and assayed by MALDI-TOF MS as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Veerasammy et al., 2020</xref>). 2,5-Dihydrobenzoc acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #149357) was used as our matrix, which supports the ionization of metabolites and peptides, and is considered a useful matrix for ‘universal analysis’ of a diverse variety of molecular types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Snovida et al., 2006</xref>). MALDI mass spectra were acquired in a Bruker Autoflex Speed TOF Machine (Bruker, Germany) and peaks were identified in SCiLS MALDI Imaging software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) by a manual peak walk across the spectrum of m/z values between 0 and 1300 for each discernible m/z ratio for unperturbed, focal, and yoked flies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In order to test the effect of trigger frequency and mechanical disturbance on the amount of rebound sleep, we used a two-way fixed factor ANOVA. We used trigger frequency as one fixed factor with three levels, that is, 20 s, 120 s, and 220 s. The second fixed factor was treatment with two levels, that is, mechanically disturbed fly and unperturbed controls. Whether the difference in total sleep post-deprivation between unperturbed controls and sleep-deprived flies was dependent on trigger frequency was inferred based on the interaction effect between the two factors described above. In all other analyses reported throughout the manuscript, we either used the Mann-Whitney U (also referred to as the Wilcoxon’s rank sum test) or the Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on the number of groups being compared. In all cases involving more than two groups, multiple comparisons were done using a Bonferroni correction. In case of the MALDI-TOF MS experiment, owing to the large number of peaks detected, all the p-values from individual tests were treated to a Benjamini-Hochberg correction to adjust for inflated false discovery rates. All statistical analyses were done and figures made using R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">R Development Core Team, 2022</xref>). Specific tests, sample sizes, and p-values are reported in the figure legends.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-91355-mdarchecklist1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Behavioral and sleep architecture phenotypes associated with mechanical sleep deprivation, and MALDI-TOF MS standards.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-91355-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All Raw Data can be found on Dryad (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfpp">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfpp</ext-link>).</p><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="isSupplementedBy" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chowdhury</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Abhilash</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ortegan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2023">2023</year><data-title>Data from: Homeostatic control of deep sleep and molecular correlates of sleep pressure in <italic>Drosophila</italic></data-title><source>Dryad Digital Repository</source><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.5061/dryad.qnk98sfpp</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (R01NS077933 and R21NS131939) and start-up funds provided by the State of New York.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Homeostatic control of deep sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Implications for Discovering Correlates of Sleep Pressure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for the delay in submitting our assessment of your manuscript but we hit some internal setbacks. Your article has now been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Leslie C Griffith (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers were very interested in some aspects of the work, such as the use of the &quot;yoked&quot; protocol for assessing sleep homeostasis and the reevaluation of the 5-min rest as the defining criterion for the sleep state that is now routinely used for <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Nevertheless, they had a number of concerns about the data, methodology, and interpretation. Given these concerns, we are sorry to say that we cannot consider your manuscript for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> at this point. If you feel you can address all the issues raised, you are welcome to submit an extensively revised manuscript, which would be considered a new submission.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>1. For this work to reach its full potential one would have to use a much larger sample base and most importantly make sure to use a wild-type line that behaves as expected when sleep-deprived. This can only be achieved by performing more experiments.</p><p>2. The most straightforward explanation for Figure 1 is that the animals are getting more short sleep bouts with the 220 s trigger.</p><p>3. It is quite notable that the baseline sleep in Figure 1 (night is almost maxed out) and later Figures (night is NOT maxed out) is quite different. This means that in those later experiments, the nighttime rebound can be seen. I think that for many data sets in the literature, this would not be the case- flies sleep a lot at night and some of your experiments are quite atypical.</p><p>4. The argument that yoked controls are better in Figure 2 is really not so clear. You still see no sleep rebound. Did you do this with the 20 or 120 triggers? It would be good to see those data especially since the 220 s trigger is the most likely to be contaminated with micro sleep and the choice to use this trigger time does not seem logical.</p><p>5. Why 24h of deprivation? Seems like this is way too stressful. Most people do not do this and I wonder if some of the failures have to do with this choice.</p><p>6. In Figure 2 almost all the recovery is at night. This will not be seen with fly lines/conditions that max out nighttime sleep. Worth at least a comment.</p><p>7. In other figures, the recovery sleep jumps around. Sometimes it is at night sometimes during the day. This really seems odd to me. I would expect it to be in one or both but consistent?</p><p>8. Should show the undisturbed condition for the 25-min sleep definition. It is like the yoked? Diff from both? This is pretty important. Overall would have liked to see more depth in this aspect of the story. I think long-bout sleep could be really interesting and useful as an alternative paradigm.</p><p>9. Did you look at PWake/PDoze for your data sets? This analysis might help shore up some of the arguments you make about sleep pressure.</p><p>10. To increase the value of this study, I might encourage the authors to extend their MALDI-TOF work to its logical conclusion: what are the molecules that have significantly increased because of sleep pressure? Can they be identified (and replicated)? Do they make sense with regard to other studies of deep sleep function? Also, I might encourage the authors to expand their sleep analyses to short-sleep epochs as well, meaning 1-5min. If &gt;25min inactivity bouts appear to engage 'deep sleep' functions, it is also possible that very short sleep bouts (1-5min), which have always been excluded from analysis in most <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep studies, might engage 'active sleep' functions, which could also be under homeostatic control. While it is commendable that the authors question the 5min sleep criterion (Figure 4B is especially informative in that regard, and a version of this figure might be provided for ALL the deprivation protocols), they still stick to this threshold on the short end of their data. Any immobility over 1min is probably worth investigating, as has been shown by a number of video-based studies now.</p><p>11. A final small correction: in line 108 the authors state that an SWS-like signal was found in flies, ref. 50 and 51. This is incorrect. No SWS-like signal has ever been found during sleep in fly brain activity, so far. In the studies referenced (50 and 51), only a decrease in LFP amplitude was observed. Some recent studies (e.g., Raccuglia et al. 2019 and 2022) have identified ~1Hz oscillatory neural activity in the central brain of sleep-deprived flies, but it is unclear if these flies were sleeping or simply sleep-deprived and awake. To imply that slow wave activity is a prerequisite for 'deep sleep' in any animal is misguided. Deep sleep (or active sleep) should be defined by its functions, not by the peculiar electrophysiology of certain animals, such as the minority of animals endowed with a cortex (or eyeballs).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the revised version of the paper &quot;Homeostatic control of deep sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Implications for Discovering Correlates of Sleep Pressure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The revised version of the manuscript addressed most of the shortcomings originally identified by the reviewers. Nevertheless, they have identified a couple of issues that remain problematic, and which would need to be suitably addressed in order for this solid work to be considered a benchmark study.</p><p>In this study, Chowdhury and co-authors use Ethoscope to re-evaluate key approaches and metrics that have dominated the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep field over the past two decades. The first approach involves mechanical sleep deprivation techniques, where sleep-deprived flies are typically compared to controls that have not been mechanically stimulated. The authors rightly question the appropriateness of such controls, and adapt Ethoscope to provide instead yoked controls that are equally stimulated but can achieve sleep. They find that the yoked control approach yields marginally better sleep rebound data over successive days following the sleep deprivation procedure. They then find that sleep rebound data is significantly improved if only &gt;25min sleep bouts are examined. This suggests that their sleep deprivation protocol specifically impacts longer sleep bouts, rather than shorter sleep bouts defined by the traditional 5-min criterion. They posit that this is because sleep homeostasis in flies (like in mammals) is centered on deep sleep functions, which are more fully engaged during longer sleep bouts. Finally, to support their case in a different way, the authors employ MALDI-TOF (a technique which allows quantifying protein content differences in tissue sections) to show that most of the protein changes incurred during a mechanical sleep deprivation procedure result from mechanical stress rather than sleep pressure. They employ the same three comparisons (unstimulated, yoked controls, sleep deprived) to arrive at this important conclusion. They uncover only 5 proteins in the fly central brain with increased expression due to sleep pressure, a small minority compared to the number of proteins associated with stress alone. The authors make a strong case for the field to re-evaluate the way sleep is being studied in this model, suggesting that many studies examining the homeostatic regulation of sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> might have been confounded by the effects of stress, or by the examining too short sleep epochs.</p><p>The main strength of this study is their clever usage of Ethoscope to better understand sleep homeostasis in the fly model. The application of yoked controls has been a standard in the mammalian sleep field and requires video-based methods linked to individualized feedback in order to apply similar techniques to flies. Everything follows from there: fine-tuning the number of random stimulations, exploring different inactivity durations to call a fly asleep, comparing yoked controls versus unstimulated controls in a variety of scenarios, including MALDI-TOF.

This is an important study, which will benefit the <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep community and inform the broader sleep field. Nevertheless, there remain a couple of issues that still need to be suitably addressed. That being said, this is a nice paper!</p><p>1. The main issue that is unclear is the one presented in L325-328 and Figure 2H-K. It is really not intuitive how this result is possible: no rebound is observed when comparing sleep deprived flies to rested, undisturbed flies. Yet a rebound is observed when comparing SD flies to flies that experienced partial sleep disruption. How could &quot;sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation mask homeostatic sleep responses&quot; as proposed in L327? This conundrum is not appropriately addressed in the discussion.</p><p>2. Figure 2A-D – Please note that using a similar paradigm Geissmann et al. did see SD rebound after 220s SD for 12h (Figure 5). If correct, this discrepancy with the existing literature should be discussed and referred to at ~L605 especially considering the similarity in the methodology used in both studies.</p><p>3. Figures 2 and 3: The red line in Figure 2H is identical to the red lines in Figures 3A and 3B. The blue line in Figure 2H is the same as in Figure 3B. Although this is a rather large dataset (n=82) if the use of the same data is strictly necessary, then it is important to point out in the text and figures that this is the same experimental dataset used in different visualizations and comparisons because the readers may otherwise get an incorrect illusion of reproducibility. We would recommend either putting all these results in the same panel/figure or independently repeating the experiment shown in Figure 3.</p><p>4. Figure 4A. The risk with this kind of analysis is that it does not take into account pre-existing variability. If a 3 day period is to be analyzed after SD, statistically speaking it would be better to include a longer baseline (pre-SD) too. For instance, the focal flies do show a sleep peak ZT12 of the day before SD. Also, for analysis of what is proposed to be sleep depth, we would recommend giving a chance to the Hidden Markov Chain model from the Griffith lab beyond what is done and shown in Supplementary Figure 3.</p><p>5. Figure 5: please mark on the figure what is the day of SD/treatment.</p><p>6. Line 662: &quot;We replicated…&quot;. Does this mean that the MALDI-TOF experiment was an N=1 (one fly brain) for each condition, so 'replicated' means that a second fly was examined per condition? This seems quite thin and might need to be explicitly stated (also in the methods), with some caveats about this being quite a preliminary finding.</p><p>7. Line 576 mentions an unknown molecule. It might nevertheless be interesting to canvass some candidates, especially since this seems to have been replicated.</p><p>8. Line 617 (and elsewhere): It should be emphasized that 1-5min sleep could in principle also be 'deep', especially after sleep deprivation. This is indeed what van Alphen 2013 showed, that after SD flies descended more rapidly into deeper (less arousable) sleep, even within the first 5min. So rebound deep sleep could still be happening within the 220 s deprivation protocol. It might be helpful to discriminate between 'short sleep' which is any 1-5min sleep epoch, and 'active sleep' which can really only be confirmed with additional investigation (e.g., responsiveness, brain recordings). We would recommend that the authors use the term 'short sleep' when discussing &lt;5min sleep bouts, and 'active sleep' only as an interpretation of one of the kinds of sleep likely to occur during short sleep bouts, especially in non sleep-deprived flies.</p><p>9. The point of Supplementary Figure 2 is a little hard to follow. Sleep-deprived flies are more active at night compared to controls, but not when yoked. This might need some clarifying, as it's somewhat unexpected and refers to a separate issue from the one being discussed at this point in the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91355.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>1. For this work to reach its full potential one would have to use a much larger sample base and most importantly make sure to use a wild-type line that behaves as expected when sleep-deprived. This can only be achieved by performing more experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we have expanded our analysis of sleep rebound following mechanical deprivation using the widely used vortexer method and have replicated sleep homeostasis experiments using the standard 20s frequency across a range of deprivation durations and show that our wild-type flies behave as described in previous work. In addition, we have extended our deprivation experiments to include one of the most commonly used genetic backgrounds to confirm that we see patterns of sleep rebound in this strain that are similar to the ones reported for our wild-type strain. Thus, we have shown that our surprising results with 220s inactivity triggers, which produce the same level of sleep deprivation as the 20s triggers, are not due to an idiosyncrasy with our wild-type strain. This expanded analysis strengthens our conclusion that, when using standard methods, behavior following sleep deprivation tracks mechanical perturbation rather than sleep pressure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The most straightforward explanation for Figure 1 is that the animals are getting more short sleep bouts with the 220 s trigger.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this alternative explanation, we have examined short, “active” sleep bouts (inactivity lasting between one and five minutes) following our sleep homeostasis experiments. It is indeed true that flies sneak in short sleep bouts during the 220s deprivation window. This, therefore, does raises the possibility that flies are not accruing sufficient sleep pressure to show rebound post sleep deprivation, which we now acknowledge in the text. Remarkably, we find such increases in active sleep even when using 20-s trigger frequencies for mechanical deprivation, a condition that does result in rebound:</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91355-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our subsequent experiments in which we deprive flies of only long bout sleep (22-min trigger frequency) and find significant multi-cycle long bout rebound is strong evidence that long-bout sleep is potently controlled by homoestatic mechanisms (also discussed in the updated text). This has not been previously shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is quite notable that the baseline sleep in Figure 1 (night is almost maxed out) and later Figures (night is NOT maxed out) is quite different. This means that in those later experiments, the nighttime rebound can be seen. I think that for many data sets in the literature, this would not be the case- flies sleep a lot at night and some of your experiments are quite atypical.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we could have been clearer for the reasons behind this striking discrepancy across experiments, which are due to the use of different methods to record behavior (video versus beam crossing) and a turn to the examination of long-bout sleep (inactivity durations of 25 minutes or more rather than 5 minutes or more). In our revised manuscript we describe this more clearly and provide the reasons for these discrepancies. It is important to note that, when using video analysis or multi-beam DAM recordings, flies do not max out on the amount of night-time sleep. We are therefore confident that our results are not atypical to laboratory conditions or fly strains but reflect the true nature of night-time sleep.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The argument that yoked controls are better in Figure 2 is really not so clear. You still see no sleep rebound. Did you do this with the 20 or 120 triggers? It would be good to see those data especially since the 220 s trigger is the most likely to be contaminated with micro sleep and the choice to use this trigger time does not seem logical.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided a clearer rational for using the 220s trigger in our revised manuscript. As described in our response to concern number two above, we do find increased microsleep during the deprivation window as pointed out by the reviewer. However, our subsequent experiments and analyses show that the homeostatic aspects of sleep rebound are captured most sensitively by long bouts of sleep, and establish robust homeostatic rebound in long, deep sleep rebounds, despite the presence of brief instances of inactivity during deprivation using 220-s inactivity triggers. Furthermore, 220s inactivity triggers were chosen to prevent the attainment of the sleep state as currently defined (widely accepted as inactivity of 5-min or more for over 20 years) in our focal flies while allowing for substantial sleep in our yoked controls. Shorter inactivity triggers would not have allowed our yoked flies to sleep much at all, thereby obviating their u9lity. We have made this fact clearer in the new manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Why 24h of deprivation? Seems like this is way too stressful. Most people do not do this and I wonder if some of the failures have to do with this choice.</p></disp-quote><p>The 24h duration of sleep deprivation was chosen to avoid circadian confounds and to examine sleep homeostasis under conditions more akin to those used in mammalian studies. It is true that most inves9gators of <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep have se;led on shorter (12h, 6h, or 4h) durations of deprivation. However, 24h deprivation has been used in the fly previously (e.g., Huber et al. 2004 Sleep Vol. 27, p. 628; Geissman et al. 2019 Sci. Adv. Vol. 5, eaau9253). Applying mechanical stimuli at specific times within the circadian cycle is expected to reset the circadian clock (e.g., Simoni et al. 2014 Science Vol. 343, p. 525). Given the clock’s strong influence on sleep, this represents an additional confound of mechanical sleep deprivation. We therefore opted to deliver mechanical stimuli for deprivation across the en9re diurnal cycle to avoid the circadian phase responses that would be expected from stimuli delivered at specific times within the cycle. Though 24h of deprivation is not commonly used in the fly field, the loss of one day’s sleep is not an extraordinary amount of sleep deprivation in the context of the wider field of sleep science. Human subjects have been routinely kept awake for significantly longer than 24h and a large number of studies have deprived mammalian model systems of full cycles of sleep. Furthermore, previous work using the ethoscope system has established that flies can be deprived of sleep for up to at least 40 days without a significant increase in mortality, which would not be expected if flies were being subjected to overwhelming stress.</p><p>However, as described above, we have expanded our analysis to include shorter durations of deprivation. In doing so, we find that, when using standard approaches to sleep deprivation and the quantification of rebound, 24h of sleep deprivation on the vortexer fails to produce substantially larger rebounds than 12h or 6h deprivation. This further supports our contention that standard methods in the field do not offer a sensitive means of detecting <italic>bona fide</italic> sleep rebound, as longer durations of deprivation produce greater amounts of sleep loss and should therefore produce larger homeostatic rebounds. This is clearly not the case using the most widespread approach to sleep homeostasis in the fly and calls for a reexamination of the methods employed by the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 2 almost all the recovery is at night. This will not be seen with fly lines/conditions that max out nighttime sleep. Worth at least a comment.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in our response to concern three above, sleep measurements using the ethoscope do not display maxed-out sleep the way that single-beam crossing data do. This is due to the overestimation of inactivity and sleep produced by the single-beam monitoring provided by the Trikinetics DAM system (see Geissman et al. 2019 Sci. Adv. Vol. 5, eaau9253), rather than due to idiosyncrasies of our flies or environmental conditions. We have made this point clearer in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In other figures, the recovery sleep jumps around.

I would expect it to be in one or both but consistent?</p></disp-quote><p>We are struck by this too and note that the picture becomes much more consistent when analysis is focused on long-bout sleep, which displays homeostatic increases in both daytime and – sleep (compared to yoked controls) across several diurnal cycles. Thus, by examining longer, deeper sleep and controlling for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical deprivation, we observe a much simpler response to deprivation, in which sleep is increased at all times of the day during which normal sleep occurs and across several days following deprivation. We think that this provides further evidence for the u9lity and power of our new approach. We have revised our manuscript to make this point clear to the reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Should show the undisturbed condition for the 25-min sleep definition.

To increase the value of this study, I might encourage the authors to extend their MALDI-TOF work to its logical conclusion: what are the molecules that have significantly increased because of sleep pressure?

Also, I might encourage the authors to expand their sleep analyses to short-sleep epochs as well, meaning 1-5min. If &gt;25min inactivity bouts appear to engage 'deep sleep' functions, it is also possible that very short sleep bouts (1-5min), which have always been excluded from analysis in most <italic>Drosophila</italic> sleep studies, might engage 'active sleep' functions, which could also be under homeostatic control.

Any immobility over 1min is probably worth investigating, as has been shown by a number of video-based studies now.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replicated our unbiased screen for molecular correlates of sleep pressure and show that serotonin, a biogenic amine that has long been implicated as a sleep promoting substance in both mammalian and fly brains, meets the criteria for a sleep substance within the central brain of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

We think that this result will be of major interest to the field and will be the basis of a great deal of future work. While we find the reviewer’s comments regarding our re-evaluation of sleep definition in the fly encouraging, we must reiterate that although we agree ‘active sleep’ likely represents a discrete sleep stage in the fly that is likely relevant to sleep homeostasis, it would not be possible to examine it with yoked controls simply owing to the logistical issues associated with yoking (i.e., the frequency of simulation necessary to prevent it; see figure above) would make it impossible for yoked controls to get enough sleep to serve as meaningful controls for mechanical stimulation.

The main issue that is unclear is the one presented in L325-328 and Figure 2H-K. It is really not intuitive how this result is possible: no rebound is observed when comparing sleep deprived flies to rested, undisturbed flies. Yet a rebound is observed when comparing SD flies to flies that experienced partial sleep disruption. How could &quot;sleep-independent effects of mechanical perturbation mask homeostatic sleep responses&quot; as proposed in L327? This conundrum is not appropriately addressed in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers here have identified the paradoxical nature of fly sleep deprivation studies that we think deserves serious attention within the field. It is indeed surprising (and troubling), that sleep deprived flies often do not display easily detectable sleep rebound when compared to undisturbed flies. This is particularly clear when flies are deprived of sleep for a full 24-h cycle (Figure 1). We believe that this absence of rebound is related to the relatively small rebounds that are measured using the standard approaches in the field. We agree that this produces a conundrum for the field that must be addressed. We contend that identifying this conundrum is one of the important contributions of our study. Even without a full answer to this conundrum our results show that the standard practice of attributing any behavioral/molecular differences observed between frequently perturbed flies to unperturbed flies to differences in sleep pressure alone is problematic and seriously confounded. Sleep-independent effects of any method of deprivation are likely multifactorial. The utility of the yoked control paradigm introduced by Rechtschaffen is that these effects do not need to be completely understood in order to be accounted for. Though it is not within the scope of our study to completely account for the sleep-independent effects of mechanical deprivation, we suggest a partial explanation: the depriving stimuli itself causes increases in locomotor activity in deprived flies that likely antagonize the increased drive to sleep in deprived flies (Supplementary Figure 2), which is related to comment 9 below. We have expanded this point further in lines 331-335, 338-339, 340-341, and 609-615.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Also, for analysis of what is proposed to be sleep depth, we would recommend giving a chance to the Hidden Markov Chain model from the Griffith lab beyond what is done and shown in Supplementary Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that accounting for variability in baseline sleep, may have revealed small amounts of rebound that our approach did not. However, we do not think that this would have fundamentally changed the major results of our study. For example, the relatively large rebounds we measure when accounting for the effects of mechanical deprivation (through yoked controls) and focusing analysis on longer bouts of sleep (by changing inactivity criterion for sleep) would still be striking contrast with the small amounts of rebound typically observed only within short windows following deprivation. Likewise, the inclusion of more baseline days may have changed the magnitudes of our measured rebounds, but having the deprivation occur several days into behavioral recording would introduce an additional difference between our study and most previous studies, i.e., the age of flies during sleep deprivation, which would have made it challenging for us to compare our results to previous studies. We would also like to stress that although the focal flies seem to have higher sleep at a time point just after ZT12 before sleep deprivation, the total amount of sleep over a period of 24-h is not statistically significantly different between treatments.</p><p>We claim that the sleep pressure of individual flies, persists for at least three cycles post sleep deprivation. According to Wiggin et al., 2020 p(Doze) is considered a measure of sleep pressure, which is precisely why that was quantified to make our case. Importantly, the authors of the paper write, “These hidden [Markov] states have a predictable relationship with P(Doze) and P(Wake), suggesting that the methods capture the same behaviors.” The authors go on to also write, “Overall, the HMM approach recapitulates the results of the P(Wake)- and P(Doze)-based analysis with the benefit of allowing decoding of behavior into discrete categories that may be tied to different circuit configurations or balances between circuits.” Moreover, there is no established association between the different hidden sleep stages and length of sleep bouts. Therefore, we think that although useful and strong as a method, the addition of HMM analyses to our dataset would not change the major results/conclusions of our study and would take us significant time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Line 662: &quot;We replicated…&quot;. Does this mean that the MALDI-TOF experiment was an N=1 (one fly brain) for each condition, so 'replicated' means that a second fly was examined per condition?

Line 617 (and elsewhere): It should be emphasized that 1-5min sleep could in principle also be 'deep', especially after sleep deprivation. This is indeed what van Alphen 2013 showed, that after SD flies descended more rapidly into deeper (less arousable) sleep, even within the first 5min. So rebound deep sleep could still be happening within the 220 s deprivation protocol. It might be helpful to discriminate between 'short sleep' which is any 1-5min sleep epoch, and 'active sleep' which can really only be confirmed with additional investigation (e.g., responsiveness, brain recordings). We would recommend that the authors use the term 'short sleep' when discussing &lt;5min sleep bouts, and 'active sleep' only as an interpretation of one of the kinds of sleep likely to occur during short sleep bouts, especially in non sleep-deprived flies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed “active sleep” to “short-sleep” bouts when describing data in the revised manuscript. We now refer to “active sleep” only when discussing the work of Anthony et al., 2023.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The point of Supplementary Figure 2 is a little hard to follow. Sleep-deprived flies are more active at night compared to controls, but not when yoked. This might need some clarifying, as it's somewhat unexpected and refers to a separate issue from the one being discussed at this point in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>These data were included in our revised manuscript to address the issues raised in point one above. Mechanical perturbation causes an increase in locomotor activity in mechanically deprived flies compared to unperturbed controls. This would be expected to mask, at least partially, the increased sleep drive expected of deprived flies. Please see our response to comment 1 above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
