In about 200 metabolic reactions ATP is not used as a phosphorylating but as an adenylating reagent leading to the release of inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). Most prominently, the biosynthesis of many macromolecules including DNA, RNA, proteins and polysaccharides releases large amounts of PPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferjani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heinonen, 2001</xref>). Given the substantial free energy of PPi, the efficient biosynthesis of macromolecules requires that PPi is immediately destroyed to prevent the respective back-reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kornberg, 1962</xref>). In all eukaryotes PPi is hydrolysed by soluble inorganic pyrophosphatases (sPPase; EC 3.6.1.1) in a highly exergonic reaction. Loss of sPPase function causes lethality in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lundin et al., 1991</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ko et al., 2007</xref>) presumably due to accumulation of PPi inhibiting the biosynthesis of macromolecules. Arabidopsis encodes six sPPase-paralogs (PPa1-PPa6) of which only PPa6 is localized in plastids whereas all others are cytosolic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gutiérrez-Luna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segami et al., 2018</xref>). However, their PPase activity is rather low and even the loss of the four ubiquitously expressed isoforms does not cause visible phenotypic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segami et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> sPPase severely affects plant growth via alterations in carbon partitioning between source and sink organs caused by the inhibition of several plant enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism that use PPi as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geigenberger et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sonnewald, 1992</xref>). Importantly, in addition to soluble PPases, plants contain membrane-bound proton-pumping pyrophosphatases (H<sup>+</sup>-PPase) at the tonoplast and in the Golgi that convert the energy otherwise released as heat into a proton-gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeshima, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Segami et al., 2010</xref>). Mutants lacking the tonoplast H<sup>+</sup>-PPase AVP1 (Arabidopsis vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-PPase) were identified based on their compensatory cell enlargement phenotype and were thus named <italic>fugu5</italic> (after the japanese term for the pufferfish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref>). The fact that the <italic>fugu5</italic> phenotype could be rescued either by growth in the presence of exogenous sucrose or the expression of the yeast sPPase IPP1 showed clearly that altered PPi levels and not reduced H<sup>+</sup>-pumping are causative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asaoka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, vacuolar pH is only mildly affected in <italic>fugu5</italic> mutants indicating that the H<sup>+</sup>-pumping ATPase (V-ATPase) present at the tonoplast is largely sufficient for vacuolar acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kriegel et al., 2015</xref>). However, loss of both vacuolar proton-pumps leads to a much more severe phenotype and defect in vacuolar acidification than loss of the tonoplast V-ATPase alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kriegel et al., 2015</xref>). It has indeed been discussed that AVP1 serves as a backup system for the V-ATPase in particular under ATP-limiting conditions like anoxia or cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maeshima, 2000</xref>). During cold acclimation plants accumulate cryoprotectants including sugars in their vacuoles and activity of both proton-pumps is upregulated leading to improved freezing tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulze et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomashow, 1999</xref>). Overexpression of AVP1 has been shown to cause increased plant growth under various abiotic stress conditions including salinity, drought and phosphate starvation but the underlying mechanism remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gaxiola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schilling et al., 2017</xref>). Attachment of the small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO to substrate proteins plays a central role in the response to a broad set of stress responses including the ones affected by AVP1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro et al., 2012</xref>). Modification of target proteins by SUMO-conjugation proceeds via a three-step mechanism. First the SUMO moiety is adenylated and then bound via a high-energy thioester linkage to the heterodimeric SUMO-activating enzyme (E1) leading to the release of PPi. Next, the activated SUMO is transferred to the SUMO-conjugating enzyme E2 and finally, assisted by SUMO-protein ligase (E3), donated to a large set of substrate proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flotho and Melchior, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson, 2004</xref>). In Arabidopsis, the key transcriptional regulator of the cold response Inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1) as well as the Heat shock factor A2 (HSFA2) have been shown to be positively regulated by SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen-Peer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miura et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we report that AVP1 contributes to both cold acclimation and heat tolerance and we show that the rapid increase in SUMOylation common to both stress responses is missing in the absence of AVP1. Furthermore, we provide evidence that accumulation of PPi in plants, yeast and mammals inhibits the SUMO E1 activating enzyme in turn affecting the fate, localization or function of a large number of proteins during cellular stress responses. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the beneficial effects of AVP1 overexpression in plants and highlight PPi as an important integrator of metabolism and stress tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lack of V-PPase activity impairs cold acclimation</title><p>We have shown previously that upregulation of ATP-hydrolysis by the V-ATPase during cold acclimation depends on the presence and the activity of the V-PPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kriegel et al., 2015</xref>). To complete the data-set for vacuolar proton-pump activity during cold acclimation, we performed parallel measurements of ATP- and PPi- hydrolysis, H<sup>+</sup>-pumping as well as cell sap pH in wild-type (Col-0), the <italic>fugu5-1</italic> mutant and a <italic>UBQ:AVP1</italic> overexpression line. Both ATP- and PPi-dependent proton-pumping are increased in wild-type (wt) and <italic>UBQ:AVP1</italic> during cold-acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). As expected PPi-dependent proton-pumping was undetectable in <italic>fugu5-1,</italic> but ATP-dependent proton-pumping was also reduced in <italic>fugu5-1</italic> compared to wt and increased only marginally upon cold-acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As a consequence of cold-induced proton-pump stimulation, vacuolar pH drops by 0.1 pH-units in wt and <italic>UBQ:AVP1</italic> but not in <italic>fugu5-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the seedling phenotype of <italic>fugu5-1</italic> is rescued by expression of the yeast soluble PPase IPP1 under control of the AVP1-promoter during the seedling stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref>), the adult growth phenotype of plants grown in short day was not rescued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>We thus asked if constitutive overexpression of an Arabidopsis sPPase would be able to fully rescue the <italic>fugu5</italic> phenotype. Among four broadly expressed Arabidopsis sPPase genes we chose <italic>PPa5</italic> and expressed its coding sequence fused to GFP under the control of the UBQ10-promoter in both wt and <italic>fugu5-1</italic>. In the resulting transgenic lines PPa5-GFP was located in the cytosol as well as in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and the seedling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) as well as the adult phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>+E) of <italic>fugu5-1</italic> were fully rescued. For further analysis, we chose two lines in the wt and in the <italic>fugu5-1</italic> background with comparable increased total soluble pyrophosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Interestingly, PPa5-GFP accumulated to much higher levels in <italic>fugu5-1</italic> than in wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G</xref>) indicating that the <italic>fugu5-1</italic> mutation influences either protein stability or transcript levels of PPa5-GFP.</p><p>We next asked if cold-acclimation is affected in <italic>fugu5-1</italic> and if so, whether this could be rescued by overexpression of a soluble pyrophosphatase. Both survival rate and ion release as a measure of freezing tolerance was comparable in all genotypes exposed to freezing without prior cold acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>A + B). Cold acclimation via exposure to 4°C for 4 days significantly improved freezing tolerance in wt to a much higher extent than in <italic>fugu5-1</italic> plants and expression of PPa5 fully rescued the hypersensitivity to cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, mutants lacking one or several sPPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segami et al., 2018</xref>) are less freezing tolerant prior to cold exposure but respond like wt after cold-acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44213.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PP<sub>i</sub> hydrolysis is required to rescue the freezing sensitive phenotype of <italic>fugu5-1</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>B</bold>) Freezing tolerance assay.

We have shown previously that the increased activity of the V-ATPase during cold acclimation is largely dependent on the presence of the V-PPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kriegel et al., 2015</xref>). During cold acclimation <italic>fugu5</italic> mutants thus should not be able to adjust their tonoplast proton-pumping activity to the increased demand caused by the accumulation of soluble sugars, organic acids and other osmoprotectants in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schulze et al., 2012</xref>). We show here that lack of the V-PPase indeed limits cold acclimation severely. However complementation by overexpression of the soluble pyrophosphatase PPa5 shows clearly that this phenotype is not caused by a reduced proton-gradient limiting cold-induced accumulation of solutes in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Accumulation of PPi has been shown to be causative for the developmental phenotype of <italic>fugu5</italic> seedlings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferjani et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref>) and our results show that this also applies to the freezing tolerance and heat stress phenotypes caused by the lack of AVP1 that we report here for the first time. Although overexpression of AVP1 has been shown to result in increased stress tolerance and yield in multiple crop plants, reduced stress tolerance of <italic>fugu5</italic> mutants has so far not been reported. The fact that the seedling phenotype observable during the heterotrophic phase of <italic>fugu5</italic> seedlings could be rescued by supply of exogenous sucrose pointed to an inhibition of gluconeogenesis. The Glc1P/UDP-Glc reaction is reversible and it has been shown that UGP-Glc pyrophosphorylase is a major target of PPi-inhibition during seedling establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferjani et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, PPi accumulation could inhibit sugar accumulation during cold acclimation but the fact that the early transcriptional response to cold is dampened in the <italic>fugu5</italic> mutant is not easily explained solely by a shift in sugar metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gutiérrez-Luna et al., 2018</xref>). PPi is not only released by many anabolic reactions but also by E1 enzymes that initiate the attachment of ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) including SUMO. Activation of UBLs requires ATP and occurs via carboxy-terminal adenylation and thiol transfer leading to the release of AMP and PPi and would thus be prone to inhibition by PPi accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Desterro et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schulman and Harper, 2009</xref>). The MYC-like bHLH transcriptional activator ICE1 is subject to ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis under ambient temperature that is counteracted by SUMOylation during the cold response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miura and Hasegawa, 2008</xref>). We have shown here that the compromised cold acclimation of <italic>fugu5</italic> is likely caused by the failure to stabilize ICE1 and that the overall levels of SUMO-conjugates that rapidly increase upon cold exposure in the wild-type fail to increase in <italic>fugu5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). It remains to be determined if accumulation of PPi has a similar effect on ubiquitination. However, reduced ubiquitination would stabilize ICE1 and would result in increased cold tolerance. As we cannot exclude that the altered sugar metabolism of <italic>fugu5</italic> directly contributes to freezing tolerance or indirectly impinges SUMOylation during cold acclimation, we extended our analysis to the heat stress response. The rapid and reversible accumulation of SUMO conjugates is one of the fastest molecular responses observed during heat stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kurepa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rytz et al., 2018</xref>). The fact that this response is dampened in both plants and yeast when PPi accumulates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) argues strongly against a secondary metabolic effect. Evidence for a direct inhibitory effect of PPi on SUMOylation was obtained in an <italic>in vitro</italic> FRET-based assay that allowed us to determine that the SUMOylation of RanGAP catalysed by human E1 and E2 enzymes was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of PPi following a mixed mode of inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that PPi could inhibit the action of the E2 enzyme, the reaction catalysed by the heterodimeric E1 activating enzyme releases PPi and is thus most likely inhibited when PPi accumulates. Indeed, we could show that E1 subunit SAE2 ~SUMO thioester formation is inhibited in the presence of micromolar PPi, raising the question how exactly PPi inhibits E1-activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>For adenylation of the SUMO C-terminus to occur, the E1 enzyme adopts an open conformation that allows binding of ATP. In this conformation, the catalytic cysteine of E1 is too far away and unavailable to become linked to SUMO. Thioester bond formation between E1 and SUMO requires structural remodelling to a closed conformation in which the catalytic cysteine moves adjacent to the C terminus of SUMO ~AMP, via unfolding of structures associated with ATP binding and SUMO adenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lois and Lima, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>). It has been suggested that active site remodelling pushes the E1 reaction forward by promoting the release of pyrophosphate to prevent the reverse reaction, the attack of the adenylate by pyrophosphate leading to the reformation of ATP. Not only is the adenylation step rate limiting, once the thioester bond is formed and AMP is released, E1 switches back to the open conformation and a second adenylation reaction occurs, resulting in the formation of a ternary complex, with an E1 molecule binding to one SUMO molecule at the adenylation active site and to a second via a thioester bond through the catalytic cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>). As E1 enzymes are potential targets for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases understanding their enzymatic activity as well as inhibitory mechanisms at the atomic level may provide leads for the development of novel drugs. A novel allosteric inhibitor that targets a cryptic pocket distinct from the active site and locks the enzyme in a previously unobserved inactive conformation has recently been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lv et al., 2018</xref>) and it will be of great interest to determine how accumulation off PPi affects the conformation of E1.</p><p>Although the exact mechanism remains to be determined, the fact that E1 activity is classically measured as ATP:PPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haas et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haas and Rose, 1982</xref>) exchange clearly reflects that inhibition of E1 enzymes by PPi is not novel per se. Although cytosolic PPi concentrations reported in the literature, in particular for plants, strongly suggest that relevant concentrations occur not only in mutant backgrounds or under stress conditions the relevance of inhibition by PPi <italic>in vivo</italic> has so far not been addressed. Cytosolic PPi concentrations of 0.2–0.3 mM as reported for spinach leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Weiner et al., 1987</xref>) would clearly not be compatible with E1 activity suggesting that PPi levels are maintained at substantially lower levels at least in the immediate environment of E1 enzymes. Many nuclear proteins are modified by SUMOylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rytz et al., 2018</xref>) and the SUMO conjugation complex self-assembles into nuclear bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazur et al., 2019</xref>). Information regarding the nuclear concentration of PPi is lacking, but the fact that DNA and RNA synthesis occurs against such high concentrations of PPi argues not only that soluble pyrophosphatases play an important role in the nucleus but could also suggest that nuclear PPase activity is higher than in the cytosol. However, the fact that a quadruple knockout mutant lacking four of five PPa-isoforms showed no obvious growth phenotype whereas the combined loss of the H<sup>+</sup>-PPase AVP1 and a single PPa-isoform causes severe dwarfism due to high PPi concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segami et al., 2018</xref>) shows clearly that cytosolic and nuclear pools of PPi are controlled by the combined action of s PPase and H<sup>+</sup>-PPase.</p><p>At least for plants, converting the substantial energy present in PPi into a proton-gradient seems preferable to releasing it as heat and the soluble PPases might thus only function as emergency valves. But is accumulation of PPi to inhibitory levels only occurring in mutant backgrounds or is there evidence that it is actively prevented under stress conditions in the wild-type? The fact that four PPa-isoforms are transcriptionally up-regulated during the first six hours of the cold acclimation response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) indicates that control of PPi levels is an integral part of the cold stress response and it remains to be determined if this is also true for other responses in particular for heat stress. Constitutive overexpression of AVP1 has been shown to cause increased growth of diverse crop plants under various abiotic stress conditions. Greater vacuolar ion sequestration, increased auxin transport, enhanced heterotrophic growth, and increased source to sink transport of sucrose have all been proposed to explain individual aspects of the phenotypes observed in plants lacking or over-expressing AVP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pasapula et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schilling et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we propose modulation of SUMOylation by cellular pyrophosphate levels as a unifying hypothesis that might explain both, the stress-related as well as the developmental aspects of the multifaceted AVP1 loss- and gain-of function phenotypes. Although our hypothesis needs further experimental validation in particular regarding the developmental phenotypes, it seems obvious that a combination of tissue-specific and inducible expression of PPi-hydrolysing enzymes might turn out to be an efficient way of generating stress-tolerant crops for the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtAVP1</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT1G15690</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtPPa1</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT1G01050</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtPPa2</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT2G18230</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtPPa4</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT3G53620</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtPPa5</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT4G01480</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtSUMO1</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT4G26840</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtICE1</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT3G26744</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtSAE1</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT4G24940</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>AtSAE2</italic></td><td/><td>TAIR: AT2G21470</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene <break/>(<italic>Saccharomices</italic> <break/> <italic>cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td><italic>ScIPP1</italic></td><td/><td>SGD: YBR011C</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>Agrobacterium</italic> <break/> <italic>tumefaciens</italic>)</td><td>ASE</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lampropoulos et al., 2013</xref></td><td/><td>pSOUP<sup>+</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Saccharomices <break/>cerevisiae)</td><td>W303</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Szoradi et al., 2018</xref></td><td>SSY122</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain <break/>background <break/>(Saccharomices <break/>cerevisiae)</td><td>IPP1prΔ::HIS3- <break/>GAL1pr-HA-IPP1</td><td>this paper</td><td>SSY2542</td><td>Sebastian Schuck lab</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>fugu5-1</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>fugu5-3</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferjani et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>ice1-2</italic></td><td>Nottingham Arabidopsis <break/>Stock Centre (NASC)</td><td>SALK_003155</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>)</td><td><italic>ppa1</italic></td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Segami et al., 2018</xref>;

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Pyrophosphate modulates stress responses via SUMOylation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>You demonstrate that the <italic>fugu5</italic> mutant, which lacks the major H<sup>+</sup>-PPase isoform AVP1, is cold- and heat stress sensitive, which is accompanied by a reduction of SUMOylation. Increasing pyrophosphate inhibits SUMO, activating E1 enzymes to interfere with SUMOylation. The finding that “AVP1/FUGU5 (PPase activity coupled to proton-transport into the vacuole) controls PPi homeostasis in Arabidopsis and that this activity is essential to allow the massive global SUMOylation response to occur after e.g. heat stress (40C) and cold stress” is a key new finding with high impact. The data clearly demonstrate the relevance of PPi homeostasis in eukaryotes for the Ubl system (E1-based activation of Ub, SUMO, Nedd8/Rub1). Overall, the data presented reveal that PPi levels are well controlled in wild-type Arabidopsis plants by AVP1 (and possibly cytosolic PPases), and loss of AVP1 activity due to a genetic mutation has pleiotropic effects on heat stress and cold signaling, very likely due to inhibition of the SUMO E1 heterodimer (a pleiotropic effect due to loss of PPase activity).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Title: The title should include &quot;<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>&quot; (or plants).</p><p>Main concerns:</p><p>For the following items, additional experiments/analyses are required:</p><p>1) Figure 1B-C: please provide appropriate statistical tests with p-values to show (in Figure 1B) that the leaf numbers analyzed give a sound difference between Col-0 and <italic>fugu5-1</italic> after cold-acclimation (chi-square test?). The percentage given does not show that the population is large enough to conclude that the difference seen is significant.</p><p>2) Provide AVP1 gene expression data in response to cold/heat/salt (using the RNA samples of Figure 2A). Data/information on AVP1 gene expression in response to cold/heat/salt stress was deemed essential to address the following points:</p><p>&quot;The authors argue that gene expression of the PPase genes is dynamically controlled in response to cold (subsection “PPi controls cold-acclimation via SUMOylation”, first paragraph, Figure 2A), but in the Introduction the authors refer to work by Segami et al. (2018) that revealed that the quadruple mutant <italic>ppa1 ppa2 ppa4 ppa5</italic> does not display a major phenotype: This suggests that the gene expression of these PPa genes has nothing to do with keeping the [PPi]cyto low and rather PPi levels are primarily controlled by AVP1. The dynamic response of PPase genes to cold is thus a weak argument for 'control' and not substantiated by phenotypic data on these 4 genes (see the aforementioned paragraph).&quot;</p><p>3) Provide evidence that the <italic>fugu5-1</italic> mutation impacts the gene expression pattern of the PPa1/2/4/5 genes in response to cold (using the RNA samples of Figure 2B and 2C). This would reveal whether the gene expression pattern of these four genes in response to cold is altered in the Fugu5 mutant and if their gene expression is thus impacted by the increased PPi levels in the <italic>fuga5-1</italic> mutant at 22C/4C. The presented increase in the PPi levels in the <italic>fugu5</italic> mutation (Figure 1G) suggests that induction of these PPa genes does not occur as a compensatory mechanism of a rise of the PPi levels due to the <italic>fugu5</italic> mutation.</p><p>The following points are unclear and should be revised in the text/figures. Although some of these excerpted reviewer statements include experiments, it is the authors’ discretion as to whether to do the experiments, or to modify the text. An explanation of the resolution should be included in the response to reviewers.</p><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, authors provide data about pyrophosphatase activity. The activity in <italic>fugu5</italic> was similar to that in Col-0. According to Figure 1—figure supplement 1, V-PPase activity in <italic>fugu5</italic> was reduced. How is V-PPase activity in <italic>fugu5</italic> expression UBQ:PP5a-GFP? And why did authors use UBQ:PP5a-GFP, instead of UBQ:AVP1? More clear information is required.</p><p>5) Please provide a brief argument/observation on why the PPa5-GFP protein levels are much higher in the <italic>fugu5-1</italic> mutant (#6, #8) than in the wt plants (Col-0, #8, #10) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2F, subsection “Lack of V-PPase activity impairs cold acclimation”, second paragraph). Apparently, the <italic>fugu5</italic> mutation stabilizes the PPa5 protein levels, which is relevant as it suggests that increased [PPi] levels in the cytosol/nucleus promotes the protein stability of PPa5 (reduced PPa5 turnover?). A similar thing might be happening with the native PPa proteins (so the regulation is at PPa gene as well as at the PPa protein level?). Are the transgene expression levels comparable in the 4 transgenic lines (RT-qPCR for GFP amplicon and/or PPa5 amplicon)? At the same time, Figure 1G suggests that the soluble PPase enzymatic activity does not differ between the Col-0 and <italic>fugu5-1</italic> backgrounds (all 4 transgenic lines belong all to group 'b'). Does this comparable soluble PPase activity signify that the PPa5-GFP chimera is partially inactive in a <italic>fugu5-1</italic> background for an unknown reason?</p><p>6) In Figure 1B and 1C, statistical analyses are required. And freezing tolerance of UBQ:AVP1 seems to be increased, compared to Col-0, but why is freezing tolerance of UBQ:PPa5/Col-0 similar to that of Col-0? If PPi hydrolysis is important, UBQ:PPa5/Col-0 may exhibit tolerance to freezing.</p><p>7) According to Figure 2A, there are at least 4 sPPase. But why did authors use PPa5 for overexpression? How about overexpression of other sPPase in <italic>fugu5</italic>? Do other sPPase rescue cold sensitivity of <italic>fugu5</italic>?</p><p>8) According to phenotype and SUMOylation assay (Figure 1 and 4), PPi level looks important to regulate SUMOylation and phenotype. Thus, how do plants exhibit when PPi is applied by a foliar spray? Application of PPi by a foliar spray to Col-0 interferes SUMOylation and decrease tolerance to freezing and heat stresses, right? Check phenotype and SUMOylation after application of PPi to Col-0.</p><p>9) A potential weak point is that other processes that might be inhibited by PPi may contribute to the physiologic phenotypes (cold stress tolerance etc.). The authors discuss formation of UDP-glucose as one process that may not contribute to the observed phenotypes. However, the Discussion should give more room to the possibility of contribution of other processes not considered or investigated in the manuscript. In particular, ubiquitin activation uses an enzyme similar to SAE, which might also be inhibitable by PPi. Ubiquitin conjugation almost certainly contributes to stress responses, as well.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44213.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Title: The title should include &quot;Arabidopsis thaliana&quot; (or plants).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to “Pyrophosphate modulates plant stress responses via SUMOylation”.

We hope that our Abstract along with the keywords are sufficient to get attention from non-plant researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main concerns:</p><p>For the following items, additional experiments/analyses are required:</p><p>1) Figure 1B-C: please provide appropriate statistical tests with p-values to show (in Figure 1B) that the leaf numbers analyzed give a sound difference between Col-0 and fugu5-1 after cold-acclimation (chi-square test?). The percentage given does not show that the population is large enough to conclude that the difference seen is significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical analysis has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide AVP1 gene expression data in response to cold/heat/salt (using the RNA samples of Figure 2A). Data/information on AVP1 gene expression in response to cold/heat/salt stress was deemed essential to address the following points:</p><p>&quot;The authors argue that gene expression of the PPase genes is dynamically controlled in response to cold (subsection “PPi controls cold-acclimation via SUMOylation”, first paragraph, Figure 2A), but in the Introduction the authors refer to work by Segami et al. (2018) that revealed that the quadruple mutant ppa1 ppa2 ppa4 ppa5 does not display a major phenotype: This suggests that the gene expression of these PPa genes has nothing to do with keeping the [PPi]cyto low and rather PPi levels are primarily controlled by AVP1. The dynamic response of PPase genes to cold is thus a weak argument for 'control' and not substantiated by phenotypic data on these 4 genes (see the aforementioned paragraph).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the dynamic response of sPPase genes to cold alone is not a strong argument for control and have thus included additional data to strengthen our conclusion. The quadruple mutant <italic>ppa1 ppa2 ppa4 ppa5</italic> does indeed not display a major growth phenotype, however in the newly added Figure 1—figure supplement 3 we show that prior to cold acclimation it is less freezing tolerant than the wildtype. The fact that V-PPase activity has been shown to increase during cold acclimation (Schulze et al., Kriegel et al.) can explain that after acclimation freezing tolerance of the quadruple sPPase mutant is comparable to wt. In addition, we have included qRT-data for AVP1 in the revised Figure 2 showing that the cold-induced increase of AVP1 activity is not due to transcriptional up-regulation. Finally, publicly available gene expression data under cold, heat and salt stress confirm that AVP1 is not upregulated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide evidence that the fugu5-1 mutation impacts the gene expression pattern of the PPa1/2/4/5 genes in response to cold (using the RNA samples of Figure 2B and 2C). This would reveal whether the gene expression pattern of these four genes in response to cold is altered in the Fugu5 mutant and if their gene expression is thus impacted by the increased PPi levels in the fuga5-1 mutant at 22C/4C. The presented increase in the PPi levels in the fugu5 mutation (Figure 1G) suggests that induction of these PPa genes does not occur as a compensatory mechanism of a rise of the PPi levels due to the fugu5 mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have included qRT data for the expression of sPPase genes in <italic>fugu5</italic> in the revised Figure 2. As expected, the cold response of several PPa genes is reduced indicating that they are under control of the ICE1/CBF-transcriptome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The following points are unclear and should be revised in the text/figures. Although some of these excerpted reviewer statements include experiments, it is the author's discretion as to whether to do the experiments, or to modify the text. An explanation of the resolution should be included in the response to reviewers.</p><p>4) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, authors provide data about pyrophosphatase activity. The activity in fugu5 was similar to that in Col-0. According to Figure 1—figure supplement 1, V-PPase activity in fugu5 was reduced. How is V-PPase activity in fugu5 expression UBQ:PP5a-GFP? And why did authors use UBQ:PP5a-GFP, instead of UBQ:AVP1? More clear information is required.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2G shows measurements of soluble PPase whereas Figure 1—figure supplement 1 shows PPi hydrolysis by membrane-integral H<sup>+</sup>-PPase in microsomal extracts.

We have so far not analysed this any further but are planning to do this in future experiments. PPa5-GFP is expressed under control of the UBI10-promotor in both genotypes and we thus assume that we are indeed facing an effect on protein stability but we will of course have to demonstrate that transgene expression is not affected. The fact that soluble PPase activity does not differ might indeed indicate yet another level of regulation and we will follow up on this. We have modified the text in the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 1B and 1C, statistical analyses are required.

As UBQ:PPa5 might not reduce PPi levels to the same extent as UBQ:AVP1, it might not be sufficient to improve freezing tolerance.
