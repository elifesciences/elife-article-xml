In the long bones, the growth plates (GPs) drive elongation by generating a scaffold progressively replaced by bone. Although studies have focused on intrinsic GP regulation, classic and recent experiments suggest that local signals also modulate GP function. We devised a genetic mouse model to study extrinsic long bone growth modulation, in which injury is specifically induced in the left hindlimb, such that the right hindlimb serves as an internal control. Remarkably, when only mesenchyme cells surrounding postnatal GPs were killed, left bone growth was nevertheless reduced. GP signaling was impaired by altered paracrine signals from the knee joint, including activation of the injury response and, in neonates, dampened IGF1 production. Importantly, only the combined prevention of both responses rescued neonatal growth. Thus, we identified signals from the knee joint that modulate bone growth and could underlie establishment of body proportions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27210.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27210.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27210.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As bones grow, their size is carefully controlled and coordinated with the growth of the other organs in the body.

In growth disorders this signaling goes wrong, which can lead to a person having unusual proportions such as a very short stature or having one leg shorter than the other.

Researchers would like to know how bone growth is affected by signals from the surrounding tissues because this could help them to develop new non-invasive treatments for these conditions.</p><p>Long bones, for example those in the leg, grow from structures near their ends called growth plates. Roselló-Díez et al. have now engineered mice in which an injury shortly after birth caused cells in the knee in the rear left leg to die off. At the same time, the rear right leg of the mice developed as normal, allowing the growth of the two legs to be compared. Roselló-Díez et al. found that the left leg of these mice grew more slowly than the right leg, even though none of the cells in the growth plate of the left leg bone had been damaged. Further investigation revealed that this was because the injury caused an imbalance between the growth-promoting and growth-restricting signals that are produced by the fat pad and articular cartilage in the knee joint. Restoring the lost balance allowed the left leg bone to grow to a more normal length.</p><p>In the future, boosting bone growth signals might provide a way to treat conditions like dwarfism or leg-length discrepancies. Understanding how different tissues influence body proportions could also help researchers to investigate how different animals evolved different body proportions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27210.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27210.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>organ size</kwd><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>extrinsic signaling</kwd><kwd>connective tissue</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>injury response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Charles Revson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-34</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roselló-Díez</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000521/2012-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roselló-Díez</surname><given-names>Alberto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HD083860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joyner</surname><given-names>Alexandra L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analyses in mice reveal a communication system between the knee joint and the developing bones that could be explored in studies addressing evolutionary changes in body proportions and in future therapies for growth disorders.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The signaling pathways that underlie the control of organ size during development, and recovery from injury, have important implications for the treatment of growth disorders. The same pathways likely also underlie evolutionary differences in body sizes and proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haldane, 1926</xref>). Inter-species transplantation experiments have shown that growth of most organs, including the limbs, eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Twitty and Schwind, 1931</xref>) and jaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schneider, 2015</xref>), to a great extent follows an intrinsic genetic program, as the final size of the organ graft is close to that of the donor. However, extrinsic factors such as nutrient availability, inflammation, mechanical forces or the presence of additional organ grafts can modulate, to varying extents, growth of many organs (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>]). Therefore, interactions between organ-intrinsic and extrinsic cues must be critical to the regulation of individual organ size, relative body proportions and responses to developmental insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stanger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mirth and Shingleton, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The developing vertebrate limb is an excellent model to study pathways controlling organ growth, as it is amenable to non-lethal manipulation, and it is composed of multiple tissues (muscles, tendons, bone, nerves, vessels, etc.) that grow coordinately and are exposed to biochemical and mechanical extrinsic signals that interact with their intrinsic genetic growth programs. Long bones within the limbs have been popular models for studies of patterning, growth and evolution since at least the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Owen, 1849</xref>), mostly as isolated entities, although lately also as part of the musculo-skeletal unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berendsen and Olsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shwartz et al., 2013</xref>). Long bone growth occurs through endochondral ossification, driven by a transient cartilage structure, the growth plate (GP), located at both ends (epiphyses) of the bone (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">[Kronenberg, 2003</xref>]). Once mesenchymal cells condense into the anlage of the skeletal elements, they differentiate into collagen II-expressing chondrocytes that undergo sequential differentiation from bone ends to center. Resting (quiescent) chondrocytes produce proliferative cells that after a few rounds of duplication cease proliferation and start to differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes (HTCs). HTCs increase their volume as they progress towards the center of the bone, laying down a collagen X-rich extracellular matrix (ECM) and secreting factors that recruit vasculature and bone precursors (osteoblasts) into the skeletal element. Some HTCs die by apoptosis, while others transdifferentiate into osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), which also derive from a fibrous layer that wraps the cartilage (perichondrium) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kronenberg, 2007</xref>), and both osteoblast pools form the primary ossification center by replacing the cartilaginous ECM with bone. This invasion of osteoblasts, blood vessels and ossification process is later recapitulated in the center of both epiphyseal regions, giving rise to the secondary ossification centers. The GP remains as a cartilage disc between the primary and secondary ossification centers, and responds to both intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate bone length. Within the GP, a negative feedback loop between indian hedgehog (IHH), secreted by pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes, and parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PTHLH or PTHrP) secreted by resting chondrocytes, couples chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vortkamp et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Long et al., 2001</xref>), and is the main conduit through which other local signals, such as fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) exert their function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>). A number of systemic signals (hormones) have long been known to impact on bone growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>), but the contribution of local signals extrinsic to the GP has been explored less. Interestingly, the GPs at each end of the long bones contribute differentially to final bone size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Digby, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payton, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moss-Salentijn, 1974</xref>), raising the possibility that each has a different intrinsic growth potential, and/or that each is exposed to distinct local environmental cues. Indeed, while there has been an emphasis on intrinsic regulators of bone growth potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nilsson and Baron, 2004</xref>), classic GP transplantation experiments revealed that the local environment can modify the amount of growth produced by a GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moss-Salentijn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Röhlig, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hert, 1964</xref>). The identities of such local extrinsic signal(s), however, have only recently begun to emerge. For example, TGFβR2 signaling from the interzone (the embryonic precursor of the joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pacifici et al., 2006</xref>]) affects maturation and signaling in the hypertrophic zone (HZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longobardi et al., 2012</xref>); while some human variants located near the gene <italic>GDF5,</italic> expressed in the interzone, are associated with decreased height and increased osteoarthritic risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sanna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Another important player is WNT signaling from the interzone, as its balance with BMP signaling from the GP controls the differentiation of chondrogenic precursors towards either GP (transient cartilage) or articular (permanent cartilage) fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ray et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, a well-known modulator of bone growth is the Growth Hormone/Insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis, whereby GH induces <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in several tissues, including the liver and the GP, but also plays an IGF1-independent role in postnatal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Isgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lupu et al., 2001</xref>). Importantly, the accumulated evidence suggests that local rather than systemic (i.e. liver-derived) IGF1 is the main factor controlling appendicular (limb) skeletal growth at early postnatal stages. For example, while genetic deletion of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the whole embryo affects skeletal growth from late gestation onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker et al., 1993</xref>), mice mutant for <italic>growth hormone receptor</italic> (<italic>Ghr</italic>) do not show a body weight or a limb length phenotype until postnatal day (P) 10–15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lupu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 1997</xref>), and GH-induced, liver-specific IGF1 only begins exerting postnatal hormonal action shortly after 3 weeks of age in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stratikopoulos et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, deletion of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the liver (which diminishes circulating IGF1 levels by &gt;75%) does not affect appendicular skeletal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sjögren et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yakar et al., 1999</xref>), whereas chronic overexpression of <italic>Igf1</italic> in liver, brain and other organs (leading to increased serum IGF1 levels) results in overgrowth of only a subset of organs that does not include the skeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathews et al., 1988</xref>). Regarding local IGF1 sources, the expression of <italic>Igf1</italic> is much lower (if at all present) in the GP than in the surrounding tissues ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2007</xref>] and our data), raising the question of whether the main local role of IGF1 is autocrine or paracrine. The fact that deletion of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the whole limb mesenchyme greatly diminishes chondrocyte hypertrophy by P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 2013</xref>), whereas specific <italic>Igf1</italic> deletion in the chondrocyte lineage (including osteoblasts) affects bone mass accretion but not bone length by two weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Govoni et al., 2007</xref>), strongly suggests that the main source of IGF1 affecting the perinatal GP is the local soft tissues. Interestingly, one of the main downstream targets of insulin/IGF signaling, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), also plays a key role in chondrocyte hypertrophy, but it is not clear what are the sources and identities of the upstream molecules that activate this pathway in chondrocytes of the GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Long, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phornphutkul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Srinivas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Probably even more complex than growth regulation during normal development is growth regulation after an injury in a growing organ, as the deleterious effects of the injury have to be resolved while the rest of the body is growing. Tissue injury triggers activation of a specific group of genes characterized by a very quick response to signals such as cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahrami and Drabløs, 2016</xref>). Such genes are often referred to as immediate-early genes. Tissue injury often also triggers an inflammatory response characterized by immune cell recruitment and release of inflammatory cytokines, which have been shown to impair organ growth, including bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacRae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mårtensson et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Elucidating the mechanisms by which local signals extrinsic to the GP modulate bone growth will be relevant to understanding regional differences in bone growth, both within and between species, and also for developing non-invasive therapies for congenital or acquired growth disorders. A major obstacle for exploring local bone growth regulation is a lack of animal models in which only cells outside the GP are manipulated. We show here that transient unilateral induction of cell death in the soft tissues of the postnatal limb impairs GP function and bone growth, leading to left-right limb length inequality. The growth defect is associated with reduced chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, due to two paracrine signaling branches from the knee joint: (1) Injury-induced local inflammation reduces IGF1 in the knee fat pad, impairing mTOR and IHH signaling in the GP. Interestingly, this branch is active in neonates but not older mice with a secondary ossification center. (2) The injury response cascade is activated in the joint and prospective articular cartilage, affecting multiple signaling pathways in the adjacent resting zone (RZ) of the GP. Both IGF1 loss and the injury response pathway have a causative role in the reduction of bone growth, as combined maintenance of IGF1 expression and inhibition of the injury response rescues bone growth following cell death outside the neonatal GP, whereas either treatment alone does not. Our study reveals that neonatal bone growth is modulated by extrinsic signals from the fat pad and the articular cartilage, opening new avenues for developmental and evolutionary studies, and for the correction of growth defects in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Growth of the left long bones is impaired following transient left-specific cell death in the adjacent mesenchyme around birth</title><p>As a means to study local bone grow control mechanisms, we developed a genetic model in mice in which transient cell death is induced specifically in the mesenchyme of the left limb, allowing the right limb to be an internal control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). A transgenic mouse line that drives Cre expression in the left lateral plate mesoderm under the control of the <italic>Pitx2</italic> asymmetric enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shiratori et al., 2006</xref>) was combined with an <italic>R26<sup>LSL-DTR</sup></italic> strain that expresses <underline>d</underline>iphtheria <underline>t</underline>oxin <underline>r</underline>eceptor (DTR) following Cre-induced recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buch et al., 2005</xref>) (Pit::DTR mice). As expected, Pit::DTR mice expressed DTR primarily in the left but not right limb mesenchyme, excluding muscles and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). To model an acute injury at birth, a single systemic injection of DT was administered at postnatal day (P) 1 (P1-Pit::DTR model), resulting in cell death in the left hindlimb mesenchyme between 1 and 3 days post-injection (dpi), with little in the right limb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and not shown). Unexpectedly, however, cell death was not detected in the left GPs of the tibia and femur of P1-Pit::DTR mice, and the front of apoptotic cells only reached the outermost layers of the prospective articular cartilage and perichondrium from P2 to P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–B’’</xref>; the proportion of cells undergoing cell death in the perichondrial groove of Ranvier was 18 ± 7% at P2, n = 6). It is likely that DT (a ~60 kDa molecule) cannot diffuse efficiently into the postnatal GP, which is avascular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and a very effective barrier to the diffusion of molecules larger than 10 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Williams et al., 2007</xref>). To rule out an abnormal response of chondrocytes to DT, we cultured Pit::DTR tibiae from P1 mice in various concentrations of DT (5, 50 and 500 ng/ml) for 24 hr, to test whether a very high concentration of DT could overcome the potential diffusion barrier and ablate GP chondrocytes. We found that at the highest concentration of DT, cell death was triggered in some cells in the core of the GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), confirming that postnatal chondrocytes can respond to DT.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27210.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Postnatal growth of the left long bones is impaired following transient left-specific cell death in the adjacent mesenchyme.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pit::DTR model for the induction of transient unilateral cell death in the limb mesenchyme.

The systemic growth reduction was likely caused by cell death in a region of the heart where <italic>Pitx2-Cre</italic> drives DTR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shiratori et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–C’</xref>), as we observed that P1<italic>-</italic>Pit::DTR animals were lethargic for ~4 days after DT injection, including severe (sometimes lethal) hypophagia. As a consequence, the GPs of P1-Pit::DTR mice at P5 were smaller than in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E’</xref>). At the molecular level, one difference found between control and P1-Pit::DTR mice at P5 was a decrease in the synthesis of ECM in both the left and right GPs of P1-Pit::DTR mice, as <italic>Agcn1</italic> and <italic>Col2a1</italic> expression was downregulated compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). After 4dpi, however, experimental mice resumed normal feeding and started catching up with the controls. Importantly, by the end of the longitudinal growth period, the lengths of the right but not the left long bones had normalized in P1-Pit::DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), demonstrating the left-specific growth reduction is independent of the transient systemic effect. It is worth noting that unwanted recombination, as observed in the Pit::DTR heart, is a common caveat of most limb-targeting Cre lines, such as <italic>Prrx1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Hoxb6-Cre,</italic> which target regions of the head and gut (see JAX005584, 017981 and references therein).

Importantly, HTCs did not display increased EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which can be activated by DTR shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xu et al., 2004</xref>) and impairs terminal chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the potential ablation of osteoprogenitors in the perichondrium of P1-Pit::DTR animals was an unlikely cause of the reduced bone growth, as most of these cells were not TUNEL+ in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–C’</xref>). Moreover, a near-complete ablation of osteoprogenitors using an <italic>Sp7</italic> (Osx)<italic>-</italic>driven Cre (Osx::DTR model) failed to impair longitudinal bone growth, although it did reduce cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Finally, we did not detect increased cell death in the osteochondral junction that could explain the observed HZ shortening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>To probe the link between soft-tissue signals and GP function, we next tested whether the signaling pathways known to affect chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were altered in the left hindlimb GPs of P1-Pit::DTR mice. Since cell death receded by P5, we focused our analysis on the first days post-injection for the rest of the study. Significantly, we found that <italic>Ihh</italic> expression was reduced in the left compared to right GPs at P3, as was the expression of the HH target gene <italic>Gli1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–A’</xref>, n = 14/16 and 8/10, respectively). We did not, however, observe a change in expression of the IHH target <italic>Pthlh</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Given that the phosphatase SHP2 negatively modulates <italic>Ihh</italic> levels in cultured chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guan et al., 2014</xref>), we treated P1-Pit::DTR pups with an SHP2 inhibitor from P1 to P3. While the treatment rescued <italic>Ihh</italic> expression, it did not rescue bone growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C’</xref>), suggesting that other parallel signaling pathways were disturbed. Since mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) is implicated in chondrocyte maturation and hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phornphutkul et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Srinivas et al., 2009</xref>), we next performed immunohistochemical detection of p-S6, a readout of mTORC1 activity, and found that indeed p-S6 levels were reduced in the left PZ and pre-HZ from P3 until at least P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, n = 19/23, 7/8 and 3/3 at P3, P4 and P5, respectively). We further found that this downregulation could be mimicked in the right GP of P1-Pit::DTR mice and also in both hindlimbs of WT pups by treatment with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, which also stunts overall growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>). Since FGFs secreted by the perichondrium negatively regulate chondrocyte proliferation and early hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karuppaiah et al., 2016</xref>), we tested whether FGF signaling was altered, but did not detect an increase in FGF signaling in any region of the left GP of P1-Pit::DTR mice at P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–B’</xref>). On the contrary, <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression was downregulated in the region of the left GP where the secondary ossification center forms, suggesting <italic>Fgfr3</italic> could be involved in the observed delayed formation and expansion of this structure. Moreover, decreased TGFβR2 signaling in the joint region has been shown to impair chondrocyte hypertrophy at embryonic stages via increased expression of the cytokine MCP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longobardi et al., 2012</xref>), but we were not able to detect MCP5 mRNA or protein in our model at P3. On the other hand, RNA and protein levels of the WNT target <italic>Lef1</italic> were upregulated in the RZ of the left P1-Pit::DTR GP compared to right (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, n = 5 at P3, 4 at P4, 3 at P5), which might impair PTHLH signaling and chondrocyte differentiation, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ray et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2009</xref>).

Since mTORC1 activity was impaired in P1-Pit::DTR mice and insulin/IGF signaling is the main bone-growth related pathway known to activate mTORC1 signaling, we examined the GH/IGF signaling axis. As the right limb serves as an internal control for the insulted left limb in our model, any left-specific defect could not be due to changes in a systemic factor(s) (be it GH or IGF1), unless there was a local change in the signal transduction machinery that responds to those systemic factors. Furthermore, given that systemic GH/IGF1 does not play an important role in early postnatal skeletal growth (see Introduction), we decided to focus on local IGF signaling. Interestingly, we found that while <italic>Igf1</italic> was highly expressed in the right infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP), an extra-synovial adipose tissue located between the femur and the tibia, it was extremely and specifically downregulated in the left IPFP of P1-Pit::DTR mice at 2-3dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, n = 10/12), and recovered by 4dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A’</xref>, n = 2). Furthermore, <italic>Igf1</italic> expression was not consistently altered in other tissues, such as the perichondrium, the muscle bundles or cells in the metaphyseal (shaft) region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, we only detected minor to no changes in the expression of <italic>Igf2</italic> or the main IGF receptor gene <italic>Igf1r</italic> in the GP or surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), indicating that the IPFP was specifically affected by the insult. We further tested whether downstream signaling components were altered. In particular, since injury-induced inflammation (see below) could conceivably increase expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), which is known to exert a negative influence on IGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed and Farquharson, 2010</xref>), we performed SOCS3 immunohistochemistry on P1-Pit::DTR knee sections. However, we could not detect differential expression between the left and right GPs at P2 or P3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that it is the reduced availability of IGF1 from the IPFP that causes some of the signaling changes observed in the left GP. To test this possibility, we provided exogenous IGF1 to the left knee region by intraarticular injections in P1-Pit::DTR pups (P1-P3), and found that indeed mTORC1 signaling was consistently rescued in the PZ and pre-HZ of the GPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’</xref> top, n = 5 P3-P5 pups). Curiously, <italic>Ihh</italic> and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression were also rescued in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’</xref> bottom, n = 3 at P3, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), suggesting that both genes are downstream of IGF signaling.</p><p>To determine the cause of <italic>Igf1</italic> downregulation, we analyzed the cellular and molecular response to cell death in the left IPFP of P1-Pit::DTR mice. We observed left-specific neutrophil recruitment at P2-P4 that had mostly receded by P5, thus precisely correlating with transient <italic>Igf1</italic> downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–C’</xref> n = 5, 5, 4, 5 at P2, P3, P4, P5). Moreover, macrophages, already very abundant in the IPFP in resting conditions, were additionally recruited to the left IPFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–A’</xref>). As neutrophils are an important feature of joint inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wright et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wipke and Allen, 2001</xref>), we tested whether neutrophils were responsible for <italic>Igf1</italic> downregulation by blocking their recruitment with the NIMP-R14 neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez et al., 1984</xref>) during P1-P3 in P1-Pit::DTR mice. Neutrophil blockade was effective for at least 14 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, n = 3), and significantly correlated with partial recovery of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in the IPFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D’</xref>, n = 4), without inhibiting cell death in this region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The partial recovery of <italic>Igf1</italic> after neutrophil inhibition indicates that additional cell types inhibit its expression. Importantly, the recovery of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression correlated with increased levels of p-S6 and <italic>Ihh</italic> in the pre-HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D’’</xref>, n = 3, and not shown), demonstrating that proper signaling in the pre-HZ requires IGF1 production from the IPFP. To further probe the role of immune-cell recruitment in <italic>Igf1</italic> downregulation, we injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the joint of WT animals, which caused a strong (but patchy) local recruitment of neutrophils to the IPFP. Of significance, this recruitment led to the predicted downregulation of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the areas with highest accumulation of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This effect took place in the absence of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>), suggesting that immune cells (probably neutrophils) secrete factors that reduce <italic>Igf1</italic> expression. Notably, we found that TNFα-expressing cells (some of them neutrophils) were present in the left and not the right IPFP in P1-Pit::DTR mice at P2, and that neutrophils accumulated TNFα in what seemed to be the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C’’’</xref>). TNFα has been shown to reduce <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in vascular smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anwar et al., 2002</xref>), raising the possibility that this cytokine is in part responsible for the observed <italic>Igf1</italic> downregulation in the left IPFP of P1-Pit::DTR mice. Interestingly, partial restoration of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression by neutrophil blockade did not rescue <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that full restoration of <italic>Igf1</italic> is necessary for normal <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression. Despite IGF1 supplementation rescuing several critical pathways, neither IGF1 injection nor neutrophil blockade were sufficient to rescue the decreased left bone growth at P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref>, n = 5 experimental and 5 control animals for each treatment), indicating that an IGF1-independent pathway also contributes to the growth defect. Indeed, expression of <italic>Lef1</italic> in the left GP remained upregulated after IGF1 injection or neutrophil blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), raising the possibility that increased LEF1 activity contributes to the growth defect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The injury response is activated in the articular cartilage</title><p>Given the importance of the immediate-early damage response upon injury, we tested its activation and indeed detected it in the left joint region of P1-Pit::DTR mice, not only in the IPFP but also in the prospective articular cartilage (pAC). Specifically, we observed that expression of <italic>Early growth response gene 1</italic> (<italic>Egr1</italic>) was increased in the left IPFP and pAC of P1-Pit::DTR mice at P2 (1dpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, n = 2). <italic>Egr1</italic> expression in the left IPFP receded by P3, but remained highly upregulated in the left pAC through P4, receding by P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, n = 3, 2, 2, respectively). Interestingly, p-S6 expression, while downregulated in the pre-HZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), was upregulated in the left pAC at P3 and P4 and receded by P5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, n = 33, 14 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B’</xref>, n = 2), suggesting transiently increased mTORC1 signaling in this region, as observed in osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pal et al., 2015</xref>). Other injury response markers followed a dynamic similar to <italic>Egr1</italic> in the left pAC of P1-Pit::DTR mice. For example, we detected ectopic expression of <italic>Hif2a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which has a prominent role in cartilage destruction during osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ryu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Husa et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, <italic>Il6</italic>, one of the main mediators of <italic>Hif2a-</italic>dependent cartilage destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ryu et al., 2014</xref>), was upregulated in the left pAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and was the likely cause of the ectopic JAK1/2-dependent expression of p-STAT3 we detected in the pAC at P3 and P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, n = 13 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and that receded by P5 (not shown). Importantly, expression of <italic>Egr1,</italic> p-S6 and p-STAT3 was not due to inflammation in the IPFP, as neutrophil blockade or injection of IGF1 did not preclude activation of the injury response in the pAC of P1-Pit::DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref> and not shown). Associated with the injury response, histological analysis revealed extensive and persistent cell loss in the pAC/AC from P4 to at least P27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>, n = 3 and 4). Of note, most signaling changes extended beyond the area of cell death (i.e. the pAC), almost reaching into the RZ of the GP (compare TUNEL and p-STAT3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>). Since cells in the pAC/AC do not normally give rise to GP chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kozhemyakina et al., 2015</xref>), this set of results raised the possibility that the injury response in the pAC triggers a paracrine-signaling cascade that contributes to the signaling defects observed in the RZ.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27210.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The injury response in the articular cartilage of P1-Pit::DTR mice correlates with signaling changes in the resting zone and impaired bone growth.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of the immediate-early marker <italic>Egr1</italic> 1dpi.

Similar to the P1 injections, analysis of cell death 3-4dpi in P14-Pit::DTR mice revealed apoptotic cells only in the surrounding soft tissues, and not the GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, n = 4). As in the P1-Pit::DTR model, the height of the left HZ zone at 4dpi was reduced in P14-Pit::DTR mice compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, n = 2), and the hindlimbs developed a progressive left-right asymmetry over time, although it was non-significant at P20 (~7–13% by P57, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>, n = 3–4 per genotype at P20, n = 7 per genotype at P57).

The IPFP appeared as a defined region at around E17.5, and this coincided with the accumulation of a high level of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in the area as compared to the surrounding mesenchymal tissues. While perivascular stem cells (CD44/CD90+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hindle et al., 2017</xref>) were detected in the interzone area even before the IPFP was formed, adipocytes (detected either by hematoxylin and eosin staining or expression of FABP4) were not clearly seen until P3-P4, indicating that adipocytes are not the main source of <italic>Igf1</italic>. As expected, <italic>Igf1</italic> expression levels gradually decreased postnatally until they were barely detectable at P8 and not detected at P12. Intrigued by the dynamic expression of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the IPFP, we finally explored whether the dynamics correlate with any change in the ratio of the lengths of the radius (far from any fat pad, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A’</xref>) and the tibia during development. Interestingly, we observed that the radius grows more slowly than the tibia at the stages when <italic>Igf1</italic> levels are high in the IPFP, whereas the ratio stabilizes after P8, roughly coinciding with the cessation of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This correlation is consistent with the hypothesis that paracrine signals from the IPFP play a role in the establishment of body proportions, a possibility with clinical and evolutionary implications (see Discussion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates that transient cell death in the early postnatal left hindlimb mesenchyme surrounding the GPs leads to reduced long bone growth due to altered signaling from two tissues in the adjacent knee joint. Only a few recent studies have addressed the regulation of longitudinal bone growth by the surrounding tissues, and showed that TGFβR2 signaling from the joint interzone stimulates chondrocyte hypertrophy in the GP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Longobardi et al., 2012</xref>), and FGFs produced by the perichondrium negatively modulate bone growth in a GP non-autonomous fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Karuppaiah et al., 2016</xref>). Of significance, our study identifies two neonatal joint components that can modulate bone growth, at least following injury: the IPFP and the pAC/AC. Taken together, our data support a model whereby extrinsic signals from the IPFP and/or pAC/AC modulate distinct GP-intrinsic signaling pathways, leading to reduced bone growth, even in the absence of intrinsic damage to the GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). While we think this model can be generally applied, the apparently milder rescue of the tibia compared to the femur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) could mean that each bone’s response to the same growth-modulating cues varies with the developmental stage in a different manner. Indeed, the specific effect of limb immobilization on the growth of different bones has recently been shown to depend on the time of treatment in chicken and crocodile embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pollard et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>By inducing cell death outside the GP, we found a prolonged long bone growth defect in vivo that was associated with inflammation in the knee joint. This result is reminiscent of in vitro studies showing that pro-inflammatory cytokines can exert a negative influence on bone growth that continues well beyond the cytokine exposure period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacRae et al., 2006</xref>). As in our in vivo study, the inflammation-dependent in vitro growth defect was only partially rescued by IGF1 treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mårtensson et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that inflammation impairs bone growth via both IGF-dependent and -independent pathways.</p><p>Using our P1-Pit::DTR mice, we also uncovered that loss of mTORC1 signaling in the pre-HZ correlates with loss of <italic>Ihh</italic> expression, and that restoration of IGF1 levels in the joint rescues both pathways. At the same time, SHP2 inhibition in P1-Pit::DTR mice rescues <italic>Ihh</italic> expression but not mTORC1 activity, and mTORC1 inhibition does not reduce <italic>Ihh</italic> expression in WT animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sanchez et al., 2009</xref>), nor does it impair IGF1-mediated rescue of <italic>Ihh</italic> expression in Pit::DTR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B’’</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that IGF1 activates <italic>Ihh</italic> expression via an mTORC1-independent pathway, possibly by inhibition of SHP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Notably, the requirement of IGF signaling for <italic>Ihh</italic> expression seems to be restricted to a narrow perinatal window, as <italic>Igf1r</italic> deletion in the cartilage only reduces <italic>Ihh</italic> expression when triggered at P5 but not prenatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), and we show that <italic>Igf1</italic> is no longer expressed in the IPFP by P12.</p><p>Unlike in the pre-HZ, we found mTORC1 activity was increased in the left pAC and RZ of P1-Pit::DTR mice. Since mTORC1 was induced despite reduction of local IGF1 levels, it follows that another signal must be responsible for mTORC1 activation in the AC/RZ. One candidate is IL6 expressed ectopically in the AC, as this cytokine can activate mTORC1 in some cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2008</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of mTORC1 activity dampened LEF1 levels in the RZ without impairing STAT3 phosphorylation, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A’’, C’’</xref>), while JAK1/2 inhibition also precluded LEF1 upregulation, without impeding p-S6 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A’,C’</xref>). These results suggest that both mTORC1 and JAK/STAT signaling pathways are independently required to activate <italic>Lef1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>We speculate that the local influence exerted by the joint region could at least in part explain poorly understood phenomena observed in the field of bone growth, such as the fact that the proximal tibia and distal femur GPs (i.e. closest to the fat pad) grow faster than the distal tibia or proximal femur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Digby, 1916</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payton, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moss-Salentijn, 1974</xref>). Our proposal is biologically relevant because differential GP growth has been recently suggested to be evolutionary optimized to achieve energy-efficient scaling of the growing bones by minimizing the remodeling of ossified cortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stern et al., 2015</xref>). While intrinsic differences in the GP likely exist and account in part for differential growth of proximal and distal GPs, classic experiments showed a change in growth rate upon proximo-distal transposition of the GPs within a bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moss-Salentijn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hert, 1964</xref>), strongly suggesting the involvement of local extrinsic factors. Fat pads are probably one of the main participants in this process, as suggested by our study and those of others showing that adipocyte-secreted signals can stimulate long bone growth in the absence of growth hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shtaif et al., 2015</xref>). In this regard, our finding that <italic>Igf1</italic> is almost absent from the IPFP by P8 correlates with the fact that the femur and tibia grow faster than the rest of the body (including forelimb bones) until roughly the same stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roselló-Díez and Joyner, 2015</xref>]). The GP likely becomes independent from the IPFP after ~P8 (due both to the intervening presence of the secondary ossification center as well as to cessation of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in the fat pad), which could also explain why it takes longer for bone growth to be significantly impaired when the injury is induced at P14 <italic>vs.</italic> P1. Finally, we cannot exclude the possibility that the IPFP and/or other local tissues hosting cells with osteochondrogenic potential, such as the synovium, bone marrow or the perichondrial groove of Ranvier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hindle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karlsson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung and Xian, 2014</xref>), can contribute to bone growth not only with paracrine signals, but also with progenitor cells (see for example Fig. S9 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yang et al., 2013</xref>]), such that cell death within these tissues in Pit::DTR mice depletes a pool of cells that participates in recovery of the injured bones.</p><p>In conclusion, further studies using mouse models should confirm and expand the repertoire of local extrinsic regulators of bone growth. This repertoire would be a valuable resource for evolutionary studies addressing the change of body proportion across phyla, and it could potentially be harnessed to develop improved therapies to correct local long bone growth defects.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The <italic>Pitx2-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shiratori et al., 2006</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_RBRC03487">IMSR_RBRC03487</ext-link>, kind gift of Dr. H.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom, Clifford J Rosen (Reviewer#1) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Colin Farquharson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors test the hypothesis that local factors outside the growth plate provide signals to long bones to enhance growth during the critical early phases of postnatal development, particularly when growth hormone is not fully activated. In particular, the authors focus on the paracrine activity of the infrapatellar fat pad as a source of IGF-I and activation of the injury response. They propose that Injury and/or inflammation can impact longitudinal growth via disturbed activation of this tissue and suggest that paracrine regulation of the growth plate is essential for normal early neonatal growth. Indeed, understanding the role of these paracrine factors may contribute to our knowledge base about longitudinal growth and pathologic states of impaired growth due to injury.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As noted above, the paper breaks new ground with a provocative model system and the rescue experiments. However there were concerns by both reviewers that need to be addressed in the revised manuscript:</p><p>1) The authors have not excluded changes in systemic GH/IGF-I axis via the pituitary (particularly since they showed systemic rescue by treating with IGF-I), nor dealt with the possibility in early postnatal development that IGF-II may be altered by inflammation and injury. Delineating changes in these other growth factors is essential for the revision. Furthermore, the discussion of early linear growth is slanted too much toward paracrine factors despite convincing mouse data to the contrary from Arg Efstratiadis and others.

Those studies need to be included (see 5 below).</italic></p><p>This is indeed a very important point that was not completely clear in the original manuscript. Since we are performing a unilateral modification, with the right limb as internal control, any left-specific defect cannot be due to changes in a systemic factor(s) (be it GH or IGF1), although it could be due to local changes in the signal transduction machinery that responds to those systemic factors. Importantly, Efstratiadis and others have shown that mutant mice for <italic>growth hormone receptor (Ghr</italic>) do not show a body weight or a limb length phenotype until P10-P15 (Zhou et al., PNAS 1997, Lupu et al., Dev Biol 2001), while we see a significant effect as early as P4. Therefore, we decided to focus on local IGF signaling. We did not detect major changes of expression for <italic>Igf2</italic> or <italic>Igf1r</italic> (i.e. the other IGF ligand and their common receptor), except in the damaged cells of the prospective articular cartilage, where the <italic>Igf2</italic> expression domain is somewhat interrupted (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) To test the possibility that downstream signaling components were affected, we determined SOCS3 expression as suggested by the reviewer, as it could conceivably be activated by inflammatory cytokines and exert a negative influence on IGF signaling (Ahmed and Farquharson, J. Endocrinology 2010). However, we could not detect differential expression between the left and right GPs in P1-<italic>PitDTR</italic> animals at P2 or P3 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that it is the reduced availability of IGF1 from the fat pad that plays a major role in the phenotype. It is also noteworthy that when the same intra-articular (i.e. local) IGF1 injection regimen that we performed in the rescue experiment is reproduced in <italic>PitDTR</italic> animals not given DT, no overgrowth phenotype is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). Actually the injected limb is slightly shorter, perhaps due to the repeated injections.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27210.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Left and right bone length in P5 <italic>PitDTR</italic> animals that were not injected with DT, but that were injected with IGF1 in the left knee from P1 to P4, twice daily. p-values for multiple comparisons test after two-way ANOVA are shown.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27210.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27210.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27210-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>We have also expanded the Introduction/Discussion to further clarify the role of IGF signaling in early postnatal development. We explain that deletion of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the liver (which diminishes circulating levels by &gt;75%) does not affect limb growth (Yakar et al.,and Sjögren et al., PNAS 1999), whereas chronic overexpression of <italic>Igf1</italic> in liver, brain and other organs results in overgrowth of only a subset of organs “without an apparent increase in skeletal growth” (Mathews et al., Endocrinology 1988). Furthermore, one of the most comprehensive studies relating to the trophic role of GH/IGF, by the Efstratiadis lab (Stratikopoulos et al., PNAS 2008), reached the conclusion that “growth hormone-induced, liver-specific IGF1 apparently begins exerting postnatal hormonal action shortly after weaning”. Finally, the fact that deletion of <italic>Igf1</italic> in the whole limb mesenchyme greatly diminishes chondrocyte hypertrophy by P7 (Cooper et al., Nature 2013), whereas specific <italic>Igf1</italic> deletion in chondrocytes from embryonic stages onwards does not affect bone growth by two weeks of age (Govoni et al., Physiol Genomics 2007), strongly argues that the main local source.</p><p> <italic>2) Their suggestion that the perichondrium is not the source of altered signaling is not fully supported by the figures and needs clearer delineation and/or further experiments to exclude this source of IGF-I.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript, we chose to show <italic>Igf1</italic> expression only in the IPFP because it is the only tissue in which we detected diminished <italic>Igf1</italic> levels. We agree with the reviewer that showing other source tissues makes the result more compelling, and therefore we have included close-ups of <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in several regions of the limb mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As shown in the figure, <italic>Igf1</italic> expression is not changed in the left perichondrium, metaphyseal region or muscle bundles surrounding the bones, as compared to the right limb. It should be noted that perichondrial <italic>Igf1</italic> expression is only detected at certain section levels, and due to inevitable differences in the precise orientation of each bone during sectioning, it is not possible to obtain exactly matched section levels for left and right bones. Therefore, to assess changes of expression as thoroughly as possible, we decided to image every single section from 5 different animals using a slide scanner. Through this serial analysis, we only found consistent left-right differences in <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in the IPFP.</p><p> <italic>3) Further studies examining SOCS3 expression and its role in down regulating IGF-I are necessary as an alternative mechanism.</italic></p><p>Please see our response to point 1 for our new results on SOCS3 expression.</p><p> <italic>4) The rescue experiments with ruxo and IGF-I showed lack of a response in the tibia; this needs to be redone or clarified to the extent that it is more demonstrable; we prefer to see a larger N for these experiments.</italic></p><p>We have now increased the number of rescued animals (especially for the double rescue, from six to eleven), and we have modified the statistical analysis, such that instead of analyzing femur and tibia separately by one-way ANOVA with Treatment as variable, we performed twoy ANOVA with Bone and Treatment as variables, in order to take into account that the measurements of femur and tibia from the same animal are matched and not independent. Interestingly, only the p-value for Treatment is statistically significant, meaning that there is not a consistent difference between femur and tibia across treatments. The conclusion of the posthoc test for multiple comparisons is that both bones show a trend towards rescue, with the p-value being 0.047 for the femur and 0.059 for the tibia (see new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As thresholds for statistical significance are arbitrary, another way to assess the biological relevance is to consider that 3/11 femora were completely rescued, whereas none of the tibiae showed complete rescue. Therefore, we cannot discard that the response of femur and tibia to the same growth-modulating cues varies slightly depending on the time window during which the perturbation happens. Indeed, the specific effect of limb immobilization on the growth of different bones was recently shown to depend on the time of treatment in chicken and crocodile embryos (Pollard et al., Sci Rep 2017). We have included this possibility in the discussion.</p><p> <italic>5) The implications for normal neonatal growth, particularly between days one – twelve is not clear in the discussion and would benefit from further elaboration.</italic></p><p>We agree that this is an important point, and while in the original manuscript we briefly discussed the potential role of the fat pad in the establishment of body proportions and allometric growth during the normal early postnatal period, we have now expanded the discussion to make this implication more clear. We have also added a developmental description of fat pad formation and the temporal correlation between <italic>Igf1</italic> expression in this tissue and the period in which the hindlimb grows faster than the forelimb in mice (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, we have included in the Discussion the possibility that the fat pad, and/or other local tissues hosting cells with osteochondrogenic potential, such as the synovium, bone marrow or the perichondrial groove of Ranvier (Yang et al., Nature 2013, Karlsson et al., J. of Anatomy 2009, Hindle et al., Stem Cells Transl Med 2017; Chung and Xian, J. Mol. Endocrinology 2014), do not only contribute with paracrine signals to bone growth, but also with progenitor cells*, such that cell death within these tissues in <italic>PitDTR</italic> mice depletes the pool of cells that could potentially participate in recovery of the affected bones. * (see for example Fig. S9 in Yang et al. Nature 2013)</p></body></sub-article></article>
