This process relies on the evolutionary conserved histone chaperone CAF-1 for which the links between structure and functions are still a puzzle. While studies of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> CAF-1 complex enabled to propose a model for the histone deposition mechanism, we still lack a framework to demonstrate its generality and in particular, how its interaction with the polymerase accessory factor PCNA is operating. Here, we reconstituted a complete <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 from fission yeast. We characterized its dynamic structure using NMR, SAXS and molecular modeling together with in vitro and in vivo functional studies on rationally designed interaction mutants. Importantly, we identify the unfolded nature of the acidic domain which folds up when binding to histones. We also show how the long KER helix mediates DNA binding and stimulates <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 association with PCNA. Our study highlights how the organization of CAF-1 comprising both disordered regions and folded modules enables the dynamics of multiple interactions to promote synthesis-coupled histone deposition essential for its DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and genome stability functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>histone chaperone</kwd><kwd>Nucleosome assembly</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd><kwd>genome integrity</kwd><kwd>nmr</kwd><kwd>saxs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-1-PL BIO-03-CEA1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Audin</surname><given-names>Maxime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE11-0028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouasti</surname><given-names>Fouad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-20-CE18-0038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tachekort</surname><given-names>Mehdi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016-1-PLBIO-03-ICR-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Soumana-Amadou</surname><given-names>Ibrahim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone, PCNA, and DNA binding are essential for CAF-1 functions in preventing DNA damage during DNA replication in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, while its C-terminal domain specifies distinct cellular processes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is packaged in a dynamic nucleoprotein complex, the chromatin, which protects DNA and regulates its accessibility. The fundamental repeat unit of chromatin, the nucleosome core particle, comprises 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer including a tetramer of histone H3−H4 flanked by two dimers of H2A−H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). Histone chaperones are critical players in ensuring histone traffic and deposition. Without energy consumption, they escort histones, facilitate their transfer and deposition on DNA, and provide links with DNA based-processes such as DNA replication, repair, and gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref>). In line with these key properties, perturbations of histone chaperones are associated with defects in genome and epigenome maintenance and function as found in cancer, aging, and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yi and Kim, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sultana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ray-Gallet and Almouzni, 2022</xref>). Discovered over 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>), conserved in all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loyola and Almouzni, 2004</xref>), the histone chaperone <underline>C</underline>hromatin <underline>A</underline>ssembly <underline>F</underline>actor 1 (CAF-1) is central and unique in promoting the deposition of replicative histones H3−H4 in a manner coupled to DNA synthesis, that is during DNA replication and repair, and is also involved in heterochromatin maintenance (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ridgway and Almouzni, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gurard-Levin et al., 2014</xref> for review). The unique feature of CAF-1 is that it provides a link with DNA synthesis via its association with the trimeric DNA polymerase processivity factor, proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), through <underline>P</underline>CNA <underline>I</underline>nteracting <underline>P</underline>rotein motifs (PIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shibahara and Stillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moggs et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rolef Ben-Shahar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pietrobon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gopinathan Nair et al., 2022</xref>), but the precise function of this interaction remains to be examined.</p><p>CAF-1 comprises three subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dohke et al., 2008</xref>). While progress in uncovering its molecular/genetic properties derives from work in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> and biochemical work in human cells, there is still a lack of atomic information for the complex. In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> CAF-1 is a hetero-trimer that binds to a single dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mattiroli et al., 2017a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>). The current model states that histone binding induces a conformational rearrangement promoting its interaction with the DNA. Two complexes must co-associate to ensure the deposition of H3−H4 tetramers on DNA in the first step of nucleosome assembly (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sauer et al., 2018</xref> for review). Two domains of the large subunit Cac1 contribute to DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>), the conserved low complexity region called KER (for Lys, Glu, and Arg rich) and the C-terminal <underline>W</underline>inged <underline>H</underline>elix <underline>D</underline>omain (WHD). These features are conserved in human CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gopinathan Nair et al., 2022</xref>). However, a comprehensive and dynamic view of the CAF-1 complex is still missing, and most critically understanding how the functional domains cooperate to ensure efficient histone deposition coupled to DNA synthesis remains to be determined. Moreover, the degree of conservation of these properties across species and possible connections with heterochromatin regulation elements such as histone H3K9 trimetylation and HP1 recruitment remain unknown.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The large <italic>SpCAF-1</italic> subunit includes four Intrinsically Disordered Regions (IDR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Names for the large, medium and small subunits of CAF-1 in <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>.

Based on novel structural insights, we designed targeted mutations to specifically identify the key features promoting Pcf1 interactions with DNA, PCNA and histones H3−H4. We next monitored functional impacts of these mutations in vitro and in vivo by analysing the phenotypes of the corresponding mutants in fission yeast. We show that disordered or partly disordered segments of the large subunit of CAF-1 are key for interactions with H3−H4 and DNA, underscoring the dynamic nature of the binding interface between CAF-1, histones H3−H4, and DNA. Upon histone binding, the acidic domain (ED) of the large subunit folds and this conformational changes impact CAF-1-PCNA interaction in vivo. We propose that such conformational changes upon histone binding contribute to PCNA/CAF1 recycling during DNA replication. We further show that PCNA binding accelerates nucleosome assembly in vitro and is also essential for the proper targeting of the complex to the chromatin in vivo. Finally, we found that the WHD C-terminal domain does not bind DNA but allows to uncouple the unique functions of CAF-1 in replication-dependent chromatin assembly, genome stability and heterochromatin maintenance. We suggest that this domain contributes to specify CAF-1 functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global organization of the full-length <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex</title><p>The large subunit of CAF-1, present in all major groups of eukaryotes, exhibits significant sequence divergence (16% sequence identity between <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 and <italic>Sc</italic>Cac1 and 21% sequence identity between <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 and <italic>Hs</italic>CHAF1A/p150, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Given this high sequence divergence, conserved biochemical properties between <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 and <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 should reveal important functional features. Of particular interest, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> heterochromatin shares with human a regulation based on the recruitment of Swi6, the heterochromatin function 1 (HP1) orthologue, via histone H3K9 trimethylation. From sequence alignments, the six main conserved regions previously proposed to contribute to the nucleosome assembly activity of CAF-1 can be inferred in <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 sequence, a KER domain, a single PIP motif, an acidic domain (ED domain), the domains predicted to bind Pcf2 (2BD) and Pcf3 (3BD) and a C-terminal WHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although <italic>Sp</italic>Pcf1 is shorter than <italic>Sc</italic>Cac1 and <italic>Hs</italic>CHAF1A/p150 (544 residues instead of 606 and 956, respectively) its sequence includes a remarkable high abundance of predicted <underline>I</underline>ntrinsically <underline>D</underline>isordered <underline>R</underline>egions (IDRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These IDRs include the predicted histone-binding domain (Pcf1 ED), the PCNA (PIP motif) and the DNA binding domain (Pcf1 KER).</p><p>We produced and purified the three subunits of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 separately from bacteria and insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, materials &amp; methods). When isolated, both Pcf2 and Pcf3 are monomeric while Pcf1 forms large soluble oligomers. Mixing the subunits by pairs, we observed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), stable complexes for Pcf1-Pcf2 and Pcf1-Pcf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Pcf2 and Pcf3 did not interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) suggesting that the large subunit Pcf1 mediates the complex assembly. We next reconstituted and isolated the recombinant full-length (FL) <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex by SEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An experimental molecular weight of 179 kDa was calculated using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Assuming an accuracy of around 10% with this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rambo and Tainer, 2013</xref>), this value is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the CAF-1 complex (calculated MW 167 kDa; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). In addition, the position of the maximum for the dimensionless Kratky plot was slightly shifted to higher values in the y and x axis compared to the position of the expected maximum of the curve for a fully globular protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This shows that the complex was globular with a significant flexibility.</p><p>To determine the extent of disorder in the large subunit of <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1, Pcf1 was produced with uniform <sup>15</sup>N (or <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>13</sup>C) labeling. The CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1) complex with unlabeled Pcf2 and Pcf3 was reconstituted and SEC-purified. Given the size of this complex (167 kDa), we expected that only amide signals from residues in long disordered regions could be observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H spectrum shows about 140 amide signals, revealing that up to a quarter of Pcf1 residues are intrinsically disordered in the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These residues are located in four continuous segments of Pcf1 and define <underline>I</underline>ntrinsically <underline>D</underline>isordered <underline>R</underline>egions that we labeled IDR1 to IDR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). IDR1 corresponds to the ~50 N-terminal residues of the protein, IDR2 (181-198) is located between the PIP motif and the 3BD region, IDR3 (355-394) overlaps a large segment of the acidic ED domain and IDR4 (451-470) is located between the 2BD region and the C-terminal WHD domain. The boundaries of the four IDRs are in agreement with the segments of Pcf1 predicted to harbor disorder with a high probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next built a model of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex using the AlphaFold2 multimer software (AF2) with one copy of each FL protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The model is consistent with our biochemical data showing that Pcf1 mediates the complex assembly. Also, in agreement with their disordered nature, low values around 0.2–0.3 of the local quality of the model as calculated by the Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) were obtained in the four IDR segments with a remarkable match for the delimitations of the four IDR segments by pLDDT values and NMR data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Accordingly, these segments are symbolized with a dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. In contrast, significantly high pLDDT was obtained for the 3BD, 2BD and WHD domains of Pcf1 and for the two subunits Pcf2 and Pcf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). These data allowed to identify four independent modules, not predicted to interact with each other. The first module corresponds to the KER domain of Pcf1, predicted to form a long helix ending by the PIP motif. The second module contains the Pcf2 subunit, composed of 7 WD repeats arranged in a circular fold, and a segment of Pcf1 corresponding to the 2BD domain forming three short beta strands and a short helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the third module, the 3BD domain of Pcf1 composed of seven helices and three beta strands establishes a large interface with Pcf3, composed of seven circular WD repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). The fourth domain is the WHD domain. We next used these models to fit our SAXS data allowing flexibility between the four modules. The best model fitted the experimental data with a high accuracy and is in agreement with a relatively globular complex. Superimposing the generated models did not define a unique orientation between the four modules, suggesting that the complex has an inter-module flexibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our findings indicate that the large subunit Pcf1 mediates the (1:1:1) complex assembly.

To further characterize this domain, we designed a short construct of Pcf1 (325-396), called Pcf1_ED, corresponding to the IDR3 segment extended in its N-terminus with the conserved acidic segment (325-355; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We confirmed the fully disordered nature of Pcf1_ED by NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).

In contrast, only a shorter fragment (338-347) vanished upon addition of Asf1−H3−H4−Mcm2(69-138), a histone complex preformed with two other histone chaperones, Asf1 and Mcm2, known to compete with CAF-1 for histone binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauer et al., 2017</xref>) and whose histone binding modes are well established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richet et al., 2015</xref>). This finding underscores a direct competition between residues (325-338) and (349-396) within the ED domain and Asf1/Mcm2 for histone binding. Fully consistent with this NMR competition experiment, the segment (353-385) of Pcf1_ED domain was predicted by AlphaFold2 to interact with histones H3−H4 through the same surface as the one bound by Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Two highly conserved positions in Pcf1, L359 and F380, are thus proposed to mediate histone H3−H4 binding in the same region as Mcm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We next used these AlphaFold2 models to fit the SAXS curve of the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1−H3−H4 complex allowing reorientation of the different modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C–D</xref>).

In order to alter the interaction of the ED domain with histones without modifying its charge and without interfering with Asf1 or Mcm2 binding, we identified from sequence alignments in this segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), two invariant hydrophobic residues, Y340 and W348, that were mutated into alanines (mutant called ED*, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, the isolated Pcf1_ED* domain showed almost no histone binding as observed by the intensity of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N NMR signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We next monitored the impact of the ED* mutations in the context of the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex. To do so, the mutations Y340A-W348A were introduced in the full length Pcf1, and the complex reconstituted with the uniformly <sup>15</sup>N labeled Pcf1-ED* and unlabeled Pcf2 and Pcf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

We were thus interested to explore the conservation of these features in Pcf1. We first isolated the KER domain (Pcf1_KER, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and an extended fragment we called Pcf1_KER-PIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which includes the PIP motif (Q<sub>172</sub>-L-K-L<sub>175</sub>-N-N-F<sub>178</sub>-F<sub>179</sub>). These domains are predicted by AlphaFold2 to form a long helix with partial disorder at both ends and possible extension over the first half of the PIP motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Using a combination of circular dichroism (CD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), SEC-SAXS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>), we confirmed that the isolated KER domain of Pcf1 domain forms a straight monomeric helix, partially continuing over the PIP motif. This long helix exhibits a strong bias in amino acid composition and remarkably, almost all basic residues are positioned on the same side of the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) providing a suitable interface for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gopinathan Nair et al., 2022</xref>). We performed EMSA using a DNA ladder as substrate and we found that Pcf1_KER domain binds DNA that are longer than 40 bp, as observed with the full <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). EMSAs with double strand 40 bp DNA fragment showed the presence of multiple bands for Pcf1_KER bound DNA, indicating a possible cooperative DNA binding of this fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Affinity measurements by MST led to a EC50 of 1.1±0.2 µM for Pcf1_KER with a cooperativity around 3, consistent with EMSA experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The DNA binding properties of Pcf1_KER-PIP are comparable to that of Pcf1_KER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

The CD analysis of Pcf1_KER* shows this mutant is mainly helical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Importantly, this mutant also shows a lower binding cooperativity for DNA binding, as estimated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1, compared to values around 3 for the WT and other mutants. In addition, the NMR signals of all IDR for this mutant with or without histones were close to that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>) indicating that the KER* mutation did not impair histone binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The C-terminal of Pcf1 folds as a WHD domain but does not bind DNA</title><p>We next isolated the Pcf1_WHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and confirmed by NMR and AlphaFold2 that its global fold is similar to <italic>Sc</italic>WHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

We first measured by isothermal microcalorimetry (ITC) an affinity of 7.1±1.3 µM between <italic>Sp</italic>PCNA and a short PIP motif segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

ITC also fits a stoichiometry of ~2 Pcf1_KER-PIP per PCNA trimer, suggesting that, in each PCNA trimer, one monomer remains unbound and potentially accessible for binding to other partners. Pcf1_KER-PIP* did not interact with PCNA confirming the importance of the PIP motif for this association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Unlike <italic>Sc</italic>CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mattiroli et al., 2017b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mattiroli et al., 2017a</xref>) and <italic>Hs</italic>CAF-1<sup>28</sup>, Pcf1_WHD did not bind DNA nor the ED domain (which remains fully disordered) in the free chaperone. Nevertheless, on the NMR spectra of the free and histone bound <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1(<sup>15</sup>N-Pcf1), the resonances of the isolated WHD domain are not present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>), in agreement with a restricted movement of this domain that could likely interacts with other folded parts of the complex. In vitro, we found no impact of the WHD deletion on CAF-1 interaction with DNA, histones or PCNA, but the <italic>Sp</italic>CAF-1-∆WHD was deficient for histone deposition. Thus, the synthetic lethality of this mutant with <italic>hip1</italic> most likely reflects a replication-coupled assembly defect. Unexpectedly, this defect does not cause a problem of heterochromatin maintenance or damage accumulation, showing that the multiple functions of CAF-1 in replication-dependent nucleosome assembly, genome stability and heterochromatin maintenance can be uncoupled thanks to the WHD domain contributing to specify CAF-1 functions. Further investigations will be necessary to understand the role of this domain.</p><p>We reveal that disorder is a fundamental feature of Pcf1 supporting its molecular functions. First, the ED domain is disordered in the FL complex and folds upon histone binding. Second, four IDRs demarcate specific domains within Pcf1. We believe that these unfolded regions provide unique ‘plasticity’ properties to Pcf1 allowing these domains to bind concomitantly their multiple specific partners (Pcf1, Pcf3, PCNA, DNA, and histones). We also reveal that although these domains individually bind their specific partners, there is an important crosstalk between them as exemplified by the fact that DNA stabilizes the CAF-1−PCNA interaction. Such plasticity and cross-talks provided by structurally disordered domains might be key for the multivalent CAF-1 functions. Human CAF-1 has been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2021</xref>). This raises the question of a potential role of the disordered domains of Pcf1, together with other replisome factor harboring such disordered regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedina, 2013</xref>), in promoting phase separation of replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Further studies will be needed to tackle these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid preparation for recombinant protein production</title><p>The cDNA sequence of WT Pcf1 (codon optimized for <italic>E. coli</italic> expression) was synthetized and inserted into the pCM153 plasmid to obtain the recombinant MBP–6His-TEV cleavage site-Pcf1 protein (named MBP-Pcf1 below).

These functions play a critical role in specifying interactions vital for DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and DNA damage repair, and their dynamics involve multiple interactions. The authors have extensively utilized various in vitro and in vivo tools to validate their model and emphasize the dynamic nature of this complex.</p><p>Strengths: Their work is supported by robust experimental data from multiple techniques, including NMR and SAXS, which validate their molecular model. They conducted in vitro interactions using EMSA and isothermal microcalorimetry, in vitro histone deposition using <italic>Xenopus</italic> high-speed egg extract, and systematically generated and tested various genetic mutants for functionality in in vivo assays. They successfully delineated domain-specific functions using in vitro assays and could validate their roles to large extent using genetic mutants. One significant revelation from this study is the unfolded nature of the acidic domain, observed to fold when binding to histones. Additionally, the authors also elucidated the role of the long KER helix in mediating DNA binding and enhancing the association of CAF-1 with PCNA. The paper effectively addresses its primary objective.</p><p>Weaknesses: A few relatively minor unresolved aspects persist, which, if clarified or experimentally addressed by the authors, could further bolster the study.</p><p>1. The precise function of the WHD domain remains elusive. Its deletion does not result in DNA damage accumulation or defects in heterochromatin maintenance. This raises questions about the biological significance of this domain and whether it is dispensable. While in vitro assays revealed defects in chromatin assembly using this mutant (Figure 5), confirming these phenotypes through in vivo assays would provide additional assurance that the lack of function is not simply due to the in vitro system lacking PTMs or other regulatory factors.</p><p>2. The observation of increased Pcf2-gfp foci in pcf1-ED* cells, particularly in mono-nucleated (G2-phase) and bi-nucleated cells with septum marks (S-phase), might suggest the presence of replication stress. This could imply incomplete replication in specific regions, leading to the persistence of Caf1-ED*-PCNA factories throughout the cell cycle. To further confirm this, detecting accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions outside of S-phase using RPA as an ssDNA marker could be informative.</p><p>3. Moreover, considering the authors' strong assertion of histone binding defects in ED* through in vitro assays (Figure 2d and S2a), these claims could be further substantiated, especially considering that some degree of histone deposition might still persist in vivo in the ED* mutant (Figure 7d, viable though growth defective double ED*+hip1D mutants). For example, the approach, akin to the one employed in Fig. 6a (FLAG-IPs of various Pcf1-FLAG-tagged mutants), could also enable a comparison of the association of different mutants with histones and PCNA, providing a more thorough validation of their findings.</p><p>4. It would be valuable for the authors to speculate on the necessity of having disordered regions in CAF1. Specifically, exploring the overall distribution of these domains within disordered/unfolded structures could provide insightful perspectives. Additionally, it's intriguing to note that the significant disparities observed among mutants (ED*, PIP*, and KER*) in in vitro assays seem to become more generic in vivo, except for the indispensability of the WHD-domain. Could these disordered regions potentially play a crucial role in the phase separation of replication factories? Considering these questions could offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id

is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the three reviewers and the reviewing editor for their positive evaluation of our manuscript. We particularly appreciate that they unanimously consider our work as “important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works”, “The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well” and “The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong”. We also thank them for a careful reading and useful comments to improve the manuscript. We have built on these comments to provide an improved version of the manuscript, and address them point by point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper makes important contributions to the structural analysis of the DNA replication-linked nucleosome assembly machine termed Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 (CAF-1). The authors focus on the interplay of domains that bind DNA, histones, and replication clamp protein PCNA.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors analyze soluble complexes containing full-length versions of all three fission yeast CAF-1 subunits, an important accomplishment given that many previous structural and biophysical studies have focused on truncated complexes. New data here supports previous experiments indicating that the KER domain is a long alpha helix that binds DNA. Via NMR, the authors discover structural changes at the histone binding site, defined here with high resolution. Most strikingly, the experiments here show that for the <italic>S. pombe</italic> CAF-1 complex, the WHD domain at the C-terminus of the large subunit lacks DNA binding activity observed in the human and budding yeast homologs, indicating a surprising divergence in the evolution of this complex. Together, these are important contributions to the understanding of how the CAF-1 complex works.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. There are some aspects of the experimentation that are incompletely described:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her careful reading of the manuscript. Indeed, we plotted two curves in Figure S1C in a color that does not match the legend, leading to confusion. Curve 1, Pcf1 alone, depicted in red, should appear in pink as indicated in the legend and in the SDS-PAGE analysis below. Curve 1 exhibits two peaks, labeled as 1a and 1b. With an elution volume of 8.5mL close to the dead volume of the column, peak 1a corresponds to soluble oligomers, while peak 1b (10.4mL) likely corresponds to monomeric Pcf1. Curve 5 (Pcf1 + Pcf2 mixture) was in pink instead of purple as indicated in the legend. This curve consists of three distinct peaks (5a, 5b, and 5c). The SDS-PAGE analysis revealed the presence of oligomers of Pcf1-Pcf2 (5a, 8.3mL), the Pcf1-Pcf2 complex (5b, 9.8mL), and Pcf2 alone (5c, 13.6 mL).</p><p>The color has now been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More importantly, was a particular SEC peak of the three-subunit CAF-1 complex (i.e. 4a or 4b) characterized in the further experimentation, or were the data obtained from the input material prior to the separation of the different peaks? If the latter, how might this have affected the results? Do the forms inter-convert spontaneously?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted all structural analyses and DNA/PCNA interactions Figures (1-4, S1-S4) with freshly SECpurified samples corresponding to the 4b peak (9.7mL). Aliquots were flash-frozen with 50% glycerol for in vitro histone assembly assays (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Given the strong structural predication about the roles of residues L359 and F380 (Fig. 2f), these should be mutated to determine effects on histone binding.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased that our structural predictions are considered as strong. We agree that investigating the role of the L359 and F380 residues will be critical to further refine the binding interface between histone H3-H4 and CAF-1. An in vitro and in vivo analysis of such mutated forms, alongside the current Pcf1-ED mutant characterized in this article and additional potential mutated forms, has the potential to provide a better understanding of the dynamic of histone deposition by CAF-1. However, these additional approaches would require to reach another step in breaking this enigmatic dynamic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Could it be that the apparent lack of histone deposition by the delta-WHD mutant complex occurs because this mutant complex is unstable when added to the <italic>Xenopus</italic> extract?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot formally exclude this possibility, and this could potentially applies to all mutated forms tested. However, in the absence of available antibodies against the fission yeast CAF-1 complex, we cannot test this hypothesis for technical reasons. Nevertheless, we feel reassured by the fact that the in vitro assays of nucleosome assembly are overall consistent with the in vivo assays. Indeed, all mutated forms tested that abolished or weakened nucleosome assembly also exhibited synthetic lethality/growth defect in the absence of a functional HIRA pathway, including the delta WHD mutated form. This genetic synergy, that reflects a defective histone deposition by CAF-1, is not specific to the fission yeast <italic>S. pombe</italic> and was previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002). This further supports the evolutionary conservation based on genetic assay as a read out for defective histone deposition by CAF-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>p. 4: &quot;An experimental molecular weight of 179 kDa was calculated using Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (Figure S1e).

Assuming an accuracy of around 10% with this method (Rambo and Tainer 2013), this value is consistent with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry for the CAF-1 complex (calculated MW 167kDa) (Figure S1e).

This finding underscores a direct competition between residues (325-338) and (349-396) within the ED domain and Asf1/Mcm2 for histone binding.”</p><p>The slight shift in the numerical scale Figure 2d was also corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>p. 8.

The authors nicely showed that the ED domain with an intrinsically disordered structure binds to histone H3-H4, that the KER domain binds to DNA, and that, in addition to a PIP box, the KER domain also contributes to the PCNA binding. The ED and KER domains as well as the WHD domain are essential for nucleosome assembly in vitro. The ED, KER domains, and the PIP box are important for the maintenance of heterochromatin.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The combination of structural analysis using NMR and Alphafold2 modeling with biophysical and biochemical analysis provided strong evidence on the role of the different domain structures of the large subunit of SpCAF-1, spPCF-1 in the binding to histone H3-H4, DNA as well as PCNA. The conclusion was further supported by genetic analysis of the various pcf1 mutants. The large amounts of data provided in the paper support the authors' conclusion very well.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The paper by Ochesenbein describes the structural and functional analysis of <italic>S. pombe</italic> CAF-1 complex critical for DNA replication-coupled histone H3/H4 deposition. By using structural, biophysical, and biochemical analyses combined with genetic methods, the authors nicely showed that a large subunit of SpCAF1, SpPCF-1, consists of 5 structured domains with four connecting IDR domains. The ED domain with IDR nature binds to histone H3-H4 dimer with the conformational change of the other domain(s). SpCAF-1 binds to dsDNA by using the KER domain, but not the WHD domain. The experiments have been done with great care and a large amount of the data are highly reliable. Moreover, the results are clearly presented and convincingly written. The conclusion in the paper is very solid and will be useful for researchers who work in the field of chromosome biology.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1. DNA binding of the KER mutant shown in Figures S3h and S3i, which was measured by the EMSA, looks similar to that of wild-type control in Figure S3f, which is different from the data in Figures 3b and 3e measured by the MST. The authors need a more precise description of the EMSA result of the KER mutant shown in Figures 3 and S3. The quantification of the EMSA result would resolve the point (should be provided).</p></disp-quote><p>A proposed by this reviewer, we performed quantification of all EMSA presented in Figure 3 and Figure S3. We quantified the signal of the free DNA band to calculate a percentage of bound DNA in each condition. All EMSA experiments were conducted in duplicate, allowing us to calculate an average value and standard deviation for each interaction. Representative curves and fitted values are reported below in the figure provided for the reviewer (panel a data for Pcf1_KER domain with two fitting models, panel b for the entire CAF-1 complexes and mutants, panel c for the isolated Pcf1_KER domains), all fitted values in panel d. Importantly, as illustrated in panel a, the complete model for a single interaction (complete KD model, dashed line curve) does not adequately fit the data. In contrast, a function incorporating cooperativity (Hill model) better accounts for the measured data (solid line curve). Consistently, we also used the Hill model to fit the binding curves measured with the MST technique. As also specified now in the text, the Hill model allows to determine an EC50 value (concentration of protein resulting in the disappearance of half of the free DNA band intensity) and a Hill coefficient value (representing cooperativity during the interaction) for each curve.</p><p>We measure a value of 3.4 ± 0.4 μM for the EC50 of SpCAF-1 WT, which is higher than the value measured by MST (0.7 ± 0.1 μM). Higher values were also calculated for all mutants and isolated Pcf1_KER domains compared to MST. These discrepancies could raise from the fact that the DNA concentration used in the two techniques were very different (20nM for MST experiments and 1μM for EMSA). Unlike the complete KD model, which includes in the calculation the DNA concentration (considered here as the &quot;receptor&quot;), the Hill model is fitted independently of this value. This model assumes that the “receptor” concentration is low compared to the KD. Here we calculate EC50 values on the same order of magnitude as the DNA concentration (low micromolar), The quantification obtained by EMSA is thus challenging to interpret. In contrast, values fitted by the MST measurements are more reliable since this limitation of low “receptor” concentration is correct.</p><p>Therefore, although measurements of EC50 and Hill coefficient from EMSA are reproducible, they may be confusing for quantifying apparent affinity values through EC50. Nevertheless, this quantitative analysis of EMSA, requested by the reviewer, has highlighted an interesting characteristic of the KER* mutant that is consistent across both methods: even though the EMSA pointed by the reviewer (Figures S3h and S3i compared to the wild-type control in Figure 3d and Figure S3f) show similar EC50 values, the binding cooperativity is different. Binding curves for the KER* mutants is no longer cooperative (Hill coefficient ~1), and this is observed for all KER* curves (isolated Pcf1_KER domain and the entire SpCAF-1 complex) with both methods, EMSA and MST. We thus decided to emphasize this characteristic of the KER* mutant in the text (page 9 line 30-32). “Importantly, this mutant also shows a lower binding cooperativity for DNA binding, as estimated by the Hill coefficient value close to 1, compared to values around 3 for the WT and other mutants.”</p><p>Since EMSA quantifications did not show a loss of “affinity” (as measured by the EC50 value) for the KER* mutants, compared to the WT contrary to MST measurements and because the DNA concentration was close to the measured EC50, we consider that EC50 values calculated by EMSA do not represent a KD value. If we add this quantification, we should discuss this point in detail. Thus, for sake of clarity, we prefer to put in the manuscript EMSA measurements as illustrations and qualitative validations of the interaction but not to include the quantification.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of interaction with DNA by EMSA.</title><p>a: quantification of the amount of bound DNA for the Pcf1_KER domain (blue points with error bars).

As with the cooperative DNA binding of CAF-1, it is very important to show the stoichiometry of CAF-1 to the DNA or the site size. Given a long alpha-helix of the KER domain with biased charges, it is also interesting to show a model of how the dsDNA binds to the long helix with a cooperative binding property (this is not essential but would be helpful if the authors discuss it).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that having a molecular model for the binding of the KER helix to DNA would be especially interesting, but at this point, considering the accuracy of the tools currently at our disposal for predicting DNA-protein interactions, such a model would remain highly speculative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 5 shows nucleosome assembly by SpCAF-1. SpCAF-1-PIP* mutant produced a product with faster mobility than the control at 2 h incubation. How much amounts of SpCAF-1 was added in the reaction seems to be critical. At least a few different concentrations of proteins should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>The slightly faster migration of the SpCAF-1-PIP<italic>is not systematically reproduced and we observed in several experiments that the band corresponding to supercoiled DNA migrated slightly above or below the one for the complementation by the SpCAF-1-WT (see Author response image 2 below). Thus this indicates that after 2 hours incubation the supercoiling assay with the SpCAF-1-PIP</italic> mutant compared to those achieved with the SpCAF-1-WT. To further document whether the WT or the PIP mutant are similar or not, we monitored difference of their nucleosome assembly efficiency by testing their ability to produce supercoiled DNA over shorter time, after 45 min incubation. Under these conditions, we reproducibly detected supercoiled forms at earlier times with SpCAF-1-WT when compared to the SpCAF-1-PIP* (see figure 5 and Author response image 2). These observations indicate that mutation in the PIP motif of Pcf1 affects the rate of supercoiling in a distinct manner when compared to the other mutations that dramatically impair SpCAF-1 capacity to promote supercoiling.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91461-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>1.

These functions play a critical role in specifying interactions vital for DNA replication, heterochromatin maintenance, and DNA damage repair, and their dynamics involve multiple interactions. The authors have extensively utilized various in vitro and in vivo tools to validate their model and emphasize the dynamic nature of this complex.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Their work is supported by robust experimental data from multiple techniques, including NMR and SAXS, which validate their molecular model. They conducted in vitro interactions using EMSA and isothermal microcalorimetry, in vitro histone deposition using <italic>Xenopus</italic> high-speed egg extract, and systematically generated and tested various genetic mutants for functionality in in vivo assays. They successfully delineated domain-specific functions using in vitro assays and could validate their roles to large extent using genetic mutants. One significant revelation from this study is the unfolded nature of the acidic domain, observed to fold when binding to histones. Additionally, the authors also elucidated the role of the long KER helix in mediating DNA binding and enhancing the association of CAF-1 with PCNA. The paper effectively addresses its primary objective and is strong.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A few relatively minor unresolved aspects persist, which, if clarified or experimentally addressed by the authors, could further bolster the study.</p><p>1. The precise function of the WHD domain remains elusive. Its deletion does not result in DNA damage accumulation or defects in heterochromatin maintenance. This raises questions about the biological significance of this domain and whether it is dispensable. While in vitro assays revealed defects in chromatin assembly using this mutant (Figure 5), confirming these phenotypes through in vivo assays would provide additional assurance that the lack of function is not simply due to the in vitro system lacking PTMs or other regulatory factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Our work demonstrates that the WHD domain is important CAF-1 function during DNA replication. Indeed, the deletion of this domain lead to a synthetic lethality when combined with mutation of the HIRA complex, as observed for a null pcf1 mutant, indicating a severe loss of function in the absence of the WHD domain. We propose that these genetic interactions, previously reported in S. cerevisiae (Kaufman et al. MCB 1998; Krawitz et al. MCB 2002) are indicative of a defective histone deposition by CAF-1. Moreover, our work establishes that this domain is dispensable to prevent DNA damage accumulation and to maintain silencing at centromeric heterochromatin, indicating that the WHD domain specifies CAF-1 functions. Moreover, our work further demonstrates that, in contrast to the S. cerevisiae and human WHD domain, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> counterpart exhibits no DNA binding activity. We thus agree that the WHD domain may contribute to nucleosome assembly in vivo via PTMs or interactions with regulatory factors that may potentially lack in in vitro systems. However, addressing these aspects deserves further investigations beyond the scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The observation of increased Pcf2-gfp foci in pcf1-ED* cells, particularly in mono-nucleated (G2phase) and bi-nucleated cells with septum marks (S-phase), might suggest the presence of replication stress. This could imply incomplete replication in specific regions, leading to the persistence of Caf1-ED*-PCNA factories throughout the cell cycle. To further confirm this, detecting accumulated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) regions outside of S-phase using RPA as an ssDNA marker could be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot formally exclude that cells expressing the Pcf1-ED mutated form exhibit incomplete replication in specific regions, an aspect that would require careful investigations. However, the microscopy analysis (Fig. 6c and S6c) of this mutant showed no alteration in the cell morphology, including the absence of elongated cells compared to wild type, a hallmark of checkpoint activation caused by ssDNA (Enoch et al. Gene &amp; Dev 1992). Therefore, investigating the consequences of the interplay between the binding of CAF-1 to PCNA and histones on the dynamic of DNA replication, is of particular interest but out of the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Moreover, considering the authors' strong assertion of histone binding defects in ED* through in vitro assays (Figure 2d and S2a), these claims could be further substantiated, especially considering that some degree of histone deposition might still persist in vivo in the ED* mutant (Figure 7d, viable though growth defective double ED*+hip1D mutants). For example, the approach, akin to the one employed in Fig. 6a (FLAG-IPs of various Pcf1-FLAG-tagged mutants), could also enable a comparison of the association of different mutants with histones and PCNA, providing a more thorough validation of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided in the current manuscript data establishing how Pcf1 mutated forms interacted with PCNA (Fig. 6a, 6b). Regarding the interactions with histone H3-H4, the approach based on immunoprecipitation using various Pcf1-FLAG tagged mutants has been unsuccessful in our hands. Indeed, we were unable to obtain robust and reproducible interactions between Pcf1 or its various mutated form with H3-H4. This is likely because Co-IP approaches do not probe for direct interactions. Indirect interactions between Pcf1 and H3-H4 are potentially bridged by additional factors, including the two other subunits of CAF-1, Pcf2 and Pcf3, or Asf1. Therefore, we are not in a position to address in vivo the direct interactions between Pcf1 and histone H3-H4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It would be valuable for the authors to speculate on the necessity of having disordered regions in CAF1. Specifically, exploring the overall distribution of these domains within disordered/unfolded structures could provide insightful perspectives. Additionally, it's intriguing to note that the significant disparities observed among mutants (ED<italic>, PIP</italic>, and KER*) in in vitro assays seem to become more generic in vivo, except for the indispensability of the WHD-domain. Could these disordered regions potentially play a crucial role in the phase separation of replication factories? Considering these questions could offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms at play.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the potential mechanistic role of partial disorder in CAF-1 is particularly interesting. Disordered regions of human CAF-1 have been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al EMBO J. 2021). As suggested, this raises the question of how disordered domains of Pcf1 could promote phase separation for replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Moreover, numerous factors of the replisome also harbor disordered regions (Bedina, A. et al, 2013. Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in Replication Process. InTech. doi:10.5772/51673), adding complexity in disentangling experimentally such questions. We have added these elements at the end of the discussion in the revised manuscript (page 20, lines 23-29). “Such plasticity and cross-talks provided by structurally disordered domains might be key for the multivalent CAF-1 functions. Human CAF-1 has been reported to form nuclear bodies with liquid-liquid phase separation properties to maintain HIV latency (Ma et al. 2021). This raises the question of a potential role of the disordered domains of Pcf1, together with other replisome factor harbouring such disordered regions (Bedina 2013), in promoting phase separation of replication factories, if such phenomenon happens in vivo. Further studies will be needed to tackle these questions.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
