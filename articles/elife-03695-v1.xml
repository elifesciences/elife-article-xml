from the bulk. Although water permeates readily across vesicular walls, passive permeation of solutes is hindered. In this study, we show that, when subject to a hypotonic bath, giant vesicles consisting of phase separating lipid mixtures undergo osmotic relaxation exhibiting damped oscillations in phase behavior, which is synchronized with swell–burst lytic cycles: in the swelled state, osmotic pressure and elevated membrane tension due to the influx of water promote domain formation. During bursting, solute leakage through transient pores relaxes the pressure and tension, replacing the domain texture by a uniform one. This isothermal phase transition—resulting from a well-coordinated sequence of mechanochemical events—suggests a complex emergent behavior allowing synthetic vesicles produced from simple components, namely, water, osmolytes, and lipids to sense and regulate their micro-environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03695.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03695.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03695.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All living cells are surrounded by a membrane that water can pass through. However, water often contains other molecules called solutes, and many of these cannot pass through the cell membrane. If the concentration of solutes outside the cell is, say, suddenly decreased, then water molecules will tend to move into the cell to lower the solute concentration there. This process, which is called osmosis, strives to equalize the solute concentrations inside and outside the cell.</p><p>Osmosis can have dramatic consequences for cells. Animal cells need to be bathed in water to survive, but if the solute concentration outside a cell is higher than inside, the cell can lose a lot of water and die. And if the solute concentration outside is lower, then water enters the cell and it can burst. Single celled microbes use a variety of strategies to counter the movement of water by osmosis: strong cell walls prevent the cell from swelling too much, and channel proteins in the membrane can be opened to allow solutes to pass through. But it is not known how more primitive cells—cells that lived billions of years ago—might have responded to fluctuations in their environment.</p><p>Oglęcka et al. have now used artificial membranes to make closed compartments called giant vesicles that mimic certain properties of cells. When giant vesicles are filled with a sugar solution and placed in water with a lower concentration of sugar, a series of events takes place that can lead to the sugar concentration inside and outside the vesicle becoming more equal.</p><p>At first the vesicle expands as water enters. However, as the membrane stretches, a temporary hole opens up, which allows some of the excess solute molecules and water to escape, shrinking the vesicle. This sets up cycles of vesicle expansion and contraction that gradually lead to the solute concentrations on both sides of the membrane becoming more equal. This cyclical expansion and contraction of the vesicle also changes the membrane, decorating it with “domains” of specialized molecules, when expanded and uniform, when shrunk.</p><p>It is possible that this process may have helped the first primitive cells to survive and, maybe, even benefit from changes in solute concentration in their environment.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03695.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03695.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>giant phospholipid vesicles</kwd><kwd>lipid rafts</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>primitive osmoregulation</kwd><kwd>compartmentalization</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-FG02-04ER46173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parikh</surname><given-names>Atul N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2009-T2-2-019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oglęcka</surname><given-names>Kamila</given-names></name><name><surname>Kraut</surname><given-names>Rachel S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Center for Biomimetic Sensor Science</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oglęcka</surname><given-names>Kamila</given-names></name><name><surname>Liedberg</surname><given-names>Bo</given-names></name><name><surname>Parikh</surname><given-names>Atul N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spontaneous osmoregulation in giant phospholipid vesicles, which is characterized by oscillations in vesicle size and membrane tension, couples to the compositional degrees of freedom at the membrane surface to produce oscillations in domain texture and induce isothermal phase change.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are the simplest cell-like closed compartments consisting of semi-permeable flexible shells (4–6 nm thick, 5–50 µm diameter), isolating femto- to pico-liter quantities of aqueous core from the surrounding bulk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walde et al., 2010</xref>). Although water permeates readily across the vesicular walls (10<sup>−2</sup>–10<sup>−3</sup> cm/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fettiplace and Haydon, 1980</xref>), passive permeation of solutes is significantly lower across the intact membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deamer and Bramhall, 1986</xref>). As a result, osmotic differentials are readily established between the compartmentalized volume and the surrounding free bath. This in turn triggers a relaxation process, which acts to reduce the osmotic pressure difference across the closed semi-permeable membrane by influx (or efflux) of water depending on the sign of the pressure differential. Thus, for osmolyte-loaded vesicles in a hypotonic environment, water permeates and vesicle swells, until the internal Laplace pressure compensates the osmotic pressure, increasing its volume to surface area ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ertel et al., 1993</xref>). In this same vein, efflux of compartmentalized water from vesicles embedded in hypertonic media, conversely, decreases the volume to surface area ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boroske et al., 1981</xref>). Furthermore, because of their large area expansion moduli (10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> mN m<sup>−1</sup>) and low bending rigidities (10<sup>−19</sup> Nm), vesicular shells bend readily but tolerate only a limited area of expansion (∼5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Needham and Nunn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hallett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seifert, 1997</xref>). Consequently, GUVs experiencing solute concentration difference across their vesicular boundary adjust their volume, deforming in hypertonic media and swelling in hypotonic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boroske et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ertel et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>A consequence of the osmotic influx of water in vesicles embedded in hypotonic media is the build-up of lateral membrane tension due to changes in the balance of forces within the bilayer producing high energy states (compared to isotonic relaxed vesicles) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Needham and Nunn, 1990</xref>). Beyond a threshold tension, rupture and pore formation become energetically favorable, lysing the GUVs at lateral tensions corresponding to ∼30–40 mNm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Needham and Nunn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ertel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mui et al., 1993</xref>). The lytic process, however, is not catastrophic; rather it follows a step-wise sequence of events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ertel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>). During each membrane rupture event, only a fraction of the intravesicular solute (and water) is released before the bilayer reseals leaving the vesicle hyperosmotic with a lower osmotic differential. This then prompts subsequent events of water influx, vesicle swelling, and rupture until sufficient intravesicular solute has been lost, and the membrane is able to withstand the residual sub-lytic osmotic pressure without collapsing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wood, 1999</xref>). Thus, GUVs in hypotonic media exhibit oscillations in their sizes—characterized by alternating modulations of vesicular volume, tension, and solute efflux—prompted by repeated cycles of swelling and bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popescu and Popescu, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the work reported here, we show that the swell–burst cycles in hypertonic vesicles consisting of domain-forming lipid mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumgart et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>) become coupled with the membrane's compositional degrees of freedom, producing a long-lived transient response characterized by damped oscillations in phase behavior at the membrane surface, cycling between the state characterized by large microscopic domains at the membrane surface and an optically uniform one. This oscillatory phase separation occurs isothermally, and it is driven by a sequence of elementary biophysical processes involving cyclical changes in osmotic pressure, membrane tension, and poration, which attend swell–burst cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koslov and Markin, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mui et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popescu and Popescu, 2008</xref>): in the swelled state, osmotic pressure and elevated membrane tension due to the influx of water promote the appearance of microscopic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayuyan and Cohen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>). During the burst phase, solute leakage through short-lived membrane poration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochard-Wyart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>) relaxes the osmotic pressure and membrane tension, breaking up the domains producing an optically uniform membrane. This cyclical pattern does not persist indefinitely: a step-wise diminution of the osmotic pressure differential, because of the solute leakage during burst events, gradually dampens the oscillations ultimately equilibrating the GUV to the residual osmotic differential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phase separation in osmotically stressed vesicles</title><p>The GUVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morales-Penningston et al., 2010</xref>) we investigated consist of ternary lipid mixtures composed of cholesterol (Ch), sphingomyelin (SM), and the unsaturated phospholipid, POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-<italic>sn</italic>-1-glycero-3-phosphocholine) at room temperature (25°C) (‘Materials and methods’). Depending on precise composition and temperature, these mixtures are known to form a uniform single phase or exhibit microscopic phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>), including one characterized by two co-existing liquid phases: a dense phase enriched in SM and Ch designated as the L<sub>o</sub> (liquid-ordered) phase and a second, less dense L<sub>d</sub> (liquid-disordered) phase consisting primarily of POPC. To discriminate between the L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phases by fluorescence microscopy, we doped our GUVs with a small concentration (0.5 mol%) of a phase sensitive probe, N-lissamine rhodamine palmitoylphosphatidyl-ethanolamine (Rho-DPPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgart et al., 2007</xref>). For an equimolar lipid (1:1:1) composition, the phase diagram predicts the absence of large microscopic domain formation at optical length scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Veatch and Keller, 2005</xref>).

As water enters, the GUV swells ironing out the thermal undulations and rendering the vesicular boundary tense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haleva and Diamant, 2008</xref>).

Although both lateral tension and pressure difference influence membrane phase behavior in our osmotically driven case, it is instructive to consider how each of the two factors individually affects membrane phase behavior. A recent thermodynamic analysis and experiments examining the effects of mechanically generated tension reveal a lowering of miscibility phase transition temperature between the L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phases with increase in tension (<italic>dT</italic>/<italic>dσ,</italic> ∼−1 K [mNm<sup>−1</sup>] <sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Portet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uline et al., 2012</xref>). However, how this shift in transition temperature affects membrane phase behavior and domain morphology is not obvious: a recent experimental study suggests that even tension alone can stabilize complex domain morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Santore, 2014</xref>). The current and earlier observations in which osmotic differentials induce phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>) are clearly at variance with these predictions. An alternate explanation involves separate theoretical arguments, which require pre-existing phase separated domains in the optically homogeneous state. It suggests that the lateral tension elevates line tension between co-existing phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akimov et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, although membrane tension disfavors nucleation of a new phase (by raising the energy barrier that must be met for the formation of critical nuclei), it can promote coalescence of small pre-existing nanoscale domains driven by minimization of line tension between L<sub>o</sub> and L<sub>d</sub> phase. Additional experiments using ternary lipid mixtures (DOPC, DPPC, and Chol), which have been thought not to produce nanodomains at temperatures above 20°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>), also produces oscillatory phase behavior (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). This then suggests that the osmotically generated tension alone might be insufficient to explain the observed osmotically induced isothermal phase transition, and that the non-ideality in mixing is likely a consequence of a combined effect of the pressure and tension. Indeed, a theoretical model by Givli and Bhattacharya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Givli et al., 2012</xref>), explicitly introducing osmotic pressure contributions within the generalized Helfrich energy treatment, suggests that pressure can perturb isothermal phase diagram, driving domain formation primarily by affecting the interaction between geometry and composition.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03695.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms responsible for oscillatory phase separation in GUVs subject to osmotic differentials.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Domain coarsening</italic>.

A closer look at the temporal dynamics reveals that the process does not persist indefinitely. The period of oscillation between optically uniform and phase-separated states increases with the passage of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). The cycle period—defined as the time elapsed between two consecutive instances of homogeneous fluorescence—increases three to 10-fold, before reaching a non-oscillating quiescent state, 60–120 min after the imposition of the osmotic differential. This ‘fatigue’ in the oscillatory phase separation process suggests that the driving force (i.e., the osmotic differential and accompanying tension) must weaken with each cycle, which requires a separate mechanism for solute efflux.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Membrane poration in osmotically tense vesicles</title><p>It is known that membrane lysis proceeds via cascades of pores during each cycle of the swell–burst sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>).

According to classical nucleation theory, the cost (<italic>E</italic>) of creating a pore in a tense membrane is determined by the competition between membrane tensional energy (−<italic>πr</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup><italic>σ</italic>) and the line tension energy (+2<italic>πrγ)</italic> at the edge of the pore. Thus, under conditions of sufficient membrane tension (<italic>dE</italic>/<italic>dr</italic> &gt; 0), pores nucleate and grow, enabling solute efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peterlin and Arrigler, 2008</xref>). Although domain formation is not required for pore-formation, the probability of pore-nucleation might be enhanced by surface defects, such as are present at the boundary between co-existing phases, since the energy required to open a pore (&gt;40 <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>B</italic></sub><italic>T</italic>) is considerably higher than the thermal activation energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>). The long life spans (∼1 s) of the pores are likely supported by two opposing processes, namely osmotic influx of water and the leakage rate of solute through the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koslov and Markin, 1984</xref>). Subsequent healing of the pore is promoted by the reduction in the net membrane area and partial loss of the encapsulated solutes, both of which reduce membrane tension, <italic>σ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>). Thus, during each membrane rupture event, only a fraction of the intravesicular solute is released before the bilayer reseals, leaving the vesicle hyperosmotic, albeit with a reduced osmotic differential. This then prompts subsequent cycles of water influx, vesicle swelling, and rupture until sufficient intravesicular solute is lost and the Laplace tension in the membrane is able to compensate for the residual osmotic pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ertel et al., 1993</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03695.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Evidence for the formation of microscopic pores during each individual cycle of oscillatory phase separation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>L</bold>) Wide-field fluorescence images of microscopic pore formation (∼5–15 µm in diameter; indicated by arrows) observed in three consecutive swell–burst cycles of a phase-separating GUV.

While large microscopic domains of co-existing liquid phases are thought to not exist in many living cells, a recent study reveals such domain texture in yeast vacuole membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toulmay and Prinz, 2013</xref>). In this study, under conditions of nutrient deprivation, pH changes, and changes in the growth medium have been shown to segregate into microscopic domains in what appears to be a sterol-dependent manner, reminiscent of synthetic giant vesicles. Since one of the functions of yeast vacuoles is to regulate osmotic pressure, it seems tempting to consider whether vacuolar domains also undergo large-scale domain reorganization under osmotic stimuli and contribute to the physiological function. The formation (and dissolution) of compositionally differentiated membrane domains (e.g., lipid rafts) is often associated with alterations in the conformations (and activity) of many signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simons and Toomre, 2000</xref>), which partition within them. It appears plausible that the domain reorganization stimulated by the osmotic activity of water might provide the cell a generic mechanism to respond to the physical perturbation, such as by activating mechanosensitive ion-channels and serving as sensors for signaling and stress transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DuFort et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stamenovic and Wang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood, 2011</xref>). <italic>Fourth</italic>, although fatty acid based prebiotic amphiphiles exhibit different mechanical properties (e.g., elastic properties and permeability characteristics) compared to phospholipids, it appears likely that amphiphilic osmoregulation, such as we witness, might have given a thermodynamic advantage to early protein-free protocells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hanczyc et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oglecka et al., 2012</xref>) to survive (and even utilize) drastic environmental osmotic shifts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Key biophysical considerations</title><p>Elementary physical mechanisms of membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fettiplace and Haydon, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deamer and Bramhall, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rawicz et al., 2008</xref>), osmotic swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taupin et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mui et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haleva and Diamant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peterlin and Arrigler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>), tension dependence of lateral phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Portet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uline et al., 2012</xref>), pressure-dependent membrane phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Givli et al., 2012</xref>), and membrane poration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Needham and Hochmuth, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhelev and Needham, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sandre et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brochard-Wyart et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karatekin et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karatekin et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levin and Idiart, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farago and Santangelo, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riske and Dimova, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Smith, 2011</xref>) have all been extensively studied and well-documented in the existing literature.

Applying van't Hoff's equation (Δ<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>osm</italic></sub> <italic>= RTΔc</italic>, where <italic>R</italic> is the gas constant and <italic>T</italic> the absolute temperature), this concentration gradient corresponds to an excess intravesicular osmotic pressure of 0.5 MPa. As a result of the pressure difference, an osmotic relaxation process sets in. Because of large differences in permeability of water (∼10<sup>−3</sup>–10<sup>−4</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>) and sucrose (∼10<sup>−8</sup> cm s<sup>−1</sup>), however, the relaxation process is determined by the significant differences in time scales for permeation of water and the solute: rapid water permeation governs the response of the solute-encapsulating hypertonic GUV by rapidly adjusting its volume and reducing the effective pressure difference across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haleva and Diamant, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peterlin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The residual osmotic pressure then necessarily generates a lateral tension in the membrane, which compensates for the internal fluid force. Following the law of Laplace (<italic>σ = ΔP r/2</italic>), the imposed osmotic pressure of 0.5 MPa translates into the applied membrane tension, <italic>σ</italic>, of 2.5 N m<sup>−1</sup> for a vesicle, 10 µm in radius—approximately three orders of magnitude larger than necessary for membrane lysis (∼3–5 mN m<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portet and Dimova, 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is instructive to note, however, that the actual tension that develops in the membrane is much lower. GUVs prepared by electroformation invariably display large variations in size, shape, and area to volume ratio. As a result, upon immersion in hypotonic solution, osmotic influx of water first transforms the initial non-spherical shapes into spherical ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hamada et al., 2011</xref>). The drop in the osmolyte concentration during this transformation effectively reduces the osmotic pressure difference, which the vesicle experiences, compared to the applied one. Note also that this reduction in osmotic pressure during the initial shape transformation is different for different vesicles within single populations. Thus, although quantifying actual membrane tension in our experiments is difficult, the observations of tense membranes and subsequent poration indicate that the osmotic perturbation is sufficient for most GUVs to surpass their maximum volume limit, developing appreciable membrane tension and pressure differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Development of membrane tension in hypotonic media</title><p>GUV membranes in isotonic media are flaccid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>).

The GUVs show periodic oscillations, which includes a swelling phase, formation of Ld and Lo domains, and transient pore formation. With time, the characteristic time period of the oscillations increases until the GUV reaches a quasi-equilibrated state, having gradually relaxed the osmotic stress through transient pore formation. The quality of the study is high: the authors show many controls and the movies and figures nicely support their conclusions. Furthermore, the text is well written and the authors are very careful at citing and discussing all previous studies on the same topics, making the overall study very solid and fair.</p><p>The importance of this work is two-fold: i) GUVs are widely used experimental tools. Other than the dedicated membrane labs who focus on these systems, I suspect most users are not well aware of the degree of complexity they can exhibit and the ease with which it can be reached (even accidentally). In this context, I think this work can be highly influential to a broad community of scientists interested in lipid and cell membranes. ii) In a more philosophical sense, this is a beautiful example of a simple chemical system in which multiple order parameters become coupled to produce highly complex (and unexpected to the non-expert) behavior. It underscores the intrinsic coupling between membrane phase and mechanical tension.</p><p>The reviewers agree this work should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>, and are happy with the experiments you have conducted, however there are a number of concerns with the text that need addressing in the form of revisions which are enumerated below:</p><p>1) The authors did not offer compelling reasons to believe this work has relevance to biological processes. Large domains are seldom observed in cells and current models for domain formation involve complex and transient interactions between not only lipids but also proteins and on a much shorter time scale and also smaller length scale. To my knowledge, the only exception is the formation of large domains in the yeast vacuole (J Cell Biol. 2013 Jul 8;202(1):35-44), which the authors did not discuss. Instead, the authors mention two processes that they say might be biologically relevant:</p><p>a) 'we found that domain dynamics become co-ordinated with the previously well-known process of expulsion of internal “organelle” vesicle, reminiscent of vesicle traffic.' I don't see how this process is reminiscent of a biological process. Cells carefully avoid leakage, notably during vesicle trafficking.</p><p>b) 'In this same vein, it seems plausible that domain-forming prebiotic amphiphiles might have given a thermodynamic advantage to early, protein-free protocells to survive drastic osmotic environmental osmotic shifts.' Here the authors quote seminal studies by Szostack about plausible lipid mixtures that may have led to primitive cell compartments. However, it should be noted that these lipid mixtures are very far from those studied here. They mostly consist in simple fatty acids, not in diacyl lipids and, as such, are characterized by much higher permeability. In a more recent paper, the Szostack lab explored the advantage of having a few mol % of diacyl lipids, but even under these conditions, the plausible primitive membrane remains very far from what is studied here.</p><p>2) Another major problem for the authors is to establish what new knowledge has been gained. No individual component of the behavior they report is previously unobserved, it is important for the authors to clearly state, and convince readers, of what is learned by their observations. In this regard, some of the language they use is perhaps too abstract. For example, the authors write in the Abstract that their observations illustrate a “quasi-homeostatic self-regulatory behavior allowing synthetic vesicles produced from simple components, namely, water, osmolytes, and lipids to sense and regulate their micro-environment in a negative feedback loop”. I'm not sure I see why this is “self-regulatory” or a “negative feedback loop”. It is oscillatory and certainly illustrates coupling between mechanical tension and phase, but I think the authors may stretch things a bit too far and may lose some readers in doing so.</p><p>3) “Oscillations in osmotic pressure and membrane tension.” Interspersed among clear explanations are several odd statements such as this one. Membrane tension is certainly oscillating, but osmotic pressure is not. If one were to make a graph of pressure versus time it would be monotonically decreasing as the vesicle equilibrates. As the authors note, this equilibration is more readily achieved by water influx, diluting the interior contents, so tension increases, until high tension drives membrane pore formation. Then, contents leak out, tension drops, and the pressure difference between interior and exterior further drops. Then the pores seal, but since the pressure is nonzero, equilibration continues again via water influx, and the cycle continues; though more slowly, since the driving pressure differential is smaller than it was before. (The authors' data on the slowing is very nice.) All this couples to phase separation, since high tension leads to phase separation, and low tension to homogeneity. Rather than the author's schematic at the end of the paper, a simple schematic of pressure monotonically decreasing and tension oscillating above and below a critical value corresponding to phase separation, would be useful for the reader.</p><p>Similarly, the authors refer in a few places to a “negative feedback loop.” This is a bit overstated. As noted above, the system is not oscillating about some equilibrium, rather it is monotonically approaching the equilibrium of zero osmotic pressure, and tension is oscillating as it is doing this. There is, in some sense, a “set point” of tension, the lysis tension, but at equilibrium this also is zero. Moreover, this feedback is related directly only to the tension, and not the phase separation, and so it again seems a bit much to call the overall phenomenon one of self-regulation by negative feedback.</p><p>Really what one would like with this is a quantitative model that reproduces the critical lysis tension (see above) or the time between oscillations or both. The paper doesn't provide this. It does contain a nice physical discussion in the supplemental text, but this succeeds only in roughly explaining the pore lifetime. I think it's fine to publish the paper without a real model, but the paper should be shorter than it is by at least 50% - it shouldn't take so many words to explain qualitatively the basic oscillation mechanism outlined above. The paper is very repetitive: the basic explanation for the observed phenomenon is given several times.</p><p>In the impact statement and the text it is noted that this phenomenon “of plausible biological significance.” There isn't a strong case made for this. I think this is fine: the paper expands our understanding of what lipid vesicles are capable of, which is important. I think these words should be removed from the impact statement.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Oscillatory phase separation in giant lipid vesicles induced by transmembrane osmotic differentials” for further consideration at <italic>eLife.</italic> Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Oglecka et al. have done a good job of addressing the concerns that one reviewer had with the original manuscript, with one exception, the area that refers to the original incorrect claim of “oscillations in osmotic pressure and membrane tension.” The authors have included a new schematic illustration “showing cyclical oscillations in tension and stair-case drop in pressure.” The tension schematic is correct; however, the step-wise drops in pressure are not. As stated originally, “If one were to make a graph of pressure versus time <italic>it would be monotonically decreasing</italic> as the vesicle equilibrates. This equilibration is more readily achieved by water influx, diluting the interior contents, so tension increases, until high tension drives membrane pore formation. Then, contents leak out, tension drops, and the pressure difference between interior and exterior <italic>further drops</italic>. Then the pores seal, but since the pressure is nonzero, equilibration continues, again via water influx, and the cycle continues...” The pressure is not stationary at any time. Of course, during the (very brief) leakage period, the rate of pressure drop may be greater than it is during the times between ruptures, but (1) the authors don't make any quantitative argument that this is the case, and (2) even if it were, the qualitative schematic that shows flat pressure lines is quite misleading. Put more simply: the tension is increasing in each cycle ’because’ water flows in, lowering the osmotic pressure. A positive slope for tension occurs together with a negative slope for pressure, and the schematic should show this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03695.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors did not offer compelling reasons to believe this work has relevance to biological processes.

We do not imply that the specific properties of osmotically generated oscillations in domain morphologies (i.e., sizes, shapes, and temporal frequencies) of giant vesicles would be reproduced in living cells subject to osmotic stresses. A variety of cellular characteristics – including changes in cytoskeleton interactions; size of plasma membrane reservoir activities of mechanosensitive channels and surface area regulation of membranes to phase separate in cells, can all be expected to regulate the osmotic stress and modulate the capacity (Raucher and Sheetz 1999, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wood 1999</xref>, Morris and Homann 2001). a) Precise sizes and time scales of domain reorganization notwithstanding, the remarkable coordination of essential biophysical processes: (1) osmotically generated membrane tension; (2) osmotic pressure dependent changes in phase separation; (3) transient membrane poration; and (4) solute efflux – which control vesicle osmoregulation should also play a role in guiding the response of a living cell to an osmotic perturbation.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing to our attention the case of yeast vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Toulmay and Prinz 2013</xref>), which exhibits phase separation of both lipids and proteins in what appears to be a sterol-dependent phase separation into co-existing liquid phases when subject to stresses (i.e., nutrient deprivation, pH changes, and changes in the growth medium) such as seen in synthetic vesicles. We have now incorporated this case (and the corresponding reference) in our narrative discussing potential biological relevance in the revised version of our submission.</p><p>Perhaps, one of the most compelling cases for the biological significance of our observations is that many biology labs use phospholipid vesicles and synthetic membranes as tools to investigate membrane-mediated effects in biological processes including cell adhesion, cell-cell interactions, signaling, organelle functions, and mechanisms of viral and bacterial interactions with host cell membranes, to name a few. Appreciating the complexity, heterogeneity, and sensitivity of membrane surfaces to osmotic gradients should prove valuable in interpreting these data and in designing model membrane systems specifically suited to the case at hand. This point is now explicitly made in the revised version of the paper.</p><p>We recognize that the parallel we draw between osmotically mediated expulsion of internal vesicles with vesicle trafficking is weak especially since the transient poration in our case is indeed accompanied by solute leakage, which is absent in vesicle trafficking. We have now removed this analogy.</p><p>We also recognize that there are significant differences in the properties of vesicles self-assembled from fatty acid amphiphiles, thought to make up pre-biotic membranes and those formed from phospholipids. However, the coupling of osmotic activity with membrane’s internal compositional degrees of freedom is of purely physical and mechanical origins and may be applicable to diverse chemical systems albeit with differences in time and size scales of oscillations. In other words, it appears likely that the heterogeneous pool of fatty acid amphiphiles (including those differing in length of their hydrocarbon tails, degrees of chain saturation, and transition temperature) might also phase-separate and respond to osmotically generated tension (and pressure) by sorting into domains. We are currently pursuing experiments with mixtures of fatty acids to determine if the observations reported here for phospholipid vesicles are also at works in that system.</p><p><italic>2) Another major problem for the authors is to establish what new knowledge has been gained. No individual component of the behavior they report is previously unobserved, it is important for the authors to clearly state, and convince readers, of what is learned by their observations. In this regard, some of the language they use is perhaps too abstract. For example, the authors write in the Abstract that their observations illustrate a “quasi-homeostatic self-regulatory behavior allowing synthetic vesicles produced from simple components, namely, water, osmolytes, and lipids to sense and regulate their micro-environment in a negative feedback loop”. I'm not sure I see why this is “self-regulatory” or a “negative feedback loop”. It is oscillatory and certainly illustrates coupling between mechanical tension and phase, but I think the authors may stretch things a bit too far and may lose some readers in doing so</italic>.</p><p>We refer to the vesicle response to an osmotic perturbation in terms of negative feedback loop since the initially isotonic vesicle, when subject to an osmotic differential, undergoes the process of relaxation to minimize the source perturbation. We refer to this process as homeostatic because in so doing, through solute and solvent equilibration, the vesicle changes the bath. We do not mean to suggest that the domain oscillations, coupling mechanical tension and phase, by themselves reflect any sort of feedback loop. We have now rephrased this discussion in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>Taken individually, it is true that the elemental biophysical processes (i.e., membrane permeability, phase separation, poration, and tension-induced and pressure-dependent changes in membrane organization), which guide vesicle response to osmotic stress are all well-appreciated in extant literature. The co-ordination between these processes, however, producing the emergent behavior in vesicles subject to osmotic difference, appears to us to be quite striking and previously unappreciated. To explicitly state what new knowledge is gained and perspectives earned, we now provide a detailed statement on value and broader implications of our observations:</p><p>“Although individual biophysical processes leading to the oscillatory domain dynamics during this osmotic relaxation process are well-appreciated, the observations reported here bring to focus several features of vesicle behaviour, which are best poorly appreciated. First, the seemingly autonomous vesicle response – in which an external osmotic perturbation is managed by a co-ordinated and cyclical sequence of physical mechanisms allowing vesicles to sense (by domain formation) and regulate (by solute efflux) their local environment– suggests a primitive form of a quasi-homeostatic regulation in a synthetic material system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He, Aizenberg et al. 2012</xref>), i.e., a simple microemulsion produced from simple components, namely, lipids, water, and osmolytes. Second, these observations illustrate how out-of-plane osmotic activity of water becomes coupled with membrane’s in-plane compositional degrees of freedom producing an exquisite and complex response. It underscores the intrinsic coupling between membrane phase and mechanical tension. Third, by highlighting the complexity of lipid vesicles, these results offer important caveats in implementing giant vesicles as experimental models in scenarios where osmotic imbalances can dominate vesicle response.<italic>”</italic></p><p><italic>3) “Oscillations in osmotic pressure and membrane tension.” Interspersed among clear explanations are several odd statements such as this one.

We now include a schematic showing cyclical oscillations in tension and stair-case drop in pressure, which occurs with the cycle number as vesicles undergo osmotic equilibration. Because of the value and appeal to broader readership, we also suggest that the original graphical schematic be also retained in the final version of the paper.</p><p><italic>Similarly, the authors refer in a few places to a “negative feedback loop.” This is a bit overstated. As noted above, the system is not oscillating about some equilibrium, rather it is monotonically approaching the equilibrium of zero osmotic pressure, and tension is oscillating as it is doing this. There is, in some sense, a “set point” of tension, the lysis tension, but at equilibrium this also is zero. Moreover, this feedback is related directly only to the tension, and not the phase separation, and so it again seems a bit much to call the overall phenomenon one of self-regulation by negative feedback</italic>.</p><p>We concur. As in response to 2) we have rephrased this discussion without implying self-regulation by negative feedback loop as mechanism for the observed coupling of tension and phase in the membranes. We have also included a new schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> qualitatively highlighting changes in membrane tension, which are oscillatory and in osmotic pressure, which are of the stair-case type.</p><p><italic>Really what one would like with this is a quantitative model that reproduces the critical lysis tension (see above) or the time between oscillations or both. The paper doesn't provide this. It does contain a nice physical discussion in the supplemental text, but this succeeds only in roughly explaining the pore lifetime. I think it's fine to publish the paper without a real model, but the paper should be shorter than it is by at least 50% - it shouldn't take so many words to explain qualitatively the basic oscillation mechanism outlined above. The paper is very repetitive: the basic explanation for the observed phenomenon is given several times</italic>.</p><p>We have edited the manuscript further with a goal of minimizing unnecessary repetitions.</p><p><italic>In the impact statement and the text it is noted that this phenomenon “of plausible biological significance.” There isn't a strong case made for this. I think this is fine: the paper expands our understanding of what lipid vesicles are capable of, which is important. I think these words should be removed from the impact statement</italic>.</p><p>We have now removed the emphasis on plausible biological significance in the impact statement and more explicitly clarified the coupling of order parameters, which occurs during osmotic equilibration in giant vesicles.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Oglecka et al. have done a good job of addressing the concerns that one reviewer had with the original manuscript, with one exception, the area that refers to the original incorrect claim of “oscillations in osmotic pressure and membrane tension.” The authors have included a new schematic illustration “showing cyclical oscillations in tension and stair-case drop in pressure.” The tension schematic is correct; however, the step-wise drops in pressure are not. As stated originally, “If one were to make a graph of pressure versus time</italic> it would be monotonically decreasing <italic>as the vesicle equilibrates. This equilibration is more readily achieved by water influx, diluting the interior contents, so tension increases, until high tension drives membrane pore formation. Then, contents leak out, tension drops, and the pressure difference between interior and exterior</italic> further drops<italic>. Then the pores seal, but since the pressure is nonzero, equilibration continues, again via water influx, and the cycle continues...” The pressure is not stationary at any time. Of course, during the (very brief) leakage period, the rate of pressure drop may be greater than it is during the times between ruptures, but (1) the authors don't make any quantitative argument that this is the case, and (2) even if it were, the qualitative schematic that shows flat pressure lines is quite misleading. Put more simply: the tension is increasing in each cycle ’because’ water flows in, lowering the osmotic pressure. A positive slope for tension occurs together with a negative slope for pressure, and the schematic should show this</italic>.</p><p>This was a clearly a gross oversight on our part. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. The osmotic influx of water prior to pore formation, which renders the membrane tense, also acts to reduce the osmotic pressure by diluting the osmolyte concentration. Solute efflux during the short-lived poration event provides a second, separate mechanism by which pressure drops. Thus during the entire osmotic equilibration process pressure drops monotonically. Although we have not quantitatively compared the pressure drop due to dilution and that occurs during solute efflux, we surmise, based on a phenomenological analyses following Idiart and Levin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Idiart and Levin 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levin and Idiart 2004</xref>), that pressure drop is more drastic during solute efflux.</p><p>We have now rectified the pressure schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and noted in the figure legend that the relative rates are conjectures, and further quantitation is needed.</p></body></sub-article></article>
