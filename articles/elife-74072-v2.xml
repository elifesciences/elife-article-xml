genes (ISGs). Here, we find that bacterial microbiota stimulate a homeostatic ISG signature in the intestine of specific pathogen-free mice. This homeostatic ISG expression is restricted to IECs, depends on IEC-intrinsic expression of IFN-λ receptor (<italic>Ifnlr1</italic>), and is associated with IFN-λ production by leukocytes. Strikingly, imaging of these homeostatic ISGs reveals localization to pockets of the epithelium and concentration in mature IECs. Correspondingly, a minority of mature IECs express these ISGs in public single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from mice and humans. Furthermore, we assessed the ability of orally administered bacterial components to restore localized ISGs in mice lacking bacterial microbiota. Lastly, we find that IECs lacking <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> are hyper-susceptible to initiation of murine rotavirus infection. These observations indicate that bacterial microbiota stimulate ISGs in localized regions of the intestinal epithelium at homeostasis, thereby preemptively activating antiviral defenses in vulnerable IECs to improve host defense against enteric viruses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interferon</kwd><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>rotavirus</kwd><kwd>intestine</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI130055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nice</surname><given-names>Timothy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM071338</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Winkle</surname><given-names>Jacob A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-AI007472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Winkle</surname><given-names>Jacob A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI139314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Megan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI141716</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Megan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-AI141478</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Megan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Megan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011912</institution-id><institution>Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MI-II-2019-790</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baldridge</surname><given-names>Megan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The enteric bacterial microbiota stimulates a highly localized interferon-lambda signal within the intestinal epithelium that protects against murine rotavirus infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines produced in response to infection that signal IFN receptor-bearing cells to induce transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs perform diverse functions, but many cooperate to induce an antiviral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sadler and Williams, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schoggins and Rice, 2011</xref>). There are three types of IFNs: type I IFNs (IFN-αs, IFN-β, others), type II IFN (IFN-γ), and type III IFNs (IFN-λs). These three types are differentiated by receptor usage (type I IFN receptor: <italic>Ifnar1</italic>/<italic>Ifnar2</italic>; type II IFN receptor: <italic>Ifngr1</italic>/<italic>Ifngr2</italic>; type III IFN receptor: <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>/<italic>Il10rb</italic>), but all three receptor complexes signal through Janus-kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) factors to stimulate ISG transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ingle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>). Type I and III IFNs are directly stimulated by host detection of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as viral nucleic acids, and the prominent contribution of these IFN types to antiviral defense is reflected by the breadth of evasion strategies used by diverse viral families to prevent their production or action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Levy and García-Sastre, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rojas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor and Mossman, 2013</xref>). The type I IFN receptor is expressed broadly across most cell types, whereas the type III IFN receptor, <italic>Ifnlr1,</italic> is primarily restricted to epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kotenko and Durbin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sommereyns et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, IFN-λ is of particular importance in effective antiviral defense of barrier tissues.</p><p>Interestingly, previous studies in mice have noted that intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are hyporesponsive to type I IFN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernández et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Winkle et al., 2020</xref>). The responsiveness of IECs to type I IFN appears to be developmentally regulated because the IECs of adult mice exhibit weaker type I responses than IECs of neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, infection of mice deficient in IFN receptors (<italic>Ifnar1</italic>, <italic>Ifngr1</italic>, <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>; single or double knockouts) with enteric viruses indicates that IFN-λ is the predominant antiviral IFN type that controls viral replication in the gastrointestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hernández et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>). IECs can robustly respond to IFN-λ with upregulation of canonical antiviral ISGs and increased resistance to infection by enteric viruses, such as rotaviruses and noroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nice et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>). Mouse rotavirus is a natural pathogen of mice that infects enterocytes located at the tips of villi in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burns et al., 1995</xref>). Rotaviruses have developed mechanisms to antagonize the induction of IFN by infected cells, suggesting that evasion of the IFN response is necessary for efficient epithelial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, prophylactic administration of IFN-λ significantly reduces the burden of mRV infection, demonstrating its potential for mediating epithelial antiviral immunity to this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mahlakõiv et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Winkle et al., 2020</xref>). However, a protective role of the endogenous IFN-λ response to mRV infection is less clear, perhaps reflecting the success of mRV evasion mechanisms.</p><p>Epithelial immunity in the gut must be appropriately balanced to protect the intestinal epithelium while preventing loss of barrier integrity and intrusion by microbes that are abundant within the gastrointestinal tract. The bacterial microbiota in the intestine perform critical functions by aiding in host metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krajmalnik-Brown et al., 2012</xref>), providing a competitive environment to defend against pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2017</xref>), and initiating and maintaining host immune function during homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Honda and Littman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rooks and Garrett, 2016</xref>). In this complex environment host epithelial and immune cells detect bacteria and viruses using a suite of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense the presence of MAMPs. Stimulation of PRRs, such as the toll-like receptor (TLR) family, activates antimicrobial and antiviral defenses providing local protection in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chu and Mazmanian, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). TLR-dependent pathways induce production of IFNs, primarily by signaling through TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF) and myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) adapter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monroe et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Odendall et al., 2017</xref>), providing a mechanism by which bacterial MAMPs can initiate IFN responses.</p><p>Signals from the bacterial microbiota have been shown to elicit a steady-state type I IFN response in systemic tissues and cell types that can prime antiviral immunity by several independent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Winkler et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, a steady-state ISG signal has been observed in the intestine of uninfected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldridge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stockinger et al., 2014</xref>), but this intestinal response remained poorly characterized. Together with the observed hypo-responsiveness of IECs to type I IFN, these findings suggested that bacterial microbiota may stimulate an IFN-λ response in the gut. To explore this interaction, we undertook the present study to assess the role of bacterial microbiota in induction of enteric ISGs at homeostasis using a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) and genetically modified mice.</p><p>In this study, we uncovered an ISG signature in IECs that was dependent on the presence of bacteria and IFN-λ signaling (hereafter referred to as ‘homeostatic ISGs’). This panel of genes was present in wild-type (WT) mice with conventional microbiota and was reduced in WT mice treated with ABX and in mice lacking <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>. We revealed that homeostatic ISG expression is (i) restricted to the intestinal epithelium across both the ileum and colon, (ii) independent of type I IFN signaling, and (iii) associated with IFN-λ transcript expression by epithelium-associated CD45+ leukocytes. Surprisingly, we found that homeostatic ISGs are not expressed uniformly by all IECs; rather, expression is concentrated in localized pockets of IECs and in differentiated IECs relative to crypt-resident progenitors. These patterns of localized ISG expression are corroborated by independently generated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from mouse and human IECs. We also found that ISG expression can be increased in ABX-treated mice by reconstitution of bacterial microbiota or administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Finally, we found that this microbiota-stimulated ISG signature provides protection from initiation of mRV infection. Cumulatively, this study found that bacteria initiate preemptive IFN-λ signaling in localized areas to protect IECs from enteric viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bacterial microbiota stimulate IFN-λ response genes in the ileum at homeostasis</title><p>To determine the effect of bacterial microbiota on homeostatic IFN-λ responses, we compared gene expression in whole ileum tissue for the following experimental groups: (i) wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice intraperitoneally injected with IFN-λ as compared to unstimulated WT mice, (ii) WT mice with conventional microbiota as compared to WT mice treated with an antibiotic cocktail (ABX) to deplete bacteria, (iii) WT mice with conventional microbiota as compared to <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with conventional microbiota, and (iv) <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice with conventional microbiota compared to <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice treated with ABX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These data indicate that ISGs are present at steady state in the ileum of specific-pathogen-free mice with conventional microbiota and suggest that microbiota stimulate expression of these genes in the ileum at homeostasis.</p><p>Type I, II, and III IFN responses have substantial gene expression overlap; therefore, to prove that the IFN-λ receptor was necessary for expression of ISGs at homeostasis, we analyzed gene expression in the ileum of <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice.

Together, these findings suggest that <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> is necessary for the bacterial microbiota-dependent expression of ISGs in the ileum at homeostasis. Since ISGs are enriched in mice upon IFN-λ stimulation and are decreased in <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and ABX-treated mice, we conclude that the bacterial microbiota stimulates IFN-λ responses in the ileum at homeostasis.</p><p>To define a core set of bacterial microbiota-dependent, <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>-dependent ‘homeostatic ISGs’, we determined the overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by defining genes with: (i) increased expression upon IFN-λ stimulation in WT mice, (ii) decreased expression upon ABX treatment in WT mice, and (iii) decreased expression in <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice relative to WT mice. The DEGs shared by each of these comparisons comprised a set of 21 genes that are decreased upon treatment with ABX and loss of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>, and are induced in response to IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This set of homeostatic ISGs includes antiviral genes that are dependent on bacterial microbiota and the IFN-λ pathway. Comparison of homeostatic ISG transcript counts between experimental treatments revealed similar insights as prior GSEA.

To extend these findings and to determine whether CD45+ cells in the intestinal epithelium produce IFN-λ in response to bacterial microbiota at homeostasis, we enriched cell subsets from epithelial or lamina propria fractions of the ileum for quantification of <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> by qPCR. We treated WT mice with control, ABX, or stimulation with a synthetic dsRNA analogue (poly I:C). We then magnet-enriched EpCAM+ or CD45+ cells from stripped intestinal epithelium or digested lamina propria ileal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that CD45+ cells from the intestinal epithelial and lamina propria fraction expressed detectable <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> at homeostasis, but EpCAM+ cells did not, which is consistent with Mahlakõiv et al. Furthermore, we found that expression of <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> in CD45+ cells from the epithelial fraction was significantly reduced with ABX treatment, and CD45+ cells from lamina propria had a non-statistically significant (p = 0.0523) reduction in <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> expression with ABX treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that a low abundance of homeostatic ISG expression would be uniformly distributed between IECs of the intestinal epithelium, and we sought to assess the distribution of the homeostatic ISG, <italic>Ifit1</italic>, using in situ hybridization (RNAscope). Contrary to our hypothesis, RNAscope staining of the ileum from untreated WT mice revealed localized pockets of robust <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in individual villi rather than ubiquitously low expression throughout the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Ifit1</italic> localization was skewed away from the crypt and toward the tips of individual villi within the ileum, and this localization was not specific to <italic>Ifit1</italic> because the distinct ISG <italic>Usp18</italic> co-localized with <italic>Ifit1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These data indicate that homeostatic ISGs are sporadically expressed in individual villi and are primarily localized to mature enterocytes that are most distally located in villi. We determined that localized ISG expression within individual villi was not due to a localized ability to respond to IFN-λ because stimulation with exogenous IFN-λ resulted in <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression within all intestinal villi, but not intestinal crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The minimal expression of <italic>Ifit1</italic> within intestinal crypts following exogenous IFN-λ treatment suggests that homeostatic ISGs are localized to mature enterocytes because intestinal crypts do not exhibit robust responses to IFN-λ. Additionally, the non-uniform distribution of homeostatic <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression was ablated in the ileum of mice treated with ABX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>), consistent with a dependency on bacterial microbiota. To determine whether localized <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression was dependent on IEC expression of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>, we assessed the distribution of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in the ilea of littermate Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup> and <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO mice.

Recently, Haber et al. published a large scRNA-seq dataset that profiled sorted IECs from the small intestine of specific pathogen-free mice and defined 15 distinct IEC subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haber et al., 2017</xref>). We analyzed IECs from this dataset, and found that of the 21 homeostatic ISGs identified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, 19 were present in the Haber et al. single-cell dataset. We determined the percentage of each epithelial cell subtype that expresses each individual homeostatic ISG, and generated a heatmap with hierarchical clustering to group IEC subtypes that have similar ISG expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Homeostatic ISGs were predominantly expressed in mature enterocyte subtypes, which clustered separately from crypt-resident progenitor IECs such as transit amplifying (TA) cells and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To compare homeostatic ISG expression between polar extremes of the crypt-villus axis, we grouped IEC subtypes that represented enterocytes (mature enterocyte cells) and crypt-associated cells (TA cells and stem cells) to compare the overall proportions of these cells with homeostatic ISG expression. We found that a significantly higher percentage of enterocytes express homeostatic ISGs than crypt-associated cells, but that these homeostatic ISGs were expressed in a relatively small proportion of enterocytes (&lt;20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

IECs from this dataset were previously clustered by Elmentaite et al. and annotated as: enterocytes, early enterocytes, tuft cells, enteroendrocrine cells, BEST4 enterocytes, goblet cells, TA cells, and crypt. For our analysis of homeostatic ISG expression, we excluded IEC subtypes with fewer than 20 constituent cells, which retained five annotated groups: enterocytes, early enterocytes, goblet cells, TA cells, and crypt.

Enterocyte, early enterocyte, and goblet subtypes clustered separately from TA cells and crypt, with the highest proportion of homeostatic ISGs being present in the enterocyte subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). As with mouse IEC data, above, we grouped annotated cells that localize in the crypt (TA cells and crypt) and compared overall proportions of homeostatic ISG expression with the mature enterocyte subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Similar to mice, homeostatic ISGs were present in significantly more enterocytes than crypt-associated cells, and most homeostatic ISGs in this human dataset were present in a relatively small proportion of cells (&lt;20%). These human data suggest that ISGs may be present in a small proportion of IECs from healthy, human ileal tissue at homeostasis and may share the localization observed in our murine analyses. Our analysis of a murine scRNA-seq dataset support our previous observations that homeostatic ISGs are not ubiquitously expressed throughout the intestinal epithelium; rather, they are expressed in a minority of IECs and skewed toward mature enterocytes along the crypt-villus axis. Our analysis of a human scRNA-seq dataset are consistent with observations in the murine model, though future studies will be required to definitively address the existence of homeostatic ISGs in human tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Assessing the effect of peroral bacterial products on homeostatic ISGs in ABX-treated mice</title><p>To further define the relationship between bacteria and homeostatic ISGs, we assessed whether oral administration of fecal contents or purified LPS (a bacterial MAMP and TLR4 agonist) could restore localized ISG expression in mice with depleted bacterial microbiota.

At 24 hr post-inoculation, we quantified mRV genomes in the epithelial fraction and the proportion of infected IECs (live, EpCAM-positive, CD45-negative, and mRV-positive) by flow cytometry. At 24 hr post-inoculation, we found that <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO mice had 20-fold more mRV genomes than <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

This equivalent mRV antigen burden in infected cells from <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO mice in combination with the lack of correlation between antigen burden and percentage of infected cells suggests that the protective role of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> is to prevent infection of IECs rather than to limit replication within IECs after they are infected. We assessed an earlier timepoint at 12 hr post-inoculation and observed similar trends toward an increased proportion of IEC infection in <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO relative to <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> littermates, but the extent of infection was 10- to 100-fold lower and near the limit of detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the 12 and 24 hr timepoints capture the earliest detectable infection of IECs by mRV, and this early infection is significantly reduced by IFN-λ signaling.</p><p>To further contextualize the localization of ISGs and mRV-infected cells over time, we performed in situ hybridization for mRV genomes and <italic>Ifit1</italic> in the ileum of WT mice at 12, 24, and 96 hr post-inoculation. Quantification of co-staining for <italic>Ifit1</italic> in mRV-infected cells indicated that a minority (~30%) were <italic>Ifit1</italic>+ at 12 or 24 hr post-inoculation, whereas a majority (~63%) of mRV-infected cells were <italic>Ifit1</italic>+ at 96 hr post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Although there are previous reports of basal, non-receptor-dependent ISG expression in immortalized and primary cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hakim et al., 2018</xref>), the homeostatic response that we report here is dependent on the IFN-λ receptor. Furthermore, we find this response is independent of type I IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that IFN-λ signaling plays a dominant and active role in the gastrointestinal epithelium. We also find minimal changes in ISG expression within the spleen and MLN after ABX treatment, suggesting that homeostatic ISGs are predominantly expressed in the intestine. These findings differ slightly from prior descriptions of systemic type I IFN responses that are dependent on bacterial microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ganal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stefan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Winkler et al., 2020</xref>). However, differences in the specific tissues and cell types analyzed make it difficult to draw direct comparisons across these studies. Therefore, we conclude that homeostatic ISGs are substantially present in IECs, but do not dispute the prior findings that relatively low homeostatic ISG expression induced by type I IFN plays an important role in extra-intestinal tissues and non-epithelial cell types.</p><p>A prior study by Mahlakõiv et al. noted the presence of <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> transcripts in CD45+ cells within the stripped intestinal epithelium, but not the lamina propria, at homeostasis. We have confirmed these findings and have extended them to show that this homeostatic expression of <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic>, but not <italic>Ifnb1</italic>, is dependent on bacterial microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, we have been unable to detect IFN-λ transcripts by RNA scope in situ hybridization in mice at homeostasis, consistent with recently published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ingle et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the production of IFN-λ is below the limit of detection by imaging or highly transient in nature. It is also unclear which CD45+ cell type produces homeostatic IFN-λ. Swamy et al. showed that T cell receptor stimulation led intraepithelial lymphocytes to produce IFN-λ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swamy et al., 2015</xref>) and Mahlakõiv et al. suggested that the primary producers of IFN-λ at steady state are intraepithelial lymphocytes due to the abundance of intraepithelial lymphocytes in the epithelial fraction. However, myeloid cells also reside near the intestinal epithelium and can sample luminal contents by various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chieppa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McDole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niess et al., 2005</xref>). Although the cell type that produces homeostatic IFN-λ is unknown, enrichment for <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> in CD45+ cells within the intestinal epithelial fraction suggests that proximity to bacterial stimuli may be a primary determinant in this response. We suggest that these cells may be actively surveying the intestinal epithelium to detect bacterial MAMPs. The specific CD45+ cell types responsible for producing homeostatic IFN-λ will be a topic of interest for future studies.</p><p>We initially anticipated that the distribution of homeostatic ISGs would be uniform among IECs. Instead, we found that this IFN-λ response is highly localized within enteric tissues. Homeostatic ISGs are observed in a minority of small intestinal villi and are primarily present in mature epithelium toward the villus tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Likewise, homeostatic ISGs are present within patches of the mature epithelium in the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The surprising finding of localized ISGs in the ileum are supported by analysis of independently generated scRNA-seq datasets from mouse and human small intestinal IECs that depict expression of homeostatic ISGs in a minority of cells with predominant expression in mature enterocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The basis for localized ISG expression is unknown; however, it may reflect the distribution of cells capable of sensing bacterial microbiota, distinct microenvironments within the gastrointestinal tract, or qualitative differences in bacterial colonization. Given the results of our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, we suggest that LPS administration, flagellin administration, or fecal transplant can partially restore the expression of homeostatic ISGs in the small intestine. This interpretation supports the concept that localized ISG-positive regions may be uniquely exposed or responsive to a variety of bacterial MAMPs. Indeed, we find that MYD88 is required for WT levels of homeostatic ISG expression in the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, MYD88 is dispensable for homeostatic ISG expression in the colon, and TRIF is not required in either small intestine or colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These data suggest that the bacterial microbiota broadly stimulates homeostatic IFN-λ through multiple, redundant PRRs. Furthermore, the presence of localized <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in ABX-treated mice following LPS administration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) suggests that localization is an intrinsic property of homeostatic ISG stimulation and is not likely to be due to qualitative differences in bacterial colonization.</p><p>ISG localization may be indicative of regional differences in access of luminal bacterial MAMPs to IFN-λ-producing cells. One host mechanism to limit bacterial interactions with the intestinal epithelium is the presence of mucus layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atuma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansson et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, the single mucus layer in the small intestine is much less adherent than the mucus layers present in the colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansson et al., 2011</xref>), which might allow occasional direct bacterial interactions with IECs or other cells near the intestinal epithelium. However, soluble components from enteric bacteria may also readily diffuse through mucus layers. In this case, there may be sporadic defects in tight junction proteins that are required to maintain the intestinal epithelium. Tight junction remodeling is essential to maintain intestinal integrity during apoptosis and extrusion of IECs that are regularly shed from the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies will be necessary to determine whether defects in epithelial barrier integrity during extrusion events are linked to the local ISG responses that we observe and further delineation of the factors that render specific regions ‘responsive’ will be of great interest for follow-up studies.</p><p>The preceding findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggested that the homeostatic ISG response in IECs would provide protection against IEC-tropic viruses, such as mRV. Although bacterial-associated, IFN-independent mechanisms of mRV clearance have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), we found that the signature of homeostatic ISGs in ileum tissue included well-characterized antiviral ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). To investigate whether these homeostatic ISGs protect against MRV, we used <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO mice that lack homeostatic ISGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) rather than using ABX treatment, which introduces pleiotropic effects on rotavirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uchiyama et al., 2014</xref>) and dramatically increases transit time through the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldridge et al., 2015</xref>). Using <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> IEC-cKO mice, we found increase in IEC infection by mRV at early stages of infection compared to <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the protection offered by IEC expression of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> was lost by the middle and late stages of infection, consistent with the ability of mRV to antagonize induction of IFN responses once infection is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). Our observations during initiation of infection may provide important context to observations in other studies that report differing capacity for infection-induced IFN-λ to protect against mRV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>). Ultimately, it is clear that prophylactic administration of exogenous IFN-λ protects against mRV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pott et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Van Winkle et al., 2020</xref>), providing precedent that homeostatic IFN-λ would also be protective when induced by bacterial microbiota prior to infection.</p><p>Although we found that homeostatic ISGs provide protection during initiation of mRV infection, it remains unclear how these localized ISG pockets impart this protection. Given our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, we suggest that these localized ISGs may be indicative of locations that are particularly vulnerable to viral infection if ISGs were not present at the time of viral exposure. However, alternative explanations for the protective effects that we observe are also plausible, such as: (i) an inability to detect the full magnitude of ISG expression by imaging, or (ii) an unknown temporal component to homeostatic ISG signaling that may be coincident with durable ISG protein expression. Given the magnitude of signal amplification in RNAscope in situ hybridization and the similarity of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in our imaging data to <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in public single-cell sequencing datasets, we find it unlikely that there is more widespread homeostatic ISG expression below the limit of our detection by imaging. However, we do think an uncharacterized temporal component of homeostatic ISG signaling is plausible, wherein individual villi may be rapidly and transiently expressing homeostatic ISGs in response to sensing of bacterial microbiota. This temporal model may also include a more durable ISG protein response that is not fully concordant with expression of ISG transcripts. In sum, these findings indicate that preexisting, homeostatic ISGs present in <italic>Ifnlr1</italic>-sufficient mice are protective during initiation of mRV infection, but that endogenous IFN-λ does not reduce mRV burden in infected cells. These data highlight the possibility that detection of bacterial microbiota in particularly exposed areas may preemptively activate homeostatic ISGs as a form of anticipatory immunity to protect the intestinal epithelium from enteric viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were bred using the C57BL/6 background and used within the age of 8–12 weeks; C57BL/6J mice (stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and used as WT.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;A homeostatic interferon-λ response to bacterial microbiota stimulates preemptive antiviral defense within discrete pockets of intestinal epithelium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work cannot be considered in its current form for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers engaged in a careful consultation round before this decision was reached. Although there was substantial interest in the findings, there were concerns over the level of novelty, the underlying mechanisms of the localized interferon response and how these may be influenced by microbiota variation. The <italic>eLife</italic> policy is not to invite a revision if significant further experimental work is considered necessary. Although the reviewers concluded that the work necessary was outside the boundaries of a revision request, we would be interested to receive a further submission as a new paper if you are able to address the concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 :</italic></p><p>In this paper the authors provide new information about the relative importance of the type I and type III interferon-driven gene expression and anti-viral responses, particularly focused on the role of the Intestinal microbiota to maintain background levels of type III (interferon λ) signaling. They show with interferon λ administration as a positive control, and antibiotic-mediated microbiota biomass depletion that low background levels of type III interferon-driven gene expression are mediated by the microbiota. Heterozygous mouse strain combinations for epithelial specific either type I or type III interferon receptor deficiency shows that the effect is type III mediated. In-situ hypbridisation shows that type III-driven gene expression is highly discontinuous in the epithelial layer and mainly at the villous tips. Rotavirus infection shows slightly accelerated kinetics in the absence of the type III receptor-signaling. Since intestinal type I and type III interferon responses are well described to occur, this provides a distinction between the two signaling pathways the consequent antiviral responses and the role of the microbiota in maintaining a basal level of type III signaling.</p><p>This is a highly mature paper with a consistent set of experiments supporting the role of type III interferon signaling as a consequence of microbiota colonization in the intestine. The strengths of the paper derives from experimental contrasting use of epithelial-specific IFNLR deficiency and IFNAR deficiency, control treatments of interferon λ in verifying gene sets, localization of the homeostatic and IFNL-stimulated response by in situ hybridisation and the use of the functional rotavirus response in the strain combination context.</p><p>I consider this is almost publication ready.</p><p>Questions and suggestions that I have regarding the data and interpretation are as follows.</p><p>1. Do the authors consider that the relative importance of type I and type III signaling depends on the age of the mice.</p><p>2. What happens to the localization of the type III signal as control stimulation or viral infection proceeds? Presumably the time trajectory of in situs in these different contexts has not been done.</p><p>3. Do microbiota composition, bacteriophage lytic phases, or diet influence the homeostatic response.</p><p>4. I think that the authors should consider citing the basal signaling in Caco2 cells and organoids (Hakim Sci. Rep. 2018 8:8341) and the interferon-independent (Shi 2019, Cell 179, 644-658) papers in the discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, Van Winkle et al. examine contributions of interferons and microbiota to innate responses in the intestine, and which cell types are involved. Previous work by this team and others demonstrated that microbiota influence interferon responses in the intestine, which can affect infection with several enteric viruses, either increasing infection or decreasing infection depending on the viral system. Here, the team profiles expression of ISGs, examines which cells produce IFNs and express ISGs, whether these responses are microbiota dependent, and examines the effect on infection with murine rotavirus.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The most interesting aspect of this study is the observation that ISG expression in the intestine is extremely patchy and limited to a few mature enterocytes. Figure 6 is stunning, and these data are supported by beautiful controls (robust/broad ISG expression everywhere in the intestine of mice treated IP with IFNlambda in Figure S4, but loss of expression in mice treated with ABX, and confirmation in public single cell RNA-seq data sets). This is the most unique and significant contribution of the study.</p><p>Other aspects of the study are also well done with appropriate controls (multiple panels with ISG levels throughout, etc.). The team uses a variety of mouse strains, treatments, etc. to support their claims.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The primary weakness lies in significance, partially based on past work. The observation about patchy ISG expression in mature enterocytes is very cool, but it remains unknown why/how this happens and whether there are any functional consequences. This reviewer understands that this is a very tough problem and may take time to figure out. Additionally, much work has already been done with microbiota and IFNlambda effects on enteric virus infection, making many of the findings here overlapping or redundant with prior work: IFNlambda effects on IECs and viral infection (Sommereyns Plos Path 2008, Baldridge JVI 2017), leukocytes as the source of IFNlambda (Mahlakoiv Plos Path 2015), and microbiota-mediated innate immune modulation and effects of IFNlambda (e.g., Baldridge Science 2015, Nice Science 2015).</p><p>For Figure 5 and S3 data, the authors examine gene expression in intestinal cells collected from mice and then enriched for epithelial vs. lamina propria cell populations. They see significantly reduced expression of IFN upon ABX treatment in just one case-harvested epithelial cells that have been enriched for CD45+ cells (leukocytes) have reduced IFNlambda expression. Lamina propria CD45+ cells do not show significantly reduced IFNlambda. This is surprising. While there are low levels of CD45+ cells in epithelial cell preps (as they show in Figure S3), there are higher levels of CD45+ cells in the LP preps. It seems odd that the only significant difference lies with these immune cells in the epithelial cell prep, and this effect is not observed in LP preps, which should contain many more CD45+ cells. Given the authors' conclusion that leukocytes are the source of IFNlambda, this deserves more follow-up or at least some discussion. Is there something special about CD45+ cells from epithelial preps? Is it possible these are contaminating cells? Or is it simply an issue with spread in the data?</p><p>In Figures 8 and S6, the authors examine Ifit1 expression in WT or mutant mice with different treatments (ABX, LPS, fecal transfer), to determine if LPS or fecal transfer can restore gene expression. Due to low expression levels and a high degree of spread in the data, they resort to binning the primary gene expression data (8H and S6A; ABX vs. ABX/LPS not significantly different) into + vs. – categories (Figure 8J, S6E; ABX vs. ABX/LPS now are significantly different) to allow different statistical analysis. From this, they conclude that ISG expression is partially restored by LPS treatment in ABX-treated mice. Since the data are just around the detection limit and it's a high bar to restore gene expression, it's perhaps understandable that the data are binary, but this isn't the most convincing data set.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors convincingly show by RNAseq, that microbiota ablation by antibiotics treatment deprives WT mice of a tonic and interferon λ induced interferon stimulated gene (ISG) response. Alongside they test interferon λ receptor ko mice, which do not show a tonic induction of ISGs or a response to antibiotics dependent removal of microbiota. Induction of ISGs in intestinal tissue depends on TLR signaling, which would support a microbiota dependent induction. Intriguingly this ISG response is highly localised in very focussed areas of the intestine. Fecal transfer or LPS treatment restore the antibiotics induced phenotype of basal ISG expression loss and partially restore antiviral protection in intestinal epithelial cells.</p><p>These data complement recent publications [PMID: 32380006][PMID: 31269444] of tonic type I interferon signaling induced by microbiota could explain a series of publications showing the importance of microbiota for antiviral defence in the gut.</p><p>The authors build a line of arguments based on the correlation of data from IFNLR -/- mice and ABX treated mice. They omit however an important alternative explanation, which might be qualitative differences in the microbiota composition between IFNLR -/- and WT mice.</p><p>An explanation for the focussed ISG response in the intestine and how this explains the reduced resistance to enteric viruses is not provided.</p><p>An alternative explanation for the observed ISG expression phenotype could be a difference in baseline microbiota composition between WT and IFNLR -/- mice. This should be checked by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of small and large intestinal samples and could be complemented by a fecal transfer from IFNLR-/- mice into ABX treated WT mice followed by measurement of baseline ISGs in the intestine.</p><p>Qualitative differences in colonisation could also explain the binary response of WT mice to fecal transfer.</p><p>The focussed ISG response shown in Figure 8 is intriguing but difficult to reconcile with the 20x reduced viral titres in WT mice. Does the virus only replicate in these sites? And are commensal microbiota specifically dense in these areas. A multicolour FISH approach could answer both of these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In this paper from Van Winkle et al., the authors determined that murine intestinal epithelial cells produce several homeostatic ISGs. These homeostatic ISGs are located in the mature enterocytes and are stimulated by the presence of bacterial microbiota. This is an exciting concept as it becomes clearer that all cells in a tissue are not the same. The authors nicely demonstrate that these homeostatic ISGs are only present when the commensal microbiota is also present and that they depend on IFNl signaling.</p><p>A main weakness of the paper is that the authors use IFNl treatment to stimulate ISGs and then use this as a basis to determine homeostatic gene levels. However, it has been shown that stem cells have basal ISGs that are IFN independent (Wu…Rice, Cell 2018), which means that the only cells that could respond to IFN would be the mature cells in the villi. Additionally, as the bacteria would normally only be in contact with the enterocytes and not the crypts then one would not expect to find bacterial induced homeostatic ISGs lower in the crypt-villi axis. Given these, the authors findings while interesting are expected due to the experimental set-up. While several experiments contain complete controls to make all interpretations, several experiments lack controls and many conclusions suffer from over statements, lack of convincing imaging and correlations between infections and ISGs.</p><p>– In Figure 1 the authors claim that there is no significant difference between ifnlr-/- +/- ABX. However, this is hard to say from the presented data. There are no clear differences in the Enrichment plots D-F and the values given in B seem to be wrong as it seems very unlikely that both the FDR and the Nominal p-value are the exact same number. Without the correct numbers it is hard to judge the conclusion of this figure.</p><p>– On Figure 1, the authors claim that WT mice separate from ifnlr-/- mice, however in Figure 1H, one of the WT mice and ifnlr-/- mice cluster together. The authors should add more mice to show this more clearly or tone down this statement.</p><p>– On Figure S2, the IFNL without ABX control is missing to be able to interpret the data set.</p><p>– In Figure 3, why are the het samples shown as stripped epithelium and not full tissue as the others in the experiment. It would be good to have all tissue samples or all stripped epithelium to be able to make a full comparison between the data sets.</p><p>– Additionally, in Figure 3 the ifr7-/- effect on ISGs levels is very modest and is further decreased with ABX (which is normally considered a criteria for it to not be key for this response) the authors should provide more evidence that irf7 is involved or tone down their conclusion in this regard.</p><p>– The impact of ABX and ifnlr-/- seems to be less apparent in the colon than the ileum (e.g. Figure 2A vs B). This is curious since the colon will have the higher bacterial load. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>– Figure 5B, it is curious that there is no induction of ifnb1 in the epithelial fraction upon poly IC treatment. While several studies have shown that the cells are not responsive to type I IFNs, there is no data showing that they cannot produce type I IFNs upon MAMP stimulation. Can the authors explain this?</p><p>– Figure S3, why are the values of CD45+ cells not closer to 100% post-enrichment? If there are still 50% of non-CD45+ cells that are being analyzed, what are they and can they impact the results shown in Figure 5?</p><p>– Figure S4, high magnification images are needed to see if the crypts are able to respond to IFNs in a murine model to clearly demonstrate whether it would be possible for them to have IFN dependent homeostatic ISGs or whether the authors are already selecting for a phenotype only present in mature enterocytes.</p><p>– Figure S5, the colon data is not very convincing as the ifnlrKO shows some background staining which does not look much different from the other images. Additionally, it is not clear why only floxed and dIEC mice are used in this figure and there are no WT mice used as in Figure 6. It would be good to have the matching animals to better compare the data. It would also be important to include high mag images to clearly see if the ISG distribution is the same (as it does not seem to be the same tip distribution that is seen in the ileum). This figure should also include a quantification as provided in other figures.</p><p>– Figure 7, crypt cells are not a cell type. There are stem cells, TA and other progenitors present that make up the crypt. This should be renamed to correctly indicate the type of cells in this population.</p><p>– Additionally, the scRNA-Seq used for human analysis was a bit strange. This paper used mainly embryos and children to derive the cell types. The fact that only a few cell types were highly present seems to indicate that maybe this was not the best paper. It would be good to compare to stronger papers such as Wang et al. JEM 2020, Fuji et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018. There is also a paper using human ileum showing that stem cells and enterocytes each have their own basal ISGs which are stem cell specific or enterocytes specific (Triana, 2020). The statements about the human data should be toned down or a more robust scRNA data set should be used.</p><p>– Figure S6D, why are there different numbers of mice used for each ISG? If the RNA is harvested, then the same RNA can be used to assess all three ISGs. It seems strange that of 30 mice tested for ifit1, only 17 were tested for stat1. These missing numbers seems strange and should be included.</p><p>– The homeostatic ISGs are only found in the tip of the villi, and rotavirus infection normally occurs at the tips of the villi, the authors claim that these homeostatic ISGs are more protective against infection. To make this claim the authors need to perform a co-staining of rotavirus infected tissue to show that the villi that are infected are not the villi which express the homeostatic ISGs. In general, rotavirus staining is needed as the FACS data suggests that a very low numbers of cells are infected which makes it hard to justify the authors claims.</p><p>– The authors claim that IFN is being produced from CD45+ epithelium derived lymphocytes. To support and strengthen this claim, it would be important to perform RNA scope with markers for these cells to determine if the sparse ISG induction seen in the tissue is correlates with the localization of these cells.</p><p>– Since the authors claim is that the homeostatic ISGs come from sensing of bacterial components, and that LPS can rescue this phenotype, then the authors should determine if tlr4-/- mice also lack the presence of homeostatic ISGs.</p><p>– Furthermore, the authors claim in the discussion that microbiota components are responsible for the homeostatic levels and that they signal through several MAMPs. However, this is not shown in the paper. In the manuscript the authors only tested LPS. They also used CpG which will signal through MyD88 but does not induce this response. To make the claim that multiple MAMPs can be used, then several other MAMP agonists should be used to show that this is not only a LPS phenotype (e.g. flagellin).</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;A homeostatic interferon-λ response to bacterial microbiota stimulates preemptive antiviral defense within discrete pockets of intestinal epithelium&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Do the authors consider that the relative importance of type I and type III signaling depends on the age of the mice.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we are aware of studies that indicate age of mice can influence IEC responsiveness to Type I IFN. To emphasize these findings, we have updated our introduction to highlight studies that explored this topic on (Lines 54-56): “The responsiveness of IECs to type I IFN appears to be developmentally regulated because the IECs of adult mice exhibit weaker type I responses than IECs of neonatal mice (Lin et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. What happens to the localization of the type III signal as control stimulation or viral infection proceeds? Presumably the time trajectory of in situs in these different contexts has not been done.</p></disp-quote><p>We find the temporal aspect of this localized homeostatic type III signaling to be incredibly interesting. We are unable to perform time trajectories of individual mice by in situ hybridization due to the terminal nature of this approach. However, we have now included ileal <italic>Ifit1</italic> in situ hybridization imaging of representative mice at 12hr, 24hr, and 96hr postinoculation with murine rotavirus. These data are presented in Figure S10, are described in Lines 603-605: “Additionally, we found mRV infection did not dramatically increase area of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in the intestine at 24 hours post-inoculation. However, at 96 hours post-inoculation, we found a significant increase in epithelial <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in the ileum relative to early times post-inoculation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Do microbiota composition, bacteriophage lytic phases, or diet influence the homeostatic response.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this important point, we now provide evidence that microbiota composition does not influence the homeostatic ISG response detailed in this manuscript. We find no difference in the number of observed bacterial species, Shannon Diversity Index, or UniFrac distance when we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on stool from <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> +/+, <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> +/, and <italic>Ifnlr1 -/-</italic> mice. We have included these data in Figure S1 and described them in text (Lines 117-120): “To rule out contributions of Ifnlr1 toward an altered intestinal bacterial microbiota, we performed 16S rRNA sequencing on stool from <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>+/+</sup>, Ifnlr1<sup>+/-</sup>, and Ifnlr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and did not find differences in α-diversity and β-diversity measurements.”</p><p>Secondly, we find the possibility of bacteriophage mechanisms to be intriguing, but have collected no data on this topic. We briefly collaborated with Dr. Brooke Napier’s group at Portland State University to assess whether ketogenic diet affects homeostatic ISG expression by altering LPS tolerance, but did not observe any interactions in our limited studies.

I think that the authors should consider citing the basal signaling in Caco2 cells and organoids (Hakim Sci.

We have expanded the discussion to include citations to both references.</p><p>We mention Hakim et al. in lines 659-661: “ Although there are previous reports of basal, non-receptor-dependent ISG expression in immortalized and primary cell lines (Hakim et al., 2018), the homeostatic response that we report here is dependent on the IFN-λ receptor.” and Shi et al. in lines 726-729: “Although bacterial-associated, IFN-independent mechanisms of mRV clearance have been reported (Shi et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2014), we found that the signature of homeostatic ISGs in ileum tissue included well-characterized antiviral ISGs (Figures 1-2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>For Figure 5 and S3 data, the authors examine gene expression in intestinal cells collected from mice and then enriched for epithelial vs. lamina propria cell populations. They see significantly reduced expression of IFN upon ABX treatment in just one case-harvested epithelial cells that have been enriched for CD45+ cells (leukocytes) have reduced IFNlambda expression. Lamina propria CD45+ cells do not show significantly reduced IFNlambda. This is surprising. While there are low levels of CD45+ cells in epithelial cell preps (as they show in Figure S3), there are higher levels of CD45+ cells in the LP preps. It seems odd that the only significant difference lies with these immune cells in the epithelial cell prep, and this effect is not observed in LP preps, which should contain many more CD45+ cells. Given the authors' conclusion that leukocytes are the source of IFNlambda, this deserves more follow-up or at least some discussion. Is there something special about CD45+ cells from epithelial preps? Is it possible these are contaminating cells? Or is it simply an issue with spread in the data?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work by Mahlakoiv et al. (Figure S3 of Mahlakoiv 2015) showed that CD45+ cells in intestinal epithelial cell preps express IFN-λ transcripts at homeostasis and therefore, we do not find it surprising to detect IFN-λ transcripts in this cellular fraction. The data depicted in Figure 5 and Figure S6 (previously S3) build upon the findings of Mahlakoiv et al. by confirming that these homeostatic IFN-λ transcripts are dependent upon the presence of bacterial microbiota. Although CD45+ cells are more abundant in LP preps, our and Mahlakoiv et al’s findings suggest that the proximity of CD45+ cells to bacterial stimuli in the intestinal epithelial layer is more indicative of IFN-λ expression than the relative abundance of CD45+ cells. To clarify these points, we have updated the Results section to elaborate on the findings of Mahlakoiv et al. (lines 336-338): “A previous study (Mahlakõiv et al., 2015) noted the presence of IFN-λ transcripts (<italic>Ifnl2/3</italic>) at homeostasis in CD45+ cells within the stripped intestinal epithelium, but not in the lamina propria.”</p><p>We additionally emphasize the potential role of CD45+ cells from the lamina propria in our conclusion of Figure 5 (lines 348-350): “From these data, we conclude that epithelium-associated CD45+ leukocytes are the likely source of homeostatic IFN-λ in response to bacterial microbiota, but we do not rule out additional involvement of CD45+ cells in the lamina propria.”</p><p>We have also expanded our discussion to include further rationale for CD45+ cell surveillance of the intestinal epithelium for stimuli from the bacterial microbiota (lines 685-690): “Although the cell type that produces homeostatic IFN-λ is unknown, enrichment for <italic>Ifnl2/3</italic> in CD45+ cells within the intestinal epithelial fraction suggests that proximity to bacterial stimuli may be a primary determinant in this response. We suggest that these cells may be actively surveying the intestinal epithelium to detect bacterial MAMPs. The specific CD45+ cell types responsible for producing homeostatic IFN-λ will be a topic of interest for future studies.”</p><p>Our future work beyond the scope of this study aims to definitively characterize the IFN-λ source cell type and its requirement for homeostatic ISG expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 8 and S6, the authors examine Ifit1 expression in WT or mutant mice with different treatments (ABX, LPS, fecal transfer), to determine if LPS or fecal transfer can restore gene expression. Due to low expression levels and a high degree of spread in the data, they resort to binning the primary gene expression data (8H and S6A; ABX vs. ABX/LPS not significantly different) into + vs. – categories (Figure 8J, S6E; ABX vs. ABX/LPS now are significantly different) to allow different statistical analysis. From this, they conclude that ISG expression is partially restored by LPS treatment in ABX-treated mice. Since the data are just around the detection limit and it's a high bar to restore gene expression, it's perhaps understandable that the data are binary, but this isn't the most convincing data set.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that Reviewer #2 recognizes the difficulties associated with analyzing the datasets present in Figure 8 and Figure S9 (formerly S6). Because control reconstitution with fecal transfer results in incomplete restoration of homeostatic ISGs, we find it compelling that restoration of <italic>Ifit1</italic> signal by LPS in ABX-treated mice is also localized. Although these results are variable, we think that the use of three candidate ISGs and two experimental approaches increases the weight of their evidence. Additionally, we now include experiments testing a role for a distinct MAMP (flagellin) in restoration of homeostatic ISGs in Figure S9. Flagellin results in partial restitution, similar to LPS, further increasing the collective strength of these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>An alternative explanation for the observed ISG expression phenotype could be a difference in baseline microbiota composition between WT and IFNLR -/- mice.

These littermate comparisons in combination with 16S rRNA sequencing suggest that unique microbiota composition is not the primary determinant of the homeostatic IFN-λ response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Qualitative differences in colonisation could also explain the binary response of WT mice to fecal transfer.</p></disp-quote><p>It is plausible that localized differences in colonization by specific members of the bacterial microbiota may exist and may explain the binary response of WT mice to fecal transfer. However, because administration of free LPS (and also flagellin in revised manuscript) to ABX-treated mice results in binary restoration of <italic>Ifit1</italic> signal, our model is that bacterial colonization is not necessary for localization of ISG signal. However, we have not fully ruled out a contributory role for qualitative differences in bacterial colonization, so we now include discussion of this possibility into the discussion in Lines 698-701: “The basis for this pattern is unknown; however, it may reflect the distribution of cells capable of sensing bacterial microbiota, distinct microenvironments within the gastrointestinal tract, or qualitative differences in bacterial colonization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The focussed ISG response shown in Figure 8 is intriguing but difficult to reconcile with the 20x reduced viral titres in WT mice. Does the virus only replicate in these sites? And are commensal microbiota specifically dense in these areas. A multicolour FISH approach could answer both of these points.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that experiments to visualize sites of virus replication are important context. Therefore, we have now included multicolor FISH depicting the distribution of <italic>Ifit1</italic> and murine rotavirus transcript at 24 hours post-infection (Figure 9I) and have included description of these results in-text (Lines 598-602): “To further contextualize the role of homeostatic ISGs in protection against mRV, we performed in situ hybridization for both mRV and <italic>Ifit1</italic> in the ileum of WT mice at 24 hours post-inoculation (Figure 9I). We observed variability in the magnitude of mRV infection between mice at this timepoint; however, we generally found that mRV RNA was not present in villi that have <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression.” To summarize, we observe that mRV-infected IECs are primarily <italic>Ifit1</italic> negative, and <italic>Ifit1</italic>-positive villi are rarely infected by mRV. These observations are consistent with mRV evasion of ISG production by infected cells, and imply (but do not prove) a protective role for preexisting ISG expression. We propose that regions with homeostatic ISG expression may have increased chance of initial encounter with mRV and are resistant to infection, but that these regions are not exclusive sites of mRV encounter. In addition to imaging, this model is partly informed by our observations that luminal MAMP administration results in localized ISG response and suggests differential access of luminal contents (Figure 8, Figure S9).</p><p>Local variation in bacterial microbiota concentration is an attractive hypothesis for localized ISG expression, but we have been unable to collect sufficient evidence to support it. Our attempts to retain mucus and bacteria within our tissue sections were not consistently successful across the large tissue sections needed to properly survey for localized ISG expression. Additionally, as mentioned above, administration of luminal MAMP to ABX-treated mice partially restores <italic>Ifit1</italic> signal, so we infer that qualitative differences in bacterial colonization are insufficient to explain the localization of ISG signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…]</p><p>– In Figure 1 the authors claim that there is no significant difference between ifnlr-/- +/- ABX. However, this is hard to say from the presented data.

Without the correct numbers it is hard to judge the conclusion of this figure.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to these and other reviewer comments, we have made multiple changes listed below to more clearly present our GSEA analysis. Together, our conclusions are unchanged from our prior submission, but the presentation is improved in clarity and includes additional information about gene set changes in our treatment groups.</p><p>1) We have removed genes with 0 counts in all samples because they do not provide information for enrichment comparisons and decreased visual clarity of the prior enrichment plots.</p><p>2) To improve upon our prior “circular” approach of using IFN-λ treatment response (Lee et al.) to test for ISG enrichment, our revised manuscript analyzes our data by GSEA for enrichment of the independently-curated HALLMARK gene sets, which include ISG sets and other pathways relevant to intestinal homeostasis (Figure S2) (Liberzon et al., 2016).</p><p>3) We now report only FDR, which is adjusted for multiple comparison testing such as the hallmark gene sets. The values in the previous Figure 1B (both FDR and p-value) were equal because of the usage of a single gene set, where FDR takes into account multiple hypotheses testing with multiple gene sets.</p><p>4) In our new analysis using HALLMARK gene sets (Figure S2), we find that INTERFERON_Α_RESPONSE genes are most upregulated in the ileum with IFN-λ stimulation, consistent with the known overlap between type I and III IFN signaling pathways.

We find there is no statistically significant difference between the ISGs of ABX-treated <italic>Ifnlr1-/-</italic> mice and conventional <italic>Ifnlr1-/-</italic> mice. These data provide additional quantification that augments our initial gene set enrichment analysis. In light of our new analysis, we have amended our commentary on the results of the heatmap in Figure 1G (formerly Figure 1H) on lines 154-162: “Comparison of homeostatic ISG transcript counts between experimental treatments revealed similar insights as prior GSEA analysis.

We would suggest that the inclusion of CD45-negative events in the CD45-enriched population does not lead to erroneous conclusions: we find the purity of EpCAM+ cells is quite high (&gt; 90%) post-enrichment, but we cannot detect IFN-λ transcripts in these cells; therefore, the contamination of EpCAM+ events in the CD45-enriched populations does not confound our conclusions from Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure S4, high magnification images are needed to see if the crypts are able to respond to IFNs in a murine model to clearly demonstrate whether it would be possible for them to have IFN dependent homeostatic ISGs or whether the authors are already selecting for a phenotype only present in mature enterocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure S7 (formerly figure S4) and now show increased magnification fields as insets. We have also clarified the language in the Results section of Figure 6 to reflect that this stimulation depicts minimal <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in intestinal crypts, consistent with the lack of homeostatic ISG expression by crypt-associated cells in Figure 6A and, subsequently, Figure 7 (Lines 390-395): “ We determined that localized ISG expression within individual villi was not due to a localized ability to respond to IFN-λ because stimulation with exogenous IFN-λ resulted in <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression within all intestinal villi, but not intestinal crypts (Figure S7). The minimal expression of <italic>Ifit1</italic> within intestinal crypts following exogenous IFN-λ treatment suggests that homeostatic ISGs are localized to mature enterocytes because intestinal crypts do not exhibit robust responses to IFN-λ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure S5, the colon data is not very convincing as the ifnlrKO shows some background staining which does not look much different from the other images. Additionally, it is not clear why only floxed and dIEC mice are used in this figure and there are no WT mice used as in Figure 6. It would be good to have the matching animals to better compare the data. It would also be important to include high mag images to clearly see if the ISG distribution is the same (as it does not seem to be the same tip distribution that is seen in the ileum). This figure should also include a quantification as provided in other figures.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure S8 (formerly figure S5), we provided images of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in the colon of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>Het</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>Het</sup> and littermate mice singly deficient in <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> (<italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>KO</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>Het</sup>) or <italic>Ifnar1</italic> (<italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>Het</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>KO</sup>). Our manuscript thus includes images from both full and conditional KO mice as well as relevant controls. We are confused regarding the reviewer’s comments about <italic>Ifnlr1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> and <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>ΔIEC</sup> mice as these mice do not appear in our former Figure S5.</p><p>To increase ease of viewing and ability to distinguish signal from background, we have provided higher magnification insets of areas of interest for these images, consequently these insets also increase appreciation of the lack of <italic>Ifit1</italic> staining in mice lacking <italic>Ifnlr1</italic> (<italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>KO</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>Het</sup>). We have also added double-knockout (<italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>KO</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>KO</sup>) images to emphasize our conclusions. Finally, we have added quantification of the area of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in tissue sections of <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>Het</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>Het</sup>, <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>KO</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>Het</sup>, <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>Het</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>KO</sup> , and <italic>Ifnlr1</italic><sup>KO</sup>/<italic>Ifnar1</italic><sup>KO</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 7, crypt cells are not a cell type. There are stem cells, TA and other progenitors present that make up the crypt. This should be renamed to correctly indicate the type of cells in this population.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated our language in the Results section of Figure 7 to more accurately convey the cell types present in the “crypt-associated” grouping that we defined. In certain cases, we refer to a group of cells from the single-cell sequencing data produced by Elmentaite et al. that were annotated as “crypt”. In the interest of accuracy and readability, where applicable in the results of Figure 7, we have clarified the decision to retain the cellular annotations bestowed by the original publishing group and removed any reference to this crypt group as a type of cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Additionally, the scRNA-Seq used for human analysis was a bit strange. This paper used mainly embryos and children to derive the cell types. The fact that only a few cell types were highly present seems to indicate that maybe this was not the best paper. It would be good to compare to stronger papers such as Wang et al. JEM 2020, Fuji et al. Cell Stem Cell 2018. There is also a paper using human ileum showing that stem cells and enterocytes each have their own basal ISGs which are stem cell specific or enterocytes specific (Triana, 2020). The statements about the human data should be toned down or a more robust scRNA data set should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not used the data gathered from embryos and have only analyzed the data from healthy children. Rather than add more datasets to the manuscript, we have chosen to tone down our conclusions regarding our analysis of the human scRNA-sequencing data by Elmentaite et al. (Lines 480-482): “Our analysis of a human scRNA-seq dataset is consistent with observations in the murine model, though future studies will be required to definitively address the existence of homeostatic ISGs in human tissue.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure S6D, why are there different numbers of mice used for each ISG? If the RNA is harvested, then the same RNA can be used to assess all three ISGs. It seems strange that of 30 mice tested for ifit1, only 17 were tested for stat1. These missing numbers seems strange and should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noting the values in Figure S9D (formerly S6D). Upon bringing it to our attention, we realized that the table in question had transposed columns. We have updated the table to display the correct values – for FT rescue, we have tested 30 mice for <italic>Ifit1</italic>, and have tested slightly fewer mice (27 and 24) for <italic>Stat1</italic> and <italic>Oas1a</italic>, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The homeostatic ISGs are only found in the tip of the villi, and rotavirus infection normally occurs at the tips of the villi, the authors claim that these homeostatic ISGs are more protective against infection. To make this claim the authors need to perform a co-staining of rotavirus infected tissue to show that the villi that are infected are not the villi which express the homeostatic ISGs. In general, rotavirus staining is needed as the FACS data suggests that a very low numbers of cells are infected which makes it hard to justify the authors claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included multicolor in situ hybridization depicting the distribution of <italic>Ifit1</italic> and murine rotavirus at 24hr postinfection (Figure 9I) and have included description of these results in-text (Lines 598-602): “To further contextualize the role of homeostatic ISGs in protection against mRV, we performed in situ hybridization for both mRV and <italic>Ifit1</italic> in the ileum of WT mice at 24 hours post-inoculation (Figure 9I). We observed variability in the magnitude of mRV infection between mice at this timepoint; however, we generally found that mRV RNA was not present in villi that have <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors claim that IFN is being produced from CD45+ epithelium derived lymphocytes. To support and strengthen this claim, it would be important to perform RNA scope with markers for these cells to determine if the sparse ISG induction seen in the tissue is correlates with the localization of these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data showing that IFN-λ is being produced by CD45+ cells associated with the intestinal epithelium is consistent with previous observations by Mahlakoiv et al. (Mahlakoiv 2015, Figure S3). We agree that further defining the cellular source of IFN-λ in response to microbial stimuli is a priority. However, we believe that this question demands robust experimental verification beyond that of correlative imaging and aim to pursue these studies in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Since the authors claim is that the homeostatic ISGs come from sensing of bacterial components, and that LPS can rescue this phenotype, then the authors should determine if tlr4-/- mice also lack the presence of homeostatic ISGs.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer below, we now include additional data with flagellin stimulation, which is capable of partially restoring homeostatic ISGs. Therefore, we would not expect deficiency of a single TLR to prevent expression of all homeostatic ISGs. In fact, MyD88 deficiency does not uniformly prevent expression of homeostatic ISGs across tissue sites (ileum and colon). Separate studies beyond the scope of the current manuscript will be needed to further fully define the cell types and signaling pathways responsible for homeostatic IFN-λ production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Furthermore, the authors claim in the discussion that microbiota components are responsible for the homeostatic levels and that they signal through several MAMPs. However, this is not shown in the paper. In the manuscript the authors only tested LPS. They also used CpG which will signal through MyD88 but does not induce this response. To make the claim that multiple MAMPs can be used, then several other MAMP agonists should be used to show that this is not only a LPS phenotype (e.g. flagellin).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include evidence that peroral flagellin is able to stimulate the homeostatic IFN-λ response to a similar extent as LPS in antibiotic-treated mice (Figure S9, formerly Figure S6). We have now included additional commentary regarding this finding in our results (Lines 526-535): “To corroborate these findings, we performed orthogonal analyses of <italic>Ifit1</italic>, <italic>Stat1</italic>, and <italic>Oas1a</italic> expression in ileum tissue of WT mice treated with ABX followed by fecal transplant, LPS administration, administration of the TLR5 agonist: flagellin, or administration of TLR9 agonist: CpG DNA (Figure S9). These data exhibited high variance, but were consistent with imaging data in Figure 8, indicating a partial restoration of homeostatic ISGs in 2050% of ABX-treated mice by LPS, flagellin, or fecal transplant, but not CpG DNA (Figure S9). Together, these data indicate that both LPS and flagellin are sufficient to restore homeostatic ISG expression to a similar extent as total microbiota. The ability of multiple TLR stimuli to partially restore homeostatic ISGs suggests that exposure to a variety of bacterial MAMPs is the basis for localized, homeostatic ISG expression.”</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Functional protection against rotavirus</p><p>The reviewers noted the need for quantification of the colocalization of murine rotavirus and Ifit1 expression in our co-staining images.

However, we have also revised the Results section to include quantification of <italic>Ifit1</italic> and mRV co-incidence on lines 665-668; “Quantification of co-staining for <italic>Ifit1</italic> in mRVinfected cells indicated that a minority (~30%) were <italic>Ifit1</italic>+ at 12hr or 24hr post-inoculation, whereas a majority (~63%) of mRV-infected cells were <italic>Ifit1</italic>+ at 96hr post-inoculation (Figure 9I-J and Figure 9 —figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ultimately, we are sympathetic to the reviewers’ puzzlement about how localized, ISG-expressing IECs could provide meaningful protection against viral infection and understand that the reviewers are unconvinced by our discussion of our model in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed alternative models that explain our data in the Discussion section on lines 830844.</p><p>“Although we found that homeostatic ISGs provide protection during initiation of mRV infection, it remains unclear how these localized ISG pockets impart this protection. Given our findings in Figure 8 and Figure 8 —figure supplement 1, we suggest that these localized ISGs may be indicative of locations that are particularly vulnerable to viral infection if ISGs were not present at the time of viral exposure. However, alternative explanations for the protective effects that we observe are also plausible, such as: (i) an inability to detect the full magnitude of ISG expression by imaging, or (ii) an unknown temporal component to homeostatic ISG signaling that may be coincident with durable ISG protein expression. Given the magnitude of signal amplification in RNAscope in situ hybridization and the similarity of <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in our imaging data to <italic>Ifit1</italic> expression in public singlecell sequencing datasets, we find it unlikely that there is more widespread homeostatic ISG expression below the limit of our detection by imaging. However, we do think an uncharacterized temporal component of homeostatic ISG signaling is plausible, wherein individual villi may be rapidly and transiently expressing homeostatic ISGs in response to sensing of bacterial microbiota. This temporal model may also include a more durable ISG protein response that is not fully concordant with expression of ISG transcripts.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Partial effect of LPS and Flagellin</p><p>Reviewers voiced concerns regarding the interpretation of LPS, flagellin, and fecal-transfer experiments to assess ISG restoration in ABX-treated mice.
