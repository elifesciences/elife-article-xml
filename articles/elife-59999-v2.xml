spindle microtubules, the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport-III (ESCRT-III) machinery has emerged as a key player in the regeneration of a sealed nuclear envelope (NE) during mitotic exit, and in the repair of this organelle during interphase rupture. ESCRT-III assembly at the NE occurs transiently during mitotic (M) exit and is initiated when CHMP7, an ER-localised ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein, interacts with the Inner Nuclear Membrane (INM) protein LEM2. Whilst classical nucleocytoplasmic transport mechanisms have been proposed to separate LEM2 and CHMP7 during interphase, it is unclear how CHMP7 assembly is suppressed in mitosis when NE and ER identities are mixed. Here, we use live cell imaging and protein biochemistry to examine the biology of these proteins during M-exit. Firstly, we show that CHMP7 plays an important role in the dissolution of LEM2 clusters that form at the NE during M-exit. Secondly, we show that CDK1 phosphorylates CHMP7 upon M-entry at Ser3 and Ser441 and that this phosphorylation reduces CHMP7’s interaction with LEM2, limiting its assembly during M-phase. We show that spatiotemporal differences in the dephosphorylation of CHMP7 license its assembly at the NE during telophase, but restrict its assembly on the ER at this time. Without CDK1 phosphorylation, CHMP7 undergoes inappropriate assembly in the peripheral ER during M-exit, capturing LEM2 and downstream ESCRT-III components. Lastly, we establish that a microtubule network is dispensable for ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming nuclear envelope. These data identify a key cell-cycle control programme allowing ESCRT-III-dependent nuclear regeneration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ESCRT</kwd><kwd>cell bio</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>CDK1</kwd><kwd>CHMP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>206346/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlton</surname><given-names>Jeremy G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M009513/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stoten</surname><given-names>Caroline L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FC001002 FC001143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>Peter B</given-names></name><name><surname>Carlton</surname><given-names>Jeremy G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CHMP7 is phosphorylated by CDK1 upon mitotic entry, preventing interaction with LEM2 and inappropriate assembly during mitotic exit.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During division, cells undergo a programmed reorganisation of their interphase architecture to allow cyto- and karyokinesis. The division phase (M-phase) is set through the actions of key protein kinases such as Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-1 (CDK1) that modify the behaviour of proteins to orchestrate cellular reorganisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Champion et al., 2017</xref>). To grant the spindle access to duplicated chromatids, the nuclear envelope (NE) is disassembled and is incorporated into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) creating a hybrid organelle containing peripheral and transmembrane proteins from both organelles. As cells exit M-phase, they must regenerate both their nuclei and their NE. Here, membranes from the ER/NE hybrid organelle envelope nascent daughter nuclei, INM proteins recover their NE localisation, spindle microtubules traversing the NE are disassembled and remaining holes in the NE are sealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlton et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to its roles in membrane trafficking and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vietri et al., 2020a</xref>), ESCRT-III has emerged as a key orchestrator of nuclear envelope sealing during open mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Olmos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olmos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2017</xref>), the repair of ruptured micro- and parental nuclear envelopes in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Willan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Robijns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vietri et al., 2020b</xref>) and the surveillance of damaged NPC complexes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Webster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Webster et al., 2014</xref>). ESCRT-III is a membrane remodelling filamentous polymer that works <italic>in-concert</italic> with a AAA-ATPase called VPS4 that provides energy for filament remodelling. VPS4 is recruited to ESCRT-III proteins through engagement of sequences called MIMs (MIT-domain interaction motifs) through its MIT (Microtubule Interaction and Trafficking) domain found within ESCRT-III proteins. In the context of NE reformation, during M-exit, the inner nuclear membrane protein LEM2 assembles into a phase-separated gel-like polymer that defines sites of ESCRT-dependent nuclear envelope sealing through its ability to recruit and activate polymerisation of the ER-localised ESCRT-III protein, CHMP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, CHMP7 and LEM2 may also regulate nuclear envelope sealing by feeding new ER membrane, as recently shown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>). In worms and fission yeast, LEM2 also has important roles in stabilising peripheral heterochromatin and in organising chromatin architecture in the interphase nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikegami et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrales et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pieper et al., 2020</xref>). Given the key role for LEM2 in stimulating CHMP7 polymerisation during M-exit, we wondered how the biology of CHMP7 and LEM2 was controlled during M-phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CHMP7 is required for dissolution of LEM2 clusters that form during nuclear envelope regeneration</title><p>CHMP7 and LEM2 exhibit complex domain architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and in interphase are localised to the ER and the INM, respectively. We took RNA-interference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and stable cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) approaches to explore the CHMP7/LEM2 axis during M-exit. In early mitosis, GFP-CHMP7 and LEM2-mCh co-localised in a hybrid ER/NE, were then transiently co-enriched at sites of ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming NE, and subsequently adopted distinct ER and NE identities as cells exited mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2017</xref>), LEM2-depletion prevented the transient assembly of CHMP7 at the reforming NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). We generated cells stably expressing LEM2-mCh or LEM2<sup>δLEM</sup>-mCh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and found that the LEM-domain was necessary for efficient LEM2 and CHMP7 enrichment at the reforming nuclear envelope, and subsequent retention of LEM2 at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref>). In cells co-expressing GFP-CHMP7 and LEM2<sup>δLEM</sup>-mCh, both proteins instead co-assembled in the peripheral ER after nuclear envelope reformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Deletion of the CHMP7-interaction domain from LEM2 (LEM2<sup>δ415-485</sup>-mCh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>) also resulted in the generation of clusters of LEM2 and nuclear envelope morphology defects in the following interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These data suggest that LEM2 must effectively gain chromatin tethers during mitotic exit to localise CHMP7 to the reforming NE, and that persistent LEM2 in the peripheral ER can seed inappropriate CHMP7 clustering during mitotic exit. In <italic>S. japonicus</italic>, Cmp7 disaggregates Lem2 clusters during interphase and mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pieper et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we found that CHMP7 depletion led to persistent enrichment of LEM2 at the reforming NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>), suggesting that CHMP7 acts additionally to disassemble LEM2 during M-exit. Importantly, depletion of IST1, an ESCRT-III subunit with well-characterised roles in nuclear envelope sealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>), did not lead to persistent LEM2 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is consistent with recent findings from yeast and worms suggesting functional diversity across ESCRT-III components during NE reassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pieper et al., 2020</xref>). Persistent assembly of LEM2 in CHMP7-depleted cells led to the formation of NE morphology defects during cytokinesis that persisted into the subsequent interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These LEM2 clusters did not incorporate other INM proteins such as LAP1 or Emerin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). VPS4 was neither recruited to the reforming NE in the absence of CHMP7, nor recruited to the LEM2 clusters induced by CHMP7-depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–C</xref>), suggesting that the clusters may form as a consequence of impaired remodelling of ESCRT-III. In cells bearing persistent LEM2 clusters, we observed a breakdown in nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and the localisation of DNA-damage markers to the site of these clusters, suggesting that their formation is detrimental to cellular health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). In <italic>S. japonicus</italic>, Lem2 clusters generated in the absence of ESCRT-III sequester heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Pieper et al., 2020</xref>). We wondered if persistent LEM2 aggregation during mitotic exit may perturb chromatin structure in CHMP7-depleted mammalian cells. We followed endogenous Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) after CHMP7 depletion and instead found diminished HP1 foci in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B–C</xref>). This defect was more pronounced in cells exhibiting LEM2-mCh clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>) and whilst there were a few remaining HP1 clusters in CHMP7-depleted cells, these did not co-localise with LEM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5E</xref>). Thus, as well as roles in spindle disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>) and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olmos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gu et al., 2017</xref>), we suggest that CHMP7 also controls a separate process of LEM2 dissolution during mitotic exit to allow both generation of a normal nuclear envelope and proper organisation of heterochromatin during the following interphase.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ESCRT-III controls LEM2 dynamics during nuclear envelope reformation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon depicting CHMP7 and LEM2 secondary structural elements.

Given that CHMP7 alone may form non-specific aggregates which could pellet by sedimentation, we next used a sedimentation-independent interaction assay to test the effect of CHMP7 phosphorylation on its ability to bind LEM2<sup>CT</sup>. Here, we discovered that whilst CHMP7 could interact well with LEM2<sup>CT</sup>, either CDK1-phosphorylated CHMP7 or CHMP7 S3D/S441D were less able to interact with LEM2<sup>CT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). These data suggest that CDK1 phosphorylation of CHMP7 reduces both its ability to self-associate and its ability to bind LEM2. As the LEM2 interaction is thought to activate polymerisation of CHMP7, we next examined the nature of the LEM2/CHMP7 assemblies produced by negative-stain electron microscopy. We observed that LEM2<sup>CT</sup> induced polymerisation of CHMP7 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), producing curved filaments with periodicity matching the published dimensions and repeat units of the CHMP7 polymer observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the reduced interaction between CHMP7 S3D/S441D and LEM2<sup>CT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>), these filaments were not produced when LEM2<sup>CT</sup> was incubated with CHMP7 S3D/S441D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). In addition to curved filaments of CHMP7, we also observed curved lattices of CHMP7, suggesting that both linear and lateral polymeric interactions were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These in vitro data support the hypothesis that CDK1-phosphorylation of CHMP7 acts to restrict its polymerisation by suppressing self-interaction and interaction with LEM2.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>CDK1-phosphorylation of CHMP7 persists beyond the timeframe nuclear envelope reassembly</title><p>We next used monopolar spindle assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2008</xref>) to examine the synchronised behaviour of CHMP7 during mitotic exit. Here, we synchronised cells at prometaphase using the Eg5 inhibitor STLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Skoufias et al., 2006</xref>) and then employed RO-3306, a highly specific CDK1 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vassilev et al., 2006</xref>), to force synchronous mitotic exit. We used previously described CAL-51 cells in which the <italic>CHMP7</italic> locus had been homozygously edited to encode mNG-CHMP7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Olmos et al., 2016</xref>). Following STLC arrest, we found that mNG-CHMP7 initiated assembly 16.32 ± 0.88 min after CDK1 inhibition and polymerised in a wave around the chromatin mass from the spindle-distal to the spindle-engaged face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>). Assembly of endogenous CHMP7 persisted for 2.67 ± 0.22 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), mimicking the assembly dynamics around the telophase nuclear envelope in asynchronous cells both in duration and in that CHMP7 in the peripheral ER was resistant to the assembly signal. In CHMP7-depleted HeLa cells stably expressing siRNA-resistant GFP-CHMP7 (GFP-CHMP7<sup>R</sup>), CHMP7 assembled with similar kinetics, initiating 16.93 ± 1.21 min after CDK1 inhibition and persisting for 3.32 ± 0.13 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). Importantly, LEM2-mCh displayed similar kinetics, becoming enriched at the monopolar nuclear envelope 16.21 ± 2.23 min after CDK1 inhibition, and persisting for 4.11 ± 0.44 min. In contrast to CHMP7, LEM2-mCh localised more strongly at the spindle-engaged face of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video3">Figure 5—video 3</xref>) before being depolymerised and maintaining NE localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Enrichment at the spindle-engaged face is perhaps indicative of its phase-separated interaction with microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>). We next asked whether microtubules were necessary for CHMP7 assembly by using nocodazole instead of STLC to arrest cells at pro-metaphase. In this case, endogenous mNG-CHMP7 assembled and disassembled at the nuclear envelope with normal kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref> – 1D, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video4">Figure 5—video 4</xref>), suggesting that microtubules are dispensable for ESCRT-III assembly at this site. Interestingly, endogenous mNG-CHMP7 usually assembled synchronously around the perimeter of the chromatin mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, in cells that were able to form a pseudo-furrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2008</xref>), CHMP7 assembled at the furrow-proximal face, before spreading to the rest of the chromatin, suggesting that there may be a furrow-directed spatial component to ESCRT-III dynamics at the reforming NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video5">Figure 5—video 5</xref>). Consistent with experiments from cycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), in CHMP7-depleted cells stably expressing LEM2-mCh, LEM2-mCh was poorly disassembled after nuclear envelope enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video6">Figure 5—video 6</xref>). These persistent LEM2-mCh assemblies did not colocalise with microtubules, suggesting that they do not form as a consequence of impaired spindle disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). Biochemical analysis of whole cell lysates from these monopolar spindle assays revealed phosphorylation of total CHMP7 at both Ser3 and Ser441 persisted for 20 min following CDK1 inhibition, with dephosphorylation completing 30 min after CDK1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Importantly, these data suggest that ESCRT-III-dependent nuclear envelope reformation occurs in a time period when the bulk of CHMP7 in the peripheral ER is phosphorylated, and that complete CHMP7 dephosphorylation only occurs after nuclear envelope reformation. We wondered if there were spatiotemporal differences in the dephosphorylation kinetics of CHMP7. Using biochemical fractionation, we found that only a minor pool of CHMP7 could be detected in a chromatin-associated fraction during M-exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and we discovered that CHMP7 in this pool was dephosphorylated in advance of the larger extra-chromatin ER and cytosolic pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> – 2C). We next raised an antibody that was able to detect pSer3 CHMP7 in mitotic cells and discovered that the pool of endogenous CHMP7 assembling at the reforming NE was not illuminated by this antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref> – 2I). These data suggest that phosphorylation of the bulk of CHMP7 in the peripheral ER persists during M-exit, whereas the pool of CHMP7 in contact with the reforming NE is dephosphorylated in advance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dephosphorylation kinetics of CHMP7 during mitotic exit.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) CAL-51 cells homozygously edited to express mNG-CHMP7 (<bold>A</bold>) or HeLa cells stably expressing LEM2-mCh (<bold>B</bold>) were synchronised to prometaphase with STLC and then released through addition of RO-3306.

During M-exit, the cell must also convert an apolar sheet of ER/NE membrane to a polarised sheet with distinct INM and ONM identities. We found that during mitotic exit, the INM protein LEM2 was co-enriched with CHMP7 at the reforming nuclear envelope and then released in a CHMP7-dependent manner to populate the INM. Importantly, LEM2 enrichment at the reforming nuclear envelope occurred in the absence of CHMP7, consistent with it being an upstream regulator of this pathway. The LEM2 clusters in CHMP7-depleted cells that persisted into the next interphase led to a breakdown of nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalisation and the generation of localised DNA damage. By inducing precocious assembly of CHMP7 through deletion of a C-terminal autoregulatory helix, we discovered that clusters of CHMP7<sup>δHelix6</sup> that formed were disassembled upon mitotic entry, suggesting that CHMP7 assembly may be regulated by cell cycle control mechanisms. Mitotic phosphorylation of the ESCRT-III components IST1 and CHMP4C is already known to regulate cytokinetic abscission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Capalbo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caballe et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that this machinery is capable of being modified by phosphorylation, and mitotic phosphorylation of LEM2 can control both its interaction with partner proteins such as Barrier to Autointegration Factor (BAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asencio et al., 2012</xref>) and its phase-separation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>). We identified direct CDK1 phosphorylation of CHMP7 at Ser3 and Ser441 as a suppressor of both CHMP7’s ability to interact with LEM2 and its ability to assemble, as judged by sedimentation assays. Given the requirement for LEM2 in the activation of CHMP7 polymerisation, introducing phosphomimetic residues at these positions suppressed LEM2-dependent CHMP7 polymerisation in vitro. Interestingly, CHMP7 is the only ESCRT-III subunit to bear recognisable consensus sequences for CDK1 phosphorylation, suggesting that mitotic regulation of ESCRT-III may be effected through this protein. Analysing the kinetics of CHMP7 phosphorylation revealed that phosphorylation coincided with M-phase entry and that global levels of CHMP7 phosphorylation persisted during the timeframe of ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming NE. We found that a local pool of CHMP7 at the reforming NE was dephosphorylated in advance of the major pool of CHMP7 in the cytosol and on the peripheral ER, suggesting a mechanism by which spatiotemporal regulation of ESCRT-III assembly could be controlled locally by CHMP7 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Whilst phosphomimetic residues at the CDK1-phosphorylation sites suppressed CHMP7’s interaction with LEM2 and reduced its sedimentation in a minimal in vitro system, their effect in cells were more complex to interpret, as we found that CHMP7 bearing phosphomimetic mutations could still be recruited, albeit with a reduced intensity and in a delayed manner, to the reforming NE, and could still rescue the phenotypes of CHMP7-depletion. It is possible that the restriction on assembly imposed by phosphomimetic residues is purposefully weak, allowing it to be overridden by the high concentration of LEM2 at the reforming NE. Alternatively, there may be additional LEM2-independent activators of CHMP7 polymerisation in cells. Examination of nonphosphorylatable substitutions were clearer to interpret as these versions of CHMP7 led to correct nuclear envelope assembly, but additional spatially inappropriate capture of residual LEM2 in the peripheral ER during M-exit. These clusters persisted into interphase and captured progressively more LEM2, leading to the loss of LEM2 from the INM. Whilst CDK1 phosphorylation at these residues suppresses inappropriate CHMP7 clustering and LEM2 capture during M-exit, it remains unclear why these clusters develop only during telophase, rather than earlier phases of mitosis. Given that LEM2 similarly undergoes M-phase phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">von Appen et al., 2020</xref>) and likely dephosphorylation during M-exit, we speculate its dephosphorylation kinetics may contribute to its co-association with CHMP7. Finally, contrary to the prevailing view that this assembly occurs at sites where spindle microtubules traverse the reforming nuclear envelope, we found that microtubules are dispensable for CHMP7 assembly at this organelle. These data are consistent with the findings from ESCRT-dependent interphase nuclear envelope repair where no such trans-nuclear envelope microtubules exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Raab et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Denais et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Robijns et al., 2016</xref>). These data link ESCRT-III assembly during mitotic exit to classical cell cycle control mechanisms and identify mitotic phosphorylation of CHMP7 as a mechanism to directly suppress its inappropriate assembly allowing LEM2 to correctly populate the INM.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CHMP7</td><td>Ensembl</td><td>ENSG00000147457</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>LEMD2</td><td>Ensembl</td><td>ENSG00000161904</td><td>Also called LEM2</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>NEB5a</td><td>NEB</td><td>C2987</td><td>Cloning grade derivative of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21Star (DE3)</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>C601003</td><td>Protein production strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5a</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CAL-51</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27618263/">27618263</ext-link></td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>GP2-293</td><td>Clontech</td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>CAL-51 mNG-CHMP7<sup>+/+</sup></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27618263/">27618263</ext-link></td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HeLa GFP-CHMP7<sup>R</sup></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27618263/">27618263</ext-link></td><td/><td>STR profiled from Crick Cell Services</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>pCMS28-EcoRI-NotI-XhoI</td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17556548/">17556548</ext-link></td><td/><td>Bicistronic retroviral packaging and exprssion vector expressing IRES-PuroR downstream of the MCS.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The manuscript 'Cdk1 controls Chmp7-dependent nuclear envelop reformation' by Jeremy Carlton and co-workers provides important new insight that helps to explain how the formation of ESCRT assemblies at the nuclear envelope (NE) is regulated. The authors have used a combination of live cell imaging, mutational analysis, and biochemical approaches to demonstrate how the interplay of Lem2 (an inner nuclear envelope membrane protein) and Chmp7 is coordinated during cell cycle progression. Because Chmp7 is an ESCRT-II/-III hybrid protein that nucleates ESCRT-III assemblies at the NE, its regulation by Cdk1 spatially and temporally restricts ESCRT -III assemblies to the reforming NE.</p><p>Specific revision requests for <italic>eLife</italic>:</p><p>1. Please address directly the in vivo role of Chmp7 phosphorylation for nuclear envelope integrity and morphology during interphase and after mitosis. It could be done by generating cell-lines in which endogenous Chmp7 was depleted and replaced with WT-Chmp7 (rescue) or phospho-mimetic- or non-phosphorylated Chmp7 mutants. In these cell-lines, they should analyze Lem2 clustering as well as nuclear integrity using GFP-NLS.</p><p>2. The Chmp7 phosphorylation paradox needs to be addressed somehow in the revision: Phosphorylation of CHMP7 restricted its polymerisation and yet CHMP7 was observed to assemble at the reforming nuclear envelope during the time period that it was phosphorylated. Perhaps one way to address this question in vivo is to generate cells that express at the same time GFP-Chmp7 S3A, S441A and phosphomimetic RFP-Chmp7 S3D, S441D and then follow their distribution in cells over time using live cell imaging. One would expect to see a clear separation of the two pools during mitosis.</p><p>3. Why do LEM2 clusters persist in CHMP7 depleted cells? Please check VPS4 localization in CHMP7 depleted cells to measure whether it localises to LEM2 clusters.</p><p>4. Please test in-vitro binding between Lem2 and the Chmp7 phospho mutants.</p><p>5. It would be great if possible, but not essential, to visualise how phosphorylation impacts CHMP7's oligomerization status using AFM or, more easily, negative stain electron microscopy, comparing with published control conditions (full-length versus ESCRT-III domain alone, in the presence of model membranes, versus in the presence of the C-terminal WH domain of LEM2). Can the observations be reconciled with the paradoxical monopolar spindle data? Specifically, these monopolar spile data led the authors to claim that CHMP7 is phosphorylated during the critical window when CHMP7 assembly activity is required for envelope sealing. As the authors note, this is hard to reconcile with their data showing that phosphorylation enhances solubility and that phospho-dead mutants assemble avidly with LEM2 and downstream ESCRT-IIIs, like IST1.

Despite repeated attempts, we were unable to generate triply-stable lines bearing phosphomimetic versions of CHMP7, LEM2 and a reporter of nuclear integrity. As such, we turned to a carefully controlled transient rescue of the CHMP7-depletion phenotype employing RNAi-resistant HA-CHMP7 constructs and in these lines analysed both LEM2 clustering and nuclear integrity. These data revealed that the LEM2-clusters formed in CHMP7 depleted cells compromised NE integrity. These clusters, and the NE-integrity defect, could be rescued by HA-CHMP7<sup>R</sup>, but not by HA-CHMP7<sup>R</sup> S3A/S441A. The new data is presented in Figure 1H and 1I, Figure 6A, 6B and Figure 6 Supplement 1A.</p><p>When performing these experiments, we were surprised to find that both HA-CHMP7<sup>R</sup> S3D/S441D and HA-CHMP7<sup>R</sup> S3E/S441E were able to rescue the clustering of LEM2 and the NE-integrity defect. We were intrigued by these findings and went on to examine the behaviour of GFP-CHMP7 S3D/S441D during M-exit. We discovered that it was still able to display limited assembly at the reforming NE, albeit with recruitment being significantly delayed and being significantly less intense (new Figure 5F-5H). We also performed new in-vitro experiments (see point 4 below) that show that phosphorylation or phosphomimetic residues at these positions could suppress CHMP7 sedimentation, its interaction with LEM2 and its polymerisation (new Figure 4E-4H, Figure 4 Supplement 1C and 1D. We note that this restriction on assembly in-vitro is partial, and we hypothesise that this allows it to be overridden by the high concentrations of LEM2 assembling at the reforming NE. We incorporate this into our discussion and also make comment that this may be evidence that alternate polymerisation stimuli may exist.</p><p>To address directly the physiological role of CHMP7-dependent LEM2 cluster dissolution, we analysed markers of DNA damage in these cells.

One would expect to see a clear separation of the two pools during mitosis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we apologise for not making our argument clear in the initial submission. The reviewers are correct in that phosphorylation of all the CHMP7 in the cell persists beyond the time period in which assembly at the NE occurs. In the original submission, we hypothesised that the NE-assembling pool was dephosphorylated in advance of the pool in the peripheral ER/cytosol, but we did not test this. Here, we have performed new experiments employing biochemical fractionation of the chromatin-associated and non-chromatin associated pools at defined times during a synchronised M-exit, and combined this with analysis of the phosphorylation status of CHMP7 using PhosTag SDS-PAGE. This revealed firstly that at all time points, only a minor fraction of CHMP7 was recoverable in the chromatin associated pool (new Figure 5 Supplement 2A-2C), suggesting that only a minor fraction of CHMP7 is involved in polymerisation at the reforming NE. This is consistent with our imaging approaches which demonstrate CHMP7 polymerisation is limited to the minor pool in direct contact with the NE. By analysing the rate of dephosphorylation of these two pools, we find that the chromatin-associated pool is dephosphorylated in advance of the pool in the peripheral ER/cytosol (new Figure 5 Supplement 2A-2C). We suggest that persistent phosphorylation of the ER-pool acts to restrict inappropriate assembly and capture of residual LEM2 on the peripheral ER. Consistent with this, we observe inappropriate clusters of GFP-CHMP7<sup>R</sup> S3A/S441A and LEM2-mCh forming on the ER during M-exit (new Figure 6C). We suggest that advanced dephosphorylation of a chromatin-associated pool of CHMP7 licenses assembly at the reforming NE.</p><p>To strengthen these observations, we generated a new phospho-specific antibody against CHMP7 Ser3. This antibody is characterised in Figure 5 Supplement 2D-2I. We note that the ER is notoriously hard to examine by fixation and immunofluorescence, but after careful optimisation, we were able to demonstrate this antibody’s ability to detect an siRNA-sensitive signal of phosphorylated CHMP7 on the mitotic ER. Under identical staining conditions, this antibody did not illuminate the pool of CHMP7 assembling at the reforming NE. These data are presented in new Figure 5 Supplement 2D-2I,, and we hope support our hypothesis that the pool of CHMP7 assembling at the reforming NE is dephosphorylated in advance of the major pool in the peripheral ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Why do LEM2 clusters persist in CHMP7 depleted cells? Please check VPS4 localization in CHMP7 depleted cells to measure whether it localises to LEM2 clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this – this is an interesting point that provides insight into how the NE clusters of LEM2 might get disassembled. We have generated new cell lines stably expressing LEM2-mCh and VPS4A-L-GFP. We find that VPS4 neither localises to the reforming NE in the absence of CHMP7 (new Figure 1 Supplement 4B), nor does it localise to the clusters of LEM2 formed in the absence of CHMP7 (new Figure 1 Supplement 4C). As expected from the literature, these data indicate that VPS4 is recruited to the reforming NE downstream of CHMP7. Interestingly, in the absence of IST1, VPS4 recruitment to the reforming NE was normal, and as LEM2 clusters at the NE did not form under these conditions, these data suggest recruitment of VPS4 correlates with dissolution of LEM2 clusters, indicating that this may be a consequence of canonical ESCRT-III activity and, importantly, to be independent of IST1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please test in-vitro binding between Lem2 and the Chmp7 phospho mutants</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting these experiments and believe they have added useful mechanistic insight into the behaviour of CHMP7. We began by extending our sedimentation assay that demonstrated co-sedimention of HA-LEM2<sup>CT</sup> with CHMP7 as a proxy for the CHMP7-LEM2 interaction. We generated recombinant versions of full length CHMP7 bearing phosphomimetic residues at Ser3 and Ser441 and showed that in-vitro, these phosphomimetic residues reduced sedimentation of CHMP7, suggesting that these changes impaired the self-association necessary for clustering and sedimentationn. The reviewers are correct in pointing out that we cannot know the polymerisation state of the sedimented material, and we have been careful to reword this as evidence of CHMP7 ‘clustering’. Under these conditions, co-sedimentation of HA-LEM2<sup>CT</sup> with CHMP7 S3D/S441D or CHMP7 S3E/S441E was reduced, suggesting that phosphorylation of CHMP7 impairs its ability to interact with LEM2. These data are presented in new Figure 4C and 4D.</p><p>However, as Reviewer 2 pointed out in their Review Commons review, ‘CHMP7 alone may form sticky aggregates, which will also pellet in sedimentation’. We wanted to repeat these experiments using a centrifugation-independent interaction assay to be sure that we were examining the interaction, rather than just the ability of CHMP7 to sediment and capture LEM2 non-specifically. As such, we covalently coupled anti-CHMP7 antisera to magnetic beads and performed the CHMP7/LEM2 interaction assay in-vitro. Here, we found that CHMP7 S3D/S441D’s interaction with LEM2<sup>CT</sup> was significantly reduced (new Figure 4E-4H). We extended these data to show that the interaction of WT CHMP7 with LEM2<sup>CT</sup> could be suppressed by directly phosphorylating CHMP7 using CDK1 (new Figure 4E – 4F). We thank the reviewer for these insightful suggestions and conclude that phosphorylation of CHMP7 on Ser3 and Ser441 suppresses its ability to bind LEM2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Using negative-stain electron microscopy, we can now report that in the presence of LEM2<sup>CT</sup>, we observe the generation of a polymer of CHMP7 that matches well the published dimensions and periodicity from von Appen et al., 2020. Performing these assays using CHMP7 S3D/S441D, we were unable to identify any polymeric assemblies, and could observe only monomers and aggregates. Given our interaction data suggesting that the phosphorylated version of CHMP7 is impaired in its ability to bind LEM2, we think it likely that this underlies its failure to polymerise in-vitro. We have included this data in the manuscript (Figure 4I and Figure 4 Supplement 2). In response to the paradoxical monopolar spindle data, we hope that our explanation and biochemical data have assuaged the reviewer’s concerns, as outlined in point 2. For assistance, performance and interpretation of negative stain electron microscopy, we have included Qu Chen and Peter Rosenthal as co-authors.</p><p>[Editors' note: we include below the reviews that the authors received from another journal, along with the authors’ responses.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript 'Cdk1 controls Chmp7-dependent nuclear envelop reformation' by Jeremy Carlton and co-workers provides important new insight that helps to explain how the formation of ESCRT assemblies at the nuclear envelop (NE) is regulated.

In particular the authors show that Cdk1 phosphorylates Chmp7 at mitotic entry on two sites (S4A, S441). Cdk1 dependent phosphorylation prevents Chmp7 activation/polymerization and phosphorylated Chmp7 can no longer engage Lem2 at the peripheral ER and thus limits ESCRT -III assemblies at the NE to mitotic exit. Defects in this process trigger unscheduled Lem2-Chmp7-ESCRT-III assemblies at the peripheral ER during mitotic exit and lead to the formation of Lem2 aggregates. The overall conclusions of the paper are important and provide a significant step forward in our understanding how the ESCRT machinery is controlled by the cell cycle machinery to re-establish NE integrity in interphase and after mitosis. Some points require clarification – I believe that most comments can be addressed without further experiments:</p><p>– What is the functional consequence of failure to phosphorylate Chmp7 for NE integrity and morphology during interphase and after mitosis?</p><p>– How do Lem2 cluster comprise NE function, morphology an integrity?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and important question and the reviewer is right that we didn’t fully explore this in our original submission.

We have revisited our imaging and have quantified the fluorescence intensities of the non-clustered HP1 signal in Control and RNAi-treated cells, which revealed neither consistent nor significant elevation of this signal in depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Whilst the link between clustered and non-clustered HP1 is certainly interesting, we don’t believe it is central to the message of this manuscript. Additionally, whilst there are a few peripheral HP1 clusters remaining in CHMP7 depleted cells, careful analysis reveals that they juxtapose, but do not colocalise with, LEM2 clusters. We provide an additional panel (Figure 1 Supplement 5E) that demonstrates this juxtaposition, and discuss this in the revised main text on page 3.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>HP1 fluoresence intensity in siRNA transfected cells N = 3, n = 262 (control), 233 (CHMP7 si-1), 254 (CHMP7 si-2), 193 (IST1 siRNA).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59999-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We also wondered if these LEM2 clusters were damaging for cells.

Please clarify how that goes together? What am I missing?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise to the reviewer for our clumsy wording. A caveat of the biochemical assays in the original submission is that they reported the phosphorylation status of all of the CHMP7 in the cell, whereas the imaging demonstrates that only a limited pool of CHMP7 in proximity to the nuclear envelope polymerises. We hope that our biochemical fractionation studies and phospho-specific antibody generation have resolved this paradox by demonstrating that the NE-pool of CHMP7 is dephosphorylated in advance of the cytosolic and ER pool.

The overall conclusions of this paper are important and provide a significant step forward in our understanding how the ESCRT machinery is controlled by the cell cycle machinery to re-establish NE integrity in interphase and after mitosis. Hence this paper will be of interest to a broad readership.</p><p>My field of expertise is the ESCRT machinery.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)): The new study from the Carlton lab focuses on the determinants of nuclear membrane homeostasis in human cell mitosis. Their particular focus is on the conserved and now established interaction between the inner nuclear membrane protein, LEM2, and the ESCRT-II/III protein, CHMP7. These proteins are segregated from each other by the nuclear envelope during interphase, and function together during late mitosis when the nuclear membrane needs to reform or during interphase if the nucleus is damaged. In their new work, these authors provide high-quality imaging data and some biochemistry aimed at understanding how LEM2 and CHMP7 activities are regulated. Their study convincingly establishes that CHMP7s activity pattern depends on phosphoregulation, adding another level of ESCRT regulation during mitosis. Specifically, their data show that CHMP7 is phosphorylated in early mitosis by CDK1, following mitotic patterns. CHMP7 is also phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro, and this appears to increase CHMP7's solubility. Phospho-dead mutant constructs of CHMP7 (Ser to Ala) accumulate in mislocalized puncta or &quot;clusters&quot; upon the ER, where they also inappropriately trap another downstream ESCRT-III protein, IST1, preventing it from reaching the nascent inner nuclear membrane. These clusters are mislocalized because previous research has established that LEM2 and CHMP7 usually cluster within gaps in the nascent nuclear envelope. The aberrant mutant clusters trap other ESCRT-IIIs proteins, like IST1, as well as LEM2-and this prevents LEM2 from reaching the inner nuclear envelope.</p><p>In general, the work is of high quality, especially the imaging experiments. Specific biochemical results, however, are more ambiguous. In many cases, careful rephrasing will suffice to help readers recognize caveats in interpretation but certain claims, which I will expand upon point-by-point, should be softened or will require additional experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for their positive assessment of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments: 1. The results from the monopolar spindle assays confused me, and given the highly artificial setting induced by these drugs are of unclear value to the current report. These data led the authors to the paradoxical claim that CHMP7 is phosphorylated during the critical window when CHMP7 assembly activity is required for envelope sealing. But as the authors note, this is very hard to reconcile with their data showing that phosphorylation enhances solubility and that phospho-dead mutants assemble avidly with LEM2 and downstream ESCRT-IIIs, like IST1. I recommend removing these data, even though the authors also use data from the monopolar spindle assays to support their claim that a &quot;microtubule network is dispensable for ESCRT-III assembly at the reforming nuclear envelope.&quot; This claim already enjoys support from prior studies documenting ESCRT-III's role in repairing the nuclear envelope during interphase when mitotic spindle fibers are absent.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise to the reviewer for our clumsy wording.

The term &quot;polymerization&quot; needs to be qualified in the text, or data revealing the existence of polymers need to be included. The clusters in the ER observed by light microscopy may contain polymerized CHMP7, but I suggest a more open phrasing (e.g. clustering) or, if the authors intend to dissect this further, additional experimental evidence. For example, does CHMP7-dHelix6 polymerizes in vitro? In addition, the authors use SDS-Page coupled to centrifugation to report CHMP7 pelleting as a proxy for polymerization (Figure 2F). Whether full-length CHMP7 alone polymerizes under these in vitro conditions has not been established, the cited research (ref #6) relied on liposomal membranes or the LEM2 winged helix domain to trigger CHMP7 polymerization. This is important because CHMP7 alone may form sticky aggregates, which will also pellet in sedimentation and SDS-Page based assays-especially after a 60 min incubation at 30{degree sign}C. This experiment and the associated figure panel are not critical to the central message of CDK1-mediated phosphoregulation. If the authors want to dissect CHMP7 polymerization further, I suggest to include visualization by AFM or EM and controls based on published conditions (CHMP7 + liposomes or CHMP7 + LEM2-CTD). Such experiments would also enable the authors to visualize whether and how whether CDK1-phosphorylated CHMP7 polymerizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer again for their thoughtful suggestions. We hope that the new data described in response to <italic>eLife</italic> review, Point 5 has addressed this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The persistent LEM2 clusters in the absence of CHMP7 are intriguing, especially given the observations in fission yeasts like pombe and japonicus that suggest Vps4-mediated disassembly is a critical aspect of nuclear homeostasis. Does it seem the simplest explanation is that the loss of CHMP7 precludes the recruitment of downstream ESCRT-III proteins, like CHMP4 and other CHMPs? Without this sequential cascade, VPS4-family ATPases are never recruited?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We visualised VPS4 in CHMP7-depleted cells exhibiting LEM2 clusters and, as the reviewer suggested, demonstrated that it was no longer recruited. Please see also the response to <italic>eLife</italic> review, Point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>4. The idea that phosphorylation regulates the dynamics of mitosis is well established, and when looking at public databases, it's clear that both CHMP7 and LEM2 have many annotated sites of phosphorylation (Serine/Tyrosine/Threonine). A broader discussion (either in the introduction or the discussion) about phosphoregulation would add value. Phosphorylation also regulates IST1 activity and LEM-BAF interactions, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point, this will help accessibility for more generalist readers. We have included more discussion of how phosphorylation can regulate the biology of organelle remodelling complexes during mitosis in the introduction and Discussion sections, with relevance for ESCRT systems highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In the discussion the authors write &quot;Importantly, LEM2 assembly at the reforming nuclear envelope occurred in the absence of CHMP7, suggesting that LEM2 is upstream and does not form as part of the ESCRT-III polymer. However, consistent with recent reports from S. japonicus [16,17], LEM2's failure to be disassembled in the absence of CHMP7 suggests that CHMP7 acts to decluster and proper release of LEM2, allowing it to correctly populate the INM. Our biochemical data indicate that polymeric CHMP7 can capture LEM2, raising the possibility that this INM protein may instead be a 'cargo' that is actively sorted onto the INM through the activity of CHMP7 at sites of annular fusion.&quot; This is a creative but speculative notion that stretches an analogy to other sites of ESCRT activity, and stretches it too far for my taste. What does it mean that LEM2 does not form as part of the ESCRT-III polymer? The constituents and properties of the ESCRT-III polymer in question remain incompletely understood-and the LEM2 winged-helix domain has been reported to co-assemble with CHMP7 around spindle fibers. Why and how should CHMP7 &quot;sort&quot; LEM2 to sites of annular fusion? Based on what data? Several other studies, including data in this manuscript (Figure 1B), show that LEM2 is required to recruit CHMP7 to the nuclear envelope, that LEM2 localization depends on the LEM-BAF interaction and BAFs ability to coat the chromatin disc. Further, when LEM2 is depleted CHMP7 does not cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in that we took a little artistic license in the Discussion section, and we have reined in our speculation here. We have also amended the text to remove reference to LEM2 incorporation into the ESCRT-III polymer, but think it is important to note that LEM2 polymerisation dynamics were unperturbed by CHMP7 depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Previous observations by the authors and others showed that the ESCRT-III-like protein CHMP7 has an important role in this process. It was previously reported that the inner nuclear membrane protein LEM2 is involved in the process of polymerising CHMP7, and that this transient polymerisation is important for the reformation of the nuclear envelope. The current manuscript addresses a crucial question: How can CHMP7 be excluded from the nucleus by a NES during the period of the cell cycle in which the nuclear membrane has disassembled and interspersed with ER membranes? The authors convincingly show that during the period when the nuclear membrane is not present, sorting of the cytoplasmic CHMP7 away from the INM LEM2 is accomplished through a classic cell-cycle regulator, CDK1. When CHMP7 is phosphorylated by CDK1 at S3 and S441, it prevents CHMP7 from inappropriately polymerising and mis-localising LEM2 to ER compartments.</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
