psychosocial environment have a demonstrated impact on health, particularly for people living in disadvantaged urban areas. Here, we investigated the effect of psychosocial experiences on gene expression in peripheral blood immune cells of children with asthma in Metro Detroit. Using RNA-sequencing and a new machine learning approach, we identified transcriptional signatures of 19 variables including psychosocial factors, blood cell composition, and asthma symptoms. Importantly, we found 169 genes associated with asthma or allergic disease that are regulated by psychosocial factors and 344 significant gene-environment interactions for gene expression levels. These results demonstrate that immune gene expression mediates the link between negative psychosocial experiences and asthma risk.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eQTLs</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>GxE</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL114097</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zilioli</surname><given-names>Samuele</given-names></name><name><surname>Slatcher</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Psychosocial environments modulate genetic risk of asthma and other allergic diseases through altered peripheral blood gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psychosocial experiences have long been recognized to affect human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 2009</xref>). Intrapersonal processes (e.g., emotionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pressman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Smith et al., 2004</xref>], interpersonal social relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Repetti et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Robles et al., 2014</xref>]) and broader structural environments (e.g., neighborhood quality and socioeconomic status [SES]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gallo and Matthews, 2003</xref>) are all associated with the morbidity and severity of diseases such as asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harrison, 1998</xref>), cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer and Mark, 1995</xref>), cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Everson-Rose and Lewis, 2005</xref>), as well as mortality rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Holt-Lunstad et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chida and Steptoe, 2008</xref>). Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the respiratory tract that disproportionately affects children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moorman et al., 2012</xref>). It is one of the costliest pediatric health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weiss et al., 2000</xref>) and a leading cause of school absenteeism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akinbami and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics, 2006</xref>). Financially struggling cities, such as Detroit, are at an especially high risk for asthma morbidity and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sullivan et al., 2002</xref>). While environmental and genetic factors lead to the development of asthma and affect the health of children with asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">von Mutius, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">von Mutius, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Umetsu et al., 2002</xref>), psychosocial stress is a critical factor contributing to asthma severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wright et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shankardass et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sandberg et al., 2000</xref>). Understanding the biological pathways underlying these associations is crucial to strengthen the causal claims linking psychosocial experiences and health.</p><p>The growing field of social genomics investigates how various dimensions of a person's social and psychological environment influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slavich and Cole, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Toyokawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galea et al., 2011</xref>). There is ample evidence for links between gene expression in blood and three major categories of psychosocial experiences: SES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2009</xref>), social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robles et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stanton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Powell et al., 2013</xref>), and emotionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farrell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Segman et al., 2010</xref>). Beyond single-gene analyses, previous studies in this area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slavich and Cole, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole, 2009</xref>) identified a pattern of differentially expressed genes referred to as the <italic>conserved transcriptional response to adversity (</italic>CTRA). The CTRA is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in inflammation and decreased expression of genes involved in type I interferon antiviral responses and IgG1 antibody synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fredrickson et al., 2013</xref>). However, these studies investigated a limited set of psychosocial experiences and did not resolve whether these pathways are causally linked to health outcomes or rather a consequence of disease status.</p><p>Several approaches have been developed for investigating the role of gene expression in complex trait variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nica et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marigorta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Võsa et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nica and Dermitzakis, 2008</xref>). Recently, transcriptome-wide association studies [TWAS] and other Mendelian randomization (MR) approaches have been used to integrate genetic effects on gene expression and on complex traits to establish causal links between a gene and a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gusev et al., 2016</xref>). MR approaches have been developed in epidemiology to examine the causal effect of a modifiable exposure on disease without conducting a randomized trial. MR designs use the genotype association with the two variables of interest to control for reverse causation and confounding. Here, we use this type of approach to connect genes with complex traits. Traditionally genes are annotated to association signals in genome-wide association studies [GWAS] based on physical proximity. TWAS test for an association between gene expression and complex traits, where gene expression is predicted based on genotypes in the GWAS study and independent expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data. Notably this goes beyond physical proximity of GWAS signals to genes and establishes a putative mechanism linking genetic variants to complex traits through genetic regulation of gene expression. Very few studies of genetic regulation of gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, eQTL mapping) in humans have included comprehensive information on psychosocial exposures, and no study to date has been able to determine the likelihood of a causal relationship between psychosocial experiences, gene expression, and asthma. This study aims at filling this gap by combining genetic and well-characterized psychosocial data from a cohort of children with asthma living in Metro Detroit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional signatures of psychosocial experiences and asthma symptoms.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Central hypothesis.

This study started during the years leading up to Detroit filing for bankruptcy in 2013 and is still ongoing. Detroit started a marked economic recovery in 2016; yet not all population groups and geographic areas have experienced it simultaneously or to the same extent. To analyze the relationship between psychosocial experiences, asthma, and transcriptional regulation, we investigated genome-wide gene expression (RNA-seq) for 251 youth participating in the ALOFT study. For 119 participants, we also collected 53 psychosocial and biological variables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Measures of psychosocial experiences were grouped into three subcategories, indicating SES, social relationships, and emotionality. Psychosocial experiences were captured through subjective and objective measures (e.g., negative affect assessed from daily diaries and recorded audio, respectively), as well as global and daily measures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Psychosocial factors and asthma alter the transcriptome</title><p>To denoise and impute psychosocial effects on gene expression for the entire cohort of 251 participants, we developed a new machine learning approach based on generalized linear models with elastic net regularization (GLMnet; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Friedman et al., 2010</xref>) and cross-validation. Using this approach, we derived transcriptional signatures that represent the portion of the transcriptome that correlates with each psychosocial factor. Analogous methods have been adopted to define transcriptional signatures of T-cell exhaustion in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alpert et al., 2019</xref>) and survival in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asgharzadeh et al., 2006</xref>), but have not been previously used for psychosocial factors. We identified significant transcriptional signatures for 31 out of 53 variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). We used an independent longitudinal dataset to validate the transcriptional signatures. We considered the changes in the observed variable between two time points (≥1 year) and compared it to the longitudinal changes in the transcriptional signature. Note that the transcriptional signature is imputed for the second time point from gene expression samples that are not included in the training set. We found significant correlations in the observed and imputed changes for the majority of variables (Spearman's correlation p-value&lt;0.05; e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).</p><p>Transcriptional signatures of the SES measures showed a strong overlap with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), suggesting that they may have very similar molecular effects or measure the same factors. However, we also saw correlations across all three variable categories. For example, subjective SES was significantly correlated with objective maternal responsiveness, family conflict, and self-reported self-disclosure, which is the extent to which the youths talk about their thoughts and feelings (r = −0.3, p=1.1 * 10<sup>−6</sup>, r = 0.29, p=4.26 * 10<sup>−6</sup>, r = 0.66, p=3 * 10<sup>−32</sup>, respectively). Overall, correlations between transcriptional signatures reflect correlations between measured variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), yet they are stronger between the transcriptional signatures, highlighting the denoising effect. Measured psychosocial factors were also associated with interindividual variation in gene expression for several genes. For example, perceived responsiveness and self-disclosure were associated with changes in gene expression for 143 and 3279 genes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e, f</xref>).

In particular, we found significant positive correlations between the transcriptional signatures of lung function (percent-predicted FEV1) and psychosocial measures of self-disclosure (r = 0.42, p=4.9 * 10<sup>−12</sup>) and subjective SES (r = 0.36, p=3.3 * 10<sup>−9</sup>).

We also found that the transcriptional signature of self-disclosure was also significantly associated with other measures of asthma, such as nightly asthma symptoms (r = 0.27, p=1.2 * 10<sup>−5</sup>) and asthma severity (r = −0.32, p=2.9 * 10<sup>−7</sup>), echoing the large body of work on the importance of self-disclosure for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pennebaker, 1995</xref>).

TWAS uses eQTLs as instrumental variables (IVs) to causally link gene expression to phenotypes. To examine local genetic effects on leukocyte gene expression, we performed cis-eQTL mapping and identified 8610 genes with at least one eQTL (eGenes, 10% false discovery rate [FDR], <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). These eGenes were enriched in Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx) whole blood eGenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguet et al., 2020</xref>) (Fisher’s test OR = 3.2, p-value&lt;2.2 * 10<sup>−16</sup>), but we also identified additional 1801 eGenes that were not detected by GTEx in whole blood.</p><p>We used the method for probabilistic TWAS analysis (PTWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), which improves upon previous TWAS methods by ensuring only strong IVs are used, and is designed to allow for validating the causality assumption (see Materials and methods). We identified 2806 eGenes in the GTEx dataset that were causally associated with asthma and allergic diseases (hay fever, eczema, and allergic rhinitis) (5% FDR). Of these, 853 were eGenes in our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). Here, we interrogated whether these causal genetic effects can be modulated by psychosocial factors through gene-environment interactions. To examine the genotype-by-environment effects of psychosocial experiences and blood composition on gene expression, we used the imputed transcriptional signatures for the entire cohort of 251 individuals. In addition to imputing missing data, we argue that these transcriptional signatures may better capture the environmental effects on the state of the cells at the molecular level (i.e., after denoising), compared to the observed variables. This is because observed variables have high levels of noise, and the measured values may not reflect the true biological effect. Therefore, we used the predicted values for all participants, including those for whom the variables were directly measured (denoising). This is similar to the context eQTL approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhernakova et al., 2017</xref>) that uses other genes as a proxy variable for the environment, but here the ‘context’ is more easily interpretable because it is defined by a transcriptional signature associated with a specific psychosocial factor. Similarly, cell-type composition imputed from gene expression was used to map cell-type interaction QTLs for 43 cell-type-tissue combinations in the GTEx v8 dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For each of the eGenes identified in our dataset, we tested the lead eQTL for an interaction effect (see Materials and methods) with any of the transcriptional signatures.

We investigated whether genes associated with risk for asthma were modulated through psychosocial experiences (E) and/or GxE effects. Among the genes causally linked to asthma or allergic disease risk by PTWAS, expression of 169 genes was modulated by psychosocial environments, including self-disclosure (125 genes), subjective SES (105 genes), family conflict (30 genes), percent unoccupied houses in the neighborhood (27 genes), maternal responsiveness (17 genes), objective negative affect (e.g., feeling sad or angry, 11 genes), child-reported conflict with parent (9 genes) and percent ≥fair houses in the neighborhood (2 genes) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata5">Figure 3—source data 5</xref>).

We developed a new approach to denoise and impute the transcriptional signatures of asthma symptoms and psychosocial experiences in peripheral blood. Longitudinal data collected on the same individuals validated the transcriptional signatures imputed on an unobserved later time point, mirroring the changes on phenotype. This demonstrates that the molecular signature of psychosocial experiences on immune cells can track changes over time and can be used to analyze cohorts where these variables are not available.</p><p>We showed overlap between transcriptional signatures of asthma symptoms and both SES and social relationships, thereby demonstrating that molecular blood gene expression pathways exist through which psychosocial experiences can affect asthma. While some of the variables used to describe pulmonary function may not directly reflect a conventional clinical endpoint, the fact that they were associated with significant transcriptional signatures indicates that they may still have pathophysiological relevance for individuals with asthma. For example, we found a significant transcriptional signature for FEV1, which is endorsed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program as a means for grading asthma severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birnkrant, 1997</xref>). Interestingly, we detected a higher number of significant correlations across imputed variables compared to the measured variables. This observation supports the effectiveness of the denoising procedure that we used to define transcriptional signatures.</p><p>Correlations between asthma phenotypes and psychosocial variables may be partially due to changes in blood compositions. Correlations between asthma severity and blood composition are supported by previous findings from the U-BIOPRED cohort where the number of genes differentially expressed between individuals with severe asthma and healthy controls was reduced by 90% after accounting for blood cell composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bigler et al., 2017</xref>). This is not surprising as several partially overlapping endotypes of asthma have been described to date, distinguished by pro-inflammatory contributions from different immune cell types. The most common asthma subtype is characterized by the involvement of T helper type 2 cells (Th2) sensitized primarily to allergens and subsequent eosinophilic airway inflammation triggered by the type two cytokines (particularly Il-5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woodruff et al., 2009</xref>). However, in non-allergic individuals, eosinophilic inflammation may be triggered by other immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brusselle et al., 2013</xref>). Elevated levels of neutrophils have been associated with more severe asthma and suggested as an alternative mechanism to eosinophilic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ray and Kolls, 2017</xref>). Further work to dissect the contributions of each cell type can be accomplished in future studies with single-cell transcriptomics.</p><p>Genes sets associated with psychosocial variables were enriched for different Gene Ontology functions and pathways. For example, self-disclosure is associated with genes distinctly enriched for neutrophil-mediated immunity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), while parent-reported conflict with child is associated with expression of genes enriched for erythrocyte differentiation. This result suggests that response to negative psychosocial experiences involves processes outside of the scope of the CTRA, which was designed to capture inflammation, antibody production, and type I interferon response. Psychosocial experiences change over time because of the children’s development as a result of broader changes in the urban environments and as a consequence of shifts in family dynamics. These changes of the psychosocial experiences are reflected longitudinally in the gene expression of immune cells and may modify the asthma symptoms and overall health. As we gain additional knowledge on the mechanisms connecting psychosocial experiences to disease, these results can be useful to support the need for social interventions that may ultimately lead to improved overall health. For example, family counseling may improve the psychosocial environment of children with asthma, ameliorating their symptoms, and reducing the impact of systemic health disparities. These social interventions may be implemented independently or together with drug treatments, and their impact could be further monitored through gene expression with larger longitudinal samples in future studies.</p><p>Pioneering work by our group and others has shown that environmental effects on gene expression and their interactions with genetic factors can play a very important role in regulating genes that are associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moyerbrailean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richards et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Findley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Knowles et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nédélec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhernakova et al., 2017</xref>). This is also applicable to asthma genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rava et al., 2015</xref>) and exposure to rhinovirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Çalışkan et al., 2015</xref>) and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thompson et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our study demonstrates that many psychosocial experiences leave an impact on gene expression, including genes that are known to be associated with asthma. When considering genetic effects on gene expression, 21% of the 8610 eQTL we discovered were not found in GTEx whole blood samples. These newly identified genetic effects may be due to limited power when performing an overlap between results from different eQTL studies. An alternative explanation is that we captured context-specific genetic effects that are due to differences between our cohort and GTEx samples in cell-type composition, ancestry, age, psychosocial environment, and/or the asthma status. Indeed, our GxE analysis identifies 344 instances of eGenes with context-specific genetic regulation of gene expression, including 124 instances of GxE with psychosocial experiences.</p><p>One outstanding challenge in human complex trait genetics focuses on the portability of polygenic risk scores across population groups or environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mostafavi et al., 2020</xref>). The 124 instances of GxE with psychosocial experiences are particularly relevant when evaluating a polygenic risk score for asthma phenotypes. For example, the individual contribution of a gene can be modified by SES in one direction and in a different direction for a different gene.</p><p>Here, we show that these altered gene expression immune profiles may in turn exacerbate asthma symptoms in children living in inner cities, who are exposed to riskier psychosocial environments. Using human genetics tools, we established that psychosocial factors can modulate the causal genetic effects between gene expression and asthma. Importantly, our results demonstrate that psychosocial factors, such as self-disclosure and SES, modulate genetic risk of asthma and other allergic diseases through altered peripheral blood gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study participants</title><p>Participants were included from an ongoing longitudinal study, ALOFT ( recruited from November 2010 to July 2018, Wayne State University Institutional Review Board approval #0412110B3F). The ALOFT study investigates the links between family dynamics, biological changes, and asthma morbidity among youth from the Detroit metropolitan area. Participants were recruited from local area hospitals and schools (for recruitment details, see Supplemental text). To be included in the study, youth were required to be between 10 and 15 years of age at the time of recruitment and diagnosed with at least mild to persistent asthma by a physician (with diagnosis confirmed from medical records). Youth were screened for medical conditions and medications that might affect asthma and associated biological markers. Only one participant reported current oral corticosteroid use. The full sample included 297 youth and their primary caregivers (typically mothers, referred to as ‘parent’ below). However, only youth with valid gene expression data were included in this investigation. Thus, the sample comprised 251 youth (148 boys and 103 girls), whose average age was 12.89 years old (<italic>sd</italic> = 1.77 years), and at least one parent. Psychosocial and biological variables, including asthma measures, were available for a subset of 119 participants.

Youth also reported on their parents smoking inside the household. However, due to low prevalence as well as uncertainty on whether the parents were present in the household during the 4 days of data collection, we decided to not use this information in our analyses. They also completed a spirometry test using the nSpire Health KoKo PFT to obtain the following pulmonary measures: FEV1 percent predicted, FVC percent predicted, FEV1/FVC percent predicted. Also at this visit, the youth and parent were given detailed instructions regarding a 4-day daily assessment period. The laboratory visit lasted approximately 2 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>In-home assessments</title><p>For 4 days following the laboratory visit (two weekdays and two weekend days), youth and their parent completed daily assessments. Both youth and their parent completed daily diaries each evening about their experiences throughout their day, and sleep diaries each morning about the quality of their sleep. Daily diaries contained items assessing their positive (i.e., happy, interested, excited, and proud) and negative (i.e., sad, angry, upset, worried, distressed) affect, and how much affection and conflict they witnessed between their parents. Youth were also asked to think about the most important and meaningful conversation they had with someone that day and the extent to which they talked about their thoughts and feelings during that conversation (to measure self-disclosure), and how understanding, validating, and caring their conversation partner was (to measure perceived responsiveness). The sleep diaries contained the Pittsburgh Sleep Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monk et al., 1994</xref>), which assesses sleep latency (how long to fall asleep), sleep efficiency (how much time in bed spent sleeping), the number of awakenings throughout the night, the total duration of sleep in hours, and the quality of the sleep. Through the daily and sleep diaries, the participants provided information on the following measures of asthma: severity and frequency of daily and nightly asthma symptoms (wheezing, shortness of breath, coughing, chest tightness, other) and nightly inhaler use. Description of daily diary and sleep diary items used in this investigation is included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. When youth completed the daily and sleep diaries (i.e., at awakening and before bed), they used a peak flow meter twice to measure peak flow, with the best score between the two assessments used as our measure of morning and evening peak flow. Only daily and sleep diary reports from youth are used in this investigation. Additionally, youth provided four samples of saliva daily for 4 days at wakeup, 30 min after wakeup, before dinner, and immediately before bed using passive drool methods. Sample time was recorded by participant report, time stamps, and MEMS 6 TrackCap monitors (Aardex Ltd., Switzerland). Samples were initially stored in participants’ refrigerators, but upon return to the lab, saliva samples were stored in the laboratory refrigerator at −20°C until assayed. To reduce positive skewness, we natural log transformed the cortisol values (raw cortisol +1). Hierarchical linear models were run in HLM to extract the average diurnal cortisol intercept, slope, and cortisol awakening response (CAR) for each participant. Finally, participants wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) in their front pocket or in a belt clip provided from the time they woke up until bedtime. The EAR captured 50 s of sound every 9 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mehl et al., 2001</xref>). EAR data were coded by trained coders using the Everyday Child Home Observation (ECHO) coding system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tobin et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, for this investigation, we use codes of wheezing, positive affect (i.e., happy, interested, excited), negative affect (i.e., sadness, anger, upset, worry, distress), maternal responsiveness (i.e., how much the mother expresses pride, support, and warmth towards the youth), and family conflict (i.e., whether an argument, conflict, fight, or yelling was overheard). Scores for each EAR-observed behavior reflect a mean of the total recordings in which the behavior was observed during waking hours. After completion of the in-home assessment period, the participants returned study materials and the EAR.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were extracted from this sample, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weckle et al., 2015</xref>).

We used bcftools gtcheck function to compare genotype calls across all biallelic SNPs in all DNA and RNA samples. RNA samples that failed to cluster with their respective DNA sample were repeated (library preparation and sequencing). If the discrepancy was not resolved, these samples were excluded from the analysis. A total of 251 samples passed this QC filter. Ultimately, the pairwise discordance rate between genotype calls from RNA and their respective DNA samples from the same individual ranged between 0.03 and 0.12. In contrast, the pairwise discordance rate between all the other unrelated samples ranged from 0.20 to 0.33.

If the objective was to estimate the measurement including its biases and errors, the ‘technical’ variance for the observed variable would be smaller if we were to use the observed values.

The model that yielded the largest number of eGenes included 18 gene expression PCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Interaction eQTL mapping</title><p>To identify interaction eQTLs, we considered the lead eQTL for each of the eGenes identified at 10% FDR by FastQTL (without correcting for gene expression principal components). This is similar to what was done by GTEx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alasoo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2017</xref>), and equivalent to a very conservative pruning of all SNPs in the entire cis-association region. We did not correct for gene expression principal components because some of them are correlated with cell composition and the environmental variables, thus complicating the interpretation of the linear model. To reduce impact of potential outliers, we quantile-normalized each transcriptional signature prior to GxE testing. We fit a linear model that includes both the genotype dosage and the marginal environmental effect as well as their interaction: Expression ~dosage + transcriptional signature +dosage*transcriptional signature. To fit this model, we used the lm function in R-3.5.2. We generated an empirical null distribution of 100 million permuted p-values to correct the interaction p-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The empirical null distribution was obtained through multiple runs of the model for each tested transcriptional signature-gene pair while permuting the genotype dosages. Storey's q-value method to control for FDR was applied on the permutation-corrected p-values for all tests within each transcriptional signature separately.</p><p>To ensure the signal detected was not solely due to cell composition differences, we repeated the GxE eQTL mapping procedure as above, while correcting for four signatures of cell composition using the following model: Expression ~ eosinophils + leukocytes+monocytes + neutrophils+dosage + transcriptional signature +dosage*transcriptional signature. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata6">Figure 3—source data 6</xref> contains full results of this analysis.</p><p>Interaction eQTL mapping with measured variables was performed the same way as with transcriptional signatures, except sample size was limited by the available data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Replication analysis of GxE</title><p>We calculated the enrichment of GxE genes from the measured variables (p-value&lt;0.01) in the set of GxE genes from the transcriptional signatures (p-value&lt;0.01). To this end, we performed Fisher's exact tests on 2 × 2 contingency tables indicating whether a gene had a GxE eQTL with the measured variable (yes/no) and with the corresponding transcriptional signature (yes/no). Additionally, we calculated the correlation of the standardized interaction effect size (z-score) for each gene obtained when considering measured variables and corresponding transcriptional signatures.</p><p>To validate our GxE results, we considered the following GxE studies for which full interaction testing results are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barreiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Çalışkan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nédélec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moyerbrailean et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim-Hellmuth et al., 2020</xref>). We show numbers of our GxE eGenes (FDR &lt; 10%) that replicated in other studies (p-value&lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>TWAS analyses</title><p>To directly investigate whether discovered effects on gene expression and GxE interactions may contribute to asthma, allergic disease risk, and/or behavioral phenotypes, we used PTWAS results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) (5% FDR) as an independent source of evidence of causality between gene expression levels and asthma/allergic disease risk. PTWAS utilizes probabilistic eQTL annotations derived from multivariant Bayesian fine-mapping analysis conferring higher power to detect TWAS associations than existing methods. The evidence for causality from PTWAS is strong for the following reasons: (1) we use only strong IVs by combining the strength of multiple independent strong eQTLs for each gene and combining information across all tissues; (2) within the PTWAS framework, we can then validate the causality assumption for each gene-trait-tissue combination. We found that the exclusion restriction criterion was violated (heterogeneity of independent estimates across multiple strong eQTLs, I<sup>2</sup> statistic &gt;0.5) in only 0.36% of the gene-trait pairs for which we computed this statistic, none of which overlap our reported results. Using eQTL data across 49 tissues from GTEx v8, we used PTWAS to analyze GWAS summary statistics from several large-scale projects. Here, we specifically focused on the following asthma studies: GABRIEL-Asthma, TAGC-Asthma-EUR, UKB-20002–1111-self-reported-asthma, UKB-6152–8-diagnosed-by-doctor-Asthma, and allergic disease studies: EAGLE-Eczema, UKB-20002–1452-self-reported-eczema-or-dermatitis, UKB-6152–9-diagnosed-by-doctor-Hayfever-allergic-rhinitis-or-eczema. Additionally we considered other phenotypes that may be relevant for our cohort: chronotype (Jones-et-al-2016-Chronotype, UKB-1180-Morning-or-evening-person-chronotype), sleep duration (Jones-et-al-2016-SleepDuration, UKB-1160-Sleep-duration), and depressive symptoms (SSGAC-Depressive-Symptoms). To identify eGenes in children with asthma that are causally associated with asthma, we considered all 4943 eGenes that were used for the interaction eQTL analysis with a significant (10% FDR) marginal effect of the psychosocial experiences from the linear model that includes both the genotype dosage and the marginal environmental effect as well as their interaction: Expression ~ dosage + transcriptional signature +dosage*transcriptional signature.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Luis Barreiro and Noah Snyder-Mackler for comments on an earlier version of this manuscript, and members of the Luca, Pique-Regi, Zilioli, and Slatcher labs for helpful discussions.

To accurately estimate gene expression differences between meaningful groups, one must account for additional sources of gene expression variation that are not of interest. To investigate the major sources of variation in the RNA-seq dataset, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on normalized RNA-seq data and investigated (1) the correlation between first 15 PCs and each of the covariates (data not shown), and (2) proportion of variance explained by each covariate overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7a</xref>), and per each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7b</xref>). The following covariates were significantly correlated with at least one PC: library preparation batch (confounded with library sequencing batch), RNA quality score (RIN), laboratory where the RNA sample was extracted, age, sex, height, weight, and ancestry (measured as first three principal components on the genotype matrix). These variables were also correlated with each other; therefore, we used PCA to calculate the PCs of all these covariates that explained &gt;99.5% variance and incorporated them in the gene expression analyses as described in the Materials and methods.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>Blood composition has a profound effect on gene expression</title><p>Blood composition is expected to have a strong effect on overall blood gene expression as blood is a heterogeneous tissue and different cell types may contribute different transcripts to the overall gene expression. The results of differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2 using LRT are displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i, j</xref>. As expected, the number of differentially expressed genes is larger for cell types that constitute a bigger fraction of the cell pool. Accordingly, we did not find genes differentially expressed for basophils, a cell type that constitutes less than 1% of total leukocytes. Based on these results, cell composition was accounted for in differential gene expression analyses of psychosocial variables and other analyses that distinguished between the two types of effects (mediation analysis).</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>Overlap of transcriptional signatures</title><p>We investigated whether transcriptional signatures for different variables were correlated with each other, which would suggest shared transcriptional pathways for these phenotypes and environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transcriptional signatures of the socioeconomic measures showed strong overlap: specifically, houses rated ≥fair, unoccupied houses, and subjective SES were intercorrelated. There was also some overlap in the social relationships category, with transcriptional signatures of daily youth-reported self-disclosure and objective maternal responsiveness significantly correlated. However, we also saw correlations crossing all three variable categories. For example, subjective SES was significantly correlated with objective maternal responsiveness, family conflict, and self-disclosure; objective negative affect was correlated with self-disclosure, family conflict, objective maternal responsiveness, and houses rated ≥fair.</p><p>We were able to identify transcriptional signatures that explained at least 1% of variance for four of the five blood composition variables and two of the seven glucocorticoid variables. Models predicting blood composition performed best with 47–150 genes, and models predicting glucocorticoid variables contained 17–100 genes. Notably, the transcriptional signatures explained a far greater percent of variation in blood composition than other categories of variables. Transcriptional signatures within each category were highly correlated, showing greater overlap within all glucocorticoid response variables and all blood composition variables (except for eosinophils, which were uncorrelated with all other blood composition signatures) than seen in asthma severity or social relationship categories. When we correlated glucocorticoid and blood composition transcriptional signatures with transcriptional signatures for psychosocial experiences and asthma severity, we observed some overlap for glucocorticoid response: specifically, stimulated levels of IL-5 were associated with percent-predicted FEV1 (r = −0.51, p&lt;0.001), unoccupied houses (r = −0.27, p=&lt;0.001), and youth-reported parent-child conflict (r = 0.18, p=0.003). There was much more overlap in blood composition transcriptional signatures with asthma severity and psychosocial experience signatures. For example, transcriptional signature of monocytes was correlated with a large number of transcriptional signatures of both asthma and psychosocial experiences, including nightly asthma symptoms (r = 0.21, p&lt;0.001), and FEV (r = 0.45, p&lt;0.001), self-disclosure (r = 0.49, p&lt;0.001), unoccupied houses (r = 0.39, p=&lt;0.001), subjective SES (r = 0.43, p&lt;0.001), and objective negative affect (r = 0.35, p&lt;0.001). Lymphocytes showed a very similar pattern of correlations to neutrophils, but in the opposite direction.</p></sec><sec id="s13" sec-type="appendix"><title>Targeted vs. unbiased approach to identifying effects of psychosocial experiences on gene expression</title><p>Previous research analyzing blood gene expression developed the CTRA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fredrickson et al., 2013</xref>), which proposes expression of 53 immune genes as a composite indicator of immune system response to adverse social environments (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cole, 2014</xref>). We compared the performance of our unbiased prediction model with a model limited to the 53 CTRA genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>). The CTRA-based model performs better at predicting the fraction of two of the five blood cell types. This may reflect differential expression of CTRA genes in some cell types. CTRA-based and unbiased models perform similarly on psychosocial and neighborhood measures, with 9/16 traits (56%) predicted more accurately by the unbiased model. CTRA-based model performs poorly at predicting asthma and glucocorticoid phenotypes, and is outperformed by the unbiased model in 10/14 traits (71%), which is expected because it was not originally developed to capture these phenotypes. In summary, limiting the scope of the prediction model to preselected immune genes does not greatly diminish performance in predicting blood and psychosocial phenotypes, but the CTRA-based model does not appropriately reflect transcriptomic signatures of asthma and glucocorticoid phenotypes. This result suggests that genes outside the CTRA subset are important to many asthma and some psychosocial phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s14" sec-type="appendix"><title>Replication of GxE effects</title><p>To validate the observed GxE effects on gene expression, we explored the overlap between the GxE genes and previously published datasets that measured interactions with different environments.

RNA-seq in PBMCs is performed to assess associations between transcription, questionnaire response data, PBMC cytokine production, and pulmonary function tests. Additionally, the investigators utilized genetic data to assess gene by environment interactions. This work would be of interest to a wide viewership. However, significant issues with underlying methodology detract from interpretation of the data and make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions. Given these underlying concerns, this paper's conclusions are not supported by the data presented and significant changes in methodology are necessary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The greatest concern with this manuscript is that instead of using observed variables the use generalized linear models with elastic net regularization was employed to develop surrogate markers for observed variables within transcriptional data. This in itself is not inherently problematic if the authors were able to identify transcriptional signatures that explained a significant amount of variance in the observed variable. Unfortunately, the data suggests that transcriptional signatures only predict differences in peripheral leukocyte population. The % variance explained for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils was &gt;30% (not suggested as a cutoff). Notably, these three variables had significant and strong correlations at follow-up time points. This suggests that the authors indeed did identify transcriptional signatures that might reasonably serve as surrogates to these observed variables. However, the main focus of this manuscript is the psychosocial environmental exposure. The % variance explained for each these transcriptional signatures is &lt; 5%. Further, these transcriptional signatures showed weak rho values when assessed at follow-up. These are not reasonable surrogates for observed values as these signatures could not within a reasonable margin of error predict many of these psychosocial measures. Due to this issue the interpretation of figures 2 and 3 becomes obscured. It remains usure what it means to have self-disclosure signature correlated with a FEV1 percent predicted signature when these signatures are not predictive of observed data. Do the observed values correlate? If so this might lend credence to authors proposed transcriptional signatures. Further the same issue plagues to the findings in figure 3 where these transcriptional signatures are used for the regression to test if known eQTLs have interaction with psychosocial measures. Since Figures 2 and 3 represent the major findings of the paper. Unfortunately, definitive conclusion cannot be drawn until the authors rectify this issue.</p><p>2. With regard to the mediation analysis presented in Figure 2, two issues arise. First, the authors present the mediation as if the three leukocyte populations were assessed simultaneously as mediators which does not appear to be the case from the description in the methods. Second, a sensitivity analysis should be performed with the mediation to assess if there is an observed confounder.</p><p>3. There is concern if the sequencing genomes at 0.1x coverage is sufficient. This leaves a significant amount data that is imputed. How many of the significant findings were derived from imputed values? Does the pair-wise error rate reported for genotype call between 0.03 and 0.12 refer to percent of base pairs where there is a discrepancy? Units are important, is this 3-12% or 0.03-0.12%.</p><p>4. It is unclear whether the interpretation of the eQTLs associated with asthma/atopy risk in population where 100% subjects have asthma. In these populations changes in gene expression can't correspond to risk because no individual is at risk; they already have the disease.</p><p>5. One lingering question is the clinical implication(s) of this extremely elegant work. In the big picture, how could we employ these results to tailor treatments for kids with asthma?</p><p>6. The effect of sex differences. While the authors recruited a similar number of male and females, it is not indicated their proportion in the 119. Additionally, asthma severity in females is exacerbated due to menstruation (Also, asthma is worsened during hormonal changes in females (e.g., menstruation, see Zein, J.G., Erzurum, S.C. Asthma is Different in Women. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 15, 28 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-015-0528-y). According to the provided data, the authors do not correct for this effect and based on the current text, it is not address whether it is was taken into account. Additionally, what is the justification for dropping all the gene chromosomes? Would the results change if they were not removed?</p><p>7. One of the main difficulties while reading the text for me was that some of the topics are not clearly introduced and explained in the main text, while they were super easy to follow the same concepts and ideas in the supplementary information and in the appendix. Could the author modify the text to make it a little bit clearer, please?</p><p>8. The authors indicate that SES transcriptional signature &quot;strong overlap with each other&quot;. Regarding this sentence: (a) SES is a very complex item to define and measure. Could the author specify how did they calculate it, e.g., income, education, a conglomerated index? (b) Is it a correlation between which variables, e.g., normalized RNA-seq counts, outputs from the model? Or you are talking about common present/absent transcripts? (c) Based on the heatmap, there are a total of 4 SES-houses unoccupied, subjective SES, parental income and houses rated &gt;=fair, and only houses unoccupied and houses rated &gt;= fair have a strong negative correlation, which one would have expected. Also, only parental income and houses rated &gt;=fair are in the same cluster. (d) &quot;For example, subjective SES was significantly correlated with objective parental responsiveness, family conflict, and self-reported self-disclosure, which is the extent to which the youths talk about their thoughts and feelings (r=-0.26, p=0.004, r=0.25, p=0.006, r=0.53, p=6.8*10-10, respectively)&quot;. Are those correlations between the transcriptional signatures associated with each variable? Or between the variables themselves.

RNA-seq in PBMCs is performed to assess associations between transcription, questionnaire response data, PBMC cytokine production, and pulmonary function tests. Additionally, the investigators utilized genetic data to assess gene by environment interactions. This work would be of interest to a wide viewership. However, significant issues with underlying methodology detract from interpretation of the data and make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions. Given these underlying concerns, this paper's conclusions are not supported by the data presented and significant changes in methodology are necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful and excellent comments. We have carefully considered them and addressed all the major points. To address the comments, we have collected additional data on 31 variables for samples for which we did not have this information curated in our earlier submission (increasing the sample size on average by 80%). We also re-ran the eQTL mapping analysis because we realized that we had mis-annotated the regulatory region for some genes; yet this did not substantially change the results. We also removed one transcriptional signature (parental income), because upon further inspection the variable needed to be recoded and the transcriptional signature was not significantly predictive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The greatest concern with this manuscript is that instead of using observed variables the use generalized linear models with elastic net regularization was employed to develop surrogate markers for observed variables within transcriptional data. This in itself is not inherently problematic if the authors were able to identify transcriptional signatures that explained a significant amount of variance in the observed variable. Unfortunately, the data suggests that transcriptional signatures only predict differences in peripheral leukocyte population. The % variance explained for neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils was &gt;30% (not suggested as a cutoff). Notably, these three variables had significant and strong correlations at follow-up time points. This suggests that the authors indeed did identify transcriptional signatures that might reasonably serve as surrogates to these observed variables. However, the main focus of this manuscript is the psychosocial environmental exposure. The % variance explained for each these transcriptional signatures is &lt; 5%. Further, these transcriptional signatures showed weak rho values when assessed at follow-up. These are not reasonable surrogates for observed values as these signatures could not within a reasonable margin of error predict many of these psychosocial measures. Due to this issue the interpretation of figures 2 and 3 becomes obscured. It remains usure what it means to have self-disclosure signature correlated with a FEV1 percent predicted signature when these signatures are not predictive of observed data. Do the observed values correlate? If so this might lend credence to authors proposed transcriptional signatures. Further the same issue plagues to the findings in figure 3 where these transcriptional signatures are used for the regression to test if known eQTLs have interaction with psychosocial measures. Since Figures 2 and 3 represent the major findings of the paper. Unfortunately, definitive conclusion cannot be drawn until the authors rectify this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer's concern and thank them for the suggestions. Our objective is not simply to predict the unobserved values, but we also assume that the observed variable has high levels of noise and the measured value does not reflect the true biological effect. Therefore, we use the predicted values for all participants, including those for whom the variable was directly measured (denoising). The best fit for the model is used to predict, for both observed and unobserved samples, the biological impact on gene expression of the relevant variable. Please note that Supplementary File 1c contains cross-validated percent variance explained – the most stringent metric for evaluating model performance. Correlations between all variables and their transcriptional signatures were significant (pvalue&lt;0.05), but we decided to use a cutoff of 1% cross-validated variance explained to only use the strongest transcriptional signatures. When we focus on these variables, the correlations between measured variables and their transcriptional signatures are significantly positive and range from 0.250.98 (mean=0.74).</p><p>We now also include correlations between measured and imputed values on a bigger subset of individuals (additional individuals not used in training the transcriptional signatures) in Supplementary File 1c. All correlations are significant (p&lt;0.05) and range from 0.14-0.90 (mean=0.48).</p><p>The major limitation in predicting changes at follow up has been that for some variables the actual measured value did not change at all or very minimally in this short time frame.</p><p>Irrespective of being a cell-type composition variable, or a different type of variable if there was a large change and the signature was predictive, we were able to predict the change from the gene expression data.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s concern that correlations between transcriptional signatures may not reflect correlations between observed values, we have now added a Figure 1—figure supplement 2. This figure compares the correlation between the observed measurements and the correlation between the imputed/denoised variables. Some of the values for the pairwise correlations between transcriptional signatures slightly changed because we have now used the values imputed for the entire sample. Strong pairwise correlations in the measured variables are preserved in the imputed variables and detected by both approaches (Correlation of pair-wise correlation coefficients is 0.9, p-value = 6.069e-11). Additionally, pairwise correlations that are detected as significant in both the measured and the denoised/imputed variables are all in the same direction. Across all pairwise correlation coefficients, the correlation of those obtained between the measured variables or the imputed variables is 0.58, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16. In our opinion, the fact that we detect a higher number of significant correlations in the imputed variables is due to the denoising effect.</p><p>We have added the following text to the manuscript:</p><p>Results:</p><p>&quot;Overall, correlations between transcriptional signatures reflect correlations between measured variables (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), yet they are stronger between the transcriptional signatures, highlighting the denoising effect&quot;</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Interestingly, we detected a higher number of significant correlations across imputed variables compared to the measured variables. This observation supports the effectiveness of the denoising procedure that we used to define transcriptional signatures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. With regard to the mediation analysis presented in Figure 2, two issues arise. First, the authors present the mediation as if the three leukocyte populations were assessed simultaneously as mediators which does not appear to be the case from the description in the methods. Second, a sensitivity analysis should be performed with the mediation to assess if there is an observed confounder.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that more complex scenarios may explain the observed correlations between the transcriptional signatures. Acknowledging these effects and given that the major focus of the manuscript is on the GxE effect in gene expression and asthma, we have decided to remove this section of the results as it would require additional analyses beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is concern if the sequencing genomes at 0.1x coverage is sufficient. This leaves a significant amount data that is imputed. How many of the significant findings were derived from imputed values? Does the pair-wise error rate reported for genotype call between 0.03 and 0.12 refer to percent of base pairs where there is a discrepancy? Units are important, is this 3-12% or 0.03-0.12%.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We used an external provider (Gencove, New York, NY) with a well-established genotyping-from-sequencing pipeline (PMID: 33743587, PMID: 33536225) to obtain genotype calls from high purity DNA samples for all participants. The actual coverage used was 0.4x, we have updated the methods to report this value. The genotype accuracy at this sequencing depth is 98.22% positive agreement and 99.82% negative agreement compared to genotyping arrays. In our study, we used the pairwise discordance between DNA and RNA-derived genotypes to identify sample swaps. The 3-12% DNA/RNA discordance was assessed only on the biallelic SNPs; yet only a subset of these SNPs is used for eQTL mapping (MAF&gt;0.1 and within 1Mb of the TSS). Additionally, the reported figure represents an overestimate of the true error rate, as heterozygous genetic variants are inherently more prone to call errors and issues such as allele-specific expression may obscure genotype calls derived from RNA-seq data (known RNA editing sites were not excluded). Furthermore, we do not use discrete genotypes for eQTL mapping, and we use allelic dosage instead because they are less sensitive to genotype calling errors.</p><p>The following changes have been made in the methods section:</p><p>&quot;Genotype data. All individuals in this study were genotyped from low-coverage (~0.4X) whole-genome sequencing and imputed to 37.5 M variants using the 1000 Genomes database by Gencove (New York, NY). […] This rate is not a direct measure of genotype call accuracy, but it is useful to identify possible sample swaps and mismatches.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is unclear whether the interpretation of the eQTLs associated with asthma/atopy risk in population where 100% subjects have asthma. In these populations changes in gene expression can't correspond to risk because no individual is at risk; they already have the disease.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our cohort of case-only asthmatic participants would not allow us to determine which genes may predispose to higher asthma risk. That is why we used an external dataset from a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (Zhang, 2019), which assessed disease-gene expression associations based on eQTL data from GTEx and multiple large GWAS for asthma risk in the typical case control study design. We hypothesized that the same genes and pathways that contribute to asthma risk are also involved in asthma symptom severity through gene regulatory variation in immune cells. We now clarify these concepts as reported below:</p><p>Results</p><p>&quot;We hypothesized that genes and pathways that contribute to asthma risk are also involved in asthma symptom severity through gene regulatory variation in immune cells.

One lingering question is the clinical implication(s) of this extremely elegant work. In the big picture, how could we employ these results to tailor treatments for kids with asthma?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is indeed an extremely relevant question. Our work is at the intersection between clinical, molecular, and social studies. While genetic risk for extreme asthma phenotypes cannot be modified, our work shows that the social environment can modulate these important genetic effects on the regulation of genes relevant for asthma and immunity. We envision that this and other studies may open the road to social interventions aimed at improving the psychosocial environment of asthmatic children in order to ameliorate their symptoms and ultimately lead to better clinical outcomes. These social interventions may be implemented independently or together with drug treatments.</p><p>The following changes were made in the revised discussion:</p><p>&quot;As we gain additional knowledge on the mechanisms connecting psychosocial experiences to disease, these results can be useful to support the need for social interventions that may ultimately lead to improved overall health.

The effect of sex differences. While the authors recruited a similar number of male and females, it is not indicated their proportion in the 119. Additionally, asthma severity in females is exacerbated due to menstruation (Also, asthma is worsened during hormonal changes in females (e.g., menstruation, see Zein, J.G., Erzurum, S.C. Asthma is Different in Women. Curr Allergy Asthma Rep 15, 28 (2015). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11882-015-0528-y). According to the provided data, the authors do not correct for this effect and based on the current text, it is not addressed whether it is was taken into account. Additionally, what is the justification for dropping all the gene chromosomes? Would the results change if they were not removed?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that sex is an important biological factor to consider. The proportion of males:females is similar in the subset of participants used for building the transcriptional signatures (68:51=1.33) as in the overall cohort (148:103=1.44). The male skew in our cohort reflects the higher predisposition of boys towards asthma compared to girls. We correct for sex effect, but not for menstrual cycle effects, because this variable was not collected in the ALOFT study. Additionally, our sample size would not allow us to correct for too many variables. To account for unmeasured confounders, which may also include the menstrual cycle, we correct for gene expression PCs in the eQTL mapping analysis.</p><p>Sex chromosome gene expression data need to be treated with caution as females may have higher expression of X chr gene escaping X inactivation. Y chr gene can of course only be assessed in males, reducing the overall sample size. For these reasons we decided to exclude sex chromosomes from our analyses. Of the 2695 asthma GWAS hits in the GWAS Catalog (ebi.ac.uk/gwas) none have been reported on the Y chromosome and only four associations (across two variants) are reported on the X chromosome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

The authors indicate that SES transcriptional signature &quot;strong overlap with each other&quot;. Regarding this sentence: (a) SES is a very complex item to define and measure. Could the author specify how did they calculate it, e.g., income, education, a conglomerated index? (b) Is it a correlation between which variables, e.g., normalized RNA-seq counts, outputs from the model? Or you are talking about common present/absent transcripts? (c) Based on the heatmap, there are a total of 4 SES-houses unoccupied, subjective SES, parental income and houses rated &gt;=fair, and only houses unoccupied and houses rated &gt;= fair have a strong negative correlation, which one would have expected. Also, only parental income and houses rated &gt;=fair are in the same cluster. (d) &quot;For example, subjective SES was significantly correlated with objective parental responsiveness, family conflict, and self-reported self-disclosure, which is the extent to which the youths talk about their thoughts and feelings (r=-0.26, p=0.004, r=0.25, p=0.006, r=0.53, p=6.8*10-10, respectively)&quot;.
