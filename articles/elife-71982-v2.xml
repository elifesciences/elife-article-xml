Some protein and RNA cargoes are significantly enriched in exosomes. How cells efficiently and selectively sort them into exosomes remains incompletely explored. Previously, we reported that YBX1 is required in sorting of miR-223 into exosomes. Here, we show that YBX1 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in vitro and in cells. YBX1 condensates selectively recruit miR-223 in vitro and into exosomes secreted by cultured cells. Point mutations that inhibit YBX1 phase separation impair the incorporation of YBX1 protein into biomolecular condensates formed in cells, and perturb miR-233 sorting into exosomes. We propose that phase separation-mediated local enrichment of cytosolic RNA-binding proteins and their cognate RNAs enables their targeting and packaging by vesicles that bud into multivesicular bodies. This provides a possible mechanism for efficient and selective engulfment of cytosolic proteins and RNAs into intraluminal vesicles which are then secreted as exosomes from cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>exosomes</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>YBX1</kwd><kwd>P-bodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schekman</surname><given-names>Randy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Condensation of cytosolic protein YBX1 into processing bodies reveals mechanisms for efficient and selective sorting of proteins and their cognate microRNAs into exosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted into the extracellular space appear to mediate some forms of intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Different sub-populations of EVs bud from the plasma membrane or arise from membrane internalized into endosomes to form multi-vesicular bodies (MVB) that fuse at the cell surface to secrete intralumenal vesicles (ILV). Secreted ILVs, referred to as exosomes, are typically 30–150 nm vesicles with a buoyant density of ~1.10–1.19 g/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mincheva‐Nilsson et al., 2016</xref>). Plasma membrane-derived microvesicles, also referred to as shedding vesicles, are more heterogeneous with sizes ranging from 30 to 1000 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cocucci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013</xref>). During their biogenesis, EVs may selectively capture proteins, lipids, metabolites, and nucleic acids which vary according to the cell of origin.</p><p>The selectivity for cargo sorting into EVs is best studied for RNA molecules. Several RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2/B1 (hnRNPA2B1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>), SYNCRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>), HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>) and major vault protein (MVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Statello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teng et al., 2017</xref>), have been implicated in the sorting of RNAs into EVs. In these studies, extracellular vesicles were isolated by sedimentation at ~100,000 xg. These crude EV preparations contain heterogeneous populations of vesicles and membrane-free ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), which has complicated the study of requirements for sorting selectivity. To solve this problem, our lab developed a buoyant density-based procedure to resolve EVs into two fractions and found that certain miRNAs are highly enriched in exosomes as opposed to EVs of lower buoyant density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2020</xref>). We further demonstrated that an RBP, YBX1, is required for selective sorting of miR-223 into exosomes in a cell-free reaction that recapitulates miRNA sorting into vesicles and in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>). In subsequent work, we identified another RBP, Lupus La protein, that is required for selective sorting of miR-122 into exosomes in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>). However, the means by which certain RNPs are efficiently and selectively packaging into exosomes remains unclear.</p><p>Eukaryotic cells form compartments that contain both membrane-bound organelles and non-membrane-bound organelles to optimize the efficiency of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheeler and Hyman, 2018</xref>). Membraneless organelles, also referred to as biomolecular condensates, are assembled via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process in which molecules such as proteins, RNA and other biopolymers are concentrated into a liquid-like compartment. Examples include cytoplasmic condensates such as stress granules, processing bodies (P-bodies), germline P-granules and nuclear condensates such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and paraspeckles. The constituents in these condensates exhibit high mobility and rapidly exchange with the surrounding cytoplasm or nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhao and Zhang, 2020</xref>). Cells also contain more stable gel-liked condensates, such as Balbiani bodies, centrosomes, nuclear pores, and amyloid bodies. These condensates exhibit slower rearrangement and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Spannl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woodruff et al., 2018</xref>). LLPS is mediated by weak, transient interactions conferred by proteins with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) and/or multivalent domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheeler and Hyman, 2018</xref>). IDRs lack a fixed or ordered three-dimensional structure and often comprise biased amino acids, in particular polar and charged residues, including glycine, serine, glutamine, arginine and lysine, and aromatic residues (e.g. tyrosine and phenylalanine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>). Amino acid side chain charge-charge, charge-π, and π-π stacking interactions have been implicated in LLPS condensate formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>). Protein-RNA and RNA-RNA interactions also contribute to RNP condensates such as stress granules and P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tauber et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Liquid-like condensates may harden over time into less fluid structures, such as hydrogels. Aberrant phase transition may be the basis of certain neurodegenerative disorders and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti and Hyman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nedelsky and Taylor, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Phase-separated condensates exhibit selective properties, favoring some proteins and RNAs and excluding others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). P-bodies, for example, are cytoplasmic RNA granules formed by condensation of translationally repressed mRNAs associated with proteins related to mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). P-body proteomes are enriched in proteins containing IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Youn et al., 2019</xref>), including those involved in mRNA decapping and decay and miRNA/siRNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). MiRNAs, their cognate mRNAs and proteins related to miRNA-mediated suppression, including Ago proteins, GW182, Rck, and MOV10 are concentrated in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eystathioy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kulkarni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sen and Blau, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Phase-separated condensates have been implicated in the membrane enclosure of cytosolic proteins associated with autophagy. Cargo proteins such as the Ape1 complex, the PGL granule, and p62, the autophagy cargo receptor, form phase-separated protein condensates, triggering formation of surrounding autophagosomes to ensure their specific and efficient transport to lysosomes or the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamasaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). By extension, it seems likely that RNA-binding proteins may form condensates as a precursor to engulfment by endosomal membranes. Indeed, YBX1 contains an IDR sequence and was reported to be associated with P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang and Bloch, 2007</xref>) and involved in stress granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Somasekharan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report evidence that the YBX1 protein efficiently forms liquid-like droplets in vitro and in cells. We observed that miR-223 but not miR-190 or miR-144 efficiently partitioned into YBX1 droplets. YBX1 condensate formation required the C-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR), dependent on the aromatic residue tyrosine and positive charged residues arginine and lysine. Point mutations that rendered YBX1 unable to phase separate disrupted YBX1 condensates in cells, interfered with recruitment of miR-223 to YBX1 droplets in vitro, and resulted in a failure of packaging of miR-223 into exosomes secreted by cells. We found that YBX1 condensed into processing bodies that contain several other proteins that were sorted into exosomes. We suggest that YBX1 liquid-like condensates may increase the local concentration of YBX1 molecules and bound RNA, and thereby direct the selective sorting miRNAs into exosomes, thus coupling RNP granules to RNA packaging into exosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>YBX1 forms liquid-like condensates in cells</title><p>We have previously shown that an RBP, YBX1, is present in purified exosomes and is required for sorting miRNAs into exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>). To further characterize how YBX1 functions in this process, we first examined its subcellular localization. Endogenous YBX1 was observed concentrated in puncta in the cytosol, as visualized by the use of specific YBX1 antibody and immunofluorescence (IF) in fixed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We hypothesized that the YBX1 puncta are liquid-like condensates that rapidly exchange their constituent molecules with the surrounding cytosol. To investigate this possibility, we constructed a stable cell line with YFP-tagged YBX1 that showed similar puncta as endogenous YBX1. Using this cell line, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments and found that after photobleaching, approximately 70 % of fluorescence was recovered within 90 s, suggesting a liquid-like behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A compound previously shown to disrupt liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules (1,6-hexanediol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kroschwald et al., 2017</xref>) caused YBX1 puncta to disassemble in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and E</xref>). Another aliphatic alcohol, 2,5-hexanediol, which was reported to be much less active in the dissolution of FUS hydrogel droplets in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), was similarly less efficient in dissolving YBX1 puncta in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). We further observed two YBX1 puncta coalesced to form a larger punctum within a few seconds, reflecting the liquid-like property of puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, these data suggest that YBX1 forms a liquid-like biomolecular condensate in cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>YBX1 forms liquid-like condensates in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subcellular localization of YBX1 in WT and ΔYBX1 from U2OS cells as visualized by YBX1 antibody.

We detected phase separation of YBX1 protein at increasing protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). YBX1 started to form weak condensates at 3 µM and liquid droplets at 5 µM which corresponded to its approximate physiological cytosolic concentration in cells (4.6 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). We also observed that YBX1 droplets were rapidly dispersed by 1,6-hexanediol treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As we observed in cells, two pure YBX1 droplets coalesced to form a larger spherical droplet, reflecting the nature of liquid-like droplets to minimize surface area by decreasing the surface/vol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Correspondingly, in FRAP analysis, the mGFP::YBX1 fluorescence signal almost completely recovered 9 s after bleaching, consistent with the fluid state of YBX1 in granules in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). These data suggest that GFP-YBX1 phase separates to form liquid condensates in vitro.

YBX1 is predicted to contain IDRs in both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The long, C-terminal segment contains positively and negatively charged clusters of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To identify the role of individual domains of YBX1 to form puncta in cells, we generated a series of constructs in which the A/P domain, CSD or the CTD were either deleted or expressed exclusively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Deletion of the CTD (YBX1-Δ128–324) completely blocked the formation of YBX1 puncta whereas the N-terminal A/P domain (YBX1-Δ1–55) was dispensable for puncta formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), suggesting that the C-terminal IDR rather than the N-terminal IDR was required for YBX1 condensate formation. Interestingly, the CTD (YBX1-Δ1–127) expressed alone was predominantly localized to the nucleus, likely within the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>), possibly due to nuclear export signals (NES) within the YBX1 N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Roeyen et al., 2013</xref>). The CSD (YBX1-CSD) showed an even cellular distribution and a deletion lacking CSD (YBX1-ΔCSD) was predominantly nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). We next studied the effect of these mutations on YBX1 droplet formation in vitro. Consistent with our observation of transfected cells, we found that CTD was indispensable for YBX1 LLPS.

To further understand which amino acids contribute to IDR-driven YBX1 LLPS, we made several distinct variants of YBX based on the residue composition within the C-terminal IDR. Several polar but uncharged amino acids variants (CTD-Y to S/A, CTD-QN to G/A), a basic amino acid variant (CTD-RK to G), an acidic amino acid variant (CTD-DE to G) and a hydrophobic non-polar amino acid variant (CTD-VMF to A) were expressed in ΔYBX1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We first examined the subcellular localization of YFP-fusion forms of these variants in U2OS cells by transient transfection. All the mutants expressed similar or higher levels of the fusion protein compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Either replacing all the tyrosine residues in the C-terminal disordered region of YBX1 with serine residues/alanine residues (CTD-Y to S/A), or replacing all the arginine and lysine residues with glycine (CTD-RK to G), comprehensively impaired YBX1 condensate formation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). All the other mutants formed YBX1 condensates as efficiently as wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We next sought to determine if variants CTD-Y to S and CTD-RK to G were defective in LLPS of YBX1 in vitro with pure mGFP-fusion proteins expressed and isolated from insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In agreement with condensate formation in cells, YBX1 phase separation was severely impaired as indicated by the formation of smaller droplets at a higher range of protein concentrations of CTD-Y to S variant or completely deficient by substitution of arginine and lysine residues with glycine in the CTD (CTD-RK to G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We further noticed that tyrosines in the CTD are relatively uniformly distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with a phase separation that fits the sticker-and-spacer model pattern of aromatic residues such as has been proposed for RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2020</xref>). These results suggest that YBX1 phase separation is driven by the IDR region, most likely through interactions among tyrosine- and arginine-rich motifs.</p><p>The YBX1 CSD is highly evolutionarily conserved and contains two consensus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) 1 and 2 sequences. The aromatic amino acid residues Phe74, Phe85, and His87 within these motifs form a hydrophobic cluster on the protein surface that participates in DNA or RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kloks et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). A single amino acid Phe to Ala mutation (F85A), was reported to block YBX1-specific RNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lyons et al., 2016</xref>). The alternating basic and acidic clusters of the CTD are implicated in nonspecific nucleic acid binding as well as protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mordovkina et al., 2020</xref>). In our previous work, YBX1 was identified in purified exosomes and found to be required for sorting miR-223 into exosomes. We hypothesized that there might be a direct interaction between YBX1 and miR-223. Purified recombinant YBX1 interacts directly with 5’ fluorescently-labeled miR-223 and F85A YBX1 abolishes that interaction as quantified by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Ma, L. and RS, in preparation). Mutation of Phe85 to Ala caused YBX1 translocation into the nucleus, mainly the nucleolus, suggesting that the RNA binding might be responsible for YBX1 retention in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Because the F85A mutant protein mostly localizes to the nucleus, it was used as a control in the following assays. To test whether YBX1-F85A remained in a liquid-like state in cells, we performed FRAP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C and D</xref>). Nearly 90 % of the fluorescence signal was recovered within 30 s after photobleaching, suggesting that YBX1-F85A is highly dynamic in cells. We further found that F85A did not affect YBX1 phase separation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>IDR-driven YBX1 phase separation is required for sorting YBX1 into exosomes</title><p>Exosomes are produced by intraluminal vesicle budding from the limiting membrane of MVBs.

In subsequent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>, we showed that CD63 defines a distinct pool of high buoyant density vesicles corresponding to exosomes. To test the presence of YBX1 in EVs from cultured U2OS cells, we examined the fractionation of extracellular YBX1 by differential centrifugation and found by immunoblot that endogenous YBX1 co-sedimented with multiple EV markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Overexpression of YFP-YBX1 in ΔYBX1 cells enhanced the secretion of sedimentable YBX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Fivefold more YFP-YBX1 was detected in the sediment of culture medium from cells overexpressing wt compared to F85A mutant YBX1 fusion protein. IDR-defective YBX1 mutant proteins (CTD-Y to S, CTD-RK to G) were less efficiently packaged than wt YBX1 into extracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To confirm that YBX1 resided inside the lumen of extracellular vesicles, we performed proteinase K protection assays on membranes in the high-speed pellet fraction. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> shows, endogenous YBX1 was protected from proteinase K digestion in the absence but not in the presence of Triton X-100. ALIX, a cytosolic protein within exosomes, and Flotillin-2, a membrane protein anchored to the inner leaflet of EVs, served as positive controls that were also degraded only in the presence of detergent. CD9, a multi (putative four)-transmembrane protein with an extracellular loop recognized by CD9 antibody, was vulnerable to degradation independent of detergent. Similarly, YFP-tagged YBX1 from a high-speed pellet fraction was mostly resistant to proteinase K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results confirmed that YBX1 was packaged into exosomes secreted from U2OS cells. In contrast, the RNA-binding defective YBX1 mutant F85A and IDR-defective mutants (Y to S and RK to G) were significantly decreased in high-speed pellet fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>).</p><p>Cells overexpressing YFP-YBX1 were used for further purification of EVs by buoyant density flotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

YFP-YBX1 was detected in the buoyant vesicle fraction from ΔYBX1/YFP-YBX1 cells but not from ΔYBX1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Further separation of these vesicles was achieved on a linear iodixanol gradient (5–25%) which resolved two distinct EV species: low density (LD) and high density (HD) sub-populations, as we previously reported for EVs from MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>).

Approximately 10-fold more YFP-YBX1 than YFP-YBX F85A mutant protein was detected in the HD vesicle fractions normalized to CD9 content in each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

We first incubated 5’Cy5-labeled miR-223, miR-190 and miR-144 with mGFP-YBX1 independently. Incubations were conducted in the presence of an excess of unlabeled RNA (10 ng/µl total RNA was extracted from U2OS cells) which produced a clear discrimination between miR-223 which partitioned well into YBX1 condensates from miR-190 and miR-144, which did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). The addition of unlabeled excess RNA produced enlarged YBX1 droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At a fixed concentration of 7.5 µM YBX1 and 100 nM miRNA but without unlabeled excess RNA, both miR-223 and miR-190 partitioned into YBX1 droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). However, at varied concentrations of miRNA, the partition coefficient for miR-223 into YBX1 droplets was higher than miR-190, while the partition coefficients for YBX1 were almost same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

Nonetheless, miR-144 was not recruited in YBX1 droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). In an independent assay, we evaluated the interaction of YBX1 with three miRNAs by co-immunoprecipitation from HEK293T cell lysates. These results were consistent with the capture or not of these miRNAs in YBX1 condensates with nearly quantitative co-precipitation of YBX1 and miR-223 but 5-10-fold lower co-precipitation of miR-190 and miR-144 from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). We next assessed miRNA partition into the phase separation defective mutants YBX1-CTD-Y to S and YBX1-CTD-RK to G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G, H and I</xref>). The Y to S mutant produced less condensate at the same protein concentration and was somewhat less discriminatory and the RK-G mutant produced no visible condensate of protein or RNA. Although the results of these two experiments were consistent, the requirement of YBX1 for secretion of miR-144 in cells was not reflected in a requirement for capture by pure YBX1 protein in condensates.</p><p>In our previous work, we evaluated the requirement for YBX1 in the secretion of miR-223 and miR-144 by assaying samples of the culture medium in which HEK293T cells were grown.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, among these three miRNAs, miR-223, and miR-144 but not miR-190 were enriched to different extents in exosomes secreted by HEK293T and U2OS cells.

Combined with the other results of our current work, we conclude, as before, that YBX1 enhances the secretion of miR-223 in EVs but that miR-144, although enriched in EVs, does not engage YBX1 condensates and is not required for secretion in EVs.

We previously reported roles for the YBX1 protein in sorting and secretion of miR-223 in HEK293T cells and the Lupus La protein in secretion of miR-122 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Both proteins contain such IDR domains, and at least one, the La protein, appears to be organized in puncta in the cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we report that pure YBX1 forms a liquid-like condensate and similarly associates with P-bodies in cells including in apparent association with other bona fide constituents of P-bodies such as the DDX6 protein. YBX1 also contains an RNA-binding domain, the CSD, which together with the IDR is required for sorting of miR-223 into exosomes secreted by cells and for the species-selective concentration of miR-223 into condensates in vitro. We report a previously unrecognized connection between proteins such as YBX1 and DDX6 that associate in P-bodies and are also secreted in exosomes. Thus, we speculate that the P-bodies may house miRNA and other small RNAs prior to their capture into membrane invaginations and intralumenal vesicles of the multivesicular body (MVB). Fusion of the MVB at lysosome would then subject the ILVs and their condensate content to degradation. Fusion of the MVB at the cell surface would result in the extracellular discharge of exosomes for uptake into other cells.</p><p>Several other RBPs have been reported to play a role in the sorting and secretion of miRNAs in exosomes. These include hnRNPA2B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>), SYNCRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hobor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Santangelo et al., 2016</xref>), HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mukherjee et al., 2016</xref>), and the major vault protein (MVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Statello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teng et al., 2017</xref>), one of which, SYNCRIP, contains an IDR domain and associates with YBX1 in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Other groups have developed evidence for post-translational modifications of RBPs that may influence their localization in cells. Sumoylation, uridylation and ubiquitylation of RBPs have been implicated in the selection of miRNA cargo for secretion in EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koppers-Lalic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Villarroya-Beltri et al., 2013</xref>). The secretion of YBX1 in EVs, for example, has been shown to depend on ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palicharla and Maddika, 2015</xref>). The relationship between these modifications and the capture of miRNAs into invaginations that form on an endosome remains to be explored. On possible connection is in the role of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and ubiquitylation of IDRs where the phase transition properties are altered by changes in charge, hydrophobicity size and structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Owen and Shewmaker, 2019</xref>). Such modifications may reversibly control the partition of RBPs and cargo into RNA granules and subsequently into vesicles budding into the endosome.</p><p>Of the two IDRs in YBX1, only the one located in the C-terminal domain appears to influence the phase condensation properties of the protein. Within the C-terminal IDR, we identified Y, R, and K residues that contribute to LLPS. As shown for prion-like RNA binding properties, we suggest that phase separation of YBX1 is governed by interactions between Y and R residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). RNA-binding through an interaction with the CSD domain of YBX1 appears to reinforce phase separation producing larger droplets at an optimum ratio of RNA/protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Dissolution of P-bodies by CHX treatment reduced by two fold the sorting of miR-223 but not miR-144 into density gradient purified exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). CHX inhibits protein synthesis by trapping mRNA on ribosomes and thereby prevents their influx into P bodies. Three proteins have been reported to be essential for P-body formation in mammalian cells: DDX6, 4E-T, and, to a lesser extent, LSM14A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayache et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Standart and Weil, 2018</xref>). To examine the direct role of P bodies in exosomal RNA sorting, we knocked down individual P-body protein DDX6, 4E-T or LSM14A by shRNA. We observed that P-body formation was greatly disrupted in most of the knock- down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref><bold>, type A cells</bold>) with a corresponding defect in the sorting of miR-223 into exosomes from 4E-T knockdown cells but not DDX6 or LSM14A knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3C</xref>). This correlated with the incomplete knockdown of DDX6 and LSM14A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>) as also seen in the persistence of small (type A cells) and big granules (type B cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>YBX1 has also been shown to localize to stress granules. Compared with the published stress granule proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jain et al., 2016</xref>), we found that 28.7 % (118/411) of stress granule proteins were identified in exosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata3">Figure 7—source data 3</xref>). YBX1 enrichment in stress granules has been reported to be linked to its secretion in response to the stress induced by arsenite treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guarino et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Our observation of a connection between P-bodies and RBPs engaged in sorting of miRNAs for secretion in exosomes may relate the two organelles by function. P-bodies are thought to function in mRNA storage or decay. Although exosomes have some small mRNAs, the average length of RNAs in the range of 100 nt favors smaller species such as tRNA, Y-RNA, vault RNA and miRNAs. If P-bodies or other RNA granules serve to condense these small RNAs for secretion in exosomes, there would have to be some segregation of species with respect to size and perhaps function. Furthermore, P-bodies are larger than the typical exosome (~500 nm vs 30–150 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>), thus the sorting of small RNA cargo for secretion may occur in only a subset of smaller P bodies or by a physical segregation of a domain of the P body by tubulation or budding into an invagination into the endosome. A further speculative connection relates to the localization of miRNA processing components, such as Ago2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Siomi and Siomi, 2009</xref>), on the surface of endosomes and on our observation of a physical contact between YBX1 and Ago2 and MOV10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Nonetheless, as we consistently find Ago2 not localized within exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shurtleff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>), there must be some sorting of YBX1 from other P body content in the capture of proteins and RNA segregated into membrane buds invaginating into the endosome. We suggest that molecules destined for secretion in exosomes are segregated in a two-step process involving partition into a precursor larger RNA granule or into RNA granules of distinct function followed by sorting from or among granules to capture those molecules fated for secretion in exosomes and capture by target cells into which exosomes are internalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Diagram representing a working model of miRNA selectively sorted into exosomes by phase-separated YBX1 condensates.</title><p>Cytosolic RBP YBX1 forms liquid-like condensates in cells and liquid droplets in vitro. Phase separation of YBX1 is governed by a C-terminal IDR, most likely through the association of aromatic amino acid tyrosine and basic amino acids arginine or lysine. Phase-separated YBX1 recruits miRNAs in a selective manner through N-terminal CSD- mediated specific protein-RNA interaction. YBX1 condensation increases its local concentration and the affiliation with P body components (such as DDX6), which further facilitates YBX1 and its cognate miRNAs sorting into exosomes. Segregation of RNA and RBPs for capture by invagination into an endosome occurs at the level of granule formation or by sorting of selected RNAs and RBPs from larger, more heterogeneous granules.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71982-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

cell culture</title><p>Human HEK293T cells and human osteosarcoma cell lines U2OS were obtained from the UC-Berkeley Cell Culture Facility and were confirmed by short tandem repeat profiling (STR) and tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were grown in monolayer cultures at 37 °C in 5 % CO<sub>2</sub> and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). For EV production, we seeded cells at ~30 % confluency in exosome-depleted medium that was obtained either by ultracentrifugation of DMEM plus 10 % FBS or DMEM supplemented with 10 % exosome-depleted FBS (System Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) in 150 mm CellBIND tissue culture dishes (Corning, Corning NY). EVs were collected when cells reached approximately 80 % confluency (~48 hr). For characterization of miRNA sorting into exosomes, cells grown to ~70 % confluency in DMEM with 10 % FBS medium and shifted into exosome-depleted medium. EVs were collected after 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Extracellular vesicle purification</title><p>Conditioned medium (about 420 ml) was harvested from HEK293T or U2OS cultured cells at 80 % confluency. All the following manipulations were performed at 4 °C. Cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 1500xg for 20 min in a Sorvall R6+ centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by 10,000xg for 20 min in 500 ml vessels using a fixed angle FIBERlite F14−6 × 500 y rotor (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The supernatant fraction was then centrifuged onto a 60 % sucrose cushion in buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 0.85% w/v NaCl) at ~100,000 xg (28,000 rpm) for 1.5 hr using SW 32 Ti swinging-bucket rotors. The interface on the sucrose cushion was collected and pooled from three tubes and applied onto a 60 % sucrose cushion for an additional centrifugation at ~120,000 xg (31,500 rpm) in a SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor for 16 hr. The sucrose concentration of the collection from the first sucrose cushion interface was measured by refractometry and was adjusted to a concentration &lt;20%. Higher concentrations of sucrose impede sedimentation because EVs equilibrate at a buoyant density above that level. For purification, EV subpopulations that resolve at distinct buoyant densities in a linear gradient were collected and mixed with 60 % sucrose to a final volume of 4 ml (sucrose final concentration is ~48%). Layers of 1.5 ml of 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, and 5 % iodixanol (Optiprep) solution in buffer A were sequentially overlaid and samples were centrifugated at ~150, 000xg (36,500 rpm) for 16 hr in a SW 41 Ti rotor. Fractions (400 µl for each) from top to bottom were collected and mixed with SDS sample buffer for immunoblot analysis. In some cases, such as in the immunoblot of YBX1, the floated fractions corresponding to the high density from 1.13 to 1.15 g/ml were pooled and concentrated by centrifugation to improve detection by immunoblot.</p><p>For EV purification in bulk (without discriminating among EV sub-populations), the first cushion-sedimented vesicles above were collected and mixed with 60 % sucrose to a final volume of 8 ml. At this point, it was important to keep the sucrose concentration &gt;50 %. Aliquots (3 ml) of 40%, (1.5 ml)10 % sucrose buffer were sequentially overlaid and the tubes were centrifuged at ~150, 000xg (36,500 rpm) for 16 hr in a SW 41 Ti swinging-bucket rotor. The 10/40 % interface was collected and used either directly for RNA extraction by a mirVana miRNA isolation kit (Thermo Fischer Scientific) or washed with PBS and concentrated by centrifugation at ~120, 000xg in a SW 55 Ti rotor for 70 min. Samples were then prepared for immunoblot analysis.</p><p>For proteinase K protection assays, the supernatant fraction from 10,000xg of conditioned medium was centrifuged at 100,000xg (28,000 rpm) for 1.5 hr using SW 32 Ti rotors. Pellet fractions resuspended in PBS were pooled and centrifuged at ~150, 000xg (36,500 rpm) for 70 min in a SW 55 Ti rotor. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and split into four equal aliquots. One sample was left untreated, another sample was treated with 0.5 % Triton X-100, the third sample was treated with 5 µg/ml proteinase K on ice for 20 min, and the last one was mixed with 0.5 % Triton X-100 prior to proteinase K treatment. Proteinase K was inactivated with 5 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) on ice for 5 min and samples were then mixed with SDS sample loading buffer for immunoblot analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Nanoparticle tracking analysis</title><p>Extracellular vesicles purified by buoyant density centrifugation were diluted 1:100 with PBS filtered with a 0.02 µm filter (What GmbH, Dassel, Germany).

The grid was quickly washed on three droplets of water to dilute the sucrose and then stained with 1 % uranyl acetate for 2 min. Excess staining solution was removed with Whatman Grade one filter paper.

We used total RNA from cells or exosomes for normalization as there is no well-accepted control transcript for exosomes. Total RNA from cells was quantified by nanodrop and total RNA from exosomes was quantified using an RNA bioanalyzer (Agilent). Typically, 10 ng total RNA from cells and 2 ng total RNA from exosomes was reverse transcribed. Taqman qPCR master mix with no amperase UNG was used for real-time PCR and reactions were performed on an ABI-7900 real-time PCR system (Life Technologies). For all RT-PCR reactions, the results are presented as mean cycle threshold (Ct) values of three independent technical replicates.

To account for background and photo-bleaching effects during acquisition, we used the mean intensity values from the bleach region (BL), the background region (BG) and the reference signal region (REF) to calculate the corrected BL (BL_corr) for each acquisition frame using the equation:</p><p>BL_corr2 (t) = BL_corr1 (t) / REF_corr1 (t) = [BL(t)-BG(t)] / [REF(t)-BG(t)].</p><p>BL_corr2 (t) was further normalized to the mean pre-bleach intensities, which were used to estimate 100 % fluorescence intensity:</p><p>BL_corr3 (t) = BL_corr2 (t) / BL_corr2 (pre-bleach).</p><p>Finally, an exponential recovery-like-shape curve was generated by plotting the normalized fluorescent intensity value to times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Live-cell imaging under hexanediol treatments</title><p>Live cell imaging was performed on an LSM880 microscope with the incubation chamber maintained at 37 °C and 5 % CO<sub>2</sub>. U2OS cells expressing YFP-YBX1 were grown on a coverslip-bottom in 35 mm dishes (MatTek P35G-1.5–14 C) until approximately 70 % confluency and then imaged using the 514 nm laser. The stock solutions of 1,6-hexanediol (Sigma-Aldrich, 240117) and 2,5-hexanediol (Sigma-Aldrich, H11904) with different m/v concentrations (20%, 10%, 4%) in phenol-red free medium were freshly prepared. Right before imaging, the normal cell culture medium was changed into 1 ml of phenol-red-free medium in the 35 mm dish. After starting the image acquisition, we added 1 ml of pre-warmed hexanediol stock solution (20%, 10%, 4%) to the 35 mm dish without pausing imaging to adjust to the final concentrations of 10%, 5%, or 2 %. We treated the time of hexanediol addition as the time ‘0’ when quantification of surviving puncta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Contribution of unpublished essential data and reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Supervision, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-71982-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

Your article has been favorably reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yan G. Zhao (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers were excited about your story and have made some suggestions listed below. The only essential revision is requested to bolster the conclusion, &quot;Condensation of YBX1 into P-bodies is required for sorting miRNAs into exosomes&quot;. Please investigate whether disruption of P body formation or P-body and YBX1 interaction affects YBX droplet formation and/or miRNA122 partitioning.</p><p>We include the full reviews below so that you can respond to the comments experimentally and/or textually, as you see appropriate and reasonable. We hope you find the comments constructive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors showed that YBX1 condensates into P bodies and 18.4% of the P body components are identified from purified exosomes. As shown Figures 4B, almost all the YBX1 signal are localized inside the enlarged endosomes induced by overexpressing constitutively active form of Rab5, and YBX1 also largely colocalizes EDC4 labeled P-bodies in Figure 7C. What is the localization of different P body components associated with exosomes or not at the same condition? It will be nice to show the segregation of YBX1 droplet from P-bodies before enclosed by endosomes.</p><p>2. For the last part of the manuscript, the authors claim that &quot;Condensation of YBX1 into P-bodies is required for sorting miRNAs into exosomes&quot;. However, the authors only provide evidence to show the localization and interaction of YBX1 with P-bodies and P-body components in EVs, which fails to demonstrate the requirement of this process in miRNA sorting. The author should investigate whether disruption of P body formation or P-body and YBX1 interaction affects YBX droplet formation and/or miRNA122 partition to support the conclusion.</p><p>3. YBX1 has been shown to localize to stress granules. Are stress granule components also identified in exosome proteomics? Is there any relationship between stress granules and exosome sorting? Please discuss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to raise several points to be addressed</p><p>– Figure 3C, 4A and similar: sorry if I overlooked this, but please describe in the figure legends or methods section how your images were processed. Is e.g. the 'scaling' of the YFP intensity identical for all panels / mutants in one figure, so the expression levels can be directly compared ? Have you checked whether the mutant proteins express to a similar level like the wild-type protein? Protein levels (can) have a great influence on the phase separation behaviour of a protein, so this information would be important for the reader.</p><p>– line 216: please show the gel shift assay, for miR-233 but also for at least one other control miRNA (best would be both miR144 and miR190)</p><p>– Line 236/237 and 276/277: the authors state that incorporation of YBX1 into ILVs, phase separation and RNA binding of YBX1 are required. While I fully agree on the LLPS part, I am not sure if the statement on RNA binding can be made as is. Figure 3-supp3A shows that the F85A mutant relocates to the nucleus / nucleolus and is depleted from the cytoplasm, which the authors suggest might be a consequence of the deficiency in RNA binding (which could well be). Still, this means that less protein is available the cytoplasm, and the lack of loading might not be due to the deficiency in RNA binding, but simply to cytoplasmic protein availability. One way to test this could be creating a cytoplasm-localised F85A mutant, and testing whether this mutant is recruited to exosomes. Otherwise, please modify the text accordingly.</p><p>– Figure 6: it is striking that addition of total RNA (6D) enhances the selectivity / affinity for miR-233 compared to the isolated miRNAs (6-supp2). It would be great if the authors could (a) provide the sequences of the miRNAs and (b) speculate about possible reasons. As an outlook, but not necessarily required for this paper: are certain motifs in miR-233 essential for recruitment (see e.g. recent work by Iserman / Gladtfelter MolCell 2020), and can they distinguish whether the miRNA is recruited to condensates as a single-stranded RNA, or bound to a target mRNA in 6D ? This is also highly interesting in light of the YBX1-DDX6 interaction, since DDX6 is involved in miRNA-mediated repression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Not essential: A very powerful test of this idea would be to identify experimental conditions to release the F85A mutant (which is retarded in the nucleus) from the nucleus into the cytosol and P bodies and analyze whether miR-223 does indeed fail to get enriched in exosomes. Other mutants that do not affect condensate formation (see Figure 3 supp 2) could be tested as well for miR-233 enrichment.</p><p>2. Essential: A link that could be strengthened in this manuscript is the link to processing bodies (P bodies). Previous work identified YBX1 in P bodies and after cells sense stress to stress granules. Indeed, the Y to S as well as the R/K to A mutants do not condense into P bodies, but how does YBX-1 exosome secretion and miR-223 targeting change when P bodies become compromised? Is YBX-1 localization to P bodies a prerequisite for miR-223 sorting?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71982.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

For example, LSM14A (or EDC4) is not associated with exosomes, DDX6 is associated with exosomes based on the LC-MS/MS results. They both form puncta together with YBX1 (Figure 7A and Figure 7B). In cells overexpressing a constitutively active mutant mCherry-Rab5<sup>Q79L</sup>, YBX1 accumulated inside enlarged endosomes, DDX6 and LSM14A localized either outside of the enlarged endosomes (white arrow) or on the rim of the enlarged endosomes (yellow arrow). These results were shown in “Author response image 1”, which is not included in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In Figure 7C and Figure 7H, we showed that IDR defective mutants YBX1-CTD-Y to S and YBX1-CTD-RK to G disrupt the association of YBX1 with P-bodies. These IDR defective mutants greatly impaired YBX1 droplet formation (Figure 3D) and miR-223 partition (Figure 6B and Figure 6C).</p><p>Treatment of cells with the translation inhibitor CHX (cycloheximide) is well established to trap mRNAs in polysomes and prevent P-body assembly. To test whether P-bodies are involved in exosomal miRNA sorting, we treated U2OS cells with 10 µg/ml CHX. The results are shown in Figure 7 supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. We found that both the P body marker EDC4 and YBX1 were no longer observed in foci following treatment with 10 µg/ml CHX for 2 h (Figure 7 supplement 2A), and miR-223 sorting into the growth medium was reduced significantly (Figure 7 supplement 2B) and by 2-fold into exosomes (Figure 7 supplement 2D) as determined by RT-qPCR.</p><p>Three proteins have been reported to be essential for P-body formation in mammalian cells: DDX6, 4E-T, and, to a lesser extent, LSM14A (Ayache et al., 2015; Standart and Weil, 2018). We used shRNA to knock down each protein and found that P-body formation was greatly disrupted in most of the knock down cells (Figure 7 supplement 3A, type A cells). We observed a defect in sorting of miR-223 into isolated exosomes from 4E-T knockdown cells but less so from LSM14A not at all from DDX6 or knockdown cells (Figure 7 supplement 3C). One possible reason is that the knock down for DDX6 and to some extent for LSM14A was incomplete (Figure 7 supplement 3B) and small granules (type A cells) or even big granules (type B cells) were observed in the DDX6 or LSM14A knock downs (Figure 7 supplement 3A). These results are now included in the revised manuscript and described in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. YBX1 has been shown to localize to stress granules. Are stress granule components also identified in exosome proteomics? Is there any relationship between stress granules and exosome sorting? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We detected stress granule components in purified exosomes and added the results in Table 3 and are described in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript. Compared with the published stress granule proteome (Jain et al., 2016), we found that 28.7% (118/411) of stress granule proteins were identified in exosomes. YBX1 enrichment in stress granules has been reported to be linked to its extracellular accumulation during arsenite treatment (Guarino et al., 2018), suggesting a possible role of stress granules in exosome sorting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would like to raise several points to be addressed</p><p>– Figure 3C, 4A and similar: sorry if I overlooked this, but please describe in the figure legends or methods section how your images were processed.

Cells with median level of expression of YFP were chosen for further analysis. We added image processing information in the “Immunofluorescence” section in Methods in the revised manuscript: “Images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope equipped with an mCherry/GFP/DAPI filter set and 63X or 100X 1.4 NA objectives, and were analyzed with the Fiji software (http://fiji.sc/Fiji). In order to better display the results, we adjusted the 'scaling' of the YFP intensity among the panels / mutants in one figure.”</p><p>The expression levels of each mutant and WT for Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 2B and 2C are added in the Figure 3 supplement 2F in the revised manuscript. We also added one sentence in the text: “…All the mutants expressed similar or higher levels of the fusion protein compared to wild type (Figure 3 supplement 2F)…” However, the immunoblot results represent the protein expression level of the heterogeneous cell population but not an individual signal cell as shown by images. To further confirm the phase separation mutant phenotype, we isolated single stable cell lines that express similar levels of mutant and wild-type proteins (Figure 4D) and corresponding images are shown in Figure 7C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– line 216: please show the gel shift assay, for miR-233 but also for at least one other control miRNA (best would be both miR144 and miR190)</p></disp-quote><p>The gel shift assay is shown in Author response image 2, but is not included in the revised manuscript.

Three nuclear localization signals have been identified in the YBX1 CTD (NLS-1: 149-156aa; NLS-2: 185-194aa; NLS-3: 276-292aa) (Roeyen et al., 2013). The NLS-2 and NLS-3 motifs are sufficient for nuclear targeting. Four related constructs P<sub>NLS</sub>185I, P<sub>NLS</sub>185II, P<sub>NLS</sub>276I, and P<sub>NLS</sub>276II failed to localize to the nucleus (Roeyen et al., 2013). In order to create a cytoplasm-localized F85A mutant, we generated five constructs as shown in author response image 3<bold>.</bold> Although ΔNLS-2, ΔP<sub>NLS</sub>185I, ΔNLS-3 and ΔP<sub>NLS</sub>276II mutants showed partial cytoplasmic localization, none of them resulted in a clean defect. Given this ambiguity, we have not included these results in the revised manuscript and instead have modified our conclusion. We added one sentence “Because the F85A mutant protein mostly localizes to the nucleus, it was used as a control in the following assays.” in line 228-230 in the revised manuscript. We also deleted the words “and RNA binding” in line 248, “both binding to RNA and” in line 290, “RNA-binding CSD and the” in line 310, and “RNA binding and” in line 315 in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 6: it is striking that addition of total RNA (6D) enhances the selectivity / affinity for miR-233 compared to the isolated miRNAs (6-supp2).

Our data showed that a low amount of total cellular RNA enhanced and high levels dissolved YBX1 condensates. The condensation of YBX1 peaks at the RNA concentration at which charges between protein and RNA are balanced. In this condition, the YBX1 droplets showed more selectivity for miR-223 over miR-190 or miR-144 due to YBX1-CSD-mediated specific protein RNA interaction.</p><p>Our unpublished results show that “UCAGU” motif on the N-terminal of miR-223 is required for its interaction with YBX1 and sorting into exosomes (Ma, L. and RS, in preparation). We speculate that this motif may be essential for its recruitment. In Figure 6 supplement 2B and 2C, there is no cellular total RNA in the phase separation reaction, thus the miRNA may be recruited to condensates as a single-stranded molecule in vitro.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
