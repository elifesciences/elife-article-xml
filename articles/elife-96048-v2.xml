has been associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have revealed the importance of RNA-binding proteins in the regulation of neuronal splicing programs. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of these splicing regulators are still unclear. Here, we show that KIS, a kinase upregulated in the developmental brain, imposes a genome-wide alteration in exon usage during neuronal differentiation in mice. KIS contains a protein-recognition domain common to spliceosomal components and phosphorylates PTBP2, counteracting the role of this splicing factor in exon exclusion. At the molecular level, phosphorylation of unstructured domains within PTBP2 causes its dissociation from two co-regulators, Matrin3 and hnRNPM, and hinders the RNA-binding capability of the complex. Furthermore, KIS and PTBP2 display strong and opposing functional interactions in synaptic spine emergence and maturation. Taken together, our data uncover a post-translational control of splicing regulators that link transcriptional and alternative exon usage programs in neuronal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KIS kinase</kwd><kwd>PTBP2</kwd><kwd>exon usage</kwd><kwd>neuronal differentiation</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>RNA binding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRE2018-083268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mendoza</surname><given-names>Mónica B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004837</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2020-113231GB-I00</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallego</surname><given-names>Carme</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P009417/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardakheh</surname><given-names>Faraz K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015652</institution-id><institution>Barts Charity</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MGU0346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mardakheh</surname><given-names>Faraz K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>KIS, a kinase upregulated in the developmental brain, phosphorylates the PTBP2 splicing complex and modulates alternative exon usage for proper synaptic spine emergence and maturation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the mammalian brain, alternative splicing (AS) is a key mechanism that contributes substantially to the enormous molecular diversity among neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbosa-Morais et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mazin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Merkin et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the similarity of neuronal gene expression programs, each neuronal subclass can be distinguished by unique alternative mRNA processing events. Moreover, AS is known to drive many aspects of neurogenesis, including neural progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, axon guidance, synapse formation, and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vuong et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlanis and Scheiffele, 2018</xref>). The relevance of AS as a regulatory mechanism is evidenced by numerous examples in which alterations in splicing are associated with pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gandal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LaForce et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schieweck et al., 2021</xref>). Although fine-tuning mRNA processing is essential for neuronal activity and maintenance, insights into its regulation are just starting to emerge. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play a critical role in regulating AS patterns. These proteins bind to pre-mRNAs and form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that can affect splicing by influencing the recognition of splicing signals or by blocking access of the splicing machinery to certain regions of the pre-mRNA. Some RBPs act as splicing enhancers, promoting the inclusion of specific exons, while others act as splicing repressors inhibiting the inclusion of exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher and Feng, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Traunmüller et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Among the most investigated RBPs are the polypyrimidine tract-binding proteins, PTBP1 and PTBP2, which are considered master regulators of neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Linares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). These two proteins exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns in which PTBP1 is expressed in most cell types and neuronal progenitor cells, whereas PTBP2 is expressed primarily in differentiating neurons and testis. During the differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells to postmitotic neurons a switch takes place from the predominant expression of PTBP1 to its neuronal paralog PTBP2, which is essential for the stem cell to neuron transition. PTBP2 null mice die shortly after birth and exhibit misregulation of AS in genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>) as well as in neurite growth and synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, PTBP2 knockout brains display reduced neural progenitor pools and premature neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>). PTBP2 also plays an important role in the embryonic-specific repression of alternative exons. As PTBP2 expression decreases from its highest levels in the embryonic brain to moderate levels during postnatal development, a cohort of exons switches from being skipped in embryos to displaying enhanced inclusion in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Licatalosi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, sequential downregulation of PTBP1 followed by PTBP2 contributes to the activation of neural exon networks at the appropriate stages of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). AS of the <italic>DLG4</italic> transcript, which encodes the excitatory postsynaptic protein PSD95, is an example of the relevance of the PTBP1/2 switch in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng, 2016</xref>). Skipping of exon 18 in <italic>DLG4</italic> transcripts causes premature translation termination and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). The controlled induction of this exon during neuronal development is essential to ensure the timing of synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). This exon may also be dynamically regulated in mature neuronal circuits to adapt PSD95 expression to the requirements of synaptic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lopez Soto et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>PTBP1 and PTBP2 are 74% identical in amino acid sequence and have a similar domain organization of four RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) connected by three linker regions. Although primarily characterized as repressive splicing regulators, they can also activate some splice sites as a function of binding position relative to regulated exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corrionero and Valcárcel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Llorian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xue et al., 2009</xref>). It has been shown that PTBP1/2 RRM2, along with the following linker sequence, is sufficient for splicing repressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robinson and Smith, 2006</xref>). RRM2 can interact with both RNA via its canonical β-sheet surface, and with other co-regulators such as Matrin3, Raver1, and hnRNPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Tyr247 of PTBP1 (PTBP2 Tyr244) within RRM2 is particularly critical for co-regulatory protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rideau et al., 2006</xref>). Regarding the regulation of PTBP proteins, different phosphate modifications are located in the unstructured regions, including the N-terminal, Linker 1, and Linker 2 regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pina et al., 2018</xref>). To date, the kinases involved are still under investigation as well as the role of these post-translational modifications in controlling PTBPs splicing activity.</p><p>KIS (encoded by the gene <italic>UHMK1</italic>) was first identified as a <underline>K</underline>inase that <underline>I</underline>nteracts with <underline>S</underline>tathmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maucuer et al., 1997</xref>), a phosphoprotein that controls microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2006</xref>). Curiously, KIS is the only known protein kinase that possesses a U2AF homology motif (UHM), an atypical RRM that has lost its RNA-binding ability, but mediates protein–protein interactions at the C-terminal region of KIS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corsini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kielkopf et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manceau et al., 2008</xref>). This motif shares 42% sequence similarity with U2AF65, a 65-kDa subunit of the splicing factor U2AF, suggesting that KIS could be involved in splicing-related processes. Various lines of evidence support the function of KIS in the modulation of gene expression at different levels such as transcription, splicing, mRNA stability, and protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arfelli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manceau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pedraza et al., 2014</xref>). Although KIS is ubiquitously expressed, higher levels are detected in the nervous system, and KIS protein is gradually upregulated during postnatal development, reaching its highest level in the mature brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bièche et al., 2003</xref>). In mature neurons, KIS has been implicated in dendritic spine morphogenesis and synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pedraza et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here, we find that KIS kinase is involved in the control of alternative exon usage, a key mechanism for promoting functional gene expression patterns during neuronal differentiation. We show that AS regulators are the main phosphorylation targets of this UHM-containing kinase. Notably, we find that PTBP2, an essential AS factor for neuronal maturation, is the major phosphotarget of KIS. We demonstrate that phosphorylation by KIS dissociates PTBP2 protein complexes affecting their ability to bind RNA and therefore inhibiting PTBP2 activity. Furthermore, KIS counteracts PTBP2-mediated inhibition of dendritic spine maturation in a phosphosite-dependent manner, and downregulation of KIS partly rescues the negative effects caused by decreasing PTBP2 levels on spine maturation. Taken together, our data point to the notion that KIS phosphorylation counteracts PTBP2 activity and, in this way, alters the expression patterns of gene isoforms involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KIS kinase regulates exon usage during neuronal differentiation</title><p>KIS contains a UHM domain frequently found in splicing regulatory proteins, and a GFP–KIS fusion accumulates in nuclear substructures adjacent to those formed by splicing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Prompted by its role in proper expression of key postsynaptic proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pedraza et al., 2014</xref>), we decided to analyze genome-wide exon usage during neuronal differentiation in vitro. First, immature neurons from mouse primary cortical neurons of 7 days in vitro (DIV) were compared with mature neurons from 18 DIV cultures when expression of <italic>UHMK1</italic>, the gene coding for KIS, reached maximal levels in cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Second, cortical neurons were infected at 7 DIV with a lentiviral construct co-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an shRNA targeted against <italic>UHMK1</italic> (shKIS) and collected at 18 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Total RNA was purified from triplicate samples for deep sequencing analysis. When compared to control (shCtrl), shKIS-infected cells displayed a fivefold reduction in <italic>UHMK1</italic> mRNA levels, similar to that at onset of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Our analysis revealed that the impact of KIS on exon usage affected both exon inclusion and skipping, although with a clear bias toward exon inclusion 6.3% vs 2% skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, genes containing more than one exon with at least a twofold change coded for proteins significantly enriched in the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), including two important activators of neurite outgrowth, CAMSAP1, and NCAM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that KIS promotes exon inclusion in genes related to neuronal differentiation, especially genes encoding synaptic proteins. Supporting this notion, the top 100 exons upregulated by KIS, that is downregulated by KIS knockdown, were strongly enriched among those increasingly used by cortical neurons from 7 to 18 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Among a total of 8457 exons that displayed low variability (Fano factor &lt;5 × 10<sup>−4</sup>) within the KIS knockdown triplicate samples, 1141 and 1106 exons were found significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively, by KIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In addition, 28.0% of exons upregulated by KIS were also upregulated during differentiation, whereas only 18.8% decreased their usage from 7 to 18 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The opposite behavior was observed for exons downregulated by KIS in which 14.3% and 24.8% increased or decreased their usage during differentiation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, whereas genes containing KIS-downregulated exons did not retrieve specific gene ontology (GO) terms, exons upregulated by KIS encoded a higher percentage of protein disorder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and were found in genes preferentially coding for RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), key factors of RNA granule formation and transport along neurites. Overall, our data link KIS to the control of exon usage in cortical neurons and suggest a pivotal role of this UHM-containing kinase as a regulator of AS during neuronal differentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KIS promotes the inclusion of exons upregulated during neuronal differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of endogenous speckle marker SRRM2 (magenta) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (bue) in HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-KIS (green).

Our RNA-seq analysis showed that KIS knockdown did not affect transcript levels of splicing regulators whose expression underwent changes during cortical neurons differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the KIS phosphoproteome could reveal the mechanism by which KIS regulates exon usage. For this, we analyzed phosphorylation changes in the proteome of HEK 293T cells expressing KIS and KIS<sup>K54A</sup>, a point mutant without kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maucuer et al., 1997</xref>).

PTBP2 is considered one of the pivotal splicing regulators in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Keppetipola et al., 2012</xref>) and, strikingly, phosphorylation at serine 308 of PTBP2 is among the top phosphosites in our KIS phosphoproteome (log<sub>2</sub>FC = 2.36). Furthermore, the kinase assay confirmed that among the three KIS serine targets on PTBP2 (Ser178, Ser308, and Ser434), Ser308 is key for PTBP2 phosphorylation by KIS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

Thus, we decided to analyze the effects of PTBP2 and KIS on PSD95 endogenous levels in hippocampal neurons.

Together, these results suggest that the phosphorylation state of PTBP2 strongly modulates its role on PSD95 expression. To test the effects of KIS on PTBP2 in this scenario, we co-transfected phosphorylation variants of KIS and PTBP2. First, KIS rescued the negative effects of PTBP2 on PSD95 expression levels. Second, this rescue was dependent on the kinase activity of KIS since co-transfection of PTBP2 with the inactive KIS<sup>K54A</sup> mutant did not increase PSD95 expression. Finally, KIS did not rescue PSD95 levels when co-transfected with the phospho-null 3SA mutant of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

These two groups of exons upregulated by KIS belong to genes associated with calcium ion activity but with different specific functions. Genes with exons downregulated by PTBP2 are more enriched in transmembrane transfer of a calcium ion from intracellular stores whereas genes with exons upregulated by PTBP2 facilitate the diffusion of calcium ions through the postsynaptic membrane.

It is well known that PTBPs proteins are able to bind to different proteins acting synergistically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and, in some cases, modify its specificity for some mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coelho et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, in the present study we have shown that key PTBP2 interactors are also KIS phosphotargets. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the association between PTBP2 and its co-regulators could be modulated as a result of phosphorylation by KIS. To assess interactions in vivo, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-PTBP2 and HA-KIS or KIS<sup>K54A</sup>, and endogenous levels of MATR3 and hnRNPM proteins were analyzed in FLAG immunoprecipitates. Co-transfection with KIS resulted in a significant decrease in PTBP2 binding to MATR3 and hnRNPM. In contrast, this decrease did not occur when the K54A mutant was co-transfected, indicating that the kinase activity of KIS is required to cause dissociation of protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Similar results were obtained in binding assays in vitro, in which purified KIS forms were added to FLAG-PTBP2 immunoprecipitates, evidencing a direct participation of KIS in the dissociation of PTBP2–MATR3–hnRNPM complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). in our experiments co-expressing KIS and PTBP2 in HEK293 cells we did not observe any reduction in splicing factor levels.

Interestingly, AlphaFold2 predicts important structural alterations in the phosphomimetic S178D and triple 3SD mutants particularly affecting RRM2, which has been shown to function as the minimal splicing repressor domain of PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Robinson and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation by KIS compromises PTBP2 RNA-binding ability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PTBP1 and PTBP2 CLIPs were performed in HEK293T cells expressing FLAG-PTBP1 and FLAG-PTBPs proteins.

Among the broad tissue types present in metazoans, the nervous system contains some of the highest levels of AS. AS controls multiple steps of neuronal development and plasticity and is a causal agent of pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Furlanis and Scheiffele, 2018</xref>). We had previously found that KIS is required for the proper expression of postsynaptic proteins at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cambray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pedraza et al., 2014</xref>) and here we show that KIS plays a key additional role in the regulation of AS, pointing to the existence of concerted mechanisms to fine tune postsynaptic protein expression during neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis.</p><p>Although many documented examples of AS regulation exist, much remains to be understood about the control of specific splicing regulators originating tissue and neuron subtype-specific splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raj and Blencowe, 2015</xref>). In the present study, we show that phosphorylation by KIS counteracts the activity of the splicing regulator PTBP2 and, as a consequence, controls gene isoform expression during neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Splicing site recognition and pre-mRNA splicing are dynamic processes involving constant rearrangement of ribonuclear proteins on the pre-mRNA being processed. Splicing regulatory proteins contain RNA-binding and protein–protein interaction domains. They bind with low specificity to mostly single-stranded parts of the pre-mRNA. To overcome the low RNA-binding specificity, splicing regulatory proteins use their protein interaction domains to bind to each other. Most splicing factors are post-translationally modified, phosphorylation being an important contributor to the splicing code that governs the fate of a pre-mRNA. Among the best studied classes of splicing proteins regulated by phosphorylation are the SR proteins (serine-/arginine-rich splicing factors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stamm, 2008</xref>). For example, phosphorylation of the SR protein SF2/ASF increases its binding to U1 snRNP and decreases its binding to the RNA export factor TAP/NXF1. Moreover, the ability of its arginine/serine domain (RS) to bind to RNA also depends on its phosphorylation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). The RS domain is highly disordered and switches to a compact, partly ordered arched shape upon phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thapar, 2015</xref>). Bioinformatics studies have shown that phosphorylation of intrinsically disordered regions occurs more frequently than in folded domains. This could be due to their increased flexibility and therefore improved kinase accessibility. In accordance with this idea, recombinant PTBP1 and PTBP2 under in vitro splicing conditions present different phosphate modifications located in the unstructured N-terminal and linker regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pina et al., 2018</xref>). Although the underlying structural mechanism is not clear, the presence of a phosphoryl group introduces electrostatic charges that can affect the structural stability of binding regions or their ability to interact with RNA or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newcombe et al., 2022</xref>). Supporting this idea, we show that the phosphorylation of PTBP2 linker regions by KIS dissociates both protein–protein and protein–RNA interactions in the PTBP2 complex. Interestingly, AlphaFold2 predicts that a mutation mimicking Ser178 phosphorylation, located at the end of linker 1, would produce major structural changes in the RRM2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This domain is of particular relevance for the interaction with RNA and splicing co-regulators, such as Matrin3, Raver1, or hnRNPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>). Within the RRM2 domain, Tyr244 is particularly critical for these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joshi et al., 2011</xref>). The AlphaFold2 prediction shows that a phosphomimetic mutation in Ser178 completely changes the spatial orientation of this Tyr244. AlphaFold2 is not yet reliable enough to predict structures with posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation, methylation, and phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertoline et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, we cannot rule out that phosphorylation of other residues (Ser308 and Ser434) causes important structural alterations in PTBP2. In particular, AlphaFold2 fails when the modifications lie within unstructured regions, as is the case of Ser308 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakravarty and Porter, 2022</xref>). The UHM acts as a protein–protein interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kielkopf et al., 2004</xref>) recognizing short peptides called UHM-ligand motifs (ULM). However, among the KIS phosphotargets identified by us, only SUGP1 contained clear ULM candidates (KRKRKSRW385 and KMGW573K). The absence of ULM in PTBP2, Matrin3, and hnRNPM would indicate that phosphorylation is not mediated by stable protein–protein interactions.</p><p>It is worth pointing out that Ser178 and Ser434 are also present in PTPB1, suggesting that phosphorylation of PTBP1 by KIS may have a role in tumorigenesis. In gastric cancer, KIS upregulation promotes growth and migration, indicating that KIS functions as an oncoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2020</xref>). In hepatocellular cancer, KIS stimulates the expression of specific cell cycle regulation genes. Furthermore, the KIS interactome in liver cancer cells revealed a significant enrichment of potential KIS interactors in mRNA splicing, including hnRNPM and PTBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wei et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, KIS has been associated with the epithelial–mesenchyme transition by phosphoproteomic and RNA-seq analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arfelli et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, in a non-neuronal context, it is plausible that phosphorylation by KIS modulates the capacity of PTBP1 to interact with RNA and co-regulatory proteins to control cell proliferation. One of the new PTBP1 interactors is SUGP2 (SURP and G-patch domain containing 2), which shares high homology with SUGP1. SUGP2 has been shown to interact with the RRM2 region of PTBP1 in HeLa nuclear extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coelho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coelho et al., 2015</xref>), and SUGP1 interacts and is phosphorylated by KIS in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arfelli et al., 2023</xref>). It is worth mentioning that SUGP1 is one of the most enriched proteins in our KIS phosphoproteome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It forms part of the spliceosome complex, interacts with the general splicing factor U2AF2 and has been reported to play an important role in branch-site recognition by its association with SF3B1. Altered levels of SUGP1 have been found in a large number of uveal melanoma and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In the future, it would be interesting to explore whether phosphorylation by KIS interferes with SUGP–PTBP interactions and the functional relevance of this mechanism in cancer and neurogenesis.</p><p>The PTBP family represents one of the most salient regulators of splicing in neurogenesis. Sequential changes in the expression of PTBP1 and PTBP2 allow for the establishment of distinct splicing regulatory patterns during neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher and Feng, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zheng, 2016</xref>). PTBP2 expression decreases during the first postnatal week of brain development, maintaining a moderate level in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fisher and Feng, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, our RNA-seq analysis showed significant PTBP2 expression in cortical neurons at 18 DIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Strikingly, PTBP1 knockdown stimulates PTBP2 expression and is sufficient to induce neuronal differentiation of fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xue et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, PTBP2 depletion in developing mouse cortex causes degeneration of this tissue over the first three postnatal weeks, a time when the normal cortex expands and develops mature circuits. Cultured <italic>PTBP2</italic><sup>−/−</sup> neurons fail to mature and start to die after 2 weeks in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). However, despite all these data on the physiological relevance of PTBP2 in neurogenesis, the role of this splicing regulator in differentiated neurons and how its activity is regulated were not understood. Regarding neuronal differentiation, it is worth noting that KIS expression increases during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bièche et al., 2003</xref>) and in vitro differentiation of hippocampal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), coinciding with postnatal decrease of PTBP2 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of PTPB2 by KIS and the concerted relative inversion in their levels would generate a molecular switch linking transcriptional and alternative exon usage programs in neuronal development.</p><p>In mature neurons, AS has a well-established role in expanding proteome diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauger and Scheiffele, 2017</xref>). Although the connection between synaptic activity and the control of KIS expression and/or kinase activity is not yet established, the contraposition of PTBP2 and KIS in splicing may constitute a fine-tuning mechanism to modulate proteome diversity as a function of plasticity-inducing signals. In this regard, single-cell transcriptomic data from hippocampal neurons show that expression variability of KIS and PTBP2 is much higher compared to actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, differences in the expression of these two splicing regulators at a single neuron level would increase protein isoform variability and expand diversity in neural circuits, a crucial property in information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miller et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the National Research Council of Spain (approval number: B9900083). We have used hippocampal neurons for imaging experiments in which it is important to have isolated mature neurons with well-defined dendritic spines, whereas cortical neuron cultures have been used for biochemical experiments where a larger amount of material is required. Hippocampi and cortex were dissected from E17.5 embryos of Swiss mice (undetermined sex) in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 0.6% glucose and 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethane sulfonic acid (HEPES). After dissection, tissues were trypsinized (Fisher, 15090046) in HBSS at 37°C for 15 min. Enzymatic digestion was stopped by washing the tissue three times with Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM; Fisher, 31095029) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 0.6% glucose.

They uncover that KIS regulates isoform selection of genes involved in neuronal differentiation and inhibits through phosphorylation the capacity of the splicing regulator PTB2 to interact with both target RNAs and protein partners.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>– This is a very clear and well-written manuscript presenting high-quality and carefully controlled experimental results. The authors used an impressive range of approaches (transcriptome-wide exon usage, phospho-proteomic, imaging, biochemical assays..) to profile exon usage alterations upon KIS knock down and provide a mechanistic understanding of how KIS regulate the splicing activity of PTBP2. Specifically, they convincingly demonstrate that the phosphorylation of PTBP2 by KIS leads to both dismantling of PTBP2 protein complexes and impaired RNA binding.</p><p>My only main concerns relate to the understanding of the biological context in which the mechanism studied may be at play. That KIS can counteract PTB2 activity through direct phosphorylation has been very clearly shown by the authors using overexpression of KIS and /or PTB constructs in different contexts (HEK293T cells, N2A cell line, hippocampal neurons). Whether this occurs endogenously in the context of neuronal differentiation, and how much this contributes to the overall phenotypes induced by KIS inactivation, is less clear. While fully investigating the interplay between KIS and PTB2 in the context of neuronal differentiation is beyond the scope of this study, the three following points could be addressed to provide some evidence in this direction.</p><p>1. Building on the experiments they perform in a KIS knock-down context (e.g. Figure 3B, or previously described spine phenotype), the authors should investigate whether inhibiting PTBP2 in this context (through shRNA or expression of a phospho-mimetic construct) might suppress the phenotypes observed when inactivating KIS.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added a new Results section showing the effects on spine maturation in hippocampal neurons expressing PTBP2 phosphomutants and in a PTBP2-KIS double knockdown scenario (Figure 4; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Results section: P6 L15-P7 L26). First, PTBP2-overexpression effects on post-synaptic protrusion density are exacerbated by the phosphoablated mutant. Intriguingly, the phosphomimetic mutant still has a negative impact in spine formation, suggesting either a residual ability of this protein to interact with its normal partners or the existence of additional roles of PTBP2 in spine development that are Matrin3 and hnRNPM independent. Second, KIS knockdown partially suppresses the defects in mature spine formation produced by the loss of PTBP2. In all, these data support the notion of KIS being a phosphorylation-mediated inhibitor of PTBP2 activity during neuronal differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Based on Figures 1E and 3A, it seems that KIS downregulation affects both exon inclusion and exon skipping, and that its function in exon usage is only partly explained by modulation of PTBP2-dependent exons. Have the authors analyzed the populations of PTBP2-dependent exons that are regulated by KIS in an opposite manner? This may point to specific classes of transcripts (in terms of expression pattern, function, molecular signature) important in the context of endogenous neuronal differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the GO terms of genes with KIS-upregulated exons by that are either downregulated or upregulated by PTBP2. In both groups we found an enrichment of genes in terms associated with calcium ion activity but with different specific functions. Genes with exons downregulated by PTBP2 are more involved in transmembrane transfer of calcium ions from intracellular stores whereas genes with exons upregulated by PTBP2 facilitate the diffusion of calcium ions through transmembrane postsynaptic. Interestingly, with respect to the cytoskeleton, the two groups show a clearly different term enrichment. Genes with exons downregulated by PTBP2 are significantly associated with the tubulin cytoskeleton, whereas genes with exons upregulated by PTBP2 are associated with the actin cytoskeleton. We have added a paragraph in the Results section (P8 L11-21) and a new panel in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should better discuss when and where they think PTBP2 phosphorylation by KIS might be relevant.

Therefore, the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of PTPB2 by KIS and the concerted relative inversion in their levels would generate a molecular switch linking transcriptional and alternative exon usage programs in neuronal development (Figure 6D).</p><p>In mature neurons, alternative splicing has a well-established role in expanding proteome diversity (Mauger &amp; Scheiffele, 2017). Although the connection between synaptic activity and the control of KIS expression and/or kinase activity is not yet established, the contraposition of PTBP2 and KIS in splicing may constitute a fine-tuning mechanism to modulate proteome diversity as a function of plasticity-inducing signals. In this regard, single-cell transcriptomic data from hippocampal neurons show that expression variability of KIS and PTBP2 is much higher compared to actin (Perez et al., 2021) (Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). Thus, differences in the expression of these two splicing regulators at a single neuron level would increase protein isoform variability and expand diversity in neural circuits, a crucial property in information processing (Miller et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>1.

As a consequence, PTBP2 activity is down-regulated. Using cultured primary immature neurons they show that KIS expression increases during differentiation and that shRNA knockdown of KIS alters the splicing of many alternative exons. Phosphoproteomic analysis of HEK293 cells transfected with KIS or a kinase dead mutant (K545A) show that it phosphorylates both PTBP2 as well as a cluster of proteins that are known to interact with PTBP2 or its paralog PTBP1. By comparing the new data on KIS-dependent splicing with previous data-sets on PTBP2-dependent splicing targets they show that KIS appears to act antagonistically with PTBP2 when it acts as a repressive regulator, but not when it is an activator. Using combinations of wt and kinase-dead KIS with PTBP2 mutants in the 3 main phosphorylation sites (3SA – non-phosphorylatable, S3D – phosphomimetic) to look at the effects on a known PTBP2 functional target, PSD95, they show that the likely effect of KIS is to antagonise PTBP2 function by phosphorylation at one or more of three residues (S178, S308, S434). Finally, they show that transfected KIS (but not K54A) reduces known protein-protein interactions of PTBP2 and that the triple phosphomimetic PTBP2 mutant shows reduced binding to RNA. Alphafold2 predictions show that the S178 phosphomimetic mutant might alter the conformation of the RRM2 domain, in particular altering the environment of Y244, which has been shown in PTBP1 to be critical for interaction with MATR3 and other coregulators.</p><p>Major points</p><p>In general, the conclusions drawn are consistent with the data. I have a few suggestions where the authors could either extend their findings with a few straightforward additional experiments, or clarify some of the existing data.</p></disp-quote><p>FigEV4 (also introductory text on p3): RRMs 3 and 4 of PTBP1/2/3 fold as a single back to back packed didomain – with the so-called linker contributing to the didomain fold (e.g. PMID: 24688880, PMID: 16179478) and also extending the RNA binding surface by creating a positive patch (e.g. PMID:20160105 PMID: 24957602). AlphaFold successfully predicts the didomain in full length PTBP2 (https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A7I2RVZ4). The authors should therefore use AlphaFold2 to predict the RRM3-4 di-domain structure of wt and phosphomimetic mutant PTBP2s. Phosphorylation of S434 or S434D, which is on the C-terminal end of RRM3 may have no predicted effect on RRM3 alone (FigEV4), but it could conceivably disrupt didomain packing, which could itself have important knock-on consequences for RNA binding. In addition, the inrtoduction of negative charges at S434 might affect the ability of R438, K440 &amp; K441 to interact with RNA. An image of the didomain charge density of WT and mutant PTBP2 would be useful to address this.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have considered the di-domain structure of RRM3 and RRM4, and AlphaFold2 predicted no effects by the phosphomimetic residues. We have added the di-domain predictions to Figure 6—figure supplement 1B.</p><p>S434 lies at the very end of RRM3 and limits with a basic region that would not bind RNA in a canonical RRM-dependent manner. In addition, as predicted by AlphaFold2, this basic region is not structured and the effects of a nearby negative charge may be difficult to predict.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 could also easily go further in experimentally testing the effects of individual phosphomimetic mutations upon protein-protein interactions (Alphafold predicts that S178D, but not S308 or S434D, should affect Y244 mediated interactions, such as MATR3). The co-IP approach in Figure 4A could readily be used with FLAG-PTBP2 mutants. Likewise, consequences of individual mutations upon RNA binding (Figure 4D) could be tested. The use of a Y244N mutant here would test whether the loss of RNA binding is a consequence of the loss of protein-protein interactions. Such experiments are not essential, but they are readily carried out and have the potential to unravel the consequences of the individual phosphorylation events (more correctly of phosphomimetic mutants).</p></disp-quote><p>After building the Y244N mutant we tested PTBP2 interactions with protein partners and observed no significant changes in the levels of Matrin3 and hnRNPM proteins in FLAG-PTBP2 immunoprecipitates nor in the RNA binding ability of PTBP2. These data suggest that, although Y244 is involved in the interaction between PTBP1 and PRI-containing proteins such as Raver1, the interaction between Matrin3 and PTBP2 would involve structural determinants other than the Matrin3 PRI and the PTPB2 Y244 residue. Compared to PTBP1, the nearby flexible loop between RRM2 and RRM3 in PTBP2 is very different and could accommodate specific interaction determinants with Matrin3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>Do KIS regulated exons show enrichment of motifs associated with PTBP2, consistent with the proposed model – particularly CU-rich motifs upstream of exons that are more repressed upon KIS shRNA treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not observed a significant enrichment of CU-rich sequences upstream of the top 100 exons upregulated by KIS.
