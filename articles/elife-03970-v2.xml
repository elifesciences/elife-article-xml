Clathrin-coated pits are well defined, but the identity, mechanism and function of alternative pathways have been controversial. Here we apply universal chemical labelling of plasma membrane proteins to define all primary endocytic vesicles, and labelling of specific proteins with a reducible SNAP-tag substrate. These approaches provide high temporal resolution and stringent discrimination between surface-connected and intracellular membranes. We find that at least 95% of the earliest detectable endocytic vesicles arise from clathrin-coated pits. GPI-anchored proteins, candidate cargoes for alternate pathways, are also found to enter the cell predominantly via coated pits. Experiments employing a mutated clathrin adaptor reveal distinct mechanisms for sorting into coated pits, and thereby explain differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins. These data call for a revision of models for the activity and diversity of endocytic pathways in mammalian cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03970.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03970.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03970.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are enclosed by a ‘plasma membrane’ that allows nutrients and certain small molecules to move in and out of cells. Larger molecules—such as proteins—are carried into cells through a process known as endocytosis, where part of the plasma membrane engulfs the molecule and transports it through the cell inside a bubble-like compartment called a vesicle.</p><p>There may be several different ways by which endocytosis can occur. The most common method involves a protein known as clathrin, which coats part of the plasma membrane on the side facing the inside of the cell. This causes the membrane to deform into a pit. The pit grows around, and eventually completely surrounds, the molecule to be transported, at which point the clathrin-coated membrane pinches off from the rest of the plasma membrane to form a vesicle.</p><p>Other forms of endocytosis do not need clathrin to form vesicles, and so are collectively known as clathrin-independent endocytosis. However, the details of how these other types of endocytosis work and how important they are for moving molecules into the cell remain unclear. This is partly because it is difficult to identify particular types of endocytosis. Previous attempts to do this have involved trying to identify molecules that are specifically and solely associated with that type of endocytosis, and using these to track the vesicle. However, few—if any—such molecules are known for clathrin-independent methods of endocytosis. Another approach is to inhibit the formation of clathrin-coated pits and study those molecules that are still taken into cells. The problem here is that incomplete inhibition can make interpreting the results difficult. Furthermore, complete inhibition of an important process like clathrin-dependent endocytosis is likely to have severe effects on many other aspects of cell function.</p><p>Bitsikas et al. have developed a new method that allows a vesicle to be identified—regardless of how it forms—in cells that have not been treated with inhibitors. This method involves labelling proteins in the plasma membrane with a chemical that allows them to be traced, and so shows when they are included in vesicle membranes. Importantly, this new method can provide very accurate information as to whether or not proteins have been included in vesicles, and this may provide advantages over previous approaches.</p><p>Bitsikas et al. selected a group of proteins that are thought to only enter cells in a clathrin-independent manner, but unexpectedly found that these proteins predominantly enter cells through clathrin-coated vesicles. Further analysis revealed that approximately 95% of all molecules that enter cells by endocytosis are taken up via clathrin-coated endocytosis. Therefore, clathrin-independent endocytosis does not make a significant contribution to the transport of large molecules into cells.</p><p>These results are at odds with current thinking in the field. Future work could reveal whether the techniques applied by Bitsikas et al. detect more active clathrin-independent endocytosis in special situations, for example during cell migration, or in specific cell types.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03970.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03970.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>clathrin</kwd><kwd>vesicle</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bitsikas</surname><given-names>Vassilis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nichols</surname><given-names>Benjamin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chemical labelling of all primary endocytic vesicles allows the contribution of different endocytic mechanisms to the total endocytic uptake in cultured mammalian cells to be quantified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endocytosis has central roles in many cell biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45a">Le Roy and Wrana, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Since the mid-nineties evidence has accumulated to suggest that mammalian cells utilise additional endocytic mechanisms beyond clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sandvig and van Deurs, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sandvig et al., 2008</xref>). Whilst the molecular detail of how clathrin-coated pits work is understood in ever-increasing detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>), similarly complete mechanistic descriptions of how endocytosis may take place outside of clathrin-coated pits are lacking.</p><p>One central difficulty in defining clathrin-independent endocytic pathways has been the paucity of rigorously validated endocytic markers and pathway-specific cargoes. Dissection of clathrin-mediated endocytosis benefited greatly from signature cargoes such as the transferrin receptor, which are efficiently concentrated in the forming endocytic vesicle, and from the fact that the forming vesicle is marked specifically in space and time by transient assemblies of clathrin, adaptors and associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pearse, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dautry-Varsat et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doxsey et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehrlich et al., 2004</xref>). By contrast, clathrin independent endocytosis has largely been defined by morphological criteria, and by the persistent uptake of cargoes that may utilise multiple pathways following perturbation of the clathrin machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saslowsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Endocytic structures that can be defined morphologically include macropinosomes, which can readily be resolved by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liberali et al., 2008</xref>), and caveolae which are distinctive in electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>). The extent to which caveolae are involved in endocytosis is, however, controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Parton and Howes, 2010</xref>). Morphology also forms a large part of the definition of more recently characterised endocytic membranes termed CLICs, for clathrin-independent carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkham et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Howes et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>GPI-anchored proteins have been extensively studied as potential cargoes for clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayor and Pagano, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannes and Mayor, 2010</xref>). The apparent presence of these proteins in endosomes devoid of transferrin, and uptake in the presence of inhibitors of clathrin-coated pits, provides evidence for GPI-enriched endosomal compartments (GEECs) that are fed from the cell surface independently from coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumari and Mayor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhagatji et al., 2009</xref>). It is not clear, however, that GPI-anchored proteins are ever highly concentrated in nascent endocytic vesicles in a manner analogous to transferrin receptor, so they may enter the cell via multiple mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mayor and Riezman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhagatji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannes and Mayor, 2010</xref>). The extent to which other types of cargo associated with clathrin-independent endocytosis, including glycosphingolipid-binding bacterial toxins as well as various viruses, are efficiently sorted during uptake is similarly unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Romer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ewers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannes and Mayor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saslowsky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lakshminarayan et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of demonstrably specific cargoes, much of the literature on clathrin-independent endocytosis relies on the use of overexpressed mutant proteins to perturb clathrin function, and observation of differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and potential clathrin-independent cargoes. Dominant negative mutants used in this manner include the C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of AP180/CALM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford et al., 2001</xref>), and the K44A mutant of dynamin, which renders this GTPase involved in the scission of clathrin coated pits enzymatically inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Bliek et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damke et al., 1995</xref>). Additionally, differential effects on endocytosis can be observed using overexpression of inactive forms of small GTPases such as ARF6, ARF1 or cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Souza-Schorey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Palacios et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naslavsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumari and Mayor, 2008</xref>). Blocking one type of endocytosis may up-regulate alternative mechanisms, over-expression of mutant proteins may induce non-physiological cellular responses, and small GTPases may, via different sets of effectors, directly or indirectly control the activity of multiple endocytic pathways. Plainly, these types of experiment need to be interpreted carefully.</p><p>Ideally, different types of endocytosis would be defined by the presence of specific molecular determinants analogous to clathrin or adaptor proteins in the case of clathrin coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>). Candidates for such determinants include caveolin and cavin proteins which make caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Parton and del Pozo, 2013</xref>), flotillin proteins which define specific plasma membrane microdomains potentially involved in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glebov et al., 2006</xref>), and the protein GRAF1 that may be important for the formation of CLIC/GEEC endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lundmark et al., 2008</xref>). The precise mechanisms by which these proteins are involved in endocytosis remain to be fully understood. Both flotillins and caveolins plus cavins form protein assemblies that are stable over time, and thus can not define endocytic events temporally in the way in which coordinated assembly and disassembly of the clathrin machinery can (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glebov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gambin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ludwig et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Thus, although several non-clathrin endocytic pathways have garnered varying degrees of supportive evidence, none has been unambiguously established in molecular and functional terms. Furthermore, the relative contributions of the multiple putative pathways to overall endocytic flux has been unclear. To resolve some of these uncertainties, ideally one would require a means to examine endocytosis in unperturbed cells in a global manner. This would allow simultaneous evaluation of a large number of cargoes and their relationship with clathrin and putative non-clathrin markers. In this study we apply a combination of new and established methods that satisfy these requirements, and thereby provide a systematic and quantitative analysis of total endocytic protein flux in cultured mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental strategy and assay validation</title><p>We sought to establish endocytic assays and protein labelling strategies to satisfy four main requirements: (1) achieve very high topological specificity in discrimination between endocytosed and extracellular protein, (2) provide a means to analyse all, or nearly all, surface proteins simultaneously, (3) provide high signal to noise, and thereby high temporal resolution for detection of primary endocytic vesicles, and (4) allow a means to follow uptake of specific cargoes.</p><p>Biotinylation of extracellular free amine groups with the small, monovalent label sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin offered a way to satisfy the first three of these requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Le Bivic et al., 1990</xref>). The biotin moiety can be removed from labelled proteins by reduction of the disulfide bond with membrane-impermeant sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNa) at 4°C, so this approach provides a powerful way to detect internalisation of surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bretscher and Lutter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid and Smythe, 1991</xref>). We assessed the efficiency of MESNa treatment in removing biotin from sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin-labelled proteins, and compared this with two widely used alternatives, washing at low pH to remove antibodies bound to the outside of the cell and cleavage of extracellular GPI-anchors with PI-PLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>). MESNa treatment could remove over 99.9% of biotin from cells labelled at 4°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Washes at pH3 to remove bound antibody, or PI-PLC to cleave GPI-anchors, were around two orders of magnitude less efficient, removing up to 50% and 90% of antibody bound to the GPI-anchored protein CD59 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davies et al., 1989</xref>). Reducible biotin and MESNa therefore offer a highly accurate way of assaying protein internalisation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03970.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental strategy and assay validation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Following surface biotinylation with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, HeLa cell lysate was serially diluted with non-biotinylated control cell lysate, and the amount of labelling was detected using streptavidin-HRP after SDS-PAGE and blotting.

Control experiments comparing incubation at 4°C with incubation for defined periods at 37°C confirmed that there was no specific signal detected unless internalisation at 37°C was allowed to take place (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Nevertheless, a wide range of rare proteins (some with estimated copy number &lt; 100 per cell) was detected, assuring us that we achieved good coverage of the total plasma membrane protein complement.

Therefore chemical labelling with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin does indeed provide a way to follow endocytosis of nearly all plasma membrane proteins simultaneously.</p><p>Reduction of extracellular disulphide bonds with membrane impermeant reducing agents like MESNa evidently provides a good way to discriminate between intra- and extra-cellular substrates. We used the genetically encoded SNAP-tag to apply this approach to specific cargo proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gautier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cole and Donaldson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Correa, 2014</xref>). The SNAP moiety was labelled with a new membrane-impermeant, reducible, fluorescent SNAP-labelling reagent, benzylguanine-SS-fluorophore [where the fluorophore can be either atto-488 (BG-SS-488) or BODIPY (BG-SS-549)]. The disulfide bond linking benzylguanine to a fluorophore can be reduced with MESNa in the same way as that in sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin. Control experiments using a minimal GPI-anchored SNAP-tag construct as a model plasma membrane protein showed that BG-SS-fluorophore allows detection of internalised SNAP tag with very high efficiency and low background, and provides an improved way of discriminating between internal and external pools of tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Biotinylated plasma membrane proteins are predominantly internalised via clathrin coated pits</title><p>Global labelling of primary endocytic vesicles was achieved by incubation of cells with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin at 4°C, warming to 37°C by rapid buffer exchange, and allowing uptake for 20 s. Endocytic vesicles detected after MESNa treatment were small puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Approximately 2% of the cells also contained distinctively larger macropinosomes over 500 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to determine the identity of the endocytic vesicles we carried out co-internalisation experiments with the archetypical high-affinity cargo for clathrin-coated pits, transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schmid and Smythe, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 1992</xref>). The great majority of endocytic vesicles contained transferrin, and therefore are likely to have arisen from clathrin-coated pits. Uptake of transferrin was solely due to binding to transferrin receptor, as large, fluid-filled macropinosomes were completely devoid of transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Residual surface-bound transferrin was detected as puncta, and co-localised with clathrin, implying concentration in nascent coated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We used unbiased and semi-automated quantification, involving application of a mask derived from the image of fluorescent transferrin, to determine the proportion of biotin-positive pixels that also contained transferrin in multiple cell images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This revealed that over 95% of the total internalised biotin after 20 s uptake was present in transferrin-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Co-localisation remained constant when times of internalisation up to 150 s were assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, after 20 s uptake over 80% of biotin-positive endocytic vesicles co-localised with clathrin in small puncta, defining them as clathrin-coated vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The proportion co-localising with clathrin fell rapidly with longer periods of uptake, as one would expect due to uncoating of primary vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03970.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Over 95% of total endocytosed protein co-localises with markers for clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal images of co-internalisation of all membrane proteins, labelled at 4°C with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin, and transferrin-546.

This improved signal to noise ratio and thereby improved temporal resolution, but at the same time cooling and rapid warming could have an effect on the endocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boucrot et al., 2010</xref>). We sought to perform the endocytic assay in unperturbed cells, under more physiological conditions, by omitting the pre-incubation step at 4°C. Cells were labelled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and transferrin at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The earliest time after initiation of labelling at which endocytic vesicles could be reliably detected was 90 s, presumably because of the time taken for sufficient reaction of the NHS ester with primary amines at the cell surface. Consistent with the results when labelling was carried out at 4°C, nearly all of the internalised protein labelled with biotin was indeed present in transferrin-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Another concern was that HeLa cells could be in some way atypical, so we repeated the same experiments in Cos7 and RPE cells. Again, there was near-complete co-localisation between endocytosed sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and transferrin after 90 s uptake at 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>In order to verify that transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles are very rare we used a different labelling approach. We loaded HeLa cells with the amphiphilic styryl membrane dye FM1-43FX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diefenbach et al., 1999</xref>), and allowed co-internalisation with transferrin for 90 s at 37°C. Extraction of the dye with label-free medium reversed plasma membrane labelling and provided a means of identifying FM1-43FX-positive intracellular vesicles. Although this may not provide such stringent topological discrimination between intracellular vesicles and surface membrane as the sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin plus MESNa approach, there was a very high degree of co-localisation between FM1-43FX-positive puncta and transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>). Quantification revealed that 90% of the FM1-43FX signal present in intracellular vesicles was also present in transferrin-positive pixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p><p>Confocal z-stacks and volume rendering were used to allow analysis at the level of individual primary endocytic vesicles. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Biotin-positive endocytic vesicles were identified as 3D objects using the Imaris software, and the transferrin cargo load was calculated based on the mean transferrin intensity within each vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). In order to account for background signal generated by experimental noise or random overlap, the transferrin channel was offset by 500 nm from its correct register, and transferrin intensity in the same objects was sampled for a second time. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The 95th percentile of this background intensity distribution was used as a cut-off to define transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Applying this conservative criterion, after 90 s continuous labelling and uptake 96% of 2350 vesicles contained transferrin, and after labelling at 4°C and uptake for 20 s 92% of 2387 vesicles contained transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A single Gaussian curve could describe the transferrin intensity distribution within most identified vesicles, consistent with stochastic incorporation of transferrin receptors into forming clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collinet et al., 2010</xref>). A small population of transferrin-negative objects could be seen as a peak at the lowest end of the intensity distribution, showing that potential transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles, where they exist, can be detected by our method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed no correlation between biotin intensity and the probability of that vesicle not containing transferrin, arguing against the possibility of a morphologically distinctive class of transferrin-negative endocytic vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also carried out experiments to test the possibility that the glycosphingolipid-binding B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTB), which has been extensively used as a marker for clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Henley et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sandvig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kirkham et al., 2005</xref>), induces the formation of transferrin-negative endocytic vesicles. Biotin-positive vesicles were identified as objects in transferrin-labeled cells as described above, with and without addition of CTB.

The simplest hypothesis arising from these observations is that essentially all proteins taken up by the cell are internalised along with transferrin via clathrin-coated pits. If this is the case, then ablation of coated pit activity should effectively block total endocytosis. Overexpression of the C-terminal clathrin-binding domain of AP180/CALM (AP180-C) provides an efficient means of blocking formation of coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ford et al., 2001</xref>). In cells overexpressing AP180-C, transferrin uptake and endocytosis of total biotinylated protein were both efficiently blocked, with total protein uptake being reduced to less than 5% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overexpression of the K44A mutant of dynamin blocks budding of clathrin-coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Bliek et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damke et al., 1995</xref>). In cells overexpressing dynamin 2 K44A there was efficient reduction of both transferrin and total biotinylated protein uptake to less than 5% of control levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Additionally, we noted that expression of very high levels of the dynamin mutant induced endocytosis of total biotinylated protein in both macropinosomes and smaller vesicular structures (see below). We conclude that formation of the primary vesicles that contribute the large majority of endocytic flux in unperturbed cells is blocked by loss of clathrin or dynamin function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Quantitative proteomics shows that perturbation of the formation of coated pits alters the protein composition of the plasma membrane</title><p>If plasma membrane proteins are predominantly endocytosed via clathrin coated pits then one would predict that they should accumulate in the plasma membrane when coated pits are not functional. Proteomic analysis of surface-biotinylated plasma membrane proteins offered a way to test this hypothesis directly. In order to ablate coated pit activity, cells were transfected with siRNA against the alpha adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor AP2 (‘AP2 siRNA’). This blocked alpha-adaptin expression, and hence AP2 function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Motley et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2006</xref>). AP2 siRNA blocked both transferrin uptake and uptake of total biotinylated proteins to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). SILAC (stable isotopic labelling by amino-acids in culture) followed by precipitation of surface biotinylated proteins with streptavidin-agarose provided a quantitative comparison of the relative abundance of plasma membrane proteins in control and AP2 siRNA treated cells. This revealed a clear and pronounced increase in the abundance of most proteins in AP2-siRNA cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Analysis of SILAC ratios of the non-biotinylated cytosolic proteins present in the flow-through provided an internal control and did not reveal similar changes, confirming that the effects of AP2 depletion are largely restricted to the population of plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This is consistent with the majority of plasma membrane proteins entering the cell via clathrin-coated pits.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03970.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Changes in plasma membrane protein composition in cells depleted of AP2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot for the AP2 alpha subunit following non-targeting or alpha adaptin (AP2) siRNA treatment.

We sought to explain this apparent discrepancy. In several of these studies CTB has been used as a marker for clathrin-independent endocytosis. As discussed previously, it was possible that CTB induces clathrin-independent uptake of GPI-anchored proteins. Object-based analysis of the transferrin load within BG-SS-488-positive vesicles in cells expressing SNAP-CD59 argues that this is not the case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>One type of experiment that can be interpreted as evidence for clathrin-independent endocytosis is the presence of endocytosed protein in vesicles separate from those labelled with transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glebov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhagatji et al., 2009</xref>). We did not observe this in the experiments outlined above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), so we chose to pursue this further by conjugating a monoclonal antibody against CD59 to both alexa-546, and to SS-atto-488 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, the disulfide bond in SS-atto-488 can be reduced with MESNa as previously. This meant we could follow uptake of endogenous CD59, and directly compare two different methods of assaying internalisation. Cells were labelled at 4°C with the doubly labelled antibody and transferrin, and then warmed to 37°C for 90 s. Subsequently cells were treated with PI-PLC to cleave GPI-anchors, and then with MESNa. The SS-atto-488 signal co-localised completely with transferrin. Alexa-546, however, was seen in many punctate structures that lack transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We interpret these data as strong evidence that the PI-PLC treatment did not remove all external GPI-anchored protein, while reduction with MESNa provided more stringent discrimination between internal and external pools of the antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, endogenous CD59 is indeed internalised in transferrin-containing vesicles, and apparent internalisation in vesicles lacking transferrin may, at least under the conditions we have employed in this study, be an artifact due to incomplete removal of surface bound antibody.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03970.023</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Clathrin-dependent endocytosis of GPI-anchored proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Doubly labelled anti-CD59-546-SS-488 allows comparison of MESNa reduction and PI-PLC treatment as methods for detecting internalised GPI-anchored protein.

Quantification confirmed specific overlap between internalised biotin and GRAF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The fact that our previous data show that most internalised biotin/total protein co-localises with transferrin made the strong prediction that these GRAF1-positive endosomes should also contain transferrin.

ARF6 showed a similar distribution to GRAF1, labelling transferrin-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). We conclude that GRAF1-GFP and ARF6-GFP are present on transferrin-positive endocytic vesicles likely to have arisen from budding of clathrin-coated pits from the plasma membrane, that flotillin 1 is not detected on early endosomes, and that caveolin 1 is present on a very small fraction of endosomes. All of these observations are consistent with our general conclusion, that at least 95% of endocytosed protein enters the cell via clathrin-coated pits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Distinct sorting mechanisms for transferrin receptor and GPI-anchored proteins lead to divergent effects on entry into coated pits</title><p>Our data argue that GPI-anchored proteins enter the cell via coated pits, but, they behave differently from many other clathrin cargoes when AP2 expression is suppressed over 5 days. There are several factors potentially involved in this effect, such as rates of synthesis, degradation and endocytic recycling of proteins with GPI anchors. We investigated further the factor most relevant to the focus of this study, sorting during endocytosis. The absence of a cytosolic domain means that GPI-anchored proteins are fundamentally different from high-affinity cargoes such as the transferrin receptor, as they can not be recruited to the nascent pit via direct recognition of endocytic sorting motifs by adaptor proteins. It is likely that GPI-anchored proteins are partially excluded from coated pits by steric crowding effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhagatji et al., 2009</xref>). We reasoned that perturbing the recognition of endocytic sorting motifs could therefore cause differential effects on uptake of GPI-anchored proteins and transferrin receptor. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we used siRNA to partially reduce AP2 expression. AP2 recognises two major endocytic motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edeling et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>). We measured transferrin and SNAP-CD59 uptake by flow cytometry, 3 days after siRNA transfection. Cells still endocytosed significant amounts of both cargoes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We compared the ratio between the two cargoes, on a cell by cell basis, for the populations of control and AP2 siRNA transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). AP2 siRNA caused a more pronounced reduction of transferrin than CD59 uptake. Confocal imaging confirmed the flow cytometry results. In cells where AP2 levels were reduced, the reduction in transferrin uptake appeared more severe than reduction in SNAP-CD59 uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Using these imaging data, we correlated the amount of AP2 remaining in each cell with the total fluorescence intensity of internalised transferrin and SNAP-CD59 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). The uptake of both cargoes was efficiently blocked when AP2 levels became close to zero, but transferrin uptake was clearly more sensitive to reduction of AP2 levels than uptake of SNAP-CD59.

Overexpression of this mutant form of μ2 for 4 days resulted in incorporation into endogenous AP2 complexes, and thereby provided a tool to further investigate sorting of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins into coated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overexpression of µ2(F174S/D176A), but not wild-type μ2, caused a dramatic differential effect on the uptake of the two cargoes after 90 s of labelling and internalisation. As predicted, transferrin uptake was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honing et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Motley et al., 2006</xref>). Uptake of SNAP-CD59, however, was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Importantly, this divergence did not arise from separate endocytic structures, as internalised SNAP-CD59 still co-localised well with the residual internalised transferrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Moreover, when 3D object-based analysis was used to identify transferrin-positive vesicles, and to quantify the amount of SNAP-CD59 present in these vesicles, a clear increase in the SNAP-CD59 load in mutant-expressing cells was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This analysis also confirmed the reduced transferrin load in endocytic vesicles in mutant-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). These results are in agreement with our initial hypothesis of distinctive sorting of GPI-anchored proteins into clathrin coated pits. They argue that steric exclusion of GPI-anchored proteins from the nascent pit becomes less acute when recruitment of high-affinity cargoes by AP2, or potentially other adaptors is abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhagatji et al., 2009</xref>). More generally, the data imply that rates of endocytosis of high affinity cargoes may be more susceptible to a range of perturbations of coated pit function than cargoes like GPI-anchored proteins, which have a lower affinity for the nascent pit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>An imaging approach to studying endocytosis in unperturbed cells, where all surface proteins are labelled, is intrinsically easier to interpret than experiments where mutant proteins, siRNA, or chemical inhibitors cause loss of function, and potentially indirect or off-target effects, over days. The use of small, monovalent reducible chemical labels provides high temporal resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and efficiency of topological discrimination between intracellular and extracellular protein. This has allowed us to follow endocytosis of effectively all proteins, and thereby to observe all endocytic intermediates formed by the cell at specific time-points, starting with as little as 20 s of internalisation. Our results are at some variance with previous studies from our own and other laboratories, and with our preconceptions before being confronted with the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the conclusions that the predominant pathway for endocytosis in mammalian cells, accounting for at least 95% of total protein endocytic flux, is uptake via the clathrin-coated pit. Other mechanisms are not likely to make a significant contribution. Primary endocytic vesicles involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis should not contain significant amounts of transferrin receptor, and while we can detect a class of such vesicles they account for less than 5% of total endocytosis. Further data, including perturbations of clathrin-coated pit function, assay of the endocytosis of GPI-anchored proteins, and co-localisation experiments looking at candidate markers for clathrin-independent endocytic pathways are all consistent with this conclusion. A recent systematic analysis of multiple assays for endocytosis using siRNA screens also provides indirect support, in that it reveals extensive functional and regulatory links between uptake of cargoes previously thought to enter the cell via different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liberali et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, this study conspicuously does not detect new linked sets of proteins likely to act together in a concerted fashion to make novel types of endocytic vesicle. Some cargoes for clathrin coated pits have been reported to be present in sub-populations of early endocytic vesicles, most likely through mechanisms related to cargo-dependent recruitment of specific adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakadamyali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mettlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Henry et al., 2012</xref>). However, there is good evidence that transferrin receptor does not behave in this way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lakadamyali et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>), and our analysis of transferrin load in primary endocytic vesicles confirms this. In the light of these observations, it is difficult to reconcile our data with reports of abundant clathrin-independent endocytic carriers or CLICs. We note that the ultrastructure of CLICs, although clearly different from clathrin-generated vesicles, is not dissimilar to that of the early endosomes that receive cargoes taken up via coated pits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harding et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willingham et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruenberg et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ullrich et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Much of the literature on clathrin-independent endocytosis is based on perturbations with differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and putative clathrin-independent cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Puri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sandvig et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen and Nichols, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lakshminarayan et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest a possible re-interpretation of this type of experiment. We demonstrate that GPI-anchored proteins enter mammalian cells via clathrin coated pits, and that this is fully compatible with the differential effects on endocytic uptake between transferrin receptor and GPI-anchored proteins reported here and observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nichols et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sabharanjak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Naslavsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumari and Mayor, 2008</xref>). The coated pit is a crowded environment, and GPI-anchored proteins will have to compete for a place inside the nascent pit with cargo proteins possessing high affinity sorting signals recognised directly by adaptor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirchhausen et al., 2014</xref>). When the protein levels of adaptors such as AP2 are reduced, or when the ability to bind and recruit certain cargoes is lost, it is likely that the pit becomes less crowded, thereby becomes more populated with low affinity or passive cargoes like GPI-anchored proteins, and yet retains some ability to bud. This leads to the differential effects on transferrin and CD59 uptake that we observed experimentally. Divergent effects of coated pit perturbation on cargoes which all demonstrably enter the cell via coated pits, means that such effects need no longer be interpreted as evidence for clathrin-independent endocytosis.</p><p>Our data place important constraints on models of endocytic flux. Additional endocytic mechanisms, like the still poorly understood set of protein machinery responsible for macropinocytosis, and the budding of caveolae, contribute very little to total protein uptake but can be detected by our assays. Such clathrin-independent pathways could still be functionally important when uptake of specific cargoes, and the variety of cell types and functions in vivo are considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Commisso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watanabe et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, we conclude that clathrin-independent pathways do not make a significant contribution to total endocytic flux in cultured cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and DNA transfections</title><p>HeLa, RPE and Cos7 cells where cultured at 37°C, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.

The Introduction section frames the problem beautifully. After settling on reducible surface biotinylation for a labeling procedure, it was confirmed that this tags bulk surface constituents. Individual cargo at the surface could be followed using a reducible fluorescent ligand for the SNAP tag. Using this approach, &gt;95% of internalized biotinylated proteins colocalized with endocytosed transferrin (Tf) after 1-2 min at 37°C. A pulse of NHS-SS-biotin at 37°C for ∼1-2 min together with Tf also produced a high degree of overlap between Tf and streptavidin signals. The remainder of the manuscript reinforces this principal finding. The authors conclude that clathrin-mediated endocytosis represents the major route for internalization for the plasma membrane and that cargo packaging is subject to steric competition.</p><p>This is a systematic, carefully controlled, well interpreted and thought provoking study that forces serious reconsideration of a large body of previously published literature. The data are generally compelling and formally question the quantitative significance of clathrin-independent endocytosis, at least in the cell types examined.</p><p>The most paradoxical results are with regard to the CLIC/GEEC pathway, which through the work of Parton and Mayor has been suggested to account for the majority of bulk/fluid phase uptake in cells. The results from two papers in particular (Kirkham et al, 2005 (ref 17); Howes et al, 2010, which is not, but should be cited) need to be reconciled with the current findings. In these studies Parton and colleagues use quantitative electron microscopy studies with DAB reactions and surface quenching with ascorbic acid to also look at very early endocytic intermediates and identify CLIC, which have distinct morphologies and lack Tfn. Their morphometric analysis suggests that they account for the majority of bulk uptake in the cells they examined. We see two possibilities for reconciling these results:</p><p>1) The lack of sensitivity of detection of nascent clathrin-independent endocytic vesicles. CME is a concentrative uptake mechanism so that B-cargo and Tfn will be ∼20-fold more concentrated in nascent CCV derived vesicles as compared to bulk PM proteins in CLIC. While the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref> appears to argue that even vesicles with very low levels of streptavidin contain Tfn it would be important somehow ensure that diffraction limited vesicles with the same label intensity as what would be expected for bulk membrane also are enriched in Tfn. That is there should be 20-fold more Tfn than bulk membrane in these nascent vesicles. Could this be done with a bulk membrane marker such as an FM143 dye? The GPI-probes should show a &gt;20:1 enrichment of Tfn vs GPI. Do these intensity differences match these expectations or are the authors unable to detect poorly labeled nascent CLICs?</p><p>2) Another possible difference is if cholera toxin (Ctx), which is used as a CLIC marker by Parton et al, actually induces formation of CLICs. This is a very easy experiment to do, namely to repeat the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5">Figure 2 and 5</xref> in the presence of unlabeled Ctx. We feel this will greatly strengthen the current story.</p><p>A second set of experiments not reconciled by the data are results of the effects of dominant-negative dynamin mutants and Dyn2 null cells. Damke et al., 1995 showed that bulk-endocytosis is restored in cells expressing ts-dynamin-1 within 30 minutes after shift to the nonpermissive temperature. This compensatory, clathrin-independent endocytosis occurred through nascent vesicles smaller than CCVs as judged by HRP uptake and EM studies. Liu et al., 2008 showed that dynamin-2 null cells continue to take up cholera toxin and Bodipy-LacSer even though transferrin uptake and macropinocytosis were inhibited. Can the authors show induction of clathrin-independent pathways other than macropinocytosis? Please discuss.</p><p>The next comments are listed below in the spirit of making the manuscript more complete and in allowing the non-specialist reader to fully comprehend the results and their significance.</p><p>1) The GPI-anchored proteins stood out in the MS analysis as they were depleted, rather than enriched, at the cell surface in an AP-2-silenced background. The protein H/L ratios of the green-labeled GPI-anchored proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> shows that these biotinylated forms of GPI-anchored proteins are clearly lower on the surface of AP-2 knocked-down cells. However, does the manuscript’s whole protein data set show whether GPI-anchored proteins accumulate inside the AP-2 siRNA cell population rather than being extensively degraded? The underlying mechanistic basis for the surface loss is not really commented on directly or rationalized. It seems to me that they should explain why this occurs. GPI-anchored proteins do recycle back to the surface more slowly, but published data indicate this is due to interaction with cholesterol in the endosomal compartment. After several days, AP-2 knocked-down cells should be relatively cholesterol deficient due to LDL receptor accumulation on the cell surface and extremely limited endocytic flow. Do the GPI-anchored proteins in the intracellular fraction of AP-2-depleted cells recycle? If not, does this argue for a requirement for plasma membrane constituents, stalled at the cell surface in AP-2 knocked-down cells, for GPI-anchored protein recycling?</p><p>2) One of the primary ways that the CIE pathway has been discriminated from the clathrin-mediated pathway is with Arf6. In this work, Arf6 is hardly mentioned. Perhaps the authors would like to comment on the possible role of Arf6 in the events they are documenting.</p><p>3) A key set of mechanistically-revealing experiments are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, were uncoupling between Tf and SNAP-CD59 as a function of AP-2 concentration is reported. The difference between the extensively and moderately AP-2-depleted cells seems very small compared with the level of AP-2 in the 'normal' cell (panel C). The white- and blue-outlined cells both have very little AP-2. It is not stated clearly what time point these cells were analyzed after AP-2 siRNA application, nor for the quantitative data in panel D. It is difficult to follow the extent of AP-2 depletion in these cells at a comparative biochemical level. Is this 'uncoupling' effect only noted when AP-2 levels are very low? The graph in panel D suggests this is not the case.

I am confident that the new experiments have improved the manuscript. A full discussion of each of the points made by reviewers, and a description of the new experiments, follows below.</p><p>The most significant new experiments are: 1) Repeating the analysis of cargo load of endocytic vesicles with and without cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), to control for possible effects of CTB-binding. 2) Imaging and measuring co-localisation between transferrin and a label for endocytosed membrane, FM-143FX, to control for the (in our opinion remote) possibility of endocytic vesicles that are not detected by labelling of all plasma membrane proteins with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin.</p><p>There are also additional new experiments, including showing that the AP2 mu2 subunit mutants that we use are indeed incorporated into AP2 complexes, and analysing co-localisation between ARF6 and endocytosed proteins.</p><p><italic>The most paradoxical results are with regard to the CLIC/GEEC pathway, which through the work of Parton and Mayor has been suggested to account for the majority of bulk/fluid phase uptake in cells. The results from two papers in particular (Kirkham et al, 2005 (ref 17); Howes et al, 2010, which is not, but should be cited) need to be reconciled with the current findings. In these studies Parton and colleagues use quantitative electron microscopy studies with DAB reactions and surface quenching with ascorbic acid to also look at very early endocytic intermediates and identify CLIC, which have distinct morphologies and lack Tfn. Their morphometric analysis suggests that they account for the majority of bulk uptake in the cells they examined. We see two possibilities for reconciling these results:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The lack of sensitivity of detection of nascent clathrin-independent endocytic vesicles. CME is a concentrative uptake mechanism so that B-cargo and Tfn will be ∼20-fold more concentrated in nascent CCV derived vesicles as compared to bulk PM proteins in CLIC. While the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1"><italic>Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref> <italic>appears to argue that even vesicles with very low levels of streptavidin contain Tfn it would be important somehow ensure that diffraction limited vesicles with the same label intensity as what would be expected for bulk membrane also are enriched in Tfn. That is there should be 20-fold more Tfn than bulk membrane in these nascent vesicles. Could this be done with a bulk membrane marker such as an FM143 dye? The GPI-probes should show a &gt;20:1 enrichment of Tfn vs GPI. Do these intensity differences match these expectations or are the authors unable to detect poorly labeled nascent CLICs?</italic></p><p>This point relates to the possibility that our reducible biotin + streptavidin labelling protocol do not detect all endocytic structures. This is of course a valid concern. We point out, however, that as we are labelling essentially all proteins, any putative vesicles not detected in our protocol would have to be either much smaller than clathrin coated vesicles, or highly depleted of protein relative to such vesicles. In this context it is important to emphasise that, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, there is no correlation between the biotin intensity of a vesicle and the probability that we fail to detect transferrin in it; it is not the case that low biotin intensity vesicles close to the detection threshold are significantly less likely to contain transferrin than higher biotin intensity vesicles. Additionally, macropinosomes (which are likely to have a similar membrane protein composition to the plasma membrane) are readily detected using our approach, as are small and scarce caveolar vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The structures described as CLICs by electron microscopy are, in fact, larger than clathrin-coated vesicles [1,2], so all in all it seems unlikely that our approach would fail to detect them.</p><p>We have devised additional experiments to support these arguments. The central question is whether there are membrane vesicles that both lack transferrin and are not detected with our reducible biotin + streptavidin protocol. We labeled cells with the styryl membrane dye FM1-43FX, along with transferrin, and allowed uptake for 90s at 37°C. There was effectively complete co-localisation between the FM1-43FX in small endocytic vesicles and transferrin, and as expected FM1-43FX also labeled obviously larger and relatively infrequent macropinosomes. This point is now made in the text, and representative images and quantification are included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2–figure supplement 7</xref>. These new data help to rule out the possibility of abundant membrane vesicles that do not contain transferrin.</p><p><italic>2) Another possible difference is if cholera toxin (Ctx), which is used as a CLIC marker by Parton et al, actually induces formation of CLICs. This is a very easy experiment to do, namely to repeat the experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig5"><italic>Figure 2 and 5</italic></xref> <italic>in the presence of unlabeled Ctx. We feel this will greatly strengthen the current story</italic>.</p><p>This is a very good suggestion. We have done precisely what the reviewer suggests and analysed the transferrin cargo load in biotin- or SNAP-CD59-positive vesicles + / - Ctx (which we refer to as CTB in the manuscript). The data, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, show that Ctx does not induce a class of vesicles which contain biotin or SNAP-CD59 but not transferrin.</p><p>This still leaves the issue of relating our data with the papers identifying CLICs somewhat unresolved [1,2]. CLICs, like macropinosomes, could be present, or up-regulated, in specific circumstances such as at the leading edge of migrating cells. We have looked at RPE cells, which spontaneously migrate in culture, and did not see evidence for this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2–figure supplement 5</xref>). Another possibility is that many structures identified by ultrastructure as CLICs may, in fact, be transferrin-positive early endosomes. The various EM studies on the morphology of early endosomes under different conditions yield examples of early endosome structures that look like CLICs, but contain transferrin or other clathrin cargoes (compare [2]-Figure 4A, with [3]-Figure 6F, [4]-Figure 1, [5]-Figure 9, [6]-Figures 8,10, [7]-Figure 1 <italic>etc</italic>.). Therefore we suggest that it is hard to define CLICs by a specific morphology, and reliance on transferrin-HRP or CTB-HRP as markers means that simultaneous detection of both conventional early endosomes and potential CLICs in the same EM sections is difficult [2]. We have added a brief section in our discussion where we try to reconcile the results in the literature by pointing out the morphological similarities between CLICs and early endosomes.</p><p><italic>A second set of experiments not reconciled by the data are results of the effects of dominant-negative dynamin mutants and Dyn2 null cells. Damke et al., 1995 showed that bulk-endocytosis is restored in cells expressing ts-dynamin-1 within 30 minutes after shift to the nonpermissive temperature. This compensatory, clathrin-independent endocytosis occurred through nascent vesicles smaller than CCVs as judged by HRP uptake and EM studies. Liu et al., 2008 showed that dynamin-2 null cells continue to take up cholera toxin and Bodipy-LacSer even though transferrin uptake and macropinocytosis were inhibited. Can the authors show induction of clathrin-independent pathways other than macropinocytosis? Please discuss</italic>.</p><p>Again, this point is well taken. On reflection, it was incorrect of us to describe the endocytosis induced by the dynamin 2 K44A mutant as macropinocytosis. Close inspection of the image we show, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref>, suggests that biotin-positive, transferrin-negative structures with a range of sizes potentially including sub-resolution vesicles as well as larger vesicles, are induced by the mutant. Given the complex mode of action of dynamin, interpretation of the effects of overexpression of the K44A mutant in terms of precise mechanisms is difficult [8]. The important finding from the point of view of our argument is that these structures are indeed clearly induced by the mutant, as demonstrated both by the image and by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>). We have amended the text accordingly. The finding that dynamin 2 K44A induces endocytic events that usually do not happen / are relatively infrequent highlights what we see as one of the main advantages of the approach used in our paper, namely analysis of the identity of endocytic carriers in unperturbed cells.</p><p><italic>The next comments are listed below in the spirit of making the manuscript more complete and in allowing the non-specialist reader to fully comprehend the results and their significance</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) The GPI-anchored proteins stood out in the MS analysis as they were depleted, rather than enriched, at the cell surface in an AP-2-silenced background. The protein H/L ratios of the green-labeled GPI-anchored proteins in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref> <italic>shows that these biotinylated forms of GPI-anchored proteins are clearly lower on the surface of AP-2 knocked-down cells. However, does the manuscripts whole protein data set show whether GPI-anchored proteins accumulate inside the AP-2 siRNA cell population rather than being extensively degraded? The underlying mechanistic basis for the surface loss is not really commented on directly or rationalized. It seems to me that they should explain why this occurs. GPI-anchored proteins do recycle back to the surface more slowly, but published data indicate this is due to interaction with cholesterol in the endosomal compartment. After several days, AP-2 knocked-down cells should be relatively cholesterol deficient due to LDL receptor accumulation on the cell surface and extremely limited endocytic flow. Do the GPI-anchored proteins in the intracellular fraction of AP-2-depleted cells recycle? If not, does this argue for a requirement for plasma membrane constituents, stalled at the cell surface in AP-2 knocked-down cells, for GPI-anchored protein recycling?</italic></p><p>We wrote the original manuscript deliberately trying to avoid claiming that our data on sorting of GPI-linked proteins into clathrin coated pits provide a complete explanation for the depletion of GPI-linked proteins from the plasma membrane following AP2 depletion. We fully agree with the reviewer that other factors including rates of recycling from intracellular compartments, rates of synthesis / Golgi exit, and changes in cellular lipid composition, could also be relevant. A full examination of these possibilities is clearly beyond the scope of the current manuscript. The SILAC data is presented in the current manuscript to substantiate the point that most proteins accumulate in the membrane in the absence of AP2, but GPI-linked proteins behave differently and therefore their sorting behaviour requires further study. Our subsequent experiments relate to endocytosis and sorting of GPI-linked proteins, the issue relevant to the paper as a whole.</p><p>In order to clarify the text we now mention some of the additional factors listed above that could be relevant to depletion of GPI-linked proteins in the plasma membrane. Also, the SILAC MS does indeed indicate that the intracellular pool of GPI-linked proteins is unchanged when AP2 is depleted, as GPI-anchored proteins are detected in the non-biotinylated protein flow-through fraction, and the SILAC ratios for these proteins are close to 1. Again, this point is now made explicitly in the text.</p><p><italic>2) One of the primary ways that the CIE pathway has been discriminated from the clathrin-mediated pathway is with Arf6. In this work, Arf6 is hardly mentioned. Perhaps the authors would like to comment on the possible role of Arf6 in the events they are documenting</italic>.</p><p>We now include ARF6-GFP in the survey of potential markers for clathrin-independent endocytic pathways in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Like GRAF1, ARF6 is detected on transferrin-positive endosomes but not, in our hands, on transferrin-negative structures.</p><p><italic>3) A key set of mechanistically-revealing experiments are presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8"><italic>Figure 8</italic></xref><italic>, were uncoupling between Tf and SNAP-CD59 as a function of AP-2 concentration is reported. The difference between the extensively and moderately AP-2-depleted cells seems very small compared with the level of AP-2 in the 'normal' cell (panel C). The white- and blue-outlined cells both have very little AP-2. It is not stated clearly what time point these cells were analyzed after AP-2 siRNA application, nor for the quantitative data in panel D. It is difficult to follow the extent of AP-2 depletion in these cells at a comparative biochemical level. Is this 'uncoupling' effect only noted when AP-2 levels are very low? The graph in panel D suggests this is not the case. Perhaps a more representative set of images could be shown?</italic></p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have improved the presentation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>. This experiment forms <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> in the new manuscript. We have increased the size of the images and chosen new examples that make the point more clearly.</p><p><italic>4) To our knowledge, most experiments using overexpressed mu2 subunits have been disappointing. AP-2 has a half-life of &gt;30 hours in cultured cells. There is no direct evidence provided that the mutant mu2 protein overexpressed is actually incorporated into functional AP-2 tetramers</italic>.</p><p>This is a good point. The long half-life of AP-2 complexes suggests that overexpression of mutant subunits needs to be for several days before the exogenously expressed subunits get incorporated into endogenous complexes. The effects shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D, 8E, 8F, 8G</xref> were observed after 4 days of overexpression of the mutant subunit. We have now carried out co-IP experiments to show that mutant ∝2 gets incorporated into endogenous complexes, and this incorporation is dependent on the time of overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8–figure supplement 2</xref>). We hope the new data will improve the manuscript.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Howes MT, Kirkham M, Riches J, Cortese K, Walser PJ, et al.
