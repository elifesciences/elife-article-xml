states. Here, we show that an antagonism between two conserved regulatory proteins, Spinophilin (Spn) and Syd-1, controls presynaptic long-term plasticity and the maintenance of olfactory memories in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While <italic>Spn</italic> mutants could not trigger nanoscopic active zone remodeling under homeostatic challenge and failed to stably potentiate neurotransmitter release, concomitant reduction of Syd-1 rescued all these deficits. The Spn/Syd-1 antagonism converged on active zone close F-actin, and genetic or acute pharmacological depolymerization of F-actin rescued the <italic>Spn</italic> deficits by allowing access to synaptic vesicle release sites. Within the intrinsic mushroom body neurons, the Spn/Syd-1 antagonism specifically controlled olfactory memory stabilization but not initial learning. Thus, this evolutionarily conserved protein complex controls behaviorally relevant presynaptic long-term plasticity, also observed in the mammalian brain but still enigmatic concerning its molecular mechanisms and behavioral relevance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>plasticity</kwd><kwd>active zone</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>neurotransmission</kwd><kwd>homeostasis</kwd><kwd>presynaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2049 (#390688087)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigrist</surname><given-names>Stephan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR186/ A03 (#278001972)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigrist</surname><given-names>Stephan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NeuroNex2 (#436260754)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigrist</surname><given-names>Stephan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR5228 (#447288260)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigrist</surname><given-names>Stephan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>[ERC-AdG &quot;Synprotect&quot;]</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigrist</surname><given-names>Stephan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NanoSYNDIV</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SI 849/10-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrel</surname><given-names>Oriane</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An antagonism between Spinophilin and Syd-1 converge on presynaptic actin to control presynaptic plasticity and memory consolidation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Synapses are key sites of information storage in the brain and shape computations of the nervous system. Their transmission strength is not hard-wired but plastically adapts to provide adequate input-output relationships, to maintain or restore transmission when compromised, and to store information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takeuchi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoll and Roche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pozo and Goda, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marder and Goaillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Costa et al., 2017</xref>). However, there is still a fundamental gap in our understanding of how dynamic changes of synapse performance intersect with circuit and sub-system activity to define behavioral states. This not the least is due to the inherent complexity of mechanisms operating across different timescales (sub-second to lifetime), using a rich spectrum of pre- and postsynaptic homeostatic and Hebbian mechanisms.</p><p>In general, mechanisms of postsynaptic plasticity have been extensively worked out and often target the postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoll and Roche, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herring and Nicoll, 2016</xref>). Molecular cascades targeting the presynaptic SV release machinery to enhance transmission on a longer term (‘sustained plasticity’), are much less characterized. There is broad evidence of presynaptic plasticity in the rodent brain, prominent at hippocampal mossy fiber bouton (MFB) synapses, involving a sequence of interleaved mechanistic components. Here, acute facilitation of release at presynaptic active zones (AZs) seemingly operates through changes in synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability and tighter Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel-sensor coupling, while longer-lasting changes required for stable memory formation at the MFB have been shown to occur via the addition of novel SV release sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Monday et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monday et al., 2022</xref>), AZ Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukaya et al., 2021</xref>) and long-lasting readily releasable SV pool (RRP) size increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vandael et al., 2020</xref>). The upstream regulatory control mechanisms which bring about these changes remain unknown, however, hampering genetic access and inquiry into their behavioral relevance.</p><p>Concerning the elucidation of presynaptic plasticity mechanisms, <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses are uniquely suited as they are accessible to a combination of genetics, pharmacology, electrophysiology and super-resolution imaging. Notably, robust presynaptic homeostatic plasticity (PHP) evident in an increase of SVs being released per action potential can be induced at NMJ synapses via a pharmacological blockade of the postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs). In the multi-step course of the NMJ PHP process, increase in AZ scaffold proteins Bruchpilot (BRP, an ELKS/CAST homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>), Rim-BP, munc13 family member Unc13A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>), and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cacophony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gratz et al., 2019</xref>) provoke increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller and Davis, 2012</xref>), and an increase in the size of the RRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>). Important for the work presented here, we recently found that BRP and Unc13A are upregulated during memory formation at <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (MB) lobe AZs, with this AZ remodeling being needed to stabilize new memories but being dispensable for initial learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we show that Spinophilin (Spn), known to function during AZ development in promoting BRP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>), also executes AZ remodeling during PHP and is crucial for sustaining PHP over longer timescales. Syd-1, which antagonizes Spn function during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>), also antagonizes Spn function in AZ remodeling and sustaining PHP. Spn functions by modulating the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakanishi et al., 1997</xref>) which regulates access of SVs to release sites. Spn and Syd-1 seemingly also function antagonistically in the MB memory center in sustaining memories. Having identified this evolutionarily conserved regulatory complex as functioning high in the regulatory scheme of presynaptic long-term plasticity via actin remodeling might pave the way towards addressing the behavioral role of presynaptic long-term plasticity in the mammalian brain.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Homeostatic synaptic plasticity serves to maintain baseline transmission strength in response to altered pre- or postsynaptic function. It is conserved from invertebrates through humans, but perhaps best illustrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>). PHP at NMJ synapses can be triggered by the application of the GluR blocker Philanthotoxin (PhTx) resulting in a compensatory enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Müller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lazarevic et al., 2013</xref>). PhTx application initiates presynaptic AZ remodeling within minutes, observed as increased AZ cytomatrix proteins. Notably however, absence of BRP still allowed for functional potentiation in the rapid induction phase (10 min PhTx treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>) but could not sustain potentiation during the maintenance phase (30 min PhTx treatment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>) of PHP, or in combination with <italic>glurIIA</italic> mutant, a genetic model of long-term PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Presynaptic Spinophilin functions to sustain homeostatic plasticity through active zone remodeling</title><p>In order to identify regulators specific for AZ remodeling and the maintenance phase of PHP, we analyzed mutants of the evolutionarily conserved AZ regulator, Spn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>), needed for efficient BRP incorporation during the developmental assembly of AZs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Spn</italic> mutants indeed failed to show any BRP increase when challenged with PhTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–b</xref>) while control animals showed a robust increase. We first considered whether this inability might be a sheer consequence of its developmental phenotype. We therefore focused on mutants of Spn’s binding partner Neurexin-1 (Nrx-1), as well as Nrx-1’s transsynaptic binding partners Neuroligin-1 (Nlg1) and Nlg2, all of which have impaired developmental AZ assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banovic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Owald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), with specific emphasis on <italic>Nlg2</italic> mutants which phenocopy <italic>Spn</italic> mutants in terms of developmental assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ramesh et al., 2021</xref>).

In contrast, during the maintenance phase, while evoked release was compensated and QC increased in controls, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and k</xref>). In fact, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants showed even a significant reduction in QC when challenged with PhTx for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f and l</xref>).</p><p>Spn at the NMJ is expressed not only at presynaptic AZs of the motoneurons but also at the postsynaptic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>). Given the presynaptic nature of its plasticity deficit, we asked whether presynaptic Spn was responsible for PHP. Thus, we conducted a rescue experiment and, in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, re-expressed full-length Spn exclusively in motor neurons using the Ok6-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Indeed, both the deficit of BRP incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–b</xref>) as well as QC increase after 30 min PhTx challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c–i</xref>) were both fully rescued, suggesting that presynaptic Spn is sufficient to mediate BRP increase and PHP maintenance. Full-length Spn, exclusively expressed in the postsynaptic muscle cells, using the Mef2-Gal4 driver, did not rescue the PHP-dependent BRP incorporation deficit of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (data not shown). Moreover, in PhTx-untreated controls, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with muscle expression of full-length Spn had reduced evoked amplitudes when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2n</xref>). Upon PhTx treatment, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with muscle expression of full-length Spn showed a modest increase in quantal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>, j-o), however, not to the same extent as with motor neuron expression of Spn. Thus, muscle expression of Spn also seems able to somewhat milden the complete loss of Spn for PHP, albeit through mechanisms independent of BRP. We therefore focused our analysis on presynaptic Spn in the following experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Spinophilin/Syd-1 antagonism controls active zone structural and functional plasticity</title><p>We next considered that if Spn operated in a truly regulatory manner in AZ plasticity, it might be opposed by counteracting regulatory activities, and identifying these could enrich our mechanistic understanding of AZ remodeling and plasticity.

To work out this potential hyperplasticity phenotype of <italic>Syd-1</italic> mutants, we followed up on BRP levels upon 30 min PhTx challenge. Interestingly, within this time interval, BRP levels returned to pre-PhTx baseline levels in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2m–n</xref> grey). Thus, BRP levels seem to increase only transiently upon PhTx-induced AZ remodeling, similar to the transient BRP increases triggered by Pavlovian olfactory conditioning in the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>).

Comparative functional enrichment analysis of the Spn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) interactome suggested that Spn was specifically associated with translational control.

Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) levels measured over the entire NMJ area showed no difference when comparing wildtype and <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1d–e</xref>) suggesting that the total number of SVs is unchanged in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants. Indeed, transmission electron microscopic analysis of NMJ boutons showed that the overall number of SVs and the overall SV density (number of SVs/unit area) were essentially unaltered in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–f</xref>). At the same time, however, in the vicinity of the AZs (recognized by their electron dense T-bars), SV numbers appeared clearly reduced in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and g</xref>). Indeed, the SV micro-arrangement was apparently altered at AZs, as the SVs no longer clustered at T-bars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Counting SVs in increments of 20 nm shells around the T-bar showed that the number of SVs very close (&lt;110 nm from T-bar center) to the AZs was lower in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, while further away (&gt;110 nm from T-bar center), SV densities were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d and h</xref>). Thus, SVs in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants seem to be largely excluded from the area very close to the AZ membrane, arguably explained by excessive cortical actin filaments blocking AZ access in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (see discussion).</p><p>As Spn seems to be involved in RRP size maintenance, we looked for possible additional mechanisms that could be involved in this context. Our proteomics analysis identified Rho-associated protein kinase (ROK) as strongly enriched within the Spn-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Rok has been shown to be involved in actomyosin contraction, RRP maintenance and facilitating SV docking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Forero et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore tested whether Rok inhibition using a specific inhibitor could preclude PHP maintenance. Pretreating larvae with Rok inhibitor did indeed preclude BRP increases upon PhTx treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6i–j</xref>). Cownsistently, the larvae pretreated with the Rok inhibitor also could not compensate for PhTx challenge as they did not increase their QC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6n</xref>). Control and <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, pretreated with Rok inhibitor, showed a reduction in mini amplitudes with PhTx treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6kl</xref>), but the Rok inhibitor pretreated wildtype controls did not return their evoked release to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k and m</xref>). Notably, at the same time, inhibitor treatment did not affect baseline release activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1i–l</xref>), suggesting that actomyosin function is indeed needed for fast, plastic RRP expansion in our system, and might be downstream of Spn.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Spinophilin is crucial for aversive olfactory mid-term memories but not for learning</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (MB) is a leading system for the analysis of learning and subsequent memory formation and consolidation.

Notably, our recent work showed that BRP and Unc13A levels in the MB increased over about 3 hr after conditioning to later return to baseline levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) reporting a transient, conditioning induced BRP increase. As BRP increases were also transient under PhTx at the NMJ as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b and m–n</xref>), we wondered whether Spn within KCs would be of importance for conditioning-triggered increases of BRP and Unc13A. Thus, we stained MBs of wild type animals subjected to olfactory conditioning for BRP and Unc13A. As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>), we observed an upregulation of BRP and Unc13A in response to paired conditioning after both 1 and 3 hr post conditioning in comparison to naive untrained animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and c</xref>). We analogously knocked down Spn specifically in the MB KCs post-developmentally, starting from 3 days after hatching, by combining the temperature-sensitive Gal80 inhibitor (Gal80<sup>ts</sup>) with RNA interference (RNAi) via the TARGET system using Gal80<sup>ts</sup> to block Gal4 transcriptional activity at low temperature (18 °C). At high temperature (29 °C), the Gal80<sup>ts</sup> protein is denatured and consequently the inhibition of Gal4 activity is lifted. In order to restrict RNAi expression to adult MB lobes, we combined tub- Gal80<sup>ts</sup> with the KC generic OK107-Gal4 line (Gal80<sup>ts</sup>;OK107).

Although AZ-remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weyhersmüller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gratz et al., 2019</xref>) begins within a few minutes after PHP induction (via PhTx), it is not a prerequisite for the rapid increase of QC observed. Concretely, <italic>BRP</italic>, <italic>Aplip-1</italic>, <italic>Srpk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>)<italic>, Arl8</italic> and <italic>IMAC</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>), which are all deficient in AZ scaffold remodeling, still increase QC in the first few minutes after the PhTx challenge (PHP induction). Later, however, they are unable to sustain a QC increase as early as 30 min after PhTx treatment.</p><p>We suggest that the transient increase of BRP, also previously described specifically in the MB γ-neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), triggers other, longer lasting AZ changes. Indeed, we found that the increase of the critical release factor Unc13A is still present at 30 min PhTx treatment and is dependent on the “transient” BRP increase (Fig. S3B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref> also uncovered a more transient upregulation of BRP when compared to Unc13A in the MB. Here, specifically upon paired olfactory conditioning, 1 hr after training, animals displayed BRP and Unc13A level increases. At 3 hr post training, however, BRP levels had already plateaued, whereas Unc13A levels had increased further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>). During the induction phase, QC increase seemingly is the result of maximizing the output of already existing release machinery and release sites via increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx or activation of preexisting but dormant release sites in a RIM, RIM-BP and Unc13A dependent fashion. Sustaining QC enhancement over a longer period, however, seemingly requires structural AZ remodeling. Arguably, the induction phase might trigger the maintenance phase, given that several mutants were found to induce but not sustain PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Böhme et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frank et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marie et al., 2010</xref>), while the reverse case has not been described so far. We show that Spn-mediated BRP-incorporation, triggered during the induction phase, is essential for PHP maintenance and likely functions to increase the number of SV release sites at the AZ by installing more Unc13A. Like BRP itself, Spn is per se dispensable for PHP induction in the tested paradigms. This said, however, a relatively bigger variance in the evoked release responses of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>), indicating that <italic>Spn</italic> mutants are not completely unaffected also concerning the induction phase of homeostatic plasticity. Induction and maintenance mechanisms might indeed be linked in more complex ways, which remain to be worked out in the future. PHP in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants could be reinstated by attenuating Syd-1 levels by removing a single <italic>syd-1</italic> gene copy, extending the developmental role of Spn/Syd-1 antagonism into PHP. Interestingly, Spn and Syd-1 also bind each other as shown through yeast-2-hybrid assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muhammad et al., 2015</xref>) and co-immunoprecipitation (this study). Future work could lead to an understanding on how their physical association steers their complementary functions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Local, active zone close control of F-actin pools downstream of Spn/Syd-1 controlled remodeling</title><p>While AZ remodeling has been described in terms of changes in core AZ proteins during PHP, there is much to be learned concerning the regulatory proteins which mediate sustained AZ remodeling during PHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frank et al., 2020</xref>).

Actin disassembly has been described before in the release of large vesicles from chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rosé et al., 2001</xref>), and also more recently at the AZ via Mical to facilitate vesicle fusion at the AZ membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orr et al., 2022</xref>). Motivated by Spn-IPs containing Mical and by the established roles of Spn family proteins in regulating actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakanishi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ryan et al., 2005</xref>), we tested whether indeed actin dynamics were mechanistically downstream of Spn and Syd-1 here. Indeed, our data suggest that the Spn/Syd-1 antagonism converges on controlling local AZ-close F-actin abundance and dynamics. Spn/Syd-1 regulation of F-actin status in turn seems to control the accessibility of SV at their release sites. To what extent the modulation of local F-actin promoting RRP size and SV docking might directly couple to the accumulation of more AZ scaffold material, potentially via biosynthetic precursor vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vukoja et al., 2018</xref>), is an interesting question now. Recent work suggests two pools of presynaptic actin to be involved in different functions. Here, one F-actin pool within the SV field facing the AZ scaffold might be involved in vesicle recruitment while another pool might operate close to the AZ plasma membrane and control RRP size and vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Orr et al., 2022</xref>). We here show evidence that the AZ remodeling and PHP maintenance process is mediated by cortical actin disassembly at the AZ via Mical, likely positioned near the AZ by Spn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, Spn-dependent cortical actin depolymerization).</p><p>We recently found that PHP maintenance is driven via a compaction process involving both voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Cacophony and BRP along with increases in the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel molecules at the AZ center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghelani et al., 2023</xref>). Such a compaction process could be mediated by local depolymerization of F-actin as implicated by our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mrestani et al., 2021</xref>) and also facilitate increases of AZ scaffold protein numbers (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, during tight junction formation, actin filament depolymerization by latrunculin-A in polarized MDCK cells led to the formation of droplet-like puncta of Zonula Occludens-1 through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beutel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schwayer et al., 2019</xref>). LLPS has been described in various contexts as forming membraneless protein condensates and by increasing local protein concentrations. Notably, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Syd-2 and ELKS-1 (BRP homologue) were shown to form liquid phases at developing AZs, which finally mature into more stable structures. Condensate liquidity is suggested to promote the incorporation and mixing of AZ components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDonald et al., 2020</xref>). PHP at AZs could thus involve LLPS-like processes involved in the concentration and accumulation of liquid-phase promoting AZ proteins driven by Spn-mediated F-actin depolymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, AZ contraction).</p><p>We also found that Rok kinase (found in Spn IPs) precludes PHP maintenance, possibly by restricting RRP replenishment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, Rok-dependent RRP replenishment). Basally active ROCK (<italic>Drosophila</italic> Rok) was found to inhibit actomyosin contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Forero et al., 2012</xref>) and physiological modulators of ROCK activity have been suggested to trigger short term synaptic plasticity in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">González-Forero et al., 2012</xref>). The most studied LLPS process at the AZ is the synapsin condensate (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) which includes SVs and forms the reserve pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milovanovic et al., 2018</xref>), from which Rok-mediated RRP replenishment occurs. Spn likely functions upstream of Rok and Mical in modulating cortical actin to allow access to the release sites, specifically during plasticity processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>).

Relevant in this regard, we have shown that the formin DAAM is tightly associated with the synaptic active zone scaffold, and electrophysiological data point to a role in the modulation of SV release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Migh et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A convergence of F-actin dynamics and active zone remodeling in the orchestration of memory relevant presynaptic plasticity</title><p>Actin cytoskeleton polymerization during and shortly after learning is needed for long-term memory formation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamprecht, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kramár et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krucker et al., 2000</xref>).

Important for this work, we recently showed that post-developmental BRP KD within the neurons of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB severely hampered olfactory aversive MTM measured a few hours after conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>), while still allowing for proper learning in the minutes range (STM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>). This manuscript shows that Spn KD also does not affect the <italic>acute, immediate</italic> formation of aversive STM, therefore we do not a priori assume that the Spn-mediated AZ remodeling results in synaptic depression. We favor the idea that our plasticity mechanism executes a post-conditioning aftermath critical for consolidating memories over time. This derives from the consideration that synaptic weights, in all likelihood, have to get re-normalized in the MB circuitry after the acute, immediate STM encoding depression. We thus think that one possibility to explain these findings is that the BRP/Unc13A increases that we observe promote potentiation in the MB network to facilitate such a renormalization. Still, the exact relation of the AZ remodeling described in this paper, to STM depression specifically, and KC presynaptic plasticity in general, is currently unknown.

Recordings were obtained with a bath solution of HL3 with 1.5 (TEVC) or 0.4 (current clamp) mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Recordings were made from cells with an initial Vm between –50 (TEVC) or –40 (current clamp) and –80 mV, and input resistances of ≥4 MΩ, using intracellular electrodes with resistances of 30–50 MΩ, filled with 3 M KCl. 2 Cells were recorded per animal. Glass electrodes were pulled using a Flaming Brown Model P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument, CA, USA). Recordings were made using an Axoclamp 2 B amplifier with HS- 2Ax0.1 head stage (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) on a BX51WI Olympus microscope with a 40 X LUMPlanFL/IR water immersion objective (Olympus Corporation, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan). mEJCs/mEPSPs were recorded for 90 seconds with the voltage clamped at –80 mV (for TEVC recordings), all other recordings were performed while clamping the voltage at –60 mV (for TEVC recordings). eEJCs/eEPSPs were recorded after stimulating the appropriate motor neuron bundle with 5 (eEJCs) or 8 (eEPSPs) V, 300 µs at 0.2 Hz using an S48 Stimulator (Grass Instruments, Astro-Med, Inc, RI, USA). To estimate the RRP size, single train recordings with 61 stimulations were performed at 100 Hz. Signals were digitized at 10 kHz using an Axon Digidata 1322  A digitizer (Molecular Devices, CA, USA) and low pass filtered at 1 kHz using an LPBF-48DG output filter (NPI Electronic, Tamm, Germany). The recordings were analyzed with pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA) and two Python scripts utilizing the pyABF package for Python 3.10 (Harden, SW (2022). pyABF 2.3.5. [Online]. Available: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pypi.org/project/pyabf">https://pypi.org/project/pyabf</ext-link>). Stimulation artifacts of eEJCs/eEPSPs were removed for clarity. mEJCs/mEPSPs were further filtered with a 500  Hz Gaussian low-pass filter. Using a single template for all cells, mEJCs/mEPSPs were identified and averaged, generating a mean mEJC/mEPSP trace for each cell. An average trace was generated from 20 eEJC/eEPSP traces per cell for 0.2 Hz stimulation and 10ms ISI paired pulse recordings and from 10 traces for 30ms ISI paired pulse recordings. Rise time was calculated from the average trace of the 0.2 Hz stimulation recording as the time from 10% to 90% of the total amplitude before the peak. Decay constant τ was calculated by fitting a first order decay function to the region of the average trace of the 0.2 Hz stimulation recording from 60% to 5% of the total amplitude after the peak. The amplitude of the average eEJC/eEPSP trace from the 0.2 Hz stimulation recording was divided by the amplitude of the averaged mEJC/mEPSP, for each respective cell, to determine the quantal content. 10ms and 30ms ISI paired pulse ratios were calculated by dividing the amplitude after the second pulse by the amplitude after the first pulse. The baseline for the second amplitude was set at the last point before the second stimulation artifact onset. Estimation of the RRP size and refilling rates were performed as described previously (Matkovic et al., J Cell Biol. 2013 Aug 19; 202(4): 667–683.); briefly, the amplitudes of the responses to each stimulation in the train were extracted from the recording by using the last data points before each artifact onset as a baseline. For each cell, these amplitudes were then added cumulatively and divided by the average mEJC amplitudes as measured for this cell to obtain the cumulative quantal content. This cumulative quantal content was then plotted against the number of stimulations and a linear regression was performed for the last 20 amplitudes, where the cells reach a steady state due to the depletion of the RRP. The intersect of this linear fit with the Y-axis is the estimated RRP size, the slope of the linear fit is the estimated refilling rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavior: olfactory associative aversive conditioning</title><p>Flies were trained using the classical olfactory aversive conditioning protocols described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>. Training and testing were performed in climate-controlled boxes at 25 °C in 80% humidity under dim red light. At 2–3 days old, flies were transferred to fresh food vials and either put at 29 °C for RNAi induction or stayed at 18 °C for the non-induced controls. Conditioning was performed on groups of around 40–50 flies with 3-octanol (around 95% purity; Sigma-Aldrich) and 4-methylcyclohexanol (99% purity; Sigma-Aldrich). Odors were diluted at 1:100 in paraffin oil and presented in 14 mm cups. A current of 120 AC was used as a behavioral reinforcer. Memory conditioning and tests were performed with a T-maze apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). In a single-cycle training, groups of flies were presented with one odor (CS<sup>+</sup>) paired with electrical shock (US; 12 times for one minute). After one minute of pure air-flow, the second odor (CS<sup>-</sup>) was presented without the shock for another minute. During the test phase, flies were given 1 min to choose between 2 arms, giving each a distinct odor. An index was calculated as the difference between the numbers of flies in each arm divided by the sum of flies in both arms. The average of two reciprocal experiments gave a performance index (PI). The values of PI ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means no learning (50:50 distribution of flies) and a value of 1 means complete learning (all flies avoided the conditioned odor). For olfactory acuity and shock reactivity, around 50 flies were put in a choice position between either one odor and air for one minute or electric shocks and no-shocks, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electron microscopy: conventional embedding of larval muscles</title><p>Third instar larvae were dissected as described above.

The filets were then fixed for 1 hr in 2% GA in 0.1 M NaCac at RT. The samples were washed thrice with NaCac buffer, allowing the filets to rinse for 5 min each time. The filets were transferred to Snap-On lid vials with the last washing step and were kept in the dark, in ice and on a shaker after this point. The filets were post-fixed with 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in 0.8% KFeCn for 1 hr. The samples were washed for 1 hr with NaCac buffer followed by three washes with Millipore water. The samples were incubated for 1 hr in 1% uranyl acetate (UrAc). The samples were then dehydrated through a series of increasing alcohol concentrations and embedded in EPON resin by incubating in 1:1 EtOH/EPON solution and then in pure EPON.

Approximately 6000 fly heads were collected per replicate, and synaptosomes were purified via differential centrifugation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Depner et al., 2014</xref>). Twenty µg of each antibody (rbBRPlast200 and rbSPN) was coupled to 50 µl Protein A–coated agarose beads. For a negative control rb-IgGs were coupled to beads. To avoid unspecific bounds of proteins to beads, synaptosome suspension was precleared by rotating for 1 h at 4 °C on naked beads. Afterwards, bead-antibody and bead-IgG complexes were incubated with solubilized and precleared synaptosome membrane preparations (P2) overnight at 4 °C. After four washing steps with IP buffer (containing 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA and 1% Triton X-100), antibody antigen complexes were eluted with 60 µl 2×denaturing protein sample buffer each.</p><p>The data output from Maxquant was analysed using Perseus software (version 1.6.2.3). LFQ values were log2 transformed to achieve normal data distribution. Proteins identified in at least three (out of four) replicates were considered for statistical analysis all other proteins that were detected and quantified in only one replicate were excluded. Missing data were imputed by values from a normal distribution (width 0.3 standard deviations; down shift 1.8). For statistical protein enrichment analysis in the BRP-IP or SPN-IP, a two-sided t-test between BRP-IP or SPN-IP and negative IgG control was used with a S0 constant of 0.1 and a permutation-based FDR of 0.05. Presented fold changes have been calculated as difference from mean values of log2 transformed intensities from BRP-IP or SPN-IP and IgG control. Microsoft Excel was used to create Volcano plot from quadruplicates of coprecipitated protein levels from the BRP-IP or SPN-IP compared with the IgG control. The x-axis represents the log2 fold-change value, indicating the magnitude of change, and the y axis is –log10 of the p-value showing statistical significance.</p><p>Pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis were carried out using Metascape 3.5 tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://metascape.org">http://metascape.org</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Mani Ramaswami as Reviewing Editor and Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Richard A Baines (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were impressed by the work, as well as the quality and interest of your observations and conclusions. However, there was a concern that the conclusion that Spn regulates synaptic plasticity through Mical-dependent control of actin dynamics was insufficiently supported, and also that the connection between NMJ mechanisms and MB mechanisms needs further clarification.

However, this is not an easy paper to read and requires the reader to continually move between two sets of figures and a data table. Case in point is Figure 5f, expression of UAS-Mica(δ) redox: the effect on QC is reported as ns, but there is clearly an increase in QC in the presence of this transgene that looks 'similar to' the increase reported as significant for UAS-Mical. P values in the data table indicate P = 0.0056, 0.0224, and 0.2519, respectively (thus supporting the stated conclusion). The latter is tested using a t-test (normalised data), whilst the former two by Mann-Whitney (non-normal). Given this is the same type of data, why are some normally distributed when others are not? Moreover, the statistics section in the methods reports a comparison of 3 or more groupings that were analysed by ANOVA. The graph as presented suggests all data was analysed at the same time, but one must assume that they were analysed as 3 x pairings. Perhaps breaks in the X-axis could be used to denote separate data. It would also aid the reader if figure legends for main text figures could be enhanced to include actual P values, n, and stats tests used, at least for certain data (as described above). I appreciate, however, that we all must adhere to journal-style requirements.</p><p>Indeed, the data table sometimes lists a t-test alone as being used, but sometimes with Welch's correction utilised for what seems to be identical data (Figure 5D). The latter correction is not described in the methods section. The inclusion of a description of why data from the same synapse might differ in its distribution (normal vs not-normal) would be helpful for those not expert in this preparation.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>With reference to the increase in QC in spn (10 min PHP, Figure 1i) – the variability of the observed increase is greater than that of the <italic>w1118</italic> control (being sig diff at only 0.05). Whilst this does not detract from the overall conclusion that spn is not required for PHP induction, the greater variance suggests that it does, nevertheless, have some organising role at this earlier time point. This point should be better discussed as the conclusion of this experiment, as presented, is too binary (no effect on PHP induction, required for maintenance). Note the use of black circles for w118 in figures often obscures the average/SEM bars. Perhaps grey could be used for the circles and black for the bars?</p><p>Whilst presynaptic expression of Spn is sufficient to rescue the Spn phenotype at the NMJ, did the authors also test post-synaptic rescue? Could it be the case that Spn can be localised either pre or post to have an effect?</p><p>Cycloheximide is reported to have no effect on the activity of Spn. However, without a positive control, it is difficult to know if this experiment was conducted appropriately – How to be sure that the feeding regime / acutely used dose was adequate?</p><p>It would be interesting to speculate whether Spn directly binds Syd-1 or not. Syd-1 is shown in Figure 3B – but not discussed in the results – is this a significant level of Syd-1? The legend of Figure 3 refers the reader to Figure s3 – but there is no proteomic data displayed in the latter.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86084.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Spn, Syd1 double mutants can support PHP: if this suppression is through Mical, then one would predict that Mical levels should also be normalized in the Spn, Syd1 double mutants.

To test this, we now immunostained for Mical in wildtype, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants and <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with <italic>syd-1</italic> heterozygosity. Indeed, in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with <italic>syd-1</italic> heterozygosity, Mical levels were comparable to wildtype NMJs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 c-d). We have added this novel finding to the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Interestingly, NMJ Mical levels are also subject to Spn/Syd-1 antagonism. <italic>Syd-1</italic> heterozygosity in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants resulted in a reestablishment of Mical levels comparable to wildtype NMJs (Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 c-d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) During olfactory conditioning: (a) synaptic changes are restricted to specific compartments of the MB; and (b) unlike homeostatic potentiation of transmitter release at the NMJ, one observes depression of transmitter release from Kenyon cell terminals. This makes it necessary to: (i) examine and report whether Brp and Unc13A levels are specific to compartments in the MB that participate in aversive conditioning (if this has been previously done, then please refer to the appropriate publication and relevant figure)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to discuss this fully justified comment in detail, and are aware that our findings open up questions that need to be worked out in the future. As correctly pointed out, the <italic>acute, immediate</italic> formation of aversive short-term memory (STM) indeed was previously shown to trigger synaptic depression at the KC&gt;MBON synapse in the respective MB compartment (Cohn, Morantte, and Ruta 2015; Hige et al. 2015; Owald and Waddell 2015). Of note here, our genetic manipulations do not affect the <italic>acute, immediate</italic> formation of aversive STM, therefore we do not a priori assume that the Spn-mediated AZ remodeling results in synaptic depression. We favor the idea that our plasticity mechanism executes a post-conditioning aftermath critical for consolidating memories over time. This derives from the consideration that synaptic weights, in all likelihood, have to get re-normalized in the MB circuitry after the acute, immediate STM encoding depression. To reiterate, AZ remodeling is indeed fully dispensable for STM, as shown in this manuscript, as well as in Turrel et al. (Turrel et al. 2022). Instead, we find a critical role for AZ remodeling for longer term (1 hr and 3 hr olfactory memory), in both this manuscript (Figure 7 a-d, S8 a-b) and also in our previous analysis (Turrel et al. 2022). We thus think that one possibility to explain these findings is that the BRP/Unc13A increases that we observe promote potentiation in the MB network to facilitate such a renormalization. In order for individual KCs to reestablish their overall excitation/inhibition balance, such regulation would not necessarily have to be compartment-specific.</p><p>Still, we fully admit that the exact relation of the AZ remodeling described in this paper, to STM depression specifically, and KC presynaptic plasticity in general, is currently unknown. Specifically, we cannot at this time tell (i) whether the conditioning-associated presynaptic remodeling is indeed potentiating KC and MB AZs, (ii) whether at all overlapping sets of synapses are involved in STM and MTM formation and (iii) consequently whether our longer-term AZ remodeling should be compartment specific. Protocols which would allow us to satisfactorily follow synapse physiology along the memory forming and conditioning time axis by using electrophysiology, are currently non-existing and that their development would be challenging. What we <italic>can</italic> say, however, is that the molecular machinery which executes structural remodeling at NMJ AZs (here associated with a homeostatic stabilization of NMJ transmission strength due to an increase of quantal content) is critically needed for MTM formation within the MB intrinsic neurons.</p><p>We did observe specificity of our AZ plasticity mechanism in the distinct MB lobe systems, in our previous work. Notably, the distinct MB lobe systems have been found to have different importance for the distinct memory components. STM and LTM were shown to be encoded in γ KCs and α/β KCs respectively (Pascual and Preat 2001; Qin et al. 2012; Blum et al. 2009). Previous reports have shown that early memory requires transmission from the α/β, α′/β′, and γ KCs (Cervantes-Sandoval et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2008; McGuire, Le, and Davis 2001). Both α/β and γ KCs are also involved in memory retrieval at 2–3 hr (Xie et al. 2013; Isabel, Pascual, and Preat 2004) when both ARM and MTM can be measured. Concerning the specificity of AZ remodeling, distinct MB lobes are of importance for the role of AZ remodeling in MTM, as in Turrel et al. we showed that α/β lobe neurons were the most important as described in the following paragraph (Turrel et al. 2022) (Figure 1 A-G):</p><p>“1 h after training, animals displayed BRP and even more pronounced Unc13A level increases. At 3 h post training, average MB BRP levels plateaued, whereas Unc13A levels increased further (Figure 1B). Syd-1 levels reached a significant increase only 3 h after training (Figure 1B). We indeed found that the kinetics and extent of AZ changes differed here: in α/β lobes, BRP and Unc13A levels increased 1 and 3 h after conditioning, whereas Syd-1 levels increased only at 1 h (Figure 1D). In α’/β’ neurons, BRP, Syd-1, and Unc13A increased at 1 and 3 h (Figure 1E). In γ lobes, Unc13A only increased at 3 h, whereas BRP showed an increase at 1 h but went back to baseline at 3 h (Figure 1F), the latter mirroring the changes observed using the STAR system by Zhang et al. (Zhang et al. 2018). Notably, at the MB calyx, no significant intensity changes were observed after paired conditioning (Figure 1G), suggesting that the changes are at least particularly pronounced in the MB lobes dominated by the AZ of KCs. However, MB lobes staining also contains contributions of other neuronal populations, particularly dopaminergic neurons (DANs). To test for the specific contribution of the MB KCs, we expressed an RNA interference (RNAi) construct against BRP using the KC generic driver OK107-Gal4. Consequently, different from <italic>w1118</italic> and Gal80ts;OK107/+ controls, neither BRP nor Unc13A levels increased significantly after paired conditioning in flies expressing a BRP-directed RNAi in adult MB KCs, suggesting an important role for BRP driven plasticity at KC AZs for this conditioning-associated plasticity (Figure S1C).”</p><p>Our strategy for this work was to use the NMJ PhTx assay to identify proteins involved in AZ remodeling that could also be involved in memory formation in adult flies. As said, as of now, we have no experimental evidence of whether the AZ remodeling observed in the MB actually leads to synaptic depression, or whether it is instead downstream of the initial short-term synaptic depression. This study and Turrel et al. (Turrel et al. 2022), however, provide evidence for an overlap of the executory machinery involved in both NMJ PHP plasticity and MTM formation, as BRP, Spn, Arl8, IMAC and Aplip1 are involved specifically both in mid-term NMJ PHP (at 30 min after PhTx treatment) and in MTM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Explain how Syd-1 could be involved in both presynaptic facilitation (NMJ) and depression (MB).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important and particularly interesting aspect of this work. We previously found that Syd-1 levels are significantly increased 1 h after conditioning in in the α/β and α’/β’ lobes (Turrel et al. 2022), while Syd-1 levels are not increased 10 min after PhTx treatment at the NMJ (Bohme et al. 2019). This finding indicates that some of the AZ proteins may be affected differently in the two plasticity processes i.e. they are not always modulated identically. Most importantly, however, we consistently find that Syd-1 counteracts Spn-executed structural, functional and behavioral plasticity: (i) loss of a single <italic>Syd-1</italic> gene copy “rescues” the PhTx triggered PHP and BRP remodeling deficit of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants. Here, <italic>Syd-1</italic> mutants continue to show elevated levels of BRP whereas wildtype animals show a transient increase in BRP followed by a return to baseline (Figure 2 m-n). (ii) reduction of Syd-1 rescued the memory display/formation provoked by Spn knockdown (Figure 7k). Lacking a temporally extended in vivo electrophysiological analysis on memory associated changes, we cannot determine the exact functional changes associated with memory consolidation, the process we show to depend on AZ remodeling controlled by the Spn/Syd-1 antagonism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In general, the work appears to be of high quality and the conclusions drawn fit the data shown.

The reviewer is right in observing that there is a statistically insignificant increase in QC upon UAS-MicaldRedox expression in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, while there are statistically significant increases in QC upon UAS-Mical or UAS-Spn expression in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants when 3 separate t tests were performed (Figure 5). When ANOVA was performed on the raw data comparing all 6 groups simultaneously, there were no statistically significant changes between any of the groups (Figure S6). Importantly, however, the recovery in evoked release upon UAS-Mical and UAS-Spn expression in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants was very clear in both the normalized and the raw data. In contrast, there was no recovery of evoked release upon UAS-MicaldRedox expression in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, supporting our conclusion that the redox activity of Mical is important for PHP. The statistically insignificant increase in QC upon UAS-MicaldRedox expression in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants could result from the fact that QC is calculated from the experimentally measured evoked and mini amplitudes and the mini amplitudes of this genotype are slightly (importantly, statistically insignificantly) lower than PhTx treated UAS-Mical and UAS-Spn groups.</p><p>We admit that it is not particularly easy to move between the main and supplementary figures and the text. Most papers addressing PHP at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ show normalized data in the main figures and raw data as supplementary figures, however. Normalization of the PhTx treated genotypes with the corresponding untreated control aids in assessing the effect on PHP, which is the primary question addressed in this study. Though we already went through efforts to improve the figures as suggested, we are certainly open to suggestions to improving the layout of the figures and thus allow for an easier access to the manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now added further description of the statistical tests used, specifically the usage of unpaired t-test with Welch's correction which was used when the standard deviations cannot be assumed to be equal amongst the datasets, as determined by F-test for comparing the variances or standard deviations from two populations. Furthermore, as a test for normality, D'Agostino and Pearson test was utilized, and Mann-Whitney U test, or 2 way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test were performed. The differences in the distribution of the data in terms of normality is likely the result of the relatively small n in these experiments, and addition of more data points would likely have resulted in normal distribution of datasets that are currently statistically tested as non-normal. These tests for normality, variance and statistical significance with corrections are used widely in similar studies.</p><p>We have now described the statistical methods used in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“Outliers were excluded using the ROUT method. In all data sets with two groups, unpaired t-test was performed. Unpaired t-test with Welch's correction which was used when the standard deviations could not be assumed to be equal amongst the datasets, as determined by F-test for comparing the variances or standard deviations from two populations. For all data sets with three or more groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used. As a test for normality, D'Agostino and Pearson test was utilized. For all data failing normality test, Mann-Whitney U test was used and 2 way ANOVA followed by Holm-Sidak's multiple comparisons test was used for grouped analyses. Statistical parameters are stated in the figure legends and all values of mean, SEM and statistical parameters are provided in table S1. Data is represented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance is denoted in the graphs as asterisks: *, p &lt; 0.05; **, p &lt; 0.01; ***, p &lt; 0.001; ns. (not significant), p &gt; 0.05.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific points:</p><p>With reference to the increase in QC in spn (10 min PHP, Figure 1i) – the variability of the observed increase is greater than that of the w1118 control (being sig diff at only 0.05). Whilst this does not detract from the overall conclusion that spn is not required for PHP induction, the greater variance suggests that it does, nevertheless, have some organising role at this earlier time point. This point should be better discussed as the conclusion of this experiment, as presented, is too binary (no effect on PHP induction, required for maintenance).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is fully right in suggesting that Spn has a general role to play in AZ organization and therefore may have an organizing, albeit not strictly essential, role for PHP upon 10min PhTx treatment as well. However, the variance visible in the normalized data is not reflected in the raw data in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 j. We have now tempered our statement about Spn’s role at this earlier time point in the discussion as follows:</p><p>“Like BRP itself, Spn is <italic>per se</italic> dispensable for PHP induction in the tested paradigms. This said, however, a relatively bigger variance in the evoked release responses of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants was observed (Figure 1h), indicating that <italic>Spn</italic> mutants are not completely unaffected also concerning the induction phase of homeostatic plasticity. Induction and maintenance mechanisms might indeed be linked in more complex ways, which remain to be worked out in the future.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Whilst presynaptic expression of Spn is sufficient to rescue the Spn phenotype at the NMJ, did the authors also test post-synaptic rescue? Could it be the case that Spn can be localised either pre or post to have an effect?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer here suggested an important experiment. We reported previously that presynaptic expression of Spn rescues the developmental <italic>Spn</italic> phenotype at the NMJ (Muhammad et al. 2015), while postsynaptic expression does not (data not shown). The evoked potentials in PhTx-untreated controls remain low upon muscle expression of Spn in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants, i.e. the baseline phenotype of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants was not rescued by postsynaptic muscle expression (previous unpublished data and Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 n). We therefore had not tried muscle expression of Spn in the PhTx experiments in this manuscript, but now did so in the context of the revision. In the new data, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with <italic>Mef2</italic>-Gal4 driven muscle expression of Spn, when under PhTx challenge, indeed showed a modest increase in quantal content compared to <italic>Spn</italic> mutants. However, the compensation did not occur to the same extent as with motor neuron expression of Spn. Thus, muscle expression of Spn also seems able to somewhat milden the complete loss of Spn for PHP. Furthermore, muscle expression of Spn did not rescue the BRP incorporation deficit of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants during PHP (data not shown). We have now added the following in the manuscript:</p><p>“Full-length Spn, exclusively expressed in the postsynaptic muscle cells, using the <italic>Mef2</italic>-Gal4 driver, did not rescue the PHP-dependent BRP incorporation deficit of <italic>Spn</italic> mutants (data not shown). Moreover, in PhTx-untreated controls, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with muscle expression of full-length Spn had reduced evoked amplitudes when compared to controls (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 n). Upon PhTx treatment, <italic>Spn</italic> mutants with muscle expression of full-length Spn showed a modest increase in quantal content (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2 c, j-o), however, not to the same extent as with motor neuron expression of Spn. Thus, muscle expression of Spn also seems able to somewhat milden the complete loss of Spn for PHP, albeit through mechanisms independent of BRP. We therefore focused our analysis on presynaptic Spn in the following experiments.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cycloheximide is reported to have no effect on the activity of Spn. However, without a positive control, it is difficult to know if this experiment was conducted appropriately – How to be sure that the feeding regime / acutely used dose was adequate?</p></disp-quote><p>As this is certainly a relevant concern which we shared, we replicated two different protocols of cycloheximide application used in previous studies: (a) direct application of cycloheximide to the NMJ during a semi-intact preparation as described in Böhme et al., 2019 (Bohme et al. 2019) and (b) feeding of cycloheximide as described in Tully et al., 1994 (Tully et al. 1994). Both protocols allowed for PHP at 10 min in our hands. As the latter protocol in adult flies was shown to eliminate long-term memory (Tully et al. 1994), we feel rather safe with our conclusion. We are afraid that given the absence of in vivo compatible assays for in situ monitoring of translation over a timeframe of only few minutes we cannot do more in the current moment. We now express this limitation with the following sentence in the manuscript:</p><p>“Given the lack of assays allowing for acute in vivo monitoring of local neuronal translation in our system, we cannot be fully sure about the effectiveness of our intervention, however.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be interesting to speculate whether Spn directly binds Syd-1 or not. Syd-1 is shown in Figure 3B – but not discussed in the results – is this a significant level of Syd-1?</p></disp-quote><p>It is a great suggestion of the reviewer to mention our previous findings at this point, as Spn and Syd-1 do in fact bind each other Figure 5C in (Muhammad et al. 2015). We now mention this explicitly in the discussion:</p><p>“PHP in <italic>Spn</italic> mutants could be reinstated by attenuating Syd-1 levels by removing a single <italic>syd-1</italic> gene copy, extending the developmental role of Spn/Syd-1 antagonism into PHP. Interestingly, Spn and Syd-1 also bind each other as shown through yeast-2-hybrid assay (Muhammad et al. 2015) and co-immunoprecipitation (this study). Future work could lead to an understanding on how their physical association steers their complementary functions.”</p><p>All highlighted proteins in Figure 3 were selected because they were statistically significantly enriched in the immunoprecipitation.</p><p>Blum, A.
