In this study, we used an emerging mammalian model of epimorphic regeneration, the African spiny mouse, to examine cell-based inflammation and tested the hypothesis that macrophages are necessary for regeneration. By directly comparing inflammatory cell activation in a 4 mm ear injury during regeneration (<italic>Acomys cahirinus</italic>) and scarring (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), we found that both species exhibited an acute inflammatory response, with scarring characterized by stronger myeloperoxidase activity. In contrast, ROS production was stronger and more persistent during regeneration. By depleting macrophages during injury, we demonstrate a functional requirement for these cells to stimulate regeneration. Importantly, the spatial distribution of activated macrophage subtypes was unique during regeneration with pro-inflammatory macrophages failing to infiltrate the regeneration blastema. Together, our results demonstrate an essential role for inflammatory cells to regulate a regenerative response.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24623.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24623.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24623.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells of the immune system are essential to defend an organism from disease. In addition, some of them are also thought to play an important role in helping injured tissues heal or even regrow. For example, when an animal is injured, immune cells such as macrophages rush to the wounded site to clear debris and help repair the damage. Macrophages come in different forms and subtypes, and express different protein markers on their surface, depending on where in the body they reside.</p><p>Few mammals can completely renew or regrow a damaged tissue – a process known as tissue regeneration. Instead, humans and most other mammals repair injuries by producing scar tissue, which has different properties compared to the original tissue it replaces. One exception is the African spiny mouse, which, unlike other rodents studied, can regrow skin and fur, nerves, muscles, and even cartilage. It has been shown that in highly regenerative animals such as salamanders and zebrafish, macrophages are necessary to initiate tissue regeneration. Documented cases of tissue regeneration in mammals are rare and therefore less understood. Until now, it was not clear why two species as closely related as spiny mice and house mice would heal identical injuries in different ways.</p><p>To better understand how new tissue regenerates, Simkin et al. compared the healing abilities of spiny mice and house mice after they received an injury to their ear and showed that macrophages appeared to be important for both the regeneration of new tissue and the formation of scar tissue. When Simkin et al. removed all macrophages in the ear of spiny mice, their ear tissue could not heal and regrow. When the macrophages were allowed to re-invade the injured site, the tissue in the ear regenerated. Further experiments showed that during tissue regeneration and scarring, different subtypes of macrophages appeared to be active.</p><p>The findings suggest that specific subtypes of macrophages could be a key element in helping tissue to regenerate. An important next step will be to further explore the different types of macrophages and whether the injury site determines what types of cells are active. A deeper understanding of how tissues can regrow in mammals will be essential to advancing our ability to stimulate tissue regeneration in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24623.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24623.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Acomys</kwd><kwd>epimorphic regeneration</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Office for International Science and Engineering IOS 1353713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seifert</surname><given-names>Ashley W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007472</institution-id><institution>University of Kentucky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Simkin</surname><given-names>Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inflammatory cells differentially regulate a scarring versus a regenerating response to injury in mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past three decades, regenerative biology has merged its rich historical practice with new genetic tools to discover how animals are capable of regenerating tissue and organs. Regeneration biologists commonly investigate organ regeneration in a range of metazoans including hydra, planarians, crickets, zebrafish, salamanders, newts, lizards and even some mammals. Conventional studies perturb cellular functions or genetic pathways to inhibit the normal regenerative response and thus seek to identify key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the regenerative response to injury. Alternatively, some investigators have employed a comparative approach to discover key mechanisms underlying regeneration. In this framework, two related species undergo different responses to injury in identical tissues and exhibit either a regenerative or a scarring response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Sikes and Bely, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wagner and Misof, 1992</xref>). This comparative approach may be particularly useful for unraveling complex interactions such as how inflammation and immunity permit, instruct or inhibit local cells to initiate and undergo functional regeneration in lieu of scarring.</p><p>Exactly how cellular inflammation and immunity affect regeneration remains controversial. One perspective posits that inflammation impedes regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mescher et al., 2017</xref>), a view supported by reports of less robust immune responses in animals and tissue that regenerate when compared to those that cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brant et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mescher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Redd et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, chronic inflammation leads to compromised healing and fibrotic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Martin and Leibovich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Riches, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wynn, 2004</xref>). However, physical injury elicits inflammation during regeneration <italic>and</italic> scarring. Specifically, cytokines and chemokines produced by neutrophils, macrophages and T-cells recruit fibroblasts, promote granulation tissue formation, activate myofibroblasts, and promote collagen production and deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aliprantis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lakos et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mori et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ong et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Smith et al., 1995</xref>). Dampening the inflammatory response by depleting leukocytes creates better healing outcomes following damage to skin, skeletal muscle, and liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dovi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duffield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Novak et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, when one considers that injury-mediated inflammation and immunity is an ancient process shared by animals (and plants) that can and cannot regenerate, a more nuanced relationship between regeneration and immunity emerges.</p><p>Mounting evidence suggests that certain immune cells may be necessary to induce and sustain regeneration. Depletion of phagocytic cells (e.g. macrophages and dendritic cells) inhibits regeneration in axolotl limbs, zebrafish fins, and neonatal mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aurora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the timing of leukocyte depletion has a major impact on regenerative outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duffield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Varga et al., 2016</xref>) supporting an important role for changing immune cell phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gensel and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Koh and DiPietro, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mantovani et al., 2013</xref>). Although these findings support a positive function of certain immune cells on regeneration, they also simplify important differences across species. For instance, salamanders lack important T-cell phenotypes and utilize primarily IgM rather than IgG antibodies while mounting an adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen and Robert, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cotter et al., 2008</xref>). While this diversity is of interest to biologists, it may obscure the goal of regenerative medicine -- to induce regeneration in humans. This makes mammalian models of tissue regeneration especially relevant to questions regarding what role immune cells play during regeneration.</p><p>Since first described by Markelova (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vorontsova and Liosner, 1960</xref>), ear pinna regeneration has remained an interesting example of musculoskeletal regeneration in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goss and Grimes, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joseph and Dyson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matias Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Seifert et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Williams-Boyce and Daniel, 1980</xref>). Recent work in African spiny mice species (<italic>Acomys cahirinus, A. kempi and A. percivali</italic>) supports ear pinna regeneration as an epimorphic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>) aligning it with appendage regeneration in other vertebrate regenerators such as salamanders, newts, zebrafish and lizards. Importantly, not all mammals can regenerate ear tissue providing variation to compare regeneration and scarring in identical tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Williams-Boyce and Daniel, 1986</xref>). Spiny mice are able to regenerate full-thickness skin, blood vessels, nerves, cartilage, adipose tissue and some muscle, whereas the same injury in <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (outbred and inbred strains) leads to incomplete ear hole closure and scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Matias Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Seifert et al., 2012a</xref>). Here, we report how the two main orchestrators of inflammation, neutrophils and macrophages, respond to injury during epimorphic regeneration in <italic>Acomys cahirinus</italic> compared to scarring in <italic>Mus musculus. Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> exhibit the same circulating leukocyte profiles, and we demonstrate a robust acute inflammatory response in both species. We demonstrate higher neutrophil activity in the scarring system compared to higher ROS activity in the regenerative system. We show that macrophages between the two species display similar <italic>in vitro</italic> properties providing a comparable baseline prior to and following injury. We also observed distinct differences in the spatiotemporal distribution of macrophage subtypes during regeneration and scarring. Finally, depletion of macrophages, prior to and during injury, inhibited blastema formation and regeneration, thus demonstrating a necessity for these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Circulating leukocyte profiles are similar between <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic></title><p>We first set out to test if baseline differences in circulating peripheral white blood cell (WBC) profiles existed prior to injury in <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic>. Using a Sudan Black B modified Giemsa-Wright stain, we quantified monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils from <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> whole blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Both species exhibited similar profiles and typical morphologies for all four cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>). For instance, monocytes were distinguishable by their kidney-shaped nucleus and diffuse cytoplasmic stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), while lymphocytes were similar in size to RBCs and their compact nucleus filled the entire cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Polymorphonuclear neutrophils stained strongly with Sudan-Black B and displayed multi-lobed nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, while eosinophils displayed multi-lobed nuclei and dark pink granules in the cytoplasm they contained few if any Sudan-Black-stained granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In <italic>Mus</italic> and <italic>Acomys</italic>, the percentage of circulating lymphocytes was significantly higher than other leukocyte populations, and eosinophils comprised the smallest population of circulating leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (Tukey’s Multiple comparison, simple effect p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These data are consistent with other leukocyte profiles from outbred CD1 mice showing that lymphocytes comprise the highest percentage of circulating WBCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hedrich, 2004</xref>).

This population of Ly6G+ cells was significantly elevated in healing tissue between D1-D7, with peak numbers occurring at D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Whereas Ly6G+/CD11b+ cells dominated the injury site at D3 in <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref> -blue dots), these cells were replaced by a Ly6G-/CD11b+ population at D7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref> - red dots). Thus, during the initial wave of leukocyte recruitment in <italic>Mus</italic> (D1-5), CD11b+ cells are primarily neutrophils and at later stages of inflammation (D7-D15) CD11b+ cells are primarily macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

IBA-1 is an actin-binding protein active in macrophages and microglia and has been used to label cells in mouse, dog, cat, human and other primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Imai et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Köhler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pierezan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sasaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schmidt et al., 2016</xref>).

To track MPO activity in vivo we used luminol, a chemiluminescent compound that exhibits specific and high sensitivity for phagocyte-mediated MPO activity from neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gross et al., 2009</xref>). Due to its larger size and reduced cell permeability (compared to luminol), we used lucigenin to measure ROS production by NADPH oxidase. Lucigenin chemiluminescence is primarily attributed to macrophage activation, and to a lesser extent from endothelial cell and neutrophil populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tseng and Kung, 2012</xref>).

We isolated spiny mouse bone marrow as previously described for <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>) and activated these cells using Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor (M-CSF) to produce activated bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). After 1 week in culture, all BMDM were CD11b+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24623.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>In vitro activation assays shows <italic>Acomys</italic> macrophages can be polarized to express different markers.</title><p>(<bold>A–I</bold>) Bone-marrow-derived macrophages isolated from <italic>Acomys</italic> femurs are cultured with no cytokines (unstimulated, A, D, G) with IFNγ+LPS (M1, B, E, H) or with IL-4 (M2, C, F, I).

Classic activation assays stimulate BMDMs with the pro-inflammatory molecules interferon gamma (IFNγ) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) which specifically increase the expression of CD86 among other pro-inflammatory cell surface markers and cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Edwards et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hathcock et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Inaba et al., 1994</xref>). In response to IFNγ and LPS, <italic>Acomys</italic> BMDMs remained CD11b+ and upregulated CD86 compared to un-stimulated and M2 stimulated macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–F</xref>). Alternative activation with interleukin 4 (IL4) increases the expression of CD206 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stein et al., 1992</xref>) and Arginase 1 among other pro-reparative, cytoprotective genes. In response to IL-4, <italic>Acomys</italic> BMDMs remained CD11b+ and expressed CD206 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,I</xref>). In contrast, most unstimulated and classically activated BMDMs were CD206- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G–H</xref>). In addition to CD206, stimulation with IL-4 also elicited Arginase 1 reactivity in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We also isolated and activated BMDMs from <italic>Mus</italic> and confirmed they display a similar pattern of protein regulation in response to polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J–R</xref>). In addition to these phenotypic markers, we also tested the mouse pan macrophage marker F4/80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Austyn and Gordon, 1981</xref>) for its reactivity to <italic>Acomys</italic> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using unstimulated BMDMs, we only found a small subset of F4/80+ cells in <italic>Acomys</italic> compared to ubiquitous labeling in <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,D</xref>). Following IFNγ+LPS stimulation, we observed an increase in F4/80+ <italic>Acomys</italic> macrophages, whereas IL-4 stimulation did not increase F4/80 labeling compared to unstimulated BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Examining F4/80 staining in vivo, we found that F4/80+ cells were distinct from CD206+ cells in Acomys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In contrast, we found that F4/80+ cells were mostly CD206+ in <italic>Mus</italic> supporting its localization as a pan macrophage marker in <italic>Mus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that F4/80 only marks a subset of macrophages in <italic>Acomys</italic> (most likely M1). Despite this difference in F4/80 reactivity, our in vitro results show intrinsic similarities between <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> macrophages supporting a general capacity to activate and change phenotype given specific wound contexts and stimuli.</p><p>Next, we addressed whether differences in the spatiotemporal distribution of macrophage subtypes might promote regeneration in lieu of scarring.

Comparing CD86+ cells distal to the injury between species, we found a significant effect of time (two-way ANOVA F = 131.8, p&lt;0.0001) and species (two-way ANOVA F = 220.0, p&lt;0.0001) whereby injury elicited a strong increase in CD86+ cells per unit area in <italic>Mus</italic>, but not in <italic>Acomys</italic> at D3 (Sidak's multiple comparison test p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Examining the spatial distribution of CD86+ cells in <italic>Mus</italic>, we found that they accumulated in the connective tissue distal to the cut cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Co-staining with the T-cell surface marker CD3 revealed interactions between CD86+ and CD3+ cells in this region as well as in the epidermis, consistent with the role of CD86 as a co-stimulatory molecule for T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In contrast to <italic>Mus</italic>, CD86+ macrophages behaved very differently in <italic>Acomys</italic> during regeneration. Following injury, we did not observe CD86+ cells accumulating in the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Instead, at D15 we observed clusters of CD86+ cells located almost exclusively lateral to the cut cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, while CD86+ cells are present in <italic>Acomys</italic>, they remain proximally restricted and do not infiltrate the blastema, whereas these same cells in <italic>Mus</italic> accumulate in newly deposited connective tissue (granulation tissue).</p><p>Although alternatively activated (M2) macrophages are usually associated with pro-regenerative outcomes, this concept remains largely untested for epimorphic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kigerl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Using our comparative system, we tested for an association between CD206+ (M2) macrophages and a regenerative response. Prior to injury, CD206+ cells were spatially distributed throughout the ear in similar numbers in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). These cells were present in the dermis between the epidermis and elastic cartilage of the ear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). We did not detect CD206+ cells in the epidermis in either species. Quantifying CD206+ cells distal to the injury in <italic>Mus</italic> and <italic>Acomys</italic>, we observed no significant difference across time (two-way ANOVA, F = 2.330, p=0.125) or between species (two-way ANOVA, F = 1.540, p=0.23) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). After D3, CD206+ cell numbers remained constant in <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> and showed no significant change distal to the injury site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Unlike CD86+ cells that localize proximal to the injury in <italic>Acomys</italic>, CD206+ cells were observed distal to the injury site in <italic>Acomys</italic> (and <italic>Mus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>). However, the distal distribution of these cells in <italic>Acomys</italic> appeared regionalized with a CD206+ dense region directly beneath the epidermis and a CD206+ sparse region in the central blastema region of the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In <italic>Mus</italic>, CD206+ cells were evenly distributed throughout the connective tissue distal to the injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Together with our data for IBA-1, our results show that while macrophages infiltrate the injury area during regeneration, the blastema is relatively free of classically activated macrophages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A popular hypothesis to explain why most mammals heal injuries with scar tissue is that they evolved a strong inflammatory and adaptive immune response that induces intense fibrosis in lieu of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Godwin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Mescher et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, the fact that some mammals exhibit epimorphic regeneration (e.g. rodent and primate digit tips, rabbit and spiny mice ear punches and skin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Borgens, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Goss and Grimes, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Joseph and Dyson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Neufeld and Zhao, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Seifert et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Singer et al., 1987</xref>) suggests that regeneration can occur despite a complex adaptive immune system. Different immune system components and inherent physiological differences between mammals and traditional regeneration models like salamanders, newts and zebrafish (e.g. homeothermy versus poikilothermy, high versus low metabolic rates, etc.) make it difficult to extrapolate how inflammation and immunity might act to affect regeneration in mammals. There have been few studies detailing how the immune system responds during epimorphic regeneration and thus how it compares to immune mediated fibrosis. In this study, we have begun to address how inflammatory cells behave during complex tissue regeneration in African spiny mice (<italic>Acomys</italic>). We identified key differences in the spatiotemporal infiltration of inflammatory cells in regenerating and scar-forming systems and demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) catalyzed through NADPH oxidation were significantly increased at the injury site during regeneration. Importantly, we showed that macrophages were required for regeneration to proceed. These results support a role for inflammatory cell signals polarizing the injury response toward two very different outcomes.</p><p>Our characterization of circulating leukocyte profiles in <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic>, demonstrate that inherent differences in myeloid cell numbers do not explain intrinsic differences in regenerative ability. This contradicts a recent report suggesting that spiny mouse blood is neutropenic and that lower numbers of circulating neutrophils are responsible for a muted inflammatory response to injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brant et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, our immunohistochemical data comparing neutrophil infiltration in <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> show that while neutrophils accumulate faster during scarring, peak neutrophil numbers are equivalent 3 days after injury in both species. In general agreement with this data, we observed differences in the intensity of myeloperoxidase activity via luminol chemilumenscence persisting until D4 after which time there was no difference across species. While neutrophil invasion in response to injury is apparent across all regenerating vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jordan and Speidel, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Seifert et al., 2012b</xref>), our results suggest that precise activity levels could lead to different injury outcomes. While prolonged inflammation can antagonize regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Margalit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mescher et al., 2013</xref>), our data supports an initial wave of cell-based inflammation as a shared feature of any injury response, including regeneration.</p><p>Along with neutrophils, monocytes also infiltrate local tissue after injury, and converging evidence suggests that macrophages are required in some capacity for epimorphic regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Godwin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Petrie et al., 2014</xref>). Our results extend these vertebrate studies by demonstrating a similar requirement during epimorphic regeneration in mammals. Acute depletion of phagocytic monocytes with clodronate liposomes delayed the initiation of ear hole closure and blastema formation by up to 2 weeks. Importantly, re-commencement of blastema formation was concurrent with the return of macrophages into the injured tissue. Examination of ear tissue at D5 revealed that phagocyte depletion delayed re-epithelialization and histolysis, two key events that are themselves required for regeneration. It is possible that macrophages provide an initiating signal for regeneration or remove subpopulations of local cells secreting inhibitory signals (e.g. senescent cells). In support of the first idea, ROS production has been suggested as an essential early signal for regeneration based on studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish tail models of regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gauron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Love et al., 2013</xref>). Macrophages are a major source of ROS after injury, and we observed significantly stronger and prolonged ROS production during regeneration compared to scarring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Weber et al., 2016</xref>). Understanding the functional consequences of balanced ROS production through NADPH oxidation versus myeloperoxidase activity will require a more complete understanding of what cell types are responsible for ROS production and how ROS more specifically can affect local cellular phenotypes.</p><p>In support of the idea that macrophages may limit inhibitory signals through selective removal of senescent cells, recent work in salamanders suggested that clearance of senescent cells is important for limb regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Yun et al., 2015</xref>) and persistence of senescent cells during liver regeneration leads to excessive fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krizhanovsky et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, the accumulation of senescent cells with age has been suggested to shorten lifespan, degrade tissue function, and increase the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baker et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2011</xref>). These and other studies suggest that proper clearance of senescent cells from damaged tissues may promote regenerative outcomes. Interestingly, as the induction of cellular senescence occurs during normal wound healing when a scar forms, it is possible that clearance of senescent cells is less important than the secretory phenotype of these cells which in some contexts can promote regeneration. For instance, short exposure to factors secreted by senescent cells in response to injury decreases fibrosis and promotes stem cell gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Chiche et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Jun and Lau, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Ritschka et al., 2017</xref>). These studies underscore the importance of analyzing how senescent cells regulate regeneration and scarring and provide evidence that the phenotype of senescent cells and their timely removal by macrophages could be an important factor in <italic>Acomys</italic> ear regeneration.</p><p>While our data demonstrates that macrophages as a total population are required for regeneration in mammals, a requirement for macrophage subtypes and how these cells interact with other immune cells during epimorphic regeneration is not known. Because the activation of macrophages is generally associated with collagen production and fibrotic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duffield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gibbons et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Wynn, 2008</xref>), the question remains as to how these immune cells orchestrate both regeneration and scar-formation in different species. Previous studies suggest a temporal component to macrophage function as a major factor for determining the outcome to skin, liver and bone injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Duffield et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mirza et al., 2009</xref>). While we did not observe temporal differences in total macrophage accumulation between <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> in the ear pinna, we did observe distinct differences in the spatial distribution of macrophage subtypes. For instance, while M2 (CD206+) macrophages were present at comparable levels in <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic>, we observed a zone dense in CD206+ macrophages in <italic>Acomys</italic> that were associated with de novo hair follicle development and a zone sparse in CD206+ cells that were associated with an area of decreased collagen production and blastema formation. Whereas CD206+ cells were absent from the blastema in <italic>Acomys</italic>, in <italic>Mus</italic>, we observed CD206+ cells throughout the collagen-rich granulation tissue, a situation similar to fibrosis observed during skin wound repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Mirza and Koh, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Song et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Willenborg et al., 2012</xref>). The spatial restriction of CD206+ cells suggests unique interactions between macrophages and surrounding cells may drive differences in a pro-regenerative or pro-fibrotic environment.</p><p>On the other hand, it is possible that the local environment (cells and/or ECM) in regenerating systems drives immune cell profile instead of immune cells driving injury outcomes. We noted an accumulation of M1 macrophages (CD86+ cells) in injured <italic>Mus</italic> tissue, and the ability of CD86+ cells to interact with CD3+ T-cells is consistent with the role of CD86 as a co-stimulatory molecule that promotes T-cell activation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hathcock et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lanier et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Peng et al., 2013</xref>). Conversely, the <italic>Acomys</italic> blastema was mostly devoid of M1 macrophages and we did not observe CD86+/CD3+ interacting cells. This was not due to an inability to detect M1 macrophages in <italic>Acomys</italic>, as we readily observed these cells at the boundary between injured and uninjured tissue. Moreover, we found that <italic>Acomys</italic> macrophages up-regulated CD86 in vitro when classically activated in response to IFNγ and LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ding et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freedman et al., 1991</xref>). This shows that <italic>Acomys</italic> macrophages possess the intrinsic ability to express M1 markers (e.g. CD86) in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli, but may be inhibited from doing so within the blastema in vivo.</p><p>A recent report suggested that spiny mice regenerate skin because they lack a robust inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brant et al., 2016</xref>). While our findings contradict their primary conclusions, careful re-interpretation of their data supports the idea that inflammation occurs during regeneration and scarring, and that different inflammatory cell phenotypes polarize the response to injury. Brant et al. based their conclusions on three primary findings. First, they presented circulating leukocyte profiles showing spiny mice with lower neutrophils and higher lymphocytes in circulation when compared to CD1 mice and suggested this would lead to fewer neutrophils in spiny mice wounds. As we have shown, neutrophils indeed arrive at the wound bed and numbers are not significantly different three days post injury. Interestingly, our data for myeloperoxidase activity suggests that differences in neutrophil activity, rather than simple numerical differences, likely play a more important role during the injury response. Second, they were unable to detect macrophages in spiny mice wounds using F4/80 and concluded no macrophages infiltrated regenerating skin wounds. Using a cross-species marker for total macrophages (IBA1), we show that macrophages indeed infiltrate an injury site. More importantly, we demonstrate that macrophages are <italic>required</italic> for regeneration. Instead, differential infiltration of macrophage subtypes exists between regeneration and scarring. While F4/80 may be a pan-macrophage marker in mice, studies have shown that this is not the case for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hamann et al., 2007</xref>), and it remains unclear if this is the case for other mammals. Our data shows that F4/80 marks a subset of macrophages with pro-inflammatory characteristics in <italic>Acomys</italic> (i.e. F4/80+ cells are increased with M1 stimulation in vitro and F4/80+ cells do not colocalize with the M2 marker, CD206, in vivo). When re-interpreted with this knowledge, their results align with our findings that reduced numbers of pro-inflammatory macrophages enter the wound site during regeneration or are present, but not activated toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Thirdly, using a cytokine array designed against mouse antigens they detected 30 cytokines during acute inflammation (D0-D7 post injury) in <italic>Mus</italic>, but only detected 12 of these cytokines in spiny mice during the same period. They interpreted the absence of 18 cytokines as an absence of these signals in spiny mice wounds. However, without validation of epitopes, failure to detect particular spiny mouse cytokines on a <italic>Mus</italic>-specific cytokine array does not reflect an absence of spiny mouse antigen. Moreover, of the 12 spiny mouse cytokines they did detect, 5 are classic pro-inflammatory markers (e.g. IL-1α, IL-1ß, IL-1ra, CXCL13 and IFNγ) that were upregulated in response to injury and present at similar levels to <italic>Mus</italic>. Thus, their spiny mouse cytokine data demonstrates strong acute inflammation in response to injury. Although nuances between regenerating dorsal skin wounds and complex tissue of the ear pinna are likely to exist, fine-tuning inflammatory responses is key to promoting scar-free outcomes.</p><p>Of the mammalian models of epimorphic regeneration that exist, very few have investigated how inflammatory cells affect blastema formation and regeneration. A forthcoming study on digit tip regeneration lends support to our conclusion that macrophages are required to help initiate regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Muneoka et al., 2017</xref>). Autoimmune-prone MRL mouse strains and their parent strain LgJ have been promoted as a mammalian regeneration model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 1998</xref>). Paradoxically, while these strains possess enhanced rates of healing, published reports across most injury models have demonstrated that they do not regenerate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Moseley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Smiley et al., 2014</xref>). Studies have documented that the healing response of the MRL mouse differs depending upon the type of injury, be it the ear pinna or other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beare et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Colwell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kench et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rajnoch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tolba et al., 2010</xref>). In the ear specifically, although 2 mm biopsy punches close and form new cartilage nodules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clark et al., 1998</xref>), larger holes and a 2 mm crush injury heal with excessive collagen deposition producing a scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawriluk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rajnoch et al., 2003</xref>). In our view, the use of MRL strains as purported regeneration models has obscured their potential utility for studying inflammation and fibrosis. Of interest, MRL mice have been extensively studied for their aberrant macrophage profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dang-Vu et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Donnelly et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Santoro et al., 1988</xref>). Bone marrow and peritoneal macrophages proliferate without CSF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hamilton et al., 1998</xref>), a rare observation among other strains of mice, and accumulation of macrophages is commonly observed in MRL tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davis and Lennon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yui et al., 1991</xref>). Macrophages in strains of MRL mice show higher production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> suggesting higher pro-inflammatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dang-Vu et al., 1987</xref>) and show increased expression of <italic>Tgfβ1</italic>, a growth factor implicated during increased fibrosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Border and Noble, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kench et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, MRL macrophages and their response to injury are unique in many respects. A detailed study of the immune response in MRL mice could instruct how inflammation guides fibrotic repair based on intrinsic and environmental tissue differences.</p><p>Macrophage phenotypes change based on environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Stout et al., 2005</xref>) and macrophages that infiltrate injured tissue exhibit temporal changes in gene and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Varga et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, cancer and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can drive macrophage phenotypes dampening the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). These observations underscore the fluid nature of macrophage phenotypes in response to injury and disease and support a model where different subtypes differentially affect healing outcomes. Although further work is needed to clarify macrophage activation phenotypes during regeneration, our results support the initial inflammatory environment as a potential source of pro-regenerative signals. Future studies in spiny mice will need to determine how specific immune cell types signal to local cells, whether macrophages induce change in the ECM and if these cells can be manipulated in a non-regenerative system. Future studies into the role of specific macrophage and other immune cell phenotypes will resolve the role of these cells in scar formation and regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care, 4 mm ear punch and tissue collection</title><p><italic>Acomys cahirinus</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (Swiss Webster Envigro_Harlan Hsd:ND4) were housed at the University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY. <italic>A. cahirinus</italic> were housed at a density of 10–15 individuals in metal wire cages (24 in. x 18 in. x 16 in., height x width x depth) (Quality Cage Company, Portland, OR) and fed a 3:1 mixture by volume of 14% protein mouse chow (Teklad Global 2014, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and black-oil sunflower seeds (Pennington Seed Inc., Madison, GA) 1x/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Haughton et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Mus</italic> were fed mouse chow only. <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic> mice were exposed to natural light, and all animals used were sexually mature.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Luisa DiPietro (Reviewer #2); David Stocum (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting paper opening new areas of mammalian regeneration research using the spiny mouse Acomys. Mammals repair tissue by scarring rather than regeneration and it is currently believed that is likely due to a robust adaptive immune system that favors fibrosis over regeneration. This is supported by indirect evidence from non-mammalian vertebrates such as urodeles, which regenerate successfully and possess relatively undeveloped adaptive immune systems when compared to mammals. In this paper, the authors used ear punch assays in both <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> to compare and contrast the macrophage responses in these animals during wound healing and regeneration. By directly comparing inflammatory cell activation in a 4 mm ear injury during regeneration (<italic>Acomys cahirinus</italic>) and scarring (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), the authors uncovered that the profiles of circulating leucocytes are similar in each. Both species mount an acute inflammatory response that differed in that <italic>Mus</italic> had higher myeloperoxidase activity and <italic>Acomys</italic> had higher ROS activity, which could be related to scarring vs. regeneration. Curiously, the authors also noted that the spatial distribution of activated macrophage subtypes was unique during regeneration with pro-inflammatory macrophages failing to infiltrate the regeneration blastema.</p><p>The analysis of leucocyte populations is meticulous and the data are consistent with the authors' conclusions. This paper chops away some of the undergrowth surrounding the idea that a highly developed adaptive immune system determines that scarring predominates over regeneration. Clearly, there is no large-scale difference between <italic>Mus</italic> and <italic>Acomys</italic> immune cells that determines the difference. To the contrary, an immune response is characteristic of both fibrosis and regeneration. Other, factors, therefore, appear to be in play in determining whether the outcome to wounding in mammals results in regeneration or fibrosis.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data presentation would improve if the authors were to provide a time-course schematic of the ear punch regeneration assay such that it could be used to follow the data presented. Although this sequence has been published, a summary diagram would be of great help in allowing the reader to interpret the data. This would let the reader easily understand the context of the time points examined in the current manuscript without having to dig up the prior paper.</p><p>2) The authors should spend considerably more time comparing, contrasting and explaining the differences that exist between the work reported in this manuscript ant the work of Brant et al. Additionally, a more scholarly discussion of the implications of the reported results and those of published findings for the MRL mouse should be attempted.</p><p>3) The data on macrophage polarization seems incomplete – what is the reason that the arginase assessment was not performed on <italic>Mus</italic>?</p><p>4) Neutrophils and macrophages have many functions in wound repair. They have bactericidal effects; macrophages are phagocytic; they release growth factors such as PDGF, TGF-β and HGF that promote epithelialization and fibroblast proliferation. Can the authors correlate the spatial findings here on macrophage location with growth factor production (or lack thereof), as assessed in previous papers?</p><p>5) The work of Maximinia Yun should be mentioned here. She has shown that macrophages in regenerating urodele limbs remove senescent cells and that this is obligatory for regeneration. The accumulation of senescent cells has also been implicated in the aging of organs; clearance of these cells preserves function (Baker et al., 2016). Removal of senescent cells could be a factor in <italic>Acomys</italic> ear tissue regeneration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24623.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Data presentation would improve if the authors were to provide a time-course schematic of the ear punch regeneration assay such that it could be used to follow the data presented.

This new figure provides a graph (A) showing the mean kinetics of ear hole closure as a function of days post injury during regeneration in <italic>Acomys</italic> and scarring in <italic>Mus</italic>. The second panel (B) presents the process of regeneration following a 4 mm ear punch. It shows whole mount photographs of the ear pinna in both species during healing and aligns key processes (e.g., inflammation, re-epithelialization, blastema formation, etc.) as a function of days post injury. We believe this figure will assist the reader in following our experimental timelines and tie specific days to the overall injury response.</p><p><italic>2) The authors should spend considerably more time comparing, contrasting and explaining the differences that exist between the work reported in this manuscript ant the work of Brant et al.</italic></p><p>We appreciate being encouraged to expand our Discussion to include this comparison in our manuscript. We agree that it is important to explain the differences reported in our study compared to the Brant et al., (2016) study that examined scar-free healing of dorsal skin wounds in spiny mice. Brant et al., (2016) concluded based on their data that spiny mice lack a robust inflammatory response and that this could partly explain their ability to regenerate skin. This conclusion was based on their data showing comparatively low numbers of neutrophils in circulation, an inability to detect macrophages in the wound bed following injury and a failure to detect many inflammatory cytokines during wound healing. Briefly, these authors did not present neutrophil data in skin wounds and relied solely on their circulating leukocyte profiles to <italic>infer</italic> that neutrophil numbers would be reduced at the injury site. While we cannot explain the discrepancy in leukocyte counts, in our study we increased biological replicates for <italic>Acomys</italic> (n=8) and used a modified Wright-Giemsa stain to clearly differentiate neutrophils based on Sudan Black incorporation into granules. The increased resolution of Sudan Black increases confidence in our own counts. Their failure to detect macrophages is based on the assumption that F4/80 is a pan-macrophage marker in spiny mice. This assumption is incorrect, a conclusion we arrived at during our own study. We believe this information is important enough to include and we have now supplemented our manuscript with additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. Our new data presents in vitro reactivity and in vivo co-localization data for F4/80 comparing <italic>Acomys</italic> and <italic>Mus</italic>. As is clear from our data, F4/80 is not a pan-macrophage marker in spiny mice, and its use as such by Brant et al., led to their conclusion that macrophages did not infiltrate skin wounds. In fact, it appears that F4/80 marks a subset of M1 macrophages in spiny mice. In this light, their data supports our finding that M1 macrophages as marked with CD86 or F4/80 do not infiltrate the blastema. Lastly, their spiny mouse cytokine data is based on a failure to detect over half of the cytokines included on the arrays they used. Instead of validating the arrays for spiny mice protein binding, they interpreted a lack of signal as an absence of the molecule. Again, a careful re-interpretation of some of their data actually lends support to our own conclusions. As per reviewers' request, we have distilled our comparisons and explanations of the differences between the two reports in a paragraph within the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Additionally, a more scholarly discussion of the implications of the reported results and those of published findings for the MRL mouse should be attempted.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ request for a more scholarly discussion of the MRL mouse and the published results purporting regeneration in this inbred strain. As the reviewers are no doubt aware, past and present work with this strain as it relates to regeneration has been fraught with controversy. In most instances, rigorous investigation of different injury paradigms have shown that, rather than regenerate, these mice exhibit increased inflammation and fibrosis in response to healing (e.g., skin – Colwell et al., 2006, Wound Repair and Regeneration;heart – Moseley et al., 2011, Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Smiley et al., 2014, Cardiovascular Pathology, etc.). However, there are reports supporting regeneration. Recently, our group demonstrated that MRL mice fail to close 4mm ear holes and instead produce fibrotic tissue to fill 2mm ear holes (Gawriluk et al., 2016. Nature Communications) a feat observed in other inbred strains (Reines et al., 2009, Rejuvenation Research, Kench et al., 1999, Clinical Immunology) and detailed for 2mm punch injuries in MRL mice (Rajnoch et al., 2003, Wound Repair and Regeneration). However, we believe that the MRL strain can be useful for understanding how inflammation directs fibrosis. Compared to normal mice, MRL mice exhibit: hematopoietic cells that overexpress TGFß1 at injury sites, increased macrophage recruitment to tissues during homeostasis and injury, and macrophages that produce higher levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, etc. These and other inflammatory cell anomalies in this strain may drive the increased fibrosis reported following injury. Thus, in response to the reviewer’s request, we have amended our Discussion and added a paragraph that addresses published data for the MRL mouse related to our findings. We have also included discussion of how this model might be useful for understanding how inflammation can regulate fibrosis.</p><p><italic>3) The data on macrophage polarization seems incomplete – what is the reason that the arginase assessment was not performed on Mus?</italic></p><p>We had performed this analysis previously, but excluded the data for space considerations. In light of the reviewer’s request we have now included data for in vitro localization of Arginase 1 and CD11b in <italic>Mus</italic> for comparison to the parallel studies run in <italic>Acomys</italic>. This data is now included in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M-O</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) Neutrophils and macrophages have many functions in wound repair. They have bactericidal effects; macrophages are phagocytic; they release growth factors such as PDGF, TGF-β and HGF that promote epithelialization and fibroblast proliferation. Can the authors correlate the spatial findings here on macrophage location with growth factor production (or lack thereof), as assessed in previous papers?</italic></p><p>We appreciate this comment and believe that quantifying growth factor production during regeneration would be very informative, especially as it relates to macrophage subtypes, re-epithelialization, cell proliferation and healing outcomes. There are several technical limitations we are trying to surmount in order to conduct this type of analysis in spiny mice and so at present we cannot provide the requested information for inclusion in this manuscript. The size of the ear pinna, and specifically the very small distance between the central (distal) part of the injury relative to the cut cartilage, make it extremely difficult to physically separate different areas within the tissue from early time points for downstream proteomic analysis. For instance, because we see CD86+ (M1) macrophages at the wound margin, but not in the blastema, we would have to ensure that proximal tissue was not included during tissue collection to correlate macrophage subtype and growth factor localization. Immunohistochemistry is the most viable option, and we are currently validating markers to downstream targets of these growth factor signaling pathways. Laser capture techniques might be possible in combination with proteomics, but this approach is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p><italic>5) The work of Maximinia Yun should be mentioned here. She has shown that macrophages in regenerating urodele limbs remove senescent cells and that this is obligatory for regeneration. The accumulation of senescent cells has also been implicated in the aging of organs; clearance of these cells preserves function (Baker et al., 2016). Removal of senescent cells could be a factor in Acomys ear tissue regeneration.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing a very exciting connection between the role of cellular senescence and tissue regeneration. In response to this request we have amended our Discussion to include a possible role for senescent cells during regeneration based partly on Dr. Yun’s work in salamanders and newts, and on data from other regeneration models. Senescent cells could also have a positive role depending on their phenotype and we include this in our amended discussion as well. Indeed, injury-induced induction of cellular senescence has been observed during limb regeneration in salamanders and newts (Yun et al., 2015, <italic>eLife</italic>) and preliminary work from our lab suggests a similar induction during regeneration in spiny mice <italic>and</italic> scarring in lab mice. Interestingly, injury induced cellular senescence and subsequent clearance by macrophages or natural killer cells occurs during normal wound repair when a scar forms (e.g., Kang et al., 2011, Nature,Krizhanovsky et al., 2008, Cell, etc.).In these cases clearance of senescent cells appears to limit fibrosis, but it does not induce regeneration. Unfortunately, Dr. Yun’s study was not able to directly test whether the persistence of senescent cells (or an increase in their number) could inhibit regeneration due to a lack of tools in the salamander model (e.g., depleting macrophages inhibits blastema formation). Thus, her work leaves open the possibility that the type of senescent cells present upon injury might have positive or negative effects. All told, this is an active area of research for many labs and we agree with the reviewers that removal of senescent cells could be an important factor in <italic>Acomys</italic> ear regeneration. Furthermore, that macrophages can remove senescent cells points to an intriguing role for macrophages during regeneration.</p></body></sub-article></article>
