migratory phenotype. Here, we show that KSR1 and ERK promote EMT-like phenotype through the preferential translation of Epithelial-Stromal Interaction 1 (EPSTI1), which is required to induce the switch from E- to N-cadherin and coordinate migratory and invasive behavior. EPSTI1 is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. Disruption of KSR1 or EPSTI1 significantly impairs cell migration and invasion in vitro, and reverses EMT-like phenotype, in part, by decreasing the expression of N-cadherin and the transcriptional repressors of E-cadherin expression, ZEB1 and Slug. In CRC cells lacking KSR1, ectopic EPSTI1 expression restored the E- to N-cadherin switch, migration, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. KSR1-dependent induction of EMT-like phenotype via selective translation of mRNAs reveals its underappreciated role in remodeling the translational landscape of CRC cells to promote their migratory and invasive behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The majority of cancer deaths result from tumor cells spreading to other parts of the body via a process known as metastasis. 90% of all cancers originate in epithelial cells that line the inner and outer surface of organs in our bodies. Epithelial cells, however, are typically stationary and must undergo various chemical and physical changes to transform in to migratory cells that can invade other tissues.</p><p>This transformation process alters the amount of protein cells use to interact with one another. For example, epithelial cells from the colon produce less of a protein called E-cadherin as they transition into migrating cancer cells and make another protein called N-cadherin instead. A protein called KSR1 is a key component of a signaling pathway that is responsible for generating the proteins colon cancer cells need to survive. But it is unknown which proteins KSR1 helps synthesize and whether it plays a role in the metastasis of colon cancer cells.</p><p>To investigate this, Rao et al. studied the proteins generated by cancerous colon cells cultured in the laboratory, in the presence and absence of KSR1. The experiment showed that KSR1 increases the levels of a protein called EPSTI1, which colon cancer cells need to transform into migratory cells. Depleting KSR1 caused cancer cells to generate less EPSTI1 and to share more features with healthy cells, such as higher levels of E-cadherin on their surface and reduced mobility. Adding EPSTI1 to the cancer cells that lacked KSR1 restored the traits associated with metastasis, such as high levels of N-cadherin, and allowed the cells to move more easily.</p><p>These findings suggest that KSR1 and EPSTI1 could be new drug targets for reducing, or potentially reversing, the invasive behavior of colon cancer cells. However, further investigation is needed to reveal how EPSTI1 is generated and how this protein helps colon cancer cells move and invade other tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>colon cancer cells</kwd><kwd>human organoids</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM121316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA036727</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>Robert E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key Ras-driven signaling pathway stimulates the preferential translation of an effector, EPSTI1, that is both necessary and sufficient for the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenotype in colorectal cancer cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecular scaffolds affect the intensity and duration of signaling pathways by coordinating a discrete set of effectors at defined subcellular locations to regulate multiple cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morrison and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pawson and Scott, 1997</xref>). Kinase Suppressor of Ras 1 (KSR1) serves as a scaffold for Raf, MEK, and ERK enabling the efficient transmission of signals within the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kortum and Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>). Although KSR1 is dispensable for normal development, it is necessary for oncogenic Ras-induced tumorigenesis including colorectal cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kortum and Lewis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fisher et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fisher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rao et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that KSR1 may modulate aberrant signals that redirect the function of effectors typically involved in normal cellular homeostasis. Activating Ras mutations are present in over 40 % of colorectal cancers (CRC), and associated with advanced disease and decreased overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haigis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Serebriiskii et al., 2019</xref>). Activated Ras, a critical driver of both tumor growth and survival, is an alluring therapeutic target, yet targeting the majority of oncogenic Ras alleles is still a work in progress. Raf/MEK/ERK signaling can phenocopy Ras signaling essential for CRC growth and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmitz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandt et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, understanding the effectors that transmit signals emanating from oncogenic Ras is a valuable step in detecting and targeting the pathways critical to tumor cell function and their adaptation to therapy.</p><p>Oncogene-driven signaling pathways promote mRNA translation that enables expression of a subset of mRNAs to promote growth, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avdulov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Truitt Morgan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pelletier et al., 2015</xref>). Tumor cells have an increased dependence on cap-dependent translation, unlike their normal complements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Truitt Morgan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Truitt and Ruggero, 2016</xref>). Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 4E (eIF4E) is a rate-limiting factor for oncogenic transformation, with reductions of as little as 40 % being sufficient to block tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Truitt Morgan et al., 2015</xref>). eIF4E function is regulated by association of 4E-binding proteins (4EBPs). Importantly, disruption of KSR1 or ERK inhibition leads to dephosphorylation and activation of 4EBP1, indicating that the function of KSR1 as an ERK scaffold is key to the aberrant regulation of mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCall et al., 2016</xref>). This tumor-specific, KSR1-dependent regulation of mRNA translation of a subset of genes was predicted to selectively promote survival of CRC cells but not normal colon epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neilsen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Almost all CRC originates from epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, but in order to invade to the surrounding tissue, cancer cells lose cell adhesiveness to acquire motility and become invasive, characterized by the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is central to tumor pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Ye and Weinberg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>). EMT involves a complex cellular process during which epithelial cells lose polarity, cell-cell contacts and acquire mesenchymal characteristics. While EMT is crucial for cell plasticity during embryonic development, trans differentiation and wound healing, when aberrantly activated EMT has deleterious effects, which facilitate motility and invasion of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieto, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dongre and Weinberg, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>). EMT has been shown to be controlled by transcription-dependent mechanisms, especially through repression of genes that are hallmarks of epithelial phenotype such as E-cadherin. Loss of E-cadherin at the membrane has been associated with carcinoma progression and EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thiery, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oda et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frixen et al., 1991</xref>). E-cadherin function is transcriptionally repressed through the action of EMT transcription factors (TFs), including Snail-family proteins (<italic>Snail1</italic>, <italic>Slug</italic>), zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 and 2 (<italic>ZEB1</italic> and <italic>ZEB2</italic>), and twist-related protein (<italic>Twist</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jolly et al., 2017</xref>). Transcriptional control of E-cadherin is unlikely to be sole determinant of EMT, invasion and metastasis. Inappropriate induction of non-epithelial cadherins, such as N-cadherin by epithelial cells are known to play a fundamental role during initiation of metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nieman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosivatz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Okubo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sadot et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loh et al., 2019</xref>). N-cadherin disassembles adherent junction complexes, disrupting the intercellular cohesion and reorienting the migration of cells, away from the direction of cell-cell contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nieman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scarpa et al., 2015</xref>). Upregulation of N-cadherin expression promotes motility and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nieman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hulit et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, central to the process of EMT is the coordinated loss of E-cadherin expression and the upregulation of N-cadherin gene expression, termed cadherin switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Loh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wheelock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tomita et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maeda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Araki et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated transcriptional regulation of EMT through oncogenic Ras or its downstream effector signaling pathways via the activation of EMT-TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreolas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemieux et al., 2009</xref>).

Enhanced activity of ERK2 but not ERK1, has been linked with Ras-dependent regulation of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies have also described an alternative program wherein cells lose their epithelial phenotype, via post-transcriptional modifications rather than transcriptional repression involving translational regulation or protein internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jechlinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aiello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Waerner et al., 2006</xref>).

EPSTI1 promotes cell invasion and malignant growth of primary breast tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Neergaard et al., 2010</xref>). We performed polysome profiling in CRC cells and found that KSR1- and ERK induces of EPSTI1 mRNA translation. EPSTI1 is both necessary and sufficient for coordinating the upregulation of N-cadherin with the downregulation of E-cadherin to stimulate cell motility and invasion in colon cancer cells. These data demonstrate that ERK-regulated regulation of mRNA translation is an essential contributor to EMT-like phenotype and reveal a novel effector of the cadherin switch whose characterization should yield novel insights into the mechanisms controlling the migratory and invasive behavior of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome-wide polysome profiling reveals translational regulation of EPSTI1 by KSR1</title><p>ERK signaling regulates global and selective mRNA translation through RSK1/2-dependent modification of cap-dependent translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roux et al., 2007</xref>). Phosphorylation of cap binding protein 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E to promote translation and the abundance of eIF4E is a rate-limiting factor for oncogenic Ras- and Myc-driven transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Truitt Morgan et al., 2015</xref>). We showed previously that KSR1 maximizes ERK activation in the setting of oncogenic Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kortum et al., 2006</xref>), which is required for increased Myc translation via dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1, supporting CRC cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCall et al., 2016</xref>). These observations imply that the ERK scaffold function of KSR1 alters the translational landscape in CRC cells to support their survival.</p><p>To determine the effect of KSR1 on translatomes in colon cancer cells, we performed genome-wide polysome profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">King and Gerber, 2016</xref>).

Multiple studies have established a relationship between oncogenic Ras-mediated ERK signaling and EMT, either through Ras or its downstream effector signaling pathways activating EMT-TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreolas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lemieux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diesch et al., 2014</xref>). Silencing of Erbin, a tumor suppresser known to disrupt KSR1-RAF1 interaction, promoted cell migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, but did not identify the mechanism on how KSR1-dependent MAPK signaling affected EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stevens et al., 2018</xref>). Mediators of EMT- like phenotype activate cap-dependent translation initiation have been associated with increased aggressiveness and metastases of cancer cells, and we have shown that KSR1 can affect translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCall et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jechlinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Waerner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prakash et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our observations establish the novel role of the scaffold protein KSR1 promoting the preferential translation of an EMT-related gene, <italic>EPSTI1</italic>, and outline a mechanism for KSR1-dependent stimulation of phenotypic plasticity. Using gene-expression analysis of the polysome-bound mRNA, we discovered KSR1 and ERK increase the translational efficiency of <italic>EPSTI1</italic> mRNA. EPSTI1 mediates KSR1-dependent motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth coincident with its suppression of EMT-TF, Slug, elevating E-cadherin expression. EPSTI1 knockdown also decreased the expression of N-cadherin mRNA and protein. In the absence of KSR1, ectopic expression of EPSTI1 was sufficient to suppress E-cadherin expression, stimulate N-cadherin expression and enhance motility and invasive behavior, this invasive behavior was also induced in non-transformed colon cells. These data demonstrate that a KSR1- and ERK-regulated component is critical to the execution of the transcriptional program that drives interconversion between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes. These studies of post-transcriptional regulation and mRNA translation reveal the importance of expanding beyond gene expression analysis for detecting mechanisms underlying epithelial plasticity and tumorigenicity.</p><p>The association of EPSTI1 with tumor metastatic potential is supported by observations that <italic>EPSTI1</italic> is highly upregulated in invasive breast cancer tissues and suggested the role of EPSTI1 in promoting metastasis, tumorsphere formation, and stemness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nielsen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Neergaard et al., 2010</xref>). Although the aberrant expression of EPSTI1 in breast cancer cells is well-established, there is little indication in the literature on the role of EPSTI1 to induce EMT, cancer invasion, and metastasis. The association of EPSTI1 induction of invasion in breast cancer cells was attributed to the increased expression of <italic>Slug</italic> and <italic>Twist</italic> mRNA and increased expression of fibronectin and Î±2Î²1 integrins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Neergaard et al., 2010</xref>). Another study suggested the interaction of EPSTI1 with valosin-containing protein (VCP) and the subsequent activation of NF-ÎºB signaling contributed to the increased tumor invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies should evaluate the potential of EPSTI1 to directly affect N-cadherin and EMT-TF expression, assess the role of NF-ÎºB signaling in EPSTI1-dependent CRC cell EMT and evaluate the potential of EPSTI1 to contribute to invasion and metastasis in vivo.</p><p>Determining how KSR1- and ERK-dependent signaling promotes EPSTI1 translation should yield novel mechanisms underlying tumor cell metastatic behavior. We show that EPSTI1 mRNA is unchanged upon KSR1 disruption or ERK inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2D</xref>) and KSR1 does not contribute to UPS-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E</xref>), suggesting that KSR1 regulates EPSTI1 through post-transcriptional modifications enhancing its preferential loading onto the polysomes. Differential mRNA splicing is implicated in EMT-related processes and splicing regulatory factors have been implicated in the motility and invasive behavior of tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pradella et al., 2017</xref>). One possibility is that KSR1 signaling promotes the splicing of EPSTI1 that promotes itâs the preferential translational contributing to increased motility and invasion.</p><p>Upon removal of KSR1 or EPSTI1, the tumor cells switch back from highly migratory and invasive EMT-like state to the epithelial state. However, the invasive property is not completely lost in KSR1/EPSTI1 disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), which could be attributed to other mesenchymal markers retained in the cells, such as vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Investigating other EMT-related mRNAs that are preferentially translated in response to KSR1-scaffolded ERK signaling may reveal additional mRNAs that make previously unappreciated contributions to cell migration, invasion, and EMT. Constitutive KSR1 or EPSTI1 knockout yields developmentally normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lozano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nguyen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2018</xref>). While KSR1 or EPSTI1 may not be essential to EMT during normal development, they may play a role in other EMT-dependent events such as wound healing where cells collectively migrate, differentiate, and re-epithelialize keratinocytes around and/or within the damaged site. If their role in EMT is exclusive to tumor cells it will reveal a key vulnerability for therapeutic evaluation. Further characterization of KSR1, EPSTI1 and the additional effectors repurposed by dysregulated translation in CRC should reveal additional novel mechanisms critical to CRC tumor survival and progression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The analysis is thorough and includes both loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies. This study advances our understanding of cancer development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KSR1-and ERK-dependent Translational Regulation of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Roger J Davis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While the reviewers found that the paper provides convincing evidence for the role of EPSTl1 in KSR1-dependent EMT, 2 of the reviewers raised valid criticisms concerning the lack of experiments to exclude an effect on degradation of EPSTl1, an important technical problem with the polysome versus monosome assignment (which could affect the interpretation of the data), and overstatements of the data. Following discussions among the referees, it was agreed that an in vivo model of colon cancer to reproduce the in vitro phenotype (as requested by reviewer #2) is not necessary for this paper. We include the full reviews of the referees because they contain in addition to the necessary changes, some very constructive suggestions for improvement of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors should rule out that KSR KD or KO does not impact EPSTI1 protein degradation.</p><p>2. Lines 166-167 â the authors state that KSR1-dependent translation of EPSTI1 is required for colon tumor cell transformation. First, tumor cells do not transform. They are already transformed. Second, no experiments up to this point show that EPSTI1 is required for transformation. To demonstrate this, they would need to express EPSTI1 in a normal or immortalized cell and demonstrate its ability to induce anchorage independent growth, or soft agar growth, or the ability to form tumors in mice. The experiments in figure 3 demonstrate that EPSTI1 is increased in colon cancer cell lines compared to &quot;normal&quot; cells and that KD of EPSTI1 in colon cancer cells leads to decreased viability and colony formation. Together these experiments prove that EPSTI1 is necessary for established cancer cell growth, but not transformation as stated.</p><p>3. Figure 4 â With regards to the impact of EPSTI1 KD or KO on cell migration, the authors should consider measuring the impact of EPSTI1 KD or KO on cell proliferation, since this could have a significant impact on the interpretation of the wound healing assay and Matrigel invasion assay. If there is no difference in proliferation then the authors' assertion that EPSTI1 is necessary for the migratory potential of the CRC cell lines hold true. However, if KD or KO cells are proliferating less (as supported by their previous work), then another reason the cells may appear to be closing the gap slower, or invading through Matrigel slower, is a decrease in cell cycle progression. If this is the case, the authors can still make the argument that EPSTI1 KD or KO cells move slower if they conduct realtime imaging of individual cells and track their movement (can be shown as a spider plot).</p><p>4. Lines 196-198 â the authors state that &quot;the switch of E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression promotes the progression of migratory and invasive behavior orchestrated by KSR1-EPSTI1 signaling in CRC cells.&quot; This is an overstatement based on the evidence provided in Figure 5. The authors demonstrate that a switch in E-cad and N-cad are associated with migratory potential, but do not demonstrate that the switch actually promotes the progression. In order to do this, they would need to KD E-cad and/or overexpress N-cad and demonstrate that this can rescue the decrease in cell migration see in Figure 4.</p><p>5. Figure 6 â Does the enforced expression of EPSTI1 increase proliferation in these cells? If so, would consider comments in point #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data shown to support the conclusion that the regulation of EPSTI1 by KSR1 is under translational control requires clarification. Authors state in the methods that RNAseq was performed on: &quot;total RNA and RNA pooled from the polysome fraction (fractions 6-9)&quot;. According to the absorbance profile shown in figure 1A, fractions 6-9 would not correspond to efficiently translated mRNAs (i.e. bound by 3 or more ribosomes), it looks like fraction 6 is the monosome. Can the authors please clarify, as this is an important technical concern which is of course relevant to the RNA-seq analysis that the authors performed to identify EPSTI1 (and potentially other targets listed) as being under translational control. Related comment regarding Figure 1F, the comparison being made is not entirely clear, the difference between control cells and the KSR1 knock-downs seems to only be obvious in one fraction, #7, which from the absorbance profile seems to be a &quot;light fraction&quot;.</p><p>2. Data with SCH772984 supports the importance of ERK1/2 activation in the regulation of EPSTI1 protein expression. However, the data that ERK1/2 inhibition alters the translation of EPSTI1 mRNA is not robust. The absorbance profiles related to the polysome fractionation done on HCT116 cells treated or not with SCH772984 are unusual, and thus the data shown in Figure 2E are in question. Related to EPSTI1 expression being under translational control, can its translation be repressed by an inhibitor of mTOR?</p><p>3. The authors have shown data that the KSR1-dependent regulation of EPSTI1 is essential for EMT, including effects on invasion, anchorage-independent cell viability, and the cadherin switch in colon cancer cell lines depleted of KSR1 (and phenotypes are rescued with add-backs of KSR1 or EPSTI1). Missing from the manuscript is an in vivo model to show whether the observed in vitro phenotypes (i.e. in colon cancer cells depleted for KSR1 or EPSTI1) have relevance in an in vivo model. HCT116 for example have been used in orthotopic mouse models, with HCT116-derived tumors showing evidence of local invasion and metastasis to distant organs (lung, liver). Using the cell lines already developed by the authors, in vivo characterization of the impact of loss of KSR1 or EPSTI1 can thus be performed.</p><p>4. Related to point #3, what is the expression of KSR1 in HCEC non-transformed cells compared to HCT116/HCT15? HCECs can be induced to undergo EMT (with loss of epithelial markers and gains in mesenchymal markers, including fibronectin, vimentin, and N-cadherin). Thus, does KSR1 overexpression, or EPSTI1 overexpression in HCECs promote a full or partial EMT, and increase their invasive/metastatic behaviour in vivo? The experiments in #3 and #4 are essential to understand how at what point during the progression of colorectal cancer KSR1 expression is dysregulated, and may help design future therapeutic targeting windows.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a very strong paper that provides a thorough and definitive analysis of the role of EPSTI1 in KSR1-dependent EMT. The major question related to this study is the molecular mechanism of EPSTI1 function â which should be addressed in subsequent studies and reported in a new paper.</p><p>There is one point that the authors could address. In the Discussion section of the manuscript, the authors speculate that it is possible that KSR1 changes EPSTI1 mRNA splicing. Since the authors have RNA-seq data that could address this point, the authors should refer to thus analysis if a conclusion can be drawn. If no conclusions can be drawn, no changes to the manuscript are required.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;KSR1-and ERK-dependent Translational Regulation of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

In Figure 6 (supplement 1), you make the point that KD of EPSTI1 does not impact cell proliferation (in D and E). This seems to be true for SW480 cells, but it is less clear for HCT116 cells.

We analyzed EPSTI1 turnover using a combination of proteasome inhibitor, MG132 and CHX in control and CRISPR-targeted KSR1 HCT116 cells (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2E). EPSTI1 turnover was not sensitive to MG132 treatment in HCT116 cells lacking KSR1 expression. Therefore, in HCT116 cells, KSR1 does not mediate ubiquitin proteosome system (UPS)-mediated degradation of EPSTI1. These data support our conclusion that EPSTI1 translation is induced by KSR1. Our findings are presented in the results (lines 134-142), Figure 1âfigure supplement 2D-E and the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We confirmed that the effects observed are due solely to cell migration using two different techniques:</p><p>1. The cell migration experiments were performed using IncuCyte scratch wound analyzer. IncuCyte software is designed specifically to experimentally quantify the effects of cell migration separate from changes that occur as result of cell proliferation. Relative wound density is calculated as the percentage of spatial cell density inside the wound relative to the spatial density outside of the wound area at a given time point. The metric is designed to be zero at t=0 and 100% when cell density inside the wound is the same as the cell density outside the initial wound. The clarification on this method is included in Results section lines 190- 194 and the methods section.</p><p>2. To determine the effect of EPSTI1 on cell proliferation, we analyzed the cell growth kinetics in HCT116 and SW480 cells (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Over a period 3 days, EPSTI1 knockdown had no effect on proliferation in comparison to control HCT116 and SW480 cells. Although, KSR1-CRISPR knockout cells grew slower that the control HCT116 and SW480 cells, EPSTI1-expression did not rescue the proliferation in these cells (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). Since cell migration was measured over 48 hours and invasion was measured for 24 hours, any effect of cell proliferation should not impact our data. Our observations are included in result section lines 238-248 and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

EPSTI1 knockdown suppressed cell invasion. However, the expression of N-cadherin in cells lacking EPSTI1 was sufficient to restore invasiveness to HCT116 cells <bold>(</bold>Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C-D). Our observation is consistent with previous observations that upregulation of N-cadherin enhances motility in multiple cancer cell lines (Hulit et al., 2007; Mrozik et al., 2018; Nieman et al., 1999). These results indicate that the switch of E-cadherin to N-cadherin expression promotes the progression of migratory and invasive behavior orchestrated by EPSTI1 signaling in CRC cells.

In our original polysome profile graphs we did not account for the dead volume between measurement of absorbance and the collection of each of the fraction which causes a delay of approximately 30 seconds.

Though AZD8055 robustly inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR substrate p70 S6 kinase, its ability to decrease EPSTI1 expression in HCT116 cells was weak relative to treatment with the ERK inhibitor (Figure 2C). These observations suggest the ERK affects EPSTI1 expression via mechanisms distinct from mTOR.

Although, EPSTI1 expression has a significant effect on cell proliferation over 7 days compared to KSR1 knockout cells in HCT116 and SW480 cells, EPSTI1 expression was enough to rescue the migratory potential by over 60% in KSR1 depleted HCT116 and SW480 cells within 24 hours (Figure 6C).
