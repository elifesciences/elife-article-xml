sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to produce complex behaviors by assembling sequences of different movements is essential for purposeful behavior and survival. One prominent model that describes how the brain produces movement sequences is called a ‘parallel model’. This model proposes that the premotor elements of different movements to be executed in sequence are activated (or readied) in parallel and then selected sequentially through a mechanism where movements occurring earlier in the sequence suppress later ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohland et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bullock, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Houghton and Hartley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lashley, 1951</xref>). A hallmark feature of this model is a parallel circuit architecture that ensures all mutually exclusive actions to be performed in sequence are simultaneously readied and competing for output. Performance order is established by hierarchical suppression among the parallel circuits, where earlier actions suppress later actions. This architecture is supported by physiological and behavioral evidence from the movement sequences of different animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Averbeck et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mushiake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, despite some movement sequences exhibiting features consistent with the parallel model, we lack an organizational and mechanistic understanding of the underlying neural circuits.</p><p>The grooming behavior of fruit flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) can be studied to define the circuit mechanisms that produce movement sequences. Making flies dirty by coating them in dust elicits a grooming sequence that starts with the cleaning of different locations on the head, such as the eyes, antennae, and proboscis, and proceeds to body locations, such as the abdomen, wings, and thorax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mueller et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Phillis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). We previously determined that the sequence is produced by a mechanism that is consistent with a parallel model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). The sequence begins when different aimed grooming movements that clean specific locations of the head or body become activated in parallel by dust. The resulting competition among mutually exclusive grooming movements is resolved through hierarchical suppression. For example, grooming of the eyes occurs first because eye grooming suppresses grooming of other locations on the head and body. This parallel model of hierarchical suppression provides a conceptual framework for dissecting the neural circuit architecture that produces <italic>Drosophila</italic> grooming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Here, we focus on the organization of the sensory inputs in the hypothesized architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>), the parallel mechanosensory neurons that detect dust at different locations and elicit aimed grooming movements.</p><p>Different mechanosensory structures are distributed across the head and body surface that respond to mechanical stimuli and elicit grooming. The most abundant of these structures are mechanosensory bristles (aka hairs or setae). Tactile displacement of individual bristles elicits grooming movements in which the legs are precisely aimed at the stimulus location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page and Matheson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>). Each bristle is innervated by a single <italic>bristle mechanosensory neuron</italic> (BMN) that is excited by displacement of that bristle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corfas and Dudai, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Walker et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, bristles and their corresponding BMNs can be ascribed to specific, aimed leg grooming movements. Other mechanosensory structures, including chordotonal organs and stretch receptors, also elicit stimulus location-aimed grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Simultaneous (parallel) optogenetic activation of mechanosensory neurons across the body elicits a grooming sequence that proceeds in the same order as the ‘natural’ dust-induced sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the sequence is elicited by parallel mechanosensory pathways that each produce a movement that grooms a specific location on the head or body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>BMNs project their axons from different locations on the head or body, through different nerves, and into the <italic>central nervous system</italic> (CNS). Previous studies of BMNs from different body locations demonstrated that they show somatotopic organization in their CNS projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson and Murphey, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murphey et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Newland, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Newland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsubouchi et al., 2017</xref>). That is, particular projection zones in the CNS correspond to specific body locations. Somatotopic organization among mechanosensory neurons and their postsynaptic circuits is consistent with the parallel model that underlies the body grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). In this model, parallel-projecting mechanosensory neurons that respond to stimuli at specific locations on the head or body could connect with somatotopically organized parallel circuits that elicit grooming of those locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). The previous discovery of a mechanosensory-connected circuit that elicits aimed grooming of the antennae provides evidence of this organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). However, the extent to which distinct circuits elicit grooming of other locations is unknown, in part, because the somatotopic projections of the mechanosensory neurons have not been comprehensively defined for the head or body.</p><p>Here, we comprehensively map the somatotopic organization among BMNs that elicit grooming of different locations on the head. <italic>Drosophila</italic> use their front legs to groom their heads in a sequence that starts with the eyes and proceeds to other locations, such as the antennae and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Two mechanosensory structures on the head (i.e. chordotonal organs and bristles) are implicated in grooming. The antennal <italic>Johnston’s organ</italic> (JO) is a chordotonal organ containing mechanosensory neurons called <italic>JO neurons</italic> (JONs) that detect stimulations of the antennae and elicit aimed grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). There are over 1000 bristles located on the head whose stimulation we postulated could also elicit aimed grooming of different head locations. In support of this, BMNs innervating bristles on the eyes were previously shown to elicit grooming of the eyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we use optogenetic tools to show that activation of subsets of BMNs at other head locations also elicits aimed grooming. We use transgenic expression, dye fills, and electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions to trace the projections of nearly all BMNs on the head, from their bristles, through their respective nerves, and into the CNS. This reveals somatotopic organization, where BMNs innervating neighboring head bristles project to overlapping zones in the CNS while those innervating distant bristles project to distinct zones. Analysis of head BMN postsynaptic connectivity reveals that neighboring BMNs show higher connectivity similarity than distant BMNs, providing evidence of somatotopically organized postsynaptic circuit pathways. This provides a comprehensive synaptic resolution projection map of head mechanosensory neurons, and further defines the organization of parallel mechanosensory pathways that elicit sequential grooming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Classification and quantification of the head bristles</title><p>A prerequisite for determining the somatotopy of head BMNs was to define the locations of their respective bristles on the head. Different populations of bristles are located on the eyes, antennae, proboscis, and other areas on the head. While the identities of most of these populations were known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenstein et al., 1994</xref>), some were poorly described and their bristle numbers were not reported. Therefore, we imaged the bristles on the head and then classified and quantified each population. We developed a unified nomenclature for the different bristle populations that was based partially on published nomenclature. Most of the bristles were easily observed by imaging white light-illuminated heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>), and color-coded depth maps further helped to distinguish between bristles while they were being counted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–H</xref>). Some bristles could not be counted from these images because of their small size, position on the head, or because they could not be distinguished from one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, asterisk with bristle number range). Therefore, we used confocal microscopy images, or referred to published work to estimate or obtain the numbers of bristles in these populations (see Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Classification and quantification of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> head bristles.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Bristles on the anterior (<bold>A</bold>), posterior (<bold>B</bold>), ventral (<bold>C</bold>), and dorsal (<bold>D</bold>) male head.

The present study focuses on the organization among bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) that elicit aimed grooming of different locations on the head, such as the eyes (red), proboscis (orange), and antennae (aqua). The body locations grooming pathway (gray) represents a continuation of the parallel architecture for any given body location, such as the abdomen or wings. (<bold>B</bold>) Being coated in dust stimulates multiple locations, inducing competition among the pathways that elicit mutually exclusive grooming movements. These movements are prioritized through hierarchical suppression (unidirectional ball and stick connections between circuits). For illustration simplicity, only the nearest-neighbor connections are shown. In the hypothesized architecture, each circuit suppresses all the subordinate circuits in the hierarchy. For example, eye grooming occurs first in the sequence because it suppresses all later movements, such as grooming of the proboscis, antennae, and body locations. (<bold>C</bold>) We hypothesize that mechanosensory neurons from different head locations project to distinct somatotopically organized zones in the ventral brain. Mechanosensory neurons on the antennae (Johnston’s organ neurons [JONs]) and eyes (BMNs) are reported to elicit aimed grooming, and BMNs at other locations are hypothesized to also elicit grooming. Mechanosensory neuron projections in the brain are hypothesized to connect with postsynaptic circuits (boxes) that elicit grooming through descending pathways that activate movement pattern generators in the ventral nerve cord.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87602-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Color-coded depth maps of the head.</title><p>(<bold>A–H</bold>) Example depth maps that were constructed from image Z-stacks (see Materials and methods).

For example, all flies have one Oc bristle on each half of the head that is always in the same location. We therefore performed dye fills on the same bristles from multiple different heads. This revealed that BMNs innervating the same bristle have the same general projection morphology across individual flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>).

BMNs innervating the same populations were found to have similar projections. For example, BM-Ant neurons all showed similar ipsilateral and midline projecting branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–J</xref>). Morphological similarity among BMNs innervating the same bristle populations was also observed for the BM-Or (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>), -Vib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–N</xref>), and -Vt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O–Q</xref>) neurons.</p><p>While BMNs innervating the largest bristles could be labeled using dye fills, we could not label BMNs innervating small bristles using this method. Therefore, we used the <italic>multicolor flipout</italic> (MCFO) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) to stochastically label individual BMNs innervating bristles within the expression patterns of the driver lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E’–G’</xref>.

Unlike the dye-filled BMNs, the MCFO-labeled BMNs could not be matched to specific bristles within a population (e.g. Ant 1 or Ant 2), but only to a specific population (e.g. Ant). In agreement with what we observed with dye-filled BMNs innervating the same populations of large bristles, the MCFO-labeled BMNs innervating the same populations of small bristles also showed similar projection morphologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">8</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the projections of the dye-filled and MCFO-labeled BMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–V</xref>).

Finally, we verified that the numbers of BMNs for each type were consistent with their corresponding bristle numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–F</xref>). This consistency of the BMN/bristle numbers, and completeness of sensory neuron proofreading in each nerve suggested that nearly all BMNs were reconstructed. Thus, we produced a near-complete brain projection map of 15 BMN types that innervate the different bristle populations on the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–T</xref>, listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>BMN somatotopic map</title><p>The projection map defined above revealed three features of somatotopic organization among the BMN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–T</xref>, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flywire.ai/#links/Eichler2023a/bristle_types_URL">FlyWire.ai link 3</ext-link> to better view the BMN projections in three dimensions). First, each type has a unique branch morphology that defines its projections into distinct zones in the SEZ. Second, types that innervate neighboring bristle populations have branches that project into partially overlapping zones. For example, BMNs that innervate bristles on the dorsal head all have a common ipsilateral projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–K and Q</xref>, lateral branch in each panel). In contrast, BMNs that innervate bristles at distant locations (e.g. dorsal and ventral head) show little or no projection overlap. Third, the projections of BMNs either remain in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere or cross the midline to the contralateral side, depending on the locations of their corresponding bristle populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). That is, BMNs innervating populations located medially on the anterior head have midline-crossing projections, whereas BMNs innervating lateral, eye, and posterior head populations have ipsilateral-only projections. BMNs innervating bristles on the proboscis showed mixtures of ipsilateral-only and midline-crossing projections. These somatotopic features reveal how BMNs have distinct and overlapping SEZ projections that reflect their relative locations and proximities on the head.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Some head bristle mechanosensory neurons (BMNs) have projections that cross the midline to the contralateral brain hemisphere.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) BMNs that remain in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere (<bold>A</bold>) versus those with midline-crossing projections (<bold>B</bold>), shaded by percent midline-crossing for each type (scale in <bold>C</bold>).

NBLAST calculates similarity scores based on neuron morphology and spatial location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). BMNs innervating neighboring bristle populations showed high similarity, indicating that their projections are morphologically similar and in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We confirmed this close proximity through analysis of BMN/BMN interconnectivity. All neurons in FlyWire.ai were previously linked to their corresponding automatically detected synapses in FAFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buhmann et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>), which revealed that the BMN axons have both pre- and postsynaptic sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Analysis of all-to-all connectivity among the BMNs revealed that some of these sites corresponded to BMN/BMN synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The highest connectivity was among BMNs of the same type, but types innervating neighboring bristles were also connected. In contrast, BMNs innervating bristles at distant locations showed low NBLAST similarity and were not connected, consistent with these BMNs projecting into distinct zones. Interestingly, the different BMN projection zones defined by the NBLAST and connectivity data correspond roughly to the eye, ventral, dorsal, and posterior head.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Somatotopically organized parallel BMN pathways</title><p>The map of somatotopically organized BMN projection zones provided evidence of the parallel sensory pathways predicted by the model of hierarchical suppression underlying grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). In the model, mechanosensory neurons detect dust at different head locations and elicit aimed grooming through distinct postsynaptic circuits that function in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). The projection zones could be where BMNs synapse with these circuits. Therefore, we examined the postsynaptic connectivity of the different BMN types to test if they form parallel connections with distinct partners. Nearly all neurons postsynaptic to the BMNs were first proofread in FlyWire.ai by our group and the wider proofreading community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>). We then compared the connectivity of the BMNs with their postsynaptic partners using cosine similarity-based clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). The 555 BM-InOm neurons were excluded from this analysis because they were present in higher numbers and with fewer presynaptic sites than the 150 BMNs of other types, and clustering all BMNs together resulted in obscured clustering (presynaptic site counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The BMN/BMN connections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref> were also excluded from the cluster analysis.</p><p>Cosine similarity clustering revealed that BMNs formed parallel postsynaptic connections that reflected their head somatotopy. The lowest level clusters at the lowest cut heights shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> dendrogram contained BMNs of the same type (colored bars next to dendrogram), demonstrating that BMNs innervating the same bristle populations had the highest connectivity similarity. Higher dendrogram cut heights (larger cluster sizes) uncovered connectivity similarity among BMN types innervating neighboring bristle populations. For example, a cut height of 4.5 identified five clusters that captured connectivity similarity among both same and neighboring BMN types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>, colored circles 1–5, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flywire.ai/#links/Eichler2023a/cosine_URL">FlyWire.ai link 4</ext-link>). Clusters 1 and 4 contained exclusively BMNs of the same type, including BM-Vib (Cluster 1) and a subset of BM-Taste neurons (Cluster 4). The other subset of BM-Taste neurons is represented in Cluster 3, showing connectivity similarity with neighboring BMNs on the ventral head. This intratype differential clustering observed with the BM-Taste neurons was also found with other BMN types, including the morphologically diverse BM-InOm neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://flywire.ai/#links/Eichler2023a/cosine_InOM_URL">FlyWire.ai link 5</ext-link>). Thus, while BMNs of the same type tend to show high connectivity similarity, we also find evidence that there are BMN subtypes with distinct postsynaptic partners. Clusters 2, 3, and 5 contained BMNs innervating neighboring bristle populations that were located roughly on the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). Clusters 2 and 3 contained exclusively dorsal or ventral BMNs, respectively, while Cluster 5 contained 77% posterior head BMNs and 23% anterior. The posterior and anterior BMNs in Cluster 5 showed relatively low postsynaptic connectivity similarity with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>), thus maintaining a mostly anterior versus posterior spatial distinction in their postsynaptic connectivity. However, the presence of both anterior and posterior head BMNs in Cluster 5 also indicates that some postsynaptic partners receive BMN inputs that are not head location specific.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Somatotopy-based postsynaptic connectivity similarity among bristle mechanosensory neuron (BMN) types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dendrogram of cosine similarity clustering of BMNs by postsynaptic connectivity similarity.

BMNs showing the highest connectivity similarity innervate the same bristle populations, as exemplified by BM-Vib (Cluster 1) and BM-Taste (Cluster 4) neurons.

This suggested that head BMNs elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations, but also neighboring locations. This result is consistent with our anatomical and connectomic data indicating that BMNs innervating neighboring bristles show overlapping projections and postsynaptic connectivity similarity (see Discussion).</p><p>Activation of BMNs on the posterior head elicited low levels of dorsal head grooming (blue trace), but mostly a forward head nodding movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A–C</xref>, pBMN-spGAL4; BM-Vt, -dOcci, -dPoOr, and -vOcci neurons, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Nodding was an apparent avoidance response to posterior touches of the head, and occurred while the flies either stood in place or walked around. However, nodding was also observed during dorsal head grooming. Such nodding movements during head grooming were previously shown to help the legs reach particular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Honegger et al., 1979</xref>). Nodding also occurred with the dorsal head grooming elicited using the dBMN-spGAL4 and InOmBMN-LexA driver lines, but these lines did not elicit nodding in the absence of grooming as we observed with pBMN-spGAL4. This suggested that BMN-activated nodding occurs in two different behavioral contexts: during dorsal head grooming and as an avoidance response. Different evidence led us to hypothesize that nodding in these contexts was elicited by distinct BMN types. First, pBMN- and dBMN-spGAL4 driver lines show overlapping expression in BM-Vt and -dPoOr neurons, and both elicit dorsal head grooming accompanied by nodding. Second, pBMN-spGAL4 is the only tested line that expressed in BM-dOcci and -vOcci neurons and also the only line that elicited nodding in the absence of grooming. When taken together, our experiments suggest that nodding-only movements are elicited by BM-dOcci and -vOcci neurons and dorsal head grooming is elicited by BM-InOc, -Vt, -dPoOr, and -InOm neurons.</p><p>In addition to grooming, BMNs on the dorsal head and eyes elicited backward motions that appeared as if flies were avoiding something that touched the head (dBMN-spGAL4 and InOmBMN-LexA). The backward motion and grooming were mutually exclusive and sequential, as the backward motion occurred transiently at the stimulus onset and was followed by grooming. As we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>), the red-light stimulus also elicited backward motions with control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>, control, black trace, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59976#video4">Video</ext-link> 5</xref>). However, control flies only responded in 33% of trials, whereas BMN activation flies responded with backward motions in most trials (73% for dorsal head BMNs, 100% BM-InOm neurons). Taken together, this study reveals that the somatotopically organized head BMNs elicit both aimed grooming and avoidance-like responses.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-87602-video5.mp4" id="video5"><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic stimulus in control flies.</title><p>Control fly was exposed to the same red-light stimulus shown in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>.

Although there were previous descriptions of the BMNs from different body parts, there were no comprehensive descriptions of all BMNs for any part. Furthermore, the head BMNs were among the least well described. Here, we modified a previously reported BMN dye fill method and produced new transgenic driver lines to define the projection morphologies of the different head BMN types that innervate specific bristle populations on the head. We then identified and reconstructed these types in the FAFB EM dataset. This provides the most comprehensive definition of the BMNs for any body part of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (or any other insect), and an essential resource for future studies. The annotated neurons can be linked to the ongoing neural circuit reconstructions in FAFB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>), or identified in anticipated new EM reconstructions of the brains of other individuals using available and emerging tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galili et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>While nearly all head BMNs were reconstructed in this work, different knowledge gaps remain. First, it is unclear if the PoOc and Su bristles are innervated by BMNs because they could not be observed using transgenic driver lines or dye filling methods. We proposed that one of the BM-Vt/PoOc neurons innervates the PoOc bristle, based on proximity and presumed morphological similarity to the neighboring BM-Vt, -InOc, and -Oc neurons. For the Su bristles, one possibility is that they are innervated by some of the 25 unknown sensory neurons reconstructed in this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–Y</xref>). Second, it remains unclear what neurotransmitter(s) are used by the BMNs. A machine learning approach was recently developed that can predict whether a neuron in FAFB uses any of six major neurotransmitters with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eckstein et al., 2020</xref>). Given that the neurotransmitter predictions for the BMNs were overwhelmingly cholinergic (not shown), and a previous study indicated that leg BMNs are sensitive to a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016a</xref>), the parsimonious explanation is that the BMNs are cholinergic. However, other studies suggest that BMNs could use histamine as a neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Salvaterra and Kitamoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yasuyama and Salvaterra, 1999</xref>). Thus, the extent to which head BMNs use acetylcholine, histamine, or other neurotransmitters remains unresolved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Resource: nearly all head mechanosensory neurons reconstructed and annotated in FAFB</title><p>In conjunction with two previous studies, work presented here contributes to the FAFB reconstruction and annotation of neurons associated with the major head mechanosensory structures, including the bristles (BMNs), JO (JONs), and taste pegs (TPMNs). The BMNs and TPMNs were reconstructed using the FlyWire.ai platform in the present work, and the JONs were previously reconstructed using the CATMAID platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2020</xref>).

Subpopulations of ~480 JONs have been previously defined that respond to diverse mechanical forces that move the antennae (JO-A, -B, -C, -D, -E, -F, and -mz neurons), including sound, gravity, wind, and tactile displacements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ishikawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsuo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>). The JONs are implicated in different behaviors including courtship, flight, locomotion, gravitaxis, wind-guided orientation, escape, and head grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kamikouchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lehnert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mamiya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mamiya and Dickinson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tootoonian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Vaughan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>). The reconstruction and annotation of head mechanosensory neurons in FAFB provides an important resource for connectomics-based studies of mechanosensory processing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). While the majority of mechanosensory neurons on the head are now identified in FAFB, some remain unknown, such as multidendritic and pharyngeal mechanosensory neurons on the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The reconstructed JONs, BMNs, and TPMNs project into distinct regions in the SEZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and E</xref>), and therefore show modality-specific projections. For example, the JONs (chordotonal neurons) define a region of the SEZ called the antennal mechanosensory and motor center while the BMNs project more ventrally. While the BMN projections are based on head location (somatotopic), the JON projections are based on mechanical stimulus modality, such as their responses to vibrational or tonic antennal movements (tonotopic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kamikouchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>). However, there are potential overlapping projections between the most ventral projecting JONs (JO-F neurons) and some BMNs projecting through the AntNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Among the BMNs that appear to overlap with the JO-F neurons are the BM-Ant neurons that are located on the same antennal segment as the JONs (pedicel). This overlap suggests that the JO-F neuron projections are somatotopic like the BMNs. Modality-specific mechanosensory projections are also reported in the VNC of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects (e.g. BMNs, hair plates, campaniform sensilla, and chordotonal neurons), revealing this organization to be fundamental in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Merritt and Murphey, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Murphey et al., 1989a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Smith and Shepherd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tsubouchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head BMNs</title><p>This work defines the somatotopic organization of the head BMNs.

However, these studies only produced partial somatotopic maps using dye fills or transgenic driver lines. Furthermore, there were no previous descriptions of somatotopy among the head BMNs. Here, we use EM reconstructions to produce a comprehensive synaptic resolution somatotopic map of head BMNs in the same brain.</p><p>All reconstructed <italic>Drosophila</italic> head BMN types terminate their projections in the SEZ. This indicates that the first layers of BMN processing for the head occur in the SEZ. In contrast, head BMNs reported in other insects project into both the SEZ and thoracic ganglia, including BMNs innervating the InOm bristles of the praying mantis and cricket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Honegger, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zack and Bacon, 1981</xref>) and wind-sensitive head bristles of the locust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tyrer et al., 1979</xref>).</p><p>Head BMNs that innervate the same bristle populations (same types) project into the same zones in the SEZ, show the highest morphological similarity, and their morphology is stereotyped across individual flies. These characteristics likely apply to most BMNs, as numerous studies have identified the stereotyped projections of BMNs innervating specific bristles on the bodies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burg and Wu, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burg and Wu, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Honegger, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kays et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murphey et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zack and Bacon, 1981</xref>). Head BMNs of the same type also show the highest postsynaptic connectivity similarity. However, some BMN types fall into multiple different NBLAST and cosine similarity clusters, revealing that there are BMN subtypes with differing morphology and postsynaptic connectivity. One notable example of such intratype diversity are the BM-InOm neurons that show differential clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This could reflect the large surface area of the eyes that spans from the dorsal to ventral head, and the differentially clustered BM-InOm neurons may innervate bristles at different locations on the eyes. Future studies will address the organizational and functional logic of such intratype diversity.</p><p>We also find that BMN types innervating neighboring bristle populations have overlapping projections (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) into zones that correspond roughly to the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head. The overlap is likely functionally significant, as cosine similarity analysis revealed that neighboring head BMN types can have common postsynaptic partners (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). However, overlap between neighboring BMN types is only partial, as they show differing projections and postsynaptic connectivity. The extent of overlap likely reflects the proximity between bristles and enables postsynaptic partners to respond to mechanosensory stimulations of neighboring bristles whose corresponding BMNs are likely to show correlated activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tuthill and Wilson, 2016b</xref>). BMN projection overlap has also been observed with other parts of the body in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For example, BMNs innervating bristles on the anterior and posterior leg compartments show overlapping projections in the VNC leg neuromere anterior and posterior zones, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murphey et al., 1989b</xref>). Similarly, BMNs innervating neighboring bristles on the thorax show overlap in their projections into the accessory mesothoracic neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kays et al., 2014</xref>). This overlap may have implications for aimed grooming behavior. For example, neighboring BMNs could connect with common neural circuits to elicit grooming of overlapping locations (discussed more below).</p><p>The somatotopic map reveals that some head BMNs have projections that remain in the ipsilateral brain hemisphere, while others have midline-crossing projections to the contralateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–E</xref>). Interestingly, BMNs innervating bristles located medially on the anterior head show midline-crossing projections, whereas those innervating more lateral populations have ipsilateral-only projections. Previous studies found that BMNs innervating medial bristles on the thorax have midline-crossing projections, while those innervating more lateral bristles have ipsilateral-only projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghysen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kays et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, BMNs that innervate bristles located on the leg segment most medial to the body (coxa) have midline-crossing projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Murphey et al., 1989b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Phelps et al., 2021</xref>). This is also the case for BMNs on the legs of other insects, such as the cricket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson and Murphey, 1985</xref>) and hawkmoth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kent and Levine, 1988</xref>). Why do some BMNs have ipsilateral and midline-crossing projections? One possibility is that these BMNs can excite postsynaptic circuitry in both brain hemispheres to elicit bilateral leg grooming responses, which could be appropriate for medial stimuli. In contrast, BMNs on the proboscis have mixtures of ipsilateral-only and midline-crossing projections, while those on the posterior head show ipsilateral-only projections. Thus, the organizational logic of midline-crossing BMNs described above may not be universal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>First synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head</title><p>This work provides the first synaptic resolution somatotopic map of a head (or body) for any species. Previous studies identified somatotopic maps across species, such as the vertebrate maps of head and body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 1977</xref>). Somatotopic organization has been found to be preserved at different layers of the nervous system and is thought to be of fundamental importance, although the full functional significance of this organization is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kaas, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thivierge and Marcus, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it remains important to produce anatomical and functional maps and define how this somatotopy interfaces with postsynaptic circuits. It has previously not been possible to obtain a comprehensive description of a somatotopic map, as most studies were limited to sparse labeling experiments and extrapolation across different animals. Thus, the spatial relationships among mechanosensory neurons that make up particular maps could not be definitively determined. We overcame this through the first complete EM reconstruction of a somatotopic map of a head in the same brain. This enables future work that will define the postsynaptic connectome of this complete map. Thus, the synaptic resolution map provided here has important implications for expanding our understanding of somatotopic neural circuit organization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Circuits that elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations</title><p>We report here that activation of the head BMNs elicits aimed grooming. Flies groom specific head locations, including the eyes, antennae, dorsal head, ventral head, and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawkins, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Szebenyi, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). With the exception of the BM-InOm neurons, little was known about the roles of the other BMNs in eliciting head grooming. The BM-InOm neurons were originally identified as necessary for grooming in response to mechanical stimulation of the eyes in the praying mantis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zack and Bacon, 1981</xref>). Mechanical stimulation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> InOm bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>) and optogenetic activation of the BM-InOm neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) were later reported to elicit eye grooming. Here, we used optogenetic activation to further define the movements elicited by BM-InOm neurons, and show that other BMN types elicit grooming of the dorsal and ventral head. Previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects showed that stimulations of bristles on the legs, wings, and thorax also elicit aimed grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corfas and Dudai, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matheson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Page and Matheson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Usui-Ishihara et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>). Thus, the BMNs are important for eliciting aimed grooming of specific locations on the head and body.</p><p>While we show that the parallel-projecting head BMNs elicit grooming of specific locations (i.e. eyes, dorsal, and ventral head), the full range of aimed grooming movements that can be elicited was not explored. For example, antennal grooming was previously shown to be elicited by JON activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and we hypothesize here that BM-Ant neuron activation also elicits antennal grooming. However, we did not identify a transgenic driver line that labels BM-Ant neurons that would enable us to test this hypothesis. Previous studies of the legs, wings, and thorax used mechanical stimulation of specific bristles, rather than BMN optogenetic activation to test the ranges of grooming movements that could be elicited. This was done by delivering mechanical stimuli directly to the bristles of decapitated flies that do not move unless stimulated. In contrast, stimulating the head bristles is relatively challenging, as it requires delivering precise mechanical stimulations to specific bristles in intact and tethered flies. We have used optogenetic analysis in this study, as it was previously demonstrated that BMN optogenetic activation elicits grooming that is comparable to mechanically stimulating their corresponding bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, our ability to test the full range of grooming movements elicited with BMN activation was limited by the driver lines produced in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>).</p><p>How do the parallel-projecting head BMNs interface with postsynaptic neural circuits to elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations? Different evidence supports the hypothesis that the BMNs connect with parallel circuits that each elicit a different aimed grooming movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). First, cosine similarity analysis revealed parallel connectivity at the first postsynaptic layer. However, this analysis revealed partial convergence of neighboring BMN types onto common postsynaptic partners. Thus, the resolution of the hypothesized parallel circuits and the specificity of the aimed grooming that they elicit remains to be determined. Second, previous studies showed that optogenetic activation of different sensory and interneuron types elicits grooming of specific head locations, suggesting that they are components of putative parallel circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cande et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Third, we identified different neuron types whose activation elicit grooming of the antennae and showed that they are connected to form a neural circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>). The inputs to this circuit are JONs that detect tactile stimulations of the antennae and project to the SEZ where they excite two interneuron types (aBN1 and aBN2) and a descending neuron type (aDN) to elicit grooming. The aDNs project to a zone in the VNC where circuitry for generating antennal grooming leg movement patterns is thought to reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkowitz and Laurent, 1996</xref>). While this circuit is postsynaptic to the JONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hampel et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>), preliminary connectomic analysis reveals that it is also postsynaptic to BMNs (not shown). Future studies will define the BMN connectivity with the antennal grooming circuit, and other neurons (and circuits) whose activation elicit aimed grooming of different head locations.</p><p>We find that activation of specific BMN types elicits both aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations and neighboring locations. This suggests overlap in the locations that are groomed with the activation of different BMN types. Such overlap provides a means of cleaning the area surrounding the stimulus location. Interestingly, our NBLAST and cosine similarity analysis indicates that neighboring BMNs project into overlapping zones in the SEZ and show common postsynaptic connectivity. Thus, we hypothesize that neighboring BMNs connect with common neural circuits (e.g. antennal grooming circuit) to elicit overlapping aimed grooming of common head locations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>BMN involvement in multiple distinct behaviors</title><p>In addition to grooming, this work identifies other movements that are elicited by the head BMNs and their corresponding bristles. Previous studies implicated the InOm bristles in an avoidance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>), although this response was not described in detail. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the BM-InOm neurons elicits an avoidance-like response in the form of backward motions. This response was also elicited by activating BMN types on the dorsal head. Another putative avoidance-like behavior, head nodding, was found to be elicited by posterior head BMNs. Avoidance responses to bristle stimulation have been previously reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects, such as limb withdrawal and postural changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Melzig et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burrows and Newland, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pflüger, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Vandervorst and Ghysen, 1980</xref>).

This layer consists of mechanosensory neurons at specific locations on the head and body that elicit aimed grooming of those locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hampel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The aimed movements are performed in a prioritized sequence when mechanosensory neurons detect dust at different locations and become simultaneously activated (i.e. head and body completely dirty). In support of this, simultaneous optogenetic activation of mechanosensory neurons across the head and body elicits a grooming sequence that resembles the dust-induced sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Among the different mechanosensory neurons, the BMNs are particularly important, as their activation alone is sufficient to elicit a grooming sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, activation of individual BMN types elicits aimed grooming, while their simultaneous activation elicits a sequence.</p><p>Here, we define the parallel architecture of BMN types that elicit the head grooming sequence that starts with the eyes and proceeds to other locations, such as the antennae and ventral head. The different BMN types are hypothesized to connect with parallel circuits that elicit grooming of specific locations (described above and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>). Indeed, we identify distinct projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating distant bristles on the head, providing evidence supporting this parallel architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D–F</xref>). However, we also find partially overlapping projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating neighboring bristles. Further, optogenetic activation of BMNs at specific head locations elicits grooming of both those locations and neighboring locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These findings raise questions about the resolution of the parallel architecture underlying grooming. Are BMN types connected with distinct postsynaptic circuits that elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle populations (e.g. Ant bristles)? Or are neighboring BMN types that innervate bristles in particular head areas connected with circuits that elicit grooming of those areas (e.g. dorsal or ventral head)? Future studies of the BMN postsynaptic circuits will be required to define the resolution of the parallel pathways that elicit aimed grooming.</p><p>The parallel-projecting head BMNs are also hypothesized to connect with postsynaptic circuits that perform additional functions to produce the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>). Simultaneous activation of the parallel architecture by dust causes competition among all movements to be performed in the sequence. This competition is resolved through a hierarchical suppression mechanism whereby earlier movements suppress later ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Performance order is established by an activity gradient among the parallel circuits where earlier movements have the highest activity and later ones have the lowest. This gradient was proposed to be produced by controlling sensory gain among the BMNs, or through putative lateral inhibitory connections between the parallel circuits. A winner-take-all network selects the movement with the highest activity and suppresses the others. Our work here provides the foundation for studies that will examine how the BMN postsynaptic circuitry is organized to drive these different functions and produce the grooming sequence.</p><p>The BMNs are hypothesized to have roles in both eliciting and terminating the different movements in the grooming sequence through dust detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Seeds et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). That is, dust on particular body parts would be detected by BMNs that are activated with displacement of their corresponding bristles and elicit aimed grooming. While a completely dirty body part would cause strong BMN activation, the level of activation would decrease as a consequence of the decreased dust levels that occur with grooming. This reduced activity would terminate the selected movement in the sequence, allowing a new round of competition among the remaining movements and selection of the next movement through hierarchical suppression. However, it has not been directly demonstrated that the BMNs elicit or terminate the sequence through dust sensing. For example, blocking BM-InOm neurons does not reduce dust-induced grooming of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). However, this may be due to compensation from neighboring mechanosensory neurons. Thus, the presumed role of the BMNs in detecting dust remains to be directly demonstrated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Flies were reared on Fisherbrand Jazz-Mix <italic>Drosophila</italic> food (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) containing corn meal, brown sugar, yeast, agar, benzoic acid, methyl paraben, and propionic acid. The flies were kept in an incubator at 21°C and 55–65% relative humidity. Flies that were not used for optogenetic experiments were kept on a 16/8 hr light/dark cycle.

Unless stated otherwise, the flies used for experiments were 5- to 8-day-old males.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Imaging the head bristles</title><p>One to 2 mm was cut off the tip of an Eppendorf 200 μL pipette tip, then an approximately 6 mm length was cut off and the remainder discarded. A freeze-killed (&gt;1 hr) male or female Canton S fly was then gently pushed in with a piece of wire, until the head protruded from the tip. The tip was then mounted in a small piece of soft wax. An observation chamber was constructed on a microscope slide, by cutting a 5 mm square hole in three layers of Highland electrical insulation tape (3M, St. Paul, MN, USA) and covering the bottom with a translucent white plastic square (cut from a Farmland Traditions dog treat bag). The fly, held in the tube, was mounted over the chamber using the wax, first dorsal side up (imaged), then ventral side up (imaged). The head was carefully cut off using sharpened iridectomy scissors, falling into the chamber where it was arranged anterior side up, held in place with a piece of coverslip, imaged, flipped posterior side up, and imaged again. Imaging was done with a Zeiss Axio Examiner D1 microscope equipped with a 10x Achroplan objective (0.25 NA) (Karl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The objective was surrounded with a cylinder of the same translucent white plastic in order to diffuse the light source and to avoid air movements that could move the antennae. The cylinder was illuminated from both sides at 2–3 cm distance by a Dolan-Jenner Fiber-lite (Dolan-Jenner Industries, Boxborough, MA, USA). A small amount of additional back-lighting was provided by the microscope light source (20% power) with a blue filter. Images were captured with a Zeiss Axiocam 512 at 60 ms exposure. The focal plane was advanced in small increments manually, resulting in approximately 50 images per head.</p><p>The image Sequence function of Fiji software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc/">http://fiji.sc/</ext-link>) was used to combine all the images into a stack. The pixel size was adjusted to 0.3125 µm and calibrated with an image of a slide micrometer. The stack was downsized to 2048 pixels minimum dimension (usually the height), and an Unsharp Mask filter applied (3 pixel radius, 0.6 mask weight), then the sides of the stack were cropped to remove unnecessary space.</p><p>The Fiji <italic>extended depth of field</italic> (EDF) plugin (Alex Prudencio, EPFL, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) was used to superimpose in-focus areas from the stacks. For acceptable processing times, the stack was downsized to 1024 pixels minimum dimension. The EDF process requires square images, so to avoid excessive cropping the canvas size was increased to 2048 pixels square, resulting in a black surround. The best results were obtained by averaging (with Image Calculator) (1) the result of EDF Easy Mode Fast setting, Gaussian-blurred by 1 pixel radius, with (2) the result of EDF Easy Mode High setting. The resulting image was cropped to 1024 minimum dimension, sharpened with Unsharp Mask, radius 1 pixel, and adjusted for optimal contrast.</p><p>With anterior views of the head, the EDF algorithm has difficulties separating the aristae from the underlying eye facets. Thus, for presentation images of the front view of the head, the EDF process was carried out separately on an anterior stack with the aristae present, and a more posterior stack with the antennae absent. These results were imported as layers into GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) and manually combined by masking.</p><p>To facilitate bristle identification, a color-coded depth map was constructed from the downsized 1024-height stack, sharpened with Unsharp-mask (1 pixel). The color channels were split, and G and B channels discarded. The R channel was Inverted (Edit menu), the contrast was adjusted, and a Gamma correction of 1.34 was applied to the stack. A lookup table (LUT) had been previously created ranging from light blue, through white and yellow to dark red (‘Stellar’). The Image: Hyperstacks: Temporal-Color Code function (LUT Stellar) was applied to the stack, giving a depth-coded image.

However, bristle abbreviations are from the present work unless otherwise indicated. Some bristle names were from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodenstein et al., 1994</xref>, including the <italic>frontal</italic> (Fr), <italic>frontoorbital</italic> (FrOr), <italic>orbital</italic> (Or), <italic>ocellar</italic> (Oc), <italic>interocellar</italic> (InOc), <italic>vertical</italic> (Vt), <italic>postorbital</italic> (PoOr), and <italic>vibrissae</italic> (Vib). We deviated from this nomenclature in the following cases. First, although the PoOr bristles form a continuous row along the back margin of each eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we subdivided them into dPoOr and vPoOr populations based on whether their associated BMNs project through the OcciNv or EyeNv, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and J</xref>). Second, we did not use the bristle name <italic>postvertical</italic>, but instead used <italic>postocellar</italic> (PoOc) that was previously proposed to better describe the location of these bristles as posterior to the other ocellar bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steyskal, 1976</xref>). Third, instead of occipital, we used the name <italic>supracervical</italic> (Su) for the bristles located immediately above the cervical connective on the back of the head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steyskal, 1976</xref>). This is because we named two populations of small bristles on the back of the head the dOcci and vOcci bristles. This name was previously proposed for these bristles in other species of flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steyskal, 1976</xref>). The abbreviation (Occi) was taken from the blowfly literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Theib, 1979</xref>). Given that the Occi bristles are found as two distinct populations in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we refer to them in this work as the dOcci and vOcci bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Our abbreviation for the <italic>vertical</italic> (Vt) bristles describes all vertical bristles. The largest two have been referred to as <italic>Vt inner</italic> (Vti) and <italic>exterior</italic> (Vte) bristles in different fly species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steyskal, 1976</xref>), and were named in the present work Vt 1 and Vt 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). The other previously described Vt bristle (named Vt 3) is posterior to Vt 2. Medial to the Vt 2 bristle is a newly categorized fourth Vt bristle that we could not find a previous description of in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (labeled Vt 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5A</xref>). This bristle could be the paravertical bristle that was previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steyskal, 1976</xref>).</p><p>The bristles on the eyes were referred to as InOm bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Honegger et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zack and Bacon, 1981</xref>). For the bristles on the outer labellum, we used the common name, <italic>taste</italic> (Taste) bristles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stocker, 1994</xref>). We refer to the other bristles on the proboscis as MaPa and Hau bristles. Note: while most of the bristles on the head are termed trichoid sensilla that are innervated by a single BMN, the Taste bristles are mostly basiconic sensilla that are each innervated by a BMN and multiple gustatory neurons. The bristles on the first and second segments of the antennae are referred to as Ant bristles.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bristle quantification</title><p>We counted the bristle populations that are defined above and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>. Most bristles were counted using color-coded depth maps (described above) that aided the identification of the bristles within each population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–H</xref>). The Ant, Fr, FrOr, Or, Oc, InOc, Vt, dOcci, PoOr, Vib, MaPa, Hau, PoOc, and Su bristles were counted using this method on eight male and four female heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> [Table 1]). Bristles on each half of the head were counted using the Fiji Cell Counter plugin (Kurt De Vos, University of Sheffield) and then averaged. These averages were used to calculate average and standard deviation for each bristle population from all counted male and female heads. Two-tailed t-tests were performed to compare male and female bristle numbers for each population. Although in this manuscript we make a distinction between the dPoOr and vPoOr bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we counted all PoOr bristles together when comparing their numbers between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>). We used other approaches to obtain or estimate the numbers of dPoOr, vPoOr, InOm, vOcci, and Taste bristles (described below).</p><p>BMNs that innervate the PoOr bristles project through two different nerves, the Occi- and EyeNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Specifically, BMNs innervating <italic>dorsal PoOr</italic> (dPoOr) bristles project through the OcciNv, while those innervating vPoOr bristles project through the EyeNv. We determined the average number of dPoOr or vPoOr bristles based on whether they were innervated by an Occi- or EyeNv-projecting BMN. The BMNs were labeled using R52A06-GAL4 to express membrane-targeted <italic>green fluorescent protein</italic> (mCD8::GFP) and imaged using a confocal microscope (imaging method described below). We then counted the dPoOr and vPoOr bristles from confocal images (example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Multiple different heads were counted to determine the average number of dPoOr and vPoOr bristles (N=10, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> [Table 2]).</p><p>The InOm bristles were too small and numerous to be counted, and it was only necessary to estimate their numbers in this work. The eyes contain the majority of bristles on the head and the numbers of these bristles can vary. Data from a previous study indicated that each eye contains between 745 and 828 regularly spaced ommatidia (776 average), and most ommatidia have an associated bristle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ready et al., 1976</xref>). However, some ommatidia around the eye edges are not associated with bristles. Based on one example of an eye from a Canton S fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ready et al., 1976</xref>), we calculated that 78% of the ommatidia had an associated bristle for that eye. This percentage was used to estimate that there are between 607 and 645 bristles on each eye from the above counted bristle ranges. This estimate was sufficient for identifying the EM-reconstructed BMNs that innervate the InOm bristles (described below) based on their overwhelming number relative to other head BMNs.</p><p>In this work we identified the vOcci bristles that were not previously described. These bristles were too small to be reliably observed at the level of resolution of the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>. To help visualize and count these bristles, we used a transgenic driver line pBMN-spGAL4 (R28D07-AD ∩ VT050279-DBD) that labels BMNs innervating these bristles (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and F’</xref>). pBMN-spGAL4 was used to express mCD8::GFP, and the ventral posterior head was imaged with a confocal microscope (see below for imaging method). The bristles could be counted by using the labeled BMN dendrites to highlight their locations (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). pBMN-spGAL4 labeled almost all of the visible vOcci bristles, but in some heads, we could see bristles that did not have an labeled BMN (not shown). Therefore, it is possible that the counts of these bristles using the GFP-labeled BMNs are lower than the actual number. We determined the average number of Occi bristles by counting different heads (N=13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> [Table 3]).</p><p>Most of the heads that we imaged had their proboscises oriented such that we could not observe and count all of the Taste bristles.

In this work, ventral head and proboscis grooming were combined and referred to as ventral head grooming. Head nodding was annotated when the fly tilted its head downward by any amount until it returned its head back in its original position. This movement often occurred in repeated cycles. Therefore, the ‘start’ was scored at the onset of the first forward movement and the ‘stop’ when the head returned to its original position on the last nod. Dorsal head grooming was scored when the fly used one or both legs to touch its dorsal head, which included the dorsal part of the eye. During dorsal head grooming, flies sometimes nodded, rotated, or kept their heads in their original position to groom the outer dorsal areas of the head (dorsal eye and posterior dorsal eye). The start of dorsal head grooming was scored when the legs reached their farthest posterior position on the head, before sweeping in the opposite direction.

The brains were imaged immediately using a Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope. The native fluorescence of nSyb.eGFP was preserved enough at the conclusion of the experiment to image the brain neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).</p><p>We attempted to fill BMNs innervating the following head bristles: PoOc, Oc, Or, Ant, Vib, and Vt. Many attempts to fill particular bristles resulted in unfilled or partially filled BMNs. Anecdotally, there also seemed to be a difference in how well the filling method worked for the different bristle populations. For example, multiple attempts to fill the Vt bristles only resulted in one successful fill of a BMN from Vt 1 and Vt 3 bristles. Additionally, we were unable to fill a BMN with multiple attempts of the PoOc bristle. Successful fill trials and the locations of specific bristles that were filled are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Light microscopy image stack storage and availability</title><p>The Z-stacks used to produce panels for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and their figure supplements are all available for download at the Brain Image Library (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_017272">SCR_017272</ext-link>).

We first identified the locations of the Ant-, Occi-, and merged Eye/LabNvs in the EM volume based on their identified locations from light microscopy data. We then chose a cross section of each nerve, close to where they enter brain neuropil, and where segmentation was available for all neurons in the nerve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We seeded every profile in the Occi- and merged Eye/LabNvs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). The Eye/LabNvs had a bundle of soma tracts from an SEZ interneuron hemilineage crossing the seed plane that was excluded from the seeding process based on the morphology of their initial segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Previous studies reconstructed major portions of JONs in FAFB AntNv using the CATMAID platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Because the FlyWire FAFB brain was locally realigned, we transformed those JONs into the FlyWire space using natverse version 0.2.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2020</xref>). After overlaying these JONs onto the seed plane, they were excluded during the seeding effort to identify BMNs in the AntNv. This left a small ventral-medial area of the nerve with previously undocumented neurons that were seeded and reconstructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We focused our reconstructions in the right hemisphere nerves. However, we also examined the OcciNv in the left hemisphere, given that it only contained a small number of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>).</p><p>The segmentations of all seeded neurons were then fully proofread by a human annotator. This process involves splitting falsely merged parts and merging falsely missing parts of a neuron using the tools available in the FlyWire neuroglancer instance (flywire.ai). FlyWire neuroglancer was also used to examine the morphologies of neurons for classification purposes.</p><p>The neurons classified as sensory origin (no soma in the brain, only axonal projections and entering through a nerve) were skeletonized using natverse (skeletor in fafbseg package version 0.10.0). Skeletons were pruned to synapse-rich areas to exclude the smooth axon in the nerve bundle. We created a three-dimensional mesh of the synapses (for synapses see below) and pruned the skeletons to arbors within the mesh volume. We then compared their morphology using the NBLAST algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Costa et al., 2016</xref>) and clustered the similarity scores with Ward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The skeletons of CATMAID reconstructions of JONs from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2020</xref>, and skeletonizations of sensory neurons from this publication were transformed into JRC2018F standard brain space for plotting using natverse. The transformed skeletons, meshes from the FlyWire proofread segmentation, and brain neuropil meshes were plotted with natverse in RStudio 2022.02.3. We used the standard brain transformations to analyze if BMNs crossed the midline in the brain. Defining the midline accurately is possible due to the symmetric nature of this brain space. If any skeleton node coordinates of a given BMN were located in the contralateral hemisphere (x of node &gt;x of midline) we classed the BMN as midline-crossing.</p><p>FlyWire provides access to a synapse table imported from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buhmann et al., 2021</xref>. We queried the table for pre- and postsynaptic sites belonging to the reconstructed sensory neurons for connectome analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">3</xref>). We used the cleft scores of the cleft prediction from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heinrich et al., 2018</xref>, to filter synapses with scores below 50, which reliably excludes falsely predicted synapses.</p><p>We then analyzed the connectivity of BMNs with each other, and with other postsynaptic partners. First, we analyzed BMN-type connectivity by adding up synaptic weights of BMN-to-BMN edges by type and normalizing by the number of possible edges between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Graphs were plotted using Cytoscape version 3.9.1 and the RCy3 (version 2.17.1) and igraph (version 1.3.0) packages for Cytoscape control from R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). Further, we compared BMN types regarding their pre- and postsynaptic connection counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We counted all entries in the FlyWire synapse table at which a given BMN was either the pre- and postsynaptic partner (not number of presynaptic sites, cleft scores ≥50). This revealed that BM-InOm neurons had fewer synaptic connections than other BMN types, which was not surprising given their small, non-complex axonic arbors in the brain. This posed a challenge when comparing BM-InOm neuron synaptic connectivity to other BMN types, as described below.</p><p>We calculated cosine similarity of BMNs to cluster them based on their connectivity similarity. Cosine similarity emphasizes the similarity of BMNs which have similar sets of postsynaptic targets. We took advantage of the good proofreading state of the FlyWire datasat to perform postsynaptic connectivity analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dorkenwald et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorkenwald et al., 2022</xref>). Note that this strategy is agnostic about partner types. A comprehensive typing of the postsynaptic partners will be included in a follow-up study as it exceeds the focus of this study. For this analysis, we excluded synapses between BMNs and only considered postsynaptic connectivity to neuron partners of other types (non-BMNs). As mentioned, BM-InOm neurons have few connections to postsynaptic partners (pre-counts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>), so we choose a low threshold of three synapses and excluded edges below that. When clustering the cosine similarity (ComplexHeatmap version 2.11.2 package in R) for all BMNs, we found that subsets of the BM-InOm neurons clustered together with other BMN types (data not shown), but the clustering failed to capture meaningful groups. Choosing a higher threshold resulted in most of the BM-InOm neuron connectivity being excluded, giving low cosine similarity scores even when compared to each other. We thus choose a higher threshold of seven synapses to analyze the cosine similarity of the BMN types excluding BM-InOm neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) and the low synapse threshold of three for analysis of the BM-InOm neurons separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). This analysis better captured the somatotopic mapping of the BMN types in the brain. From our preliminary analysis we expect BM-InOm neurons to share postsynaptic partners with other BMN types, but further analysis is required to investigate patterns of connectivity of all BMNs to postsynaptic targets.</p><p>Connections to postsynaptic partners were calculated as follows: We analyzed all postsynaptic partners of the BMNs (after applying the above-mentioned cleft score) and summed the BMN input by BMN type. We assigned postsynaptic partners to the BMN type giving the highest input to them (e.g. if BM-Ant neurons contribute the highest synaptic input to a given postsynaptic neuron this neuron is termed Ant_post). We then plotted the connections from BMN types to the postsynaptic partner neurons grouped by their major input partner. To show only strong connections we applied a threshold (&gt;5%) by normalizing the edges by the total output of a given BMN type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Matching EM-reconstructed BMN projections with light microscopy imaged BMNs that innervate specific bristles</title><p>Manual categorization of the EM-reconstructed sensory neurons revealed that they consist of BMNs, JONs, TPMNs, and <italic>gustatory neurons</italic> (GRNs). JONs and GRNs were previously identified and described in the EM volume using the CATMAID platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engert et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hampel et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). The TPMNs were identified based on their morphological similarity to previous light microscopy descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jeong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miyazaki and Ito, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). 25 sensory neurons were reconstructed that could not be identified based on dye fill, MCFO, or published neurons. These neurons are referred to in this work as unknown and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–Y</xref>. We also identified interneurons that were not classified because sensory neurons were the focus of this study. The BMNs, JONs, and TPMNs are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and E</xref>. The GRNs and interneurons were excluded from further analysis in this study.</p><p>The 705 BMNs and 25 unknown sensory neurons were clustered based on NBLAST similarity scores as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We used these clusters in conjunction with manual anatomical inspection of light microscopy images to assign the BMNs to specific bristle populations. In particular, we compared the morphologies of the EM-reconstructed BMNs with dye-filled, stochastically labeled (MCFO), and driver line-labeled BMNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–N</xref>). In some cases we did not have light microscopy images to enable direct matching of particular BMNs to their corresponding bristles. These BMNs were matched based on the morphology of BMNs innervating neighboring bristle populations (described for specific BMNs below). We also verified that the numbers of BMNs for each type were consistent with the numbers of their bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B–F</xref>). In the specific cases described below, we used additional evidence to match the different BMNs to their bristles, including comparing the reconstructed BMNs on both sides of the brain (OcciNv only, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>) and based on common connectivity of the BMNs with their postsynaptic partners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). A full list of the BMNs can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p><p>The BMNs have been referred to in some previous work as external sensilla (es neurons). We adopted BMN here because it was similar to the widely adopted nomenclature for different sensory modalities, such as GRNs, ORNs, JONs. Further, it more explicitly links the neurons to the bristles.</p><p>Three BMNs that innervate the InOc bristles (BM-InOc neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) were identified based on comparison with MCFO data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). One BMN that innervates the Oc bristle (BM-Oc neuron, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) was identified based on comparison with dye fill data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Six BMNs are proposed to innervate the Fr bristles (BM-Fr neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The Fr bristles are located near the midline, immediately above the Ant bristles and below the InOc and Oc bristles. BMNs that innervate the Ant, InOc, and Oc bristles show very similar morphology with the BM-Fr neurons, including the ipsilateral and midline projections. 20 BMNs that innervate the Ant bristles (BM-Ant neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) were identified based on comparison with dye fill data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Three BMNs that innervate the Or bristles (BM-Or neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>) were identified based on comparison with dye fill data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Six BMNs are proposed to innervate the FrOr bristles (BM-FrOr neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). The FrOr bristles are located immediately ventral to the Or bristles. The BM-Or neurons show very similar morphology with the proposed BM-FrOr neurons, including an ipsilateral projection.</p><p>555 BMNs that innervate the InOm bristles (BM-InOm neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>) were identified using previous descriptions of the projections of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hampel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The similarity of the collective projections of the BM-InOm neurons with those labeled by the InOmBMN-LexA driver line are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2N</xref>. Clustering based on NBLAST similarity scores revealed that there were morphologically distinct groups of BM-InOm neurons. However, in contrast to other BMN types, the BN-InOm neurons were small with few relatively simple branches, and the clusters were likely due to relatively minor differences in these branches. For example, at the selected cut height (H=5) resulted in 11 different clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Additionally, while the BM-InOm neurons showed some differential postsynaptic connectivity based on cosine clustering results, these differences were relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, the BM-InOm neurons are treated as a single group that innervates eye bristles in this work, while a future study will further examine the heterogeneity of the BM-InOm neurons.</p><p>18 EyeNv-projecting BMNs that innervate the Vib bristles (BM-Vib neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6M</xref>) were identified based on comparison with dye fill data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G</xref>). This includes three BMNs that project through the AntNv (BM-Vib [AntNv] neurons) that are morphologically similar to the BM-Vib (EyeNv) neurons. Based on 52A06-GAL4 labeling of BMNs on the head, BM-Vib (AntNv) neurons innervate smaller anterior Vib bristles that are lateral to Vib 1 and 2 bristles. In total, 15 BMNs projecting through the EyeNv (BM-Vib [EyeNv]) and 3 projecting through the AntNv (BM-Vib [AntNv]) were identified in the EM dataset.</p><p>15 BMNs are proposed to innervate the MaPa bristles (BM-MaPa neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6N</xref>), as their morphology matches a previous description (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Naresh Singh and Nayak, 1985</xref>). It was difficult to distinguish between BM-MaPa and BM-Vib neurons based on morphology or nerve projection. However, all BM-MaPa neurons showed high cosine similarity in their postsynaptic connectivity to non-BMN neurons, and clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>BMNs that innervate the Taste bristles (BM-Taste neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>) were identified based on their similarity to the MCFO images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We did not have dye fill or MCFO images of the BMNs that innervate the Hau bristles (BM-Hau neurons). These BMNs were presumed to show similar morphology to the BM-Taste neurons, given their close proximity. Indeed, visual inspection revealed five BMNs that had similar, yet slightly different morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6P</xref>). The axons appeared larger in diameter and showed a dorsal midline-crossing branch that was not found in BM-Taste neurons. Further, the five BM-Hau neurons showed high cosine similarity in their postsynaptic connectivity with non-BMN neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Five BMNs that project through the OcciNv that could innervate the Vt bristles (BM-Vt neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6Q</xref>) were identified based on comparison with dye fill data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2I–K</xref>). Because there are only four Vt bristles, the additional BMN in this group is proposed to innervate the PoOc bristle (BM-PoOc neuron). However, because we had no dye fills for the BM-PoOc neuron and limited dye fill examples of BM-Vt neurons, we included all five BMNs in the category BM-Vt/PoOc neurons. PoOc is hypothesized to project through the OcciNv and show similar morphology to the neighboring BM-Oc and -InOc neurons, and at least one BM-Vt/PoOc neuron has the expected morphology. Although the BM-InOc neuron is presumed to exist, we could not find evidence of a neuron innervating the PoOc bristle using any of the BMN driver lines reported in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p><p>Seven BMNs projecting through the OcciNv showed very similar morphology and were identified as innervating the dPoOr and dOcci bristles and named BM-dPoOr and BM-dOcci neurons, respectively. The morphology of the BM-dPoOr neurons was determined from MCFO experiments using dBMN-spGAL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2L</xref>). MCFO experiments using pBMN-spGAL4 did not enable us to distinguish between BM-dPoOr and BM-dOcci neurons, as we could not tell which BMN came from which bristle population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4S, T</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7B–D</xref>). One difficulty in matching the reconstructed BM-PoOr and BM-dOcci neurons was that their numbers in the left brain hemisphere did not match what we expected from the numbers of their corresponding bristles. For example, there were only four tentatively assigned BM-dPoOr neurons, while we expected between five and nine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Because the OcciNv contains only a small number of BMNs, we also reconstructed BMNs in the right brain hemisphere OcciNv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4A–D</xref>). This revealed four additional BMNs on the right than on the left for the BM-dPoOr neurons, which matched what we expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4D</xref>). The numbers of the other BMN types that project through the OcciNv (i.e. BM-Vt/PoOc and BM-dOcci neurons) were the same in both hemispheres and matched with the expected number of bristles.</p><p>26 BMNs projecting through the EyeNv show very similar morphology and were identified as innervating the vPoOr and vOcci bristles. The vOcci-innervating BMNs (BM-vOcci neurons) were matched with MCFO images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2M</xref>). However, we did not obtain dye fill or MCFO images of BMNs innervating the vPoOr bristles (BM-vPoOr neurons). These neurons were expected to show similar morphology with the BM-vOcci neurons based on their close proximity. Because we could not distinguish between these BMNs, they were grouped together and named (BM-vOcci/vPoOr neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6T</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Quantification of bristle populations on male and female heads.</title><p>Table 1.

The result is a neuroanatomy resource that will be an important community resource. To match BMNs reconstructed in an electron microscopy volume of the adult fly brain, the authors matched clustered reconstructed BMNs with light-level BMN classes observed using precise dye-fills and stochastic labeling techniques. The authors then employ a variety of clustering methods to demonstrate that BMN populations that innervate different regions of the head project into the subesophageal zone and terminate in distinctive yet, in some cases, partially overlapping zones. By clustering BMNs on the basis of their synaptic partners, the authors find that BMNs from distant areas of the head have non-overlapping synaptic partners while those from neighbor areas have overlapping synaptic partners. This result calls into question the scale at which the parallel model of hierarchical suppression may be operating. Finally, the authors use tools that were generated during the light-level characterization of BMN projections to show that activating BMNs that innervate specific areas of the head leads to grooming of the innervated regions and neighboring regions, consistent with the observed overlap in downstream circuits between BMNs innervating neighboring regions of the head. This result suggests that while the parallel model could be operating on a broad scale, additional circuit mechanisms may be operating on a finer scale to produce grooming of the area surrounding the source of mechanosensory input.</p><p>This work will have a positive impact on the field by contributing a complete accounting of the mechanosensory bristles of the fruit fly head, describing the brain projection patterns of the BMNs that innervate them, and linking them to BMN sensory projections in an electron microscopy volume of the adult fly brain. It will also have a positive impact on the field by providing genetic tools to help functionally subdivide the contributions of different BMN populations to circuit computations and behavior. This contribution will pave the way for further mechanistic study of central circuits that subserve grooming circuits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87602.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seeds</surname><given-names>Andrew M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Neurobiology, University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eichler</surname><given-names>Katharina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hampel</surname><given-names>Stefanie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Alejandro-García</surname><given-names>Adrián</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Calle-Schuler</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Santana-Cruz</surname><given-names>Alexis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Neurobiology, Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">San Juan</named-content></addr-line><country>Puerto Rico</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kmecova</surname><given-names>Lucia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Blagburn</surname><given-names>Jonathan M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hoopfer</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Carleton College</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Northfield</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This valuable work provides a near-complete description of the mechanosensory bristles on the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> head and the anatomy and projection patterns of the bristle mechanosensory neurons that innervate them.

In this manuscript, the authors have built on a large body of previous work to comprehensively classify and quantify the head bristles. They broadly identify the nerves that various bristles use to project to the SEZ and describe their region-specific innervation in the SEZ. They use dye-fills, clonal labelling, and electron microscopic reconstructions to describe in detail the phenomenon of somatotopy - conserved peripheral representations within the central brain - within the innervation of these neurons. In the process they develop novel tools to access subsets of these neurons. They use these to demostrate that groups of bristles in different parts of the head control different aspects of the grooming sequence.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors combine genetic tools, dye fills and connectome analysis techniques to generate a &quot;first-of-its-kind&quot;, near complete, synaptic resolution map of the head bristle neurons of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Therefore, we are currently limited to manual annotation for our behavioral analysis. That said, we do not believe that our manual annotation is subjective. The grooming movements that we examine in this work are distinguishable from each other through frame-by-frame manual annotation of video at 30 fps. Our annotation of the grooming and backward motions performed by flies are based on previous publications that established a controlled vocabulary defining each movement (Hampel et al., 2020a, 2017, 2015; Seeds et al., 2014). In this work, we added head nodding to this controlled vocabulary that is described in the Materials and methods. We have added additional text to the third paragraph of the Material and methods section entitled “Behavioral analysis procedures” that we hope better describes our behavioral analysis. This description now reads:</p><p>Head <italic>nodding</italic> was annotated when the fly tilted its head downward by any amount until it returned its head back in its original position. This movement often occurred in repeated cycles. Therefore, the “start” was scored at the onset of the first forward movement and the “stop” when the head returned to its original position on the last nod.</p><p>We do not make any firm conclusions about the head movements (nodding) and backwards motions. We refer to nodding as a descriptive term that would allow the reader to better understand what the behavior looks like. We make no firm conclusions about any behavioral functional role that either the nodding or the backward motions might have, with the exception of nodding in the context of grooming. We only suggest that the behaviors appear to be avoidance responses. Furthermore, backward walking was not mentioned. Instead we refer to backward motions. We are only reporting our annotations of these movements that do occur, and are significantly different from controls. We speculate that these could be avoidance responses based on support from the literature. Future studies will be required to understand whether these movements serve real behavioral roles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors end up generating a near-complete map of head BMNs that will serve as a long-standing resource to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> research community.

The authors then switch from morphology-based categorization to non-BMN connectivity as a clustering method, which they claim demonstrates that BMNs form a somatotopic map in the brain. This map is not easily appreciated, and although contralateral projections in some populations are clear, the distinct projection zones that are mentioned by the authors are not readily apparent. Because of the extensive morphological overlap between connectivity-based clusters, it is not clear that small projection differences at the projection level are what determines the post-synaptic connectivity of a given BMN cluster or their functional role during behavior. The claim the somatotopic organization of BMN projections is preserved among their postsynaptic partners to form parallel sensory pathways is not supported by the result that different connectivity clusters still have high cosine similarity in a number of cases (i.e. Clusters 1 and 3, or Clusters 1 and 2). Finally, the authors use tools that were generated during the light-level characterization of BMN projections to show that specifically activating BMNs that innervate different areas of the head triggers different grooming behaviors. In one case, activation of a single population of sensory bristles (lnOm) triggers two different behaviors, both eye and dorsal head grooming. This result does not seem consistent with the parallel model, which suggests that these behaviors should be mutually exclusive and rely on parallel downstream circuitry.</p></disp-quote><p>We made revisions to the manuscript that address this recommendation.

We describe how previous studies showed bristle mechanosensory neurons in insects are somatotopically organized, but these studies were not comprehensive descriptions of complete somatotopic maps for the head or body. To our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive and synaptic resolution somatotopic map of a head for any animal. This sets the stage for the complete definition of the interface between somatotopically-organized mechanosensory neurons and postsynaptic circuits, which has broad implications for future studies on aimed grooming, and mechanosensation in general. Below we itemize revisions to the Introduction, Discussion, and Figures to provide a clearer statement of the significance of our study as it relates to somatotopy.</p><p>(1) Newly added Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 more explicitly grounds the study in somatotopy, providing a working model of the organization of the circuit pathways that produce the grooming sequence. This model features somatotopy as shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 1C.</p><p>(2) Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 is incorporated into the Introduction in the second, third, and fourth paragraphs, the first paragraph of the Results section titled “Somatotopically-organized parallel BMN pathways”, and the second and third paragraphs of the last Discussion section titled “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence”.</p><p>(3) We added text to the end of the fourth paragraph of the Introduction that now reads: “In this model, parallel-projecting mechanosensory neurons that respond to stimuli at specific locations on the head or body could connect with somatotopically-organized parallel circuits that elicit grooming of those locations (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-C). The previous discovery of a mechanosensory-connected circuit that elicits aimed grooming of the antennae provides evidence of this organization (Hampel 2015). However, the extent to which distinct circuits elicit grooming of other locations is unknown, in part, because the somatotopic projections of the mechanosensory neurons have not been comprehensively defined for the head or body.”</p><p>(4) There is a Discussion section that further explains the extent of prior knowledge and our contributions on somatotopy that is titled “A synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head BMNs”. Additionally, the previous version of this section had a paragraph on the broader implications of our work as it relates to somatotopy across species. In light of the reviewer comments, we decided to make this paragraph into its own Discussion section to better highlight the broader significance of our work. This section is titled “First synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The somatotopy isn't overtly obvious - perhaps they could try mapping presynaptic sites and provide landmarks to improve visualisation.</p></disp-quote><p>We made the following revisions to better highlight the head BMN somatotopy. One point of confusion from the previous manuscript version stemmed from us not explicitly defining the somatotopic organization that we observed. There seemed to be confusion that we were defining the head somatotopy based only on the small projection differences among BMNs from neighboring head locations. While we believe that these small differences indeed correspond to somatotopy, we failed to highlight that there are overt differences in the brain projections of BMNs from distant locations on the head. For example, Figure 5B (right panel) shows the distinct projections between the LabNv (brown) and AntNv (blue) BMNs that innervate bristles on the ventral and dorsal head, respectively. Thus, BMN types innervating neighboring bristles show overlapping projections with small projection differences, whereas those innervating distant bristles show non overlapping projections into distinct zones.</p><p>Our analysis of postsynaptic connectivity similarity also shows somatotopic organization among the BMN postsynaptic partners, as BMN types innervating the same or neighboring bristle populations show high connectivity similarity (Figure 8, old Figure 7). Below we highlight major revisions to the text and Figures that hopefully better reveal the head somatotopy.</p><p>(1) In the last paragraph of the Introduction we added text that explicitly frames the experiments in terms of somatotopic organization: “This reveals somatotopic organization, where BMNs innervating neighboring bristles project to the same zones in the CNS while those innervating distant bristles project to distinct zones. Analysis of the BMN postsynaptic connectome reveals that neighboring BMNs show higher connectivity similarity than distant BMNs, providing evidence of somatotopically organized postsynaptic circuit pathways.”</p><p>(2) We mention an example of overt somatotopy from Figure 5 in the Results section titled “EM-based reconstruction of the head BMN projections in a full adult brain”. The text reads “For example, BMNs from the Eye- and LabNv have distinct ventral and anterior projections, respectively. This shows how the BMNs are somatotopically organized, as their distinct projections correspond to different bristle locations on the head (Figure 5B,C).”</p><p>(3) In new Figure 8 (part of old Figure 7), we modified panels that correspond to the cosine similarity analysis of postsynaptic connectivity. The major revision was to plot the cosine similarity clusters onto the head bristles so that the bristles are now colored based on their clusters (C). This shows how neighboring BMNs cluster together, and therefore show similar postsynaptic connectivity. We believe that this provides a nice visualization of somatotopic organization in BMN postsynaptic connectivity. We also added the clustering dendrogram as recommended by Reviewer #2 (Figure 8A).</p><p>(4) In new Figure 8, we added new panels (D-F) that summarize our anatomical and connectomic analysis showing different somatotopic features of the head BMNs. Different BMN types innervate bristles at neighboring and distant proximities (D). BMNs that innervate neighboring bristles project into overlapping zones (E, example of reconstructed BM-Fr and -Ant neurons with non-overlapping BM-MaPa neurons) and show postsynaptic connectivity similarity (F, example connectivity map of three BM types on cosine similarity data).</p><p>(5) To accompany the new Figure 8D-F panels, we added a paragraph to summarize the different somatotopic features of the head BMNs that were identified based on our anatomical and connectomic analysis. This is the last paragraph in the Results section titled “Somatotopically-organized parallel BMN pathways”:</p><p>Our results reveal head bristle proximity-based organization among the BMN projections and their postsynaptic partners to form parallel mechanosensory pathways. BMNs innervating neighboring bristles project into overlapping zones in the SEZ, whereas those innervating distant bristles project to distinct zones (example of BM-Fr, -Ant, and -MaPa neurons shown in Figure 8D,E). Cosine similarity analysis of BMN postsynaptic connectivity revealed that BMNs innervating the same bristle populations (same types) have the highest connectivity similarity. Figure 8F shows example parallel connections for BM-Fr, -Ant, and -MaPa neurons (vertical arrows), where the edge width indicates the number of synapses from each BMN type to their major postsynaptic partners. Additionally, BMNs innervating neighboring bristle populations showed postsynaptic connectivity similarity, while BMNs innervating distant bristles show little or none. For example, BM-Fr and -Ant neurons have connections to common postsynaptic partners, whereas BM-MaPa neurons show only weak connections with the main postsynaptic partners of BM-Fr or -Ant neurons (Figure 8F, connections under 5% of total BMN output omitted). These results suggest that BMN somatotopy could have different possible levels of head spatial resolution, from specific bristle populations (e.g. Ant bristles), to general head areas (e.g. dorsal head bristles).</p><p>We also refer to Figure 8D-F to illustrate the different somatotopic features in the Discussion. These references can be found in the following Discussion sections titled “A synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head BMNs (fourth paragraph)”, and “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence (second paragraph)”.</p><p>(6) In addition to improving the Figures, we provide additional tools that enable readers to explore the BMN somatotopy in a more interactive way. That is, we provide 5 different FlyWire.ai links in the manuscript Results section that enable 3D visualization of the different reconstructed BMNs (e.g. FlyWire.ai link 1).</p><p>Note: In working on old Figure 7 to address this Reviewer suggestion, we also reordered panels A-E. We believe that this was a more logical ordering than in the previous draft. These panels are now the only data shown in Figure 7, as the cosine similarity analysis is now in Figure 8. We hope that splitting these panels into two Figures will improve manuscript readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Light EM Mapping: A better description of methods by which this mapping was done would be helpful. Perhaps the authors could provide a few example parallel representations of the EM and light images in the main figure would help the reader better appreciate the strength of their approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done as the Reviewers suggested and added panels to Figure 6 that show examples of the LM and EM image matching (Figure 6A,B). We added two examples that used different methods for labeling the LM imaged BMNs, including MCFO labeling of an individual BM-InOc neuron and driver line labeling of a major portion of BM-InOm neurons using InOmBMN-LexA. These panels are referred to in the first paragraph of the Results section titled “Matching the reconstructed head BMNs with their bristles”. Note that examples for all LM/EM matched BMN types are shown in Figure 6 – figure supplement 2.</p><p>We had provided Figure 6 – figure supplement 2 in the reviewed manuscript that shows all the above requested “parallel representations of the EM and light images”. However, the Reviewer critiques made us realize that the purpose of this figure supplement was not clearly indicated. Therefore, we have revised Figure 6 – figure supplement 2 and its legend to make its purpose clearer. First, we changed the legend title to better highlight its purpose. The legend is now titled: “Matching EM reconstructed BMN projections with light microscopy (LM) imaged BMNs that innervate specific bristles”. Second, we added label designations to the figure panel rows that highlight the LM and EM comparisons. That is, the rows for light microscopy images of BMNs are indicated with LM and the rows for EM reconstructed BMN images are labeled with EM. Reviewer #3 had indicated that it was not clear what labeling methods were used to visualize the LM imaged BM-InOm neurons in Figure 6 – figure supplement 2N. Therefore, we added text to the figure and the legend to better highlight the different methods used. Panels A and B were also cropped to accommodate the above mentioned revisions.</p><p>The manuscript also provides an extensive Materials and methods section that describes the different lines of evidence that were used to assign the reconstructed BMNs as specific types. We changed the title to better highlight the purpose of this methods section to “Matching EM reconstructed BMN projections with light microscopy imaged BMNs that innervate specific bristles”. The evidence used to support the assignment of the different BMN types is also summarized in Figure 6 – figure supplement 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Parallel circuit model: The authors motivate their study with this. We're recommending that they define expectations of such circuitry, its alternatives (including implications for downstream pathways), and behavior before they present their results.

This manuscript provides a comprehensive assessment of the first layer of this circuit architecture. A byproduct of this work is a contribution that offers immediate utility and significance to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> connectomics community. Namely, the description of the majority of mechanosensory neurons on the head, with their annotation in the recently released whole brain connectome dataset (FlyWire.ai). In writing this manuscript, we tried to balance both of these things, which was difficult to write. We very much appreciate the Reviewers' comments that have highlighted points of confusion in our original draft. We hope that the revised draft is now clearer and more logically presented. We have made revisions to the text and provided a new figure supplement (Figure 1 - figure supplement 1) and new panels in Figure 8. Below we highlight the major revisions.</p><p>(1) The Introduction was revised to more explicitly ground the study in the parallel model, while also removing details that were not pertinent to the experiments presented in the manuscript.</p><p>The first paragraph introduces different features of the parallel model. To better focus the reader on the parts of the model that were being assessed in the manuscript, we removed the following sentences: “Performance order is established by an activity gradient among parallel circuits where earlier actions have the highest activity and later actions have the lowest. A winner-take-all network selects the action with the highest activity and suppresses the others. The selected action is performed and then terminated to allow a new round of competition and selection of the next action.” Note that these sentences are included in the third and fourth paragraphs of the last Discussion section titled “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence”.</p><p>The first paragraph of the Introduction now introduces a bigger picture view of the model that emphasizes the two main features: (1) a parallel circuit architecture that ensures all mutually exclusive actions to be performed in sequence are simultaneously readied and competing for output, and (2) hierarchical suppression among the parallel circuits, where earlier actions suppress later actions.</p><p>(2) Newly added Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 provides a working model of grooming (Reviewer # 1 suggestion). We now more strongly emphasize that the study aimed to define the parallel neural circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence, focusing on the mechanosensory layer of this architecture. In particular, we refer to the new Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 that has been added to better convey the hypothesized grooming neural circuit architecture. Figure 1 – figure supplement 1 is incorporated into the Introduction (paragraphs two, three, and four), Results section titled “Somatotopically-organized parallel BMN pathways (first paragraph)”, and last Discussion section titled “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence (second and third paragraphs)”.</p><p>(3) New panels in Figure 8 update the model of parallel circuit organization as it relates to somatotopy (D-F). These panels show the parallel circuits hypothesized by the model, but also indicate convergence, with different possible levels of head resolution for these circuits. We describe above where these panels are referenced in the text.</p><p>(4) We added a new paragraph in the last Discussion section titled “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence” that better incorporates the results from this manuscript into the working model of grooming. This paragraph is shown below.</p><p>Here we define the parallel architecture of BMN types that elicit the head grooming sequence that starts with the eyes and proceeds to other locations, such as the antennae and ventral head. The different BMN types are hypothesized to connect with parallel circuits that elicit grooming of specific locations (described above and shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C). Indeed, we identify distinct projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating distant bristles on the head, providing evidence supporting this parallel architecture (Figure 8D-F). However, we also find partially overlapping projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating neighboring bristles. Further, optogenetic activation of BMNs at specific head locations elicits grooming of both those locations and neighboring locations (Figure 9). These findings raise questions about the resolution of the parallel architecture underlying grooming. Are BMN types connected with distinct postsynaptic circuits that elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle populations (e.g. Ant bristles)? Or are neighboring BMN types that innervate bristles in particular head areas connected with circuits that elicit grooming of those areas (e.g. dorsal or ventral head)? Future studies of the BMN postsynaptic circuits will be required to define the resolution of the parallel pathways that elicit aimed grooming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Aside from this summary of major concerns, the detailed recommendations are attached below.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I appreciate the quality and exhaustive body of work presented in this manuscript.

It would have been nice to have been introduced to what the alternative model might be and what each would mean for organisation of the circuit architecture. Some guiding schematics would go a long way in illustrating this point.

This would help in orienting the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer #1 that Figure 4 and its supplements could use some indicator that would orient the reader with respect to the dye filled or stochastically labeled neurons. The images are of the entire SEZ in the ventral brain, and in the case of some panels, the background staining enables visualization of the brain e.g. Figure 4H,M,N. To help orient the reader in this region, we added a dotted line to indicate the approximate SEZ midline. This also enables the reader to more clearly see which of the BMN types cross the midline.</p><p>Midline visual guides were added for Figure 4, Figure 4 – figure supplement 2, Figure 4 – figure supplement 3, Figure 4 – figure supplement 4, Figure 4 – figure supplement 5, Figure 4 – figure supplement 6, Figure 4 – figure supplement 7, Figure 4 – figure supplement 8, Figure 6 – figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The comparison between the EM and the fills/clones are not obvious.

I think it would help the reader if a few sentences about cosine clustering used for connectivity based clustering were included in the main text. Also, for NBLAST hierarchical clustering, it would help if some informed metrics could be used for defining cluster numbers (e.g. Braun et al, 2010 PLOS ONE shows how Ward linkage cost could be used for hierarchical clustering).</p></disp-quote><p>Depending on where the cut height is placed on the dendrogram for cosine similarity of BMNs, different features of the BMN type postsynaptic connectivity are captured. As the number of clusters is increased (lower cut height), clustering is mainly among BMNs of the same type, showing that these BMNs have the highest connectivity similarity. As the number of clusters is reduced (higher cut height), BMNs innervating neighboring bristles on the head are clustered, revealing three general clusters corresponding to the dorsal, ventral, and posterior head. This reveals somatotopy based clustering among same and neighboring BMN types. The cut height shown in Figure 8 and Figure 8 – figure supplement 2 was chosen because it highlighted both of these features.</p><p>The NBLAST clustering shows similar results to the connectivity based clustering with respect to neighboring and distant BMN types. As the number of clusters increases BMNs of the same type are clustered, and these types can be further subdivided into morphologically distinct subtypes. As the number of clusters is reduced, the clustering captures neighboring BMNs. Thus, neighboring BMN types showed high morphology similarity (and proximity) with each other, and low similarity with distant BMN types.</p><p>Please see our responses to a Reviewer #3 critique below for further description of the clustering results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the same lines it would help if the clustering dendrograms were included in the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for this comment.

Our previous work (Hampel et al. 2015) described a mechanosensory connected neural circuit that elicits grooming of the antennae. While this previous study demonstrated that the Johnston’s organ mechanosensory neurons are synaptically and functionally connected with this circuit, our preliminary analysis indicates that it is also connected with BM-Ant neurons. We hypothesize that there are additional such circuits that are responsible for eliciting grooming of other head locations.</p><p>To better highlight potential downstream targets in the manuscript, we now mention the antennal circuit in the Introduction. This text reads: In this model, parallel-projecting mechanosensory neurons that respond to stimuli at specific locations on the head or body could connect with somatotopically-organized parallel circuits that elicit grooming of those locations (Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A-C). The previous discovery of a mechanosensory-connected circuit that elicits aimed grooming of the antennae provides evidence of this organization (Hampel 2015). However, the extent to which distinct circuits elicit grooming of other locations is unknown, in part, because the somatotopic projections of the mechanosensory neurons have not been comprehensively defined for the head or body.</p><p>There is also text in the Discussion that addresses this Reviewer comment. It describes the antennal circuit and mentions the possibility that other similar circuits may exist. This can be found in the third paragraph of the section titled “Circuits that elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Authors find that opto activation of BMNs leads to grooming of targeted as well as neighboring areas. Is there any sequence observed here? i.e. first clean targeted area and then clean neighboring area? I wonder if the answer to this is something as simple as common post-synaptic targets which is essentially reducing the resolution of the BMN sensory map. Some more speculation on this interesting result could be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate and agree with this point from Reviewer #2, and have tried to better emphasize the possible implications for grooming that the overlapping projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating neighboring bristles may have. This is now better addressed in the Results and Discussion sections. Below we highlight where this is addressed:</p><p>(1) In the second paragraph of the Results section titled “Activation of subsets of head BMNs elicits aimed grooming of specific locations” we added text that suggests the possibility that grooming of the stimulated and neighboring locations could be due to the overlapping projections and connectivity. This text reads: This suggested that head BMNs elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations, but also neighboring locations. This result is consistent with our anatomical and connectomic data indicating that BMNs innervating neighboring bristles show overlapping projections and postsynaptic connectivity similarity (see Discussion).</p><p>(2) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section titled “A synaptic resolution somatotopic map of the head BMNs”, we added a sentence to the end of the fourth paragraph that alludes to further discussion of this topic. This sentence reads: This overlap may have implications for aimed grooming behavior. For example, neighboring BMNs could connect with common neural circuits to elicit grooming of overlapping locations (discussed more below).</p><p>(3) In the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section titled “Circuits that elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations” there is a paragraph that mentions the possibility of mechanosensory convergence onto common postsynaptic circuits to promote grooming of the stimulated area, along with neighboring areas. This paragraph is below.</p><p>We find that activation of specific BMN types elicits both aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle locations and neighboring locations. This suggests overlap in the locations that are groomed with the activation of different BMN types. Such overlap provides a means of cleaning the area surrounding the stimulus location. Interestingly, our NBLAST and cosine similarity analysis indicates that neighboring BMNs project into overlapping zones in the SEZ and show common postsynaptic connectivity. Thus, we hypothesize that neighboring BMNs connect with common neural circuits (e.g. antennal grooming circuit) to elicit overlapping aimed grooming of common head locations.</p><p>(4) In the new second paragraph of the Discussion section titled “Parallel circuit architecture underlying the grooming sequence” we further discuss the issue of the BMN “sensory map. This paragraph is below.</p><p>Here we define the parallel architecture of BMN types that elicit the head grooming sequence that starts with the eyes and proceeds to other locations, such as the antennae and ventral head. The different BMN types are hypothesized to connect with parallel circuits that elicit grooming of specific locations (described above and shown in Figure 1 – figure supplement 1A,C). Indeed, we identify distinct projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating distant bristles on the head, providing evidence supporting this parallel architecture (Figure 8D-F). However, we also find partially overlapping projections and connectivity among BMNs innervating neighboring bristles. Further, optogenetic activation of BMNs at specific head locations elicits grooming of both those locations and neighboring locations (Figure 9). These findings raise questions about the resolution of the parallel architecture underlying grooming. Are BMN types connected with distinct postsynaptic circuits that elicit aimed grooming of their corresponding bristle populations (e.g. Ant bristles)? Or are neighboring BMN types that innervate bristles in particular head areas connected with circuits that elicit grooming of those areas (e.g. dorsal or ventral head)? Future studies of the BMN postsynaptic circuits will be required to define the resolution of the parallel pathways that elicit aimed grooming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) If authors were to include a summary table that shows all known attributes about BMN type as columns that could be very useful as a resource to the community.

The following Materials and methods section provides a detailed description of the evidence used to assign each BMN type in “Matching EM reconstructed BMN projections with light microscopy imaged BMNs that innervate specific bristles”. In many cases, BMN type could be assigned with confidence solely based on morphological comparisons with our light level data (e.g. dye fills), in conjunction with bristle counts to indicate an expected number of BMNs showing similar morphology. Thus, the LM/EM matches and NBLAST clustering were largely complementary.</p><p>The EM reconstructed BMNs were matched as particular BMN types, in part based on examination of the NBLAST data at different cut heights. NBLAST clustering of the BMNs revealed general trends at higher and lower cut heights (Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A, Supplementary file 3). The lowest cut heights included mostly BMNs of the same type innervating the same bristle populations, and smaller clusters that subdivided into morphologically distinct subtypes (see Supplementary file 3 for clusters produced at cut height 1). This revealed that BMNs of the same type tended to show the highest morphological similarity with each other, but they also showed intratype morphological diversity. Higher cut heights produced clusters of BMNs innervating neighboring bristles populations (e.g. ventral head BMNs), showing high morphological similarity among neighboring BMN types.</p><p>We selected the cut height 5 shown in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A,B because it captures examples of both same and neighboring type clustering. For example, it captures a cluster of mostly BM-Taste neurons (Cluster 16), and neighboring BMN types, including those from the dorsal head (Cluster 14) or ventral head (Cluster 15).</p><p>Based on reviewer comments, we realized that the way we wrote the BMN matching section in the Results indicated more reliance on the NBLAST clustering than what was actually necessary, distorting the way we actually matched the BMNs. Therefore, we softend the first couple of sentences to place less emphasis on the importance of the NBLAST. We also indicated that the readers can find the resulting clusters at different cut heights, referring to Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A and Supplementary file 3. The first two sentences of the first paragraph in the Results section titled “Matching the reconstructed head BMNs with their bristles” now read:</p><p>The reconstructed BMN projections were next matched with their specific bristle populations. The projections were clustered based on morphological similarity using the NBLAST algorithm (example clustering at cut height 5 shown in Figure 6 – figure supplement 1A,B, Supplementary file 3, FlyWire.ai link 2) (Costa et al., 2016). Clusters could be assigned as BMN types based on their similarity to light microscopy images of BMNs known to innervate specific bristles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The number of reconstructed BMNs is remarkably similar to what is expected based on bristle counts for each group except for lnOm. Why do you think there is such a large discrepancy there?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that there is a discrepancy between the number of reconstructed BM-InOm neurons and the number expected based on InOm bristle counts because these bristle counts were based on few flies and these numbers appear to be variable. We did not further investigate the numbers of InOm bristles in this manuscript because we only needed an estimate of their numbers, given that there is over an order of magnitude difference in the eye bristles versus any other head bristle population. Therefore, we could relatively easily conclude that the head BMNs were related to the InOm bristles, based on their sheer numbers and their morphology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 - figure supplement 2N, please describe these panels better. Main text says the upper image is from lnOmBMN-LexA, but the figure legend doesn't agree.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added text to the figure legend that now makes the contents of panel 2N clear to the reader. Further, we now indicate in the figure legend for each panel, the method used to obtain the labeled neurons (i.e. fill, MCFO, driver), to avoid similar confusion for the other panels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 - figure supplement 4D. How frequently is there a mismatch between the number of BMNs for a given type across hemispheres?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the full reconstruction of the BMNs on both sides of the brain was beyond the scope of this work, the BMNs on both sides have since been reconstructed and annotated (Schlegal et al. 2023). We plan to provide more analysis of BMNs on both sides of the brain in a forthcoming manuscript. However, the BMN numbers tend to show agreement on both sides of the brain.

The overlap is likely functionally significant, as cosine similarity analysis revealed that neighboring head BMN types have common postsynaptic partners. However, overlap between neighboring BMN types is only partial, as they show differing projections and postsynaptic connectivity.&quot; Then in this paragraph, you say, &quot;How do the parallel-projecting head BMNs interface with postsynaptic neural circuits to elicit aimed grooming of specific head locations? Different evidence supports the hypothesis that the BMNs connect with parallel circuits that each elicit a different aimed grooming movement (Seeds et al., 2014).&quot; The overlapping postsynaptic BMN connectivity seems in conflict with the claim that the circuits are parallel.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this confusion. We now better describe this apparent discrepancy between our results and the parallel model of grooming behavior. We made several revisions to the manuscript that address this recommendation.

These image stacks are stored in the Brain Image Library (BIL). Rows in the spreadsheet correspond to each image stack. Columns provide information about each stack including: figure panels that each image stack contributed to, image stack title, DOI for each stack (link provides metadata for each stack and file download link), image stack file name, genotype of imaged fly, and information about image stack. References to this file have been made at different locations throughout the text and Figure legends. We also added a section on the BIL data in the Materials and methods entitled “Light microscopy image stack storage and availability”.
