In the first stage, before birth in primates and before eye opening in altricial mammals, spontaneous activity generated by the retina and cortex shapes visual brain circuits in an activity-dependent but experience-independent manner. In the second stage, visual activity generated by sensory experience refines receptive fields. Here, we investigated the consequences of altering this sequence of events by prematurely opening one or both eyes of ferrets and examining visual receptive fields in monocular cortex after the closure of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. We observed that many cells in animals with prematurely opened eyes exhibited low-pass temporal frequency tuning and increased temporal frequency bandwidths, and these cells showed slightly increased orientation and direction selectivity index values. Spontaneous activity was greatly elevated in both hemispheres following the premature opening of one or both eyes, suggesting a global change in circuit excitability that was not restricted to cells that viewed the world through the prematurely opened eye. No major changes were noted in spatial frequency tuning. These results suggest that premature visual experience alters circuit excitability and visual receptive fields, in particular with respect to temporal processing. We speculate that closed lids in altricial mammals serve to prevent visual experience until circuits are initially established and are ready to be refined by visual experience.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The developing brain requires the right experiences at the right time to form proper connections. For most mammals, vision develops in two main stages. Before birth in humans – or before eye opening in animals born with closed eyes – spontaneous activity within the brain helps establish an initial visual circuitry without external visual input. These initial connections are then fine-tuned after birth or eye opening.</p><p>This sequential development is critical for normal visual function. Moreover, the visual system processes different aspects of vision (like motion, direction and detail) through specialized neural pathways, and proper development of these pathways also requires the right sequence of experiences.</p><p>In humans, babies born prematurely receive visual stimulation during what would typically be a pre-visual period, potentially disrupting this sequence. To find out what happens when visual experience occurs too early Griswold and Van Hooser studied the developing visual system in ferrets by artificially opening one or both eyes before they would naturally open and recording how neurons of the visual system responded to moving stimuli.</p><p>The results showed that ferrets with prematurely opened eyes developed significant abnormalities in their visual processing, particularly in how neurons respond to moving stimuli. Using electrophysiological recordings in the primary visual cortex, Griswold and Van Hooser observed that neurons in the ferrets showed unusually broad responses to different speeds of motion and increased activity at slow speeds. These neurons also showed higher spontaneous activity levels and increased suppression of activity in response to certain stimuli, such as quickly moving grating stimuli. These changes in firing rates and suppression occurred even in a part of the visual cortex that was ipsilateral (on the same side) to the early-opened eye, a location that does not receive direct input from the early-opened eye, suggesting that premature vision causes widespread alterations in brain circuit development. Other aspects of vision, like the ability to detect detail, were less affected.</p><p>These findings suggest that the timing of visual experiences is critical for healthy development and may help explain why human infants born very prematurely often have difficulty with motion perception, even without brain injuries. Understanding these neural differences could guide the development of targeted visual therapies for premature infants. Further research could determine if specific types of visual stimulation (or a lack of stimulation) might be protective during this sensitive period.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ferret</kwd><kwd>mustela putorious furo</kwd><kwd>motion perception</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Hooser</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Introducing premature visual experience by opening the closed eyelids early in ferrets caused many cells in the primary visual cortex to mature improperly.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proper development of visual cortical circuits depends on both experience-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wong, 1999</xref>) and experience-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hensch and Quinlan, 2018</xref>) processes. Classically, these mechanisms have been divided into two sequential stages: an early stage, before the onset of visual experience, in which molecular cues and spontaneous activity in retina and cortex guide initial circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Katz and Shatz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grubb et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2018</xref>), followed by a period in which activity driven by visual experience refines circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chapman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2020</xref>). The sequential nature of these two phases presumably ensures a developmental trajectory in which circuits achieve a state of maturation that provides proper support for the onset of experience-driven mechanisms that finalize the construction process.</p><p>Given the sequential nature of visual development, it is interesting to ask if there are any positive or negative consequences of violating this sequence by introducing patterned visual stimulation at earlier time points. Are there significant changes that cannot be reversed even with subsequent visual experience? These questions are especially important to address in light of the rising population of human infants born very prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Crump et al., 2019</xref>), who receive visual stimulation during what is typically a presensory period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colonnese et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Murata and Colonnese, 2016</xref>).</p><p>To address these questions, we have examined the impact of premature visual experience on receptive fields in visual cortex of the ferret. Ferrets undergo a long postnatal developmental period and have a history of foundational developmental studies in vision. Ferrets are born with their eyes closed – a condition that is maintained for 30–35 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Issa et al., 1999</xref>) – making it possible to introduce inappropriately early visual experience by opening the lids with forceps, without introducing factors related to immature birth. We opened zero, one, or both eyes early and evaluated receptive fields in primary visual cortex electrophysiologically after the closure of the critical periods for direction selectivity and ocular dominance. We studied monocular receptive fields only, so that we could be sure of the developmental condition of the eye, necessarily the contralateral eye, that was driving the receptive field properties we observed.</p><p>We observed substantial changes in temporal frequency tuning in monocular cells that observed the world through an early-opened eye. These cells, on average, exhibited strikingly broad tuning for temporal frequency with markedly enhanced responses at low temporal frequencies. These major alterations in visual selectivity were not present in all receptive field properties, as orientation and direction tuning in these cells were only slightly altered. By contrast, we observed substantial changes in spontaneous firing rates in both hemispheres after either or both eyes were opened early, suggesting that premature vision has a more global impact on the establishment of a firing rate set point in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turrigiano and Nelson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hengen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In all, these results suggest that premature visual experience causes lasting changes in temporal processing and in the baseline tone of cortical circuits. The changes in temporal frequency tuning are likely to have an impact on motion perception. To perceive a moving object, an animal must have knowledge of the object’s direction and speed. The ratio of the temporal frequency of a stimulus to its spatial frequency is its speed, so temporal frequency tuning provides critical information about stimulus speed. Human babies that are born very prematurely are a heterogeneous group with a wide variety of visual deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kozeis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dutton, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sakki et al., 2018</xref>), but even when one excludes cases of known brain or retinal damage, very premature babies exhibit increased thresholds for motion perception later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). Our results in ferrets raise the possibility that inappropriately early visual experience could be an important factor that contributes to lasting motion processing deficits in humans born very prematurely.</p><p>Part of this work appeared as the PhD thesis of SVG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Griswold, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our primary goal was to explore the influence of premature vision on the parameters of receptive fields in V1. We reared ferrets under three conditions in order to examine the impact of premature vision through one or both eyes in comparison with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>): in one group, we opened one eye early; in a second group, we opened both eyes early; and a third, control group was allowed to open their eyes naturally. Animals in both of the premature eye opening groups experienced early vision beginning on postnatal day 25, a developmental timepoint when retinal waves are still occurring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meister et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wong et al., 1993</xref>), yet V1 is also responsive to visual input through the closed lids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krug et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerman et al., 2002</xref>). This ensured interaction between spontaneous, endogenously generated activity and patterned visual input. We hypothesized that this interaction may drive aberrant development of cortical receptive fields, as it is known that visual input is capable of initiating retinal waves through the closed lids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tiriac et al., 2018</xref>). Following premature eye opening, animals were brought to the lab for 2 hr a day of unguided visual exposure over 4 days, for a total of 8 hr of visual exposure. Visual exposure consisted of gentle handling to prevent the young kits from sleeping, thus ensuring a sufficient amount of visual experience through the prematurely opened eye(s). Animals received no other intervention between the end of visual stimulus training on P28 and terminal electrophysiology experiments which occurred between P55-68.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recording schematics, experimental timeline, and electrode track reconstructions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recording schematics: EO1contra cells were those recorded in monocular cortex contralateral to a single prematurely opened eye.

Animals that experienced premature vision had one eye or both eyes opened on P25. All animals experienced a period outside of the nest in the form of daily 2 hr handling sessions beginning on P25 and ending on P28, allowing unguided viewing of the laboratory environment through prematurely opened eyes or low resolution experience through closed lids. Electrophysiological recording took place between P55-68, at a time when the critical period for ocular dominance was closing or closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Issa et al., 1999</xref>).

Thus, if premature vision causes permanent changes to receptive field properties, we ought to be able to see them at P55-68.</p><p>We recorded responses to long batteries of visual stimulation with sinusoidal gratings where multiple parameters were co-varied in order to assess a wide variety of possible receptive field differences between control animals and animals that had their eyes opened prematurely. In this study, all recordings were performed in the monocular visual cortex in order to simplify the interpretation of these changes without needing to consider interactions between the two eyes. We labeled cells as EO1contra (monocular neurons contralateral to a single early-opened eye), EO1ipsi (monocular neurons ipsilateral to a single early-opened eye), EO2 (monocular neurons contralateral to an early opened eye where both eyes were opened early), and control (monocular neurons in control animals). EO1 contra and EO2 cells observed the world through early-opened eyes, while EO1ipsi neurons observed the world through eyes that opened on time but were ipsilateral to early-opened eyes.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Orientation and direction tuning index values are slightly increased by premature experience</title><p>Cells in all animals exhibited some degree of orientation and direction selectivity. Orientation selectivity was assessed for stimuli that moved back and forth in two opposite directions at each cell’s preferred spatial frequency. Direction selectivity was assessed at the neuron’s optimal temporal frequency and a spatial frequency of 0.1. Example responses for each group are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>. Control animals exhibited a baseline average orientation index value (1-CV) of 0.42, and this value was not significantly elevated in EO1ipsi neurons (0.45, p&lt;0.54, Linear Mixed Effects Model). However, orientation selectivity was slightly elevated in EO1contra neurons (0.52, p&lt;0.024) and EO2 neurons (0.54, p&lt;0.016, LMEM). Direction selectivity as assessed by 1-DCV was slightly reduced in EO1ipsi neurons (0.24, p&lt;0.027, LMEM) as compared to control values (0.29), and 1-DCV values were not significantly different in EO1contra neurons (0.29, p&lt;0.296) or EO2 neurons (0.33, p&lt;0.169, LMEM). The overall distribution of direction preferences in 45° bins did not significantly differ across the groups (chi-square test, p=0.11), nor did the distribution of orientation angle preferences in 45° bins (chi-square test, 5.3x10–2).

Overall responses after dark-rearing are reduced, but temporal frequency tuning is only slightly narrowed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2006</xref>).

However, temporal frequency tuning of these animals has not been reported in detail. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pasternak et al., 1981</xref> reported that strobe-reared ferrets exhibited greater difficulty in distinguishing slow-moving stimuli from static stimuli compared to controls, an ability that slightly improved with practice, suggesting possible temporal frequency deficits. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kennedy and Orban, 1983</xref> report a reduction in high-pass velocity-tuned cells, but not an increase in low-pass cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Humphrey and Saul, 1998</xref> do not report temporal frequency tuning across their population, but their example cell does appear to be broadly tuned and low-pass. Temporal frequency tuning is not subject to rapid modification shortly after eye opening, as Ritter and colleagues demonstrated that providing ferrets that had just opened their eyes naturally with 6–9 hr of visual stimulation of a single temporal frequency did not elicit a shift in temporal frequency tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ritter et al., 2017</xref>). The same stimulation causes a dramatic increase in direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ritter et al., 2017</xref>) that normally develops in the first week to 10 days after eye opening and requires visual experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Van Hooser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roy et al., 2020b</xref>).

They may move the young from one nest to another as they grow, but otherwise, the young are primarily in the relatively dark nest. It is highly likely that some light penetrates and that information about the 24 hr cycle is available, but the light is likely to be dim and unlikely to provide a basis for high luminance, high contrast stimulation through the closed lids. The animals begin to spend substantial time outside the nest after eye opening.</p><p>The ferret is a domesticated strain of the European polecat. In laboratory settings, ferret jills give birth and keep their kits in a nest box. A laboratory typically maintains a 24 hr cycle with 12 or 14 hr of light, and the light reaching the closed lids must first pass through the cage, the nest box, and the nesting material. Therefore, developing ferrets have an obvious circadian light signal, but the light available for image formation is likely dim and of low contrast.</p><p>Although the light that reaches the close lids in developing ferrets is likely to be relatively dim, and any image-forming signal passing through the closed lids would be highly filtered in luminance, spatial frequency, and contrast, it is important to remember that visual input before natural eye opening (through the closed lids) can drive activity in retina, LGN, and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huttenlocher, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman and Stryker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krug et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akerman et al., 2004</xref>).

The low-resolution visual input before natural eye opening is capable of driving activity in the visual circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huttenlocher, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chapman and Stryker, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krug et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akerman et al., 2004</xref>), and evidence shows that this early form of low-resolution visual experience plays a role in the development of ON-OFF segregation in dLGN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerman et al., 2002</xref>) and the initiation of retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tiriac et al., 2018</xref>). Propagation of high luminance, high contrast, and high spatial frequency input through the developing retina may alter or disrupt the typical retinal wave formation and propagation, and thus may have deleterious effects on developmental processes driven by endogenous activity. Alternatively, high-contrast signals may not interrupt retinal waves but may contribute independent activity that, through experience-dependent plasticity mechanisms, produces the alterations in receptive field properties that we observed.</p><p>Several other basic mechanistic questions remain unanswered. It is unclear where in the visual circuit cascade these deficits first arise. Does the lateral geniculate nucleus or retina exhibit altered temporal frequency tuning? Is the influence of the patterned visual stimulation instructive, so that if one provided premature stimulation with only certain temporal frequencies, one would see selectivity for those temporal frequencies, or would tuning always be broad? Other questions remain concerning the top-down influence on V1 from ‘higher’ motion areas such as MT (monkeys) or PSS (ferret); MT exhibits mature neural markers earlier than V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bourne and Rosa, 2006</xref>), and suppression of PSS impacts motion selectivity in V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lempel and Nielsen, 2021</xref>). Finally, our recordings were performed in monocular cortex so that we could be sure of the developmental condition of the eye that drove the classic responses. It is interesting to speculate about what might occur more centrally in binocular visual cortex. Ocular dominance shifts are not induced when one eye is opened prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Issa et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that ocular dominance plasticity is not engaged at this early stage, but one might imagine that the impacts on temporal frequency and spontaneous firing rates would still be present. Future studies will be needed to address these questions.</p><p>We introduced premature patterned vision at a time when cortical inhibition is undergoing substantial changes. GABAergic signaling has already undergone its switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>) from providing primarily depolarizing input to hyperpolarizing input by P21-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mulholland et al., 2021</xref>). In the days prior to eye opening, inhibitory cells exhibit activity that is closely associated with the emerging functional modules that will reflect orientation columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mulholland et al., 2021</xref>), but do not yet exhibit selectivity to orientation, in contrast to excitatory neurons, which do exhibit selectivity to orientation at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang and Fitzpatrick, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The broad tuning in temporal frequency and elevated spontaneous firing rates that we observed could reflect a deficit in cortical inhibition in animals that experienced premature vision. Yet selectivity was not entirely destroyed, as neurons still exhibited selectivity for orientation and direction. Selectivity can be achieved with a combination of amplification of appropriate excitatory signals and inhibitory suppression that is either selective or broad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ben et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rubin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Somers et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hatta et al., 1998</xref>), so it is unclear how the circuit has changed.

Work in ferrets and rats suggests a role for retinal waves in the development of interhemispheric connectivity; bilateral enucleation of ferrets induces anomalies in the distribution of callosal cells in primary visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bock et al., 2012</xref>), and results in callosal projections connecting topographically mismatched loci in VC in P4-6 rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olavarria and Hiroi, 2003</xref>). Further, retinal waves demonstrate coordinated activity between both hemispheres in mice and ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weliky and Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>). Recent findings describe a transient retina to retina connection in mice and ferret, which exists during the period of retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murcia-Belmonte et al., 2019</xref>). This connection provides a plausible mechanism for the theorized inter-retinal coordination of waves thought to be necessary to drive development of bilateral topographic maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams and Horton, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Murcia-Belmonte et al., 2019</xref>). Given that light is capable of initiating retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tiriac et al., 2018</xref>), it is feasible that exposure to light through a single, prematurely opened eye would initiate retinal waves capable of propagating to the closed eye. Given the qualitative differences between vision through a closed lid vs open eye, initiation and propagation of retinal waves would be both asymmetric and mutually influential between retinas, potentially accounting for the differences in RFs observed between EO1ipsi and control hemispheres.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Comparison with prior studies</title><p>There have been only a few animal studies that have sought to introduce inappropriately early vision.

Our data are consistent with the idea that inappropriately early visual stimulation contributes to deficits in motion processing. A moving object has both a speed and direction, and temporal frequency is critical to determine an object’s speed.

By altering premature patterned vision, it may be possible to uncover the plasticity rules that are at play in the developing mammalian visual system before the natural onset of vision.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biological sample (Ferret)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Ferret</td><td align="left" valign="top">Marshall Bio-Resources</td><td align="left" valign="top">Mustelo putorius furo</td><td align="left" valign="top">Female ferrets used</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="top">Rabbit anti-NeuN, Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated</td><td align="left" valign="top">Millipore</td><td align="left" valign="top">Cat# ABN78A4</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dilution: 1:300</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Ketamine</td><td align="left" valign="top">Patterson Veterinary</td><td align="left" valign="top">07-890-8598</td><td align="left" valign="top">20 mg kg⁻¹ im</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Isoflurane Covetrus</td><td align="left" valign="top">Covetrus</td><td align="left" valign="top">029405</td><td align="left" valign="top">1.5–3% in N₂O/O₂ mixture for surgery</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Isoflurane Covetrus</td><td align="left" valign="top">Covetrus</td><td align="left" valign="top">061843</td><td align="left" valign="top">Infused into wound margins</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dexamethasone</td><td align="left" valign="top">Patterson Veterinary</td><td align="left" valign="top">07-808-8194</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.5 mg kg⁻¹ im</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Atropine</td><td align="left" valign="top">Patterson Veterinary</td><td align="left" valign="top">07-869-6061</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.16–0.8 mg kg⁻¹ im</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Gallamine triethiodide</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">G8134-25G</td><td align="left" valign="top">10–30 mg kg⁻¹ h⁻¹</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sodium pentobarbital (Euthasol)</td><td align="left" valign="top">Patterson Veterinary</td><td align="left" valign="top">07-805-9296</td><td align="left" valign="top">200 mg/kg, IP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">DiI</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">42364–100 MG</td><td align="left" valign="top">Used for electrode track reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">DiCarlo et al., 1996</xref>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Paraformaldehyde</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">P6148-1KG</td><td align="left" valign="top">4% in 0.1 M PBS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Triton-X 100</td><td align="left" valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="top">9002-93-1</td><td align="left" valign="top">0.3% in PBS</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="top">Fluoromount-G</td><td align="left" valign="top">Southern Biotech</td><td align="left" valign="top">0100–20</td><td align="left" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="top">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="top">Used for stimulus creation and data analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="top">Psychophysics Toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brainard, 1997</xref>;

Litters of 4 or more kits arrived with a jill between postnatal days (P) 12–21. Animals were housed in a room with timed lights (12 hr on, 12 hr off) in a custom stainless-steel cage (60 cm × 60 cm×35 cm) with a hammock and small toys. For the entire study, a total of 27 female ferrets were used and all experimental procedures were carried out between postnatal days P55–68. Female ferrets were used because housing mature male ferrets in the same room with mature female ferrets causes stress to the female ferrets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Facilitating premature visual experience</title><p>We divided animals into three experimental groups. The first group of animals had one of their eyes gently opened with forceps at P25, while the other eye was left closed to open naturally, and time of natural eye opening was noted. We used the label early Eye Opening One Contralateral (henceforth EO1contra) to indicate neurons in the monocular visual cortex that viewed the world through the (contralateral) eye that was opened early, and early Eye Opening 1 Ipsilateral (henceforth EO1ipsi) to indicate neurons in the monocular visual cortex that viewed the world through the eye that opened on time. In the second group of animals, both eyes were opened at P25, and neurons from the monocular visual cortex that viewed the world through either of these eyes were labeled early Eye Opening 2 (henceforth EO2). Finally, the third group of animals was two eye controls and was allowed to open both eyes normally, with the time of natural eye opening noted. Ferrets frequently open one eye up to a day before the other, and any disparity in the time of opening between the eyes was noted. Ferret kits in laboratory housing receive limited visual stimulation through their closed lids, as the mother actively keeps the kits in their relatively dark nest. In order to ensure that animals with early-opened eyes actually had patterned visual experience (and animals with closed lids had the same stimulation filtered through the lids), animals were brought to the lab for 2 hr a day for 4 consecutive days beginning at P25. These ferret kits were placed in a rat cage atop a heating pad and gently manipulated to maintain wakefulness during this natural, unguided viewing. We studied 17 animals that had one eye prematurely opened, 4 animals that had both eyes opened, and 11 controls.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Surgical preparation for terminal physiology experiments P55-68</title><p>The ferret was sedated with ketamine (20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> im). Atropine (0.16–0.8 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> im) and dexamethasone (0.5 mg kg−1 im) were administered to reduce bronchial and salivary secretion and to reduce inflammation, respectively. The animal was next anesthetized with a mixture of isoflurane, oxygen, and nitrous oxide through a mask, and a tracheostomy was performed. The animal was then ventilated with 1.5–3% isoflurane in a 2:1 mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen. A cannula was inserted into the intraperitoneal (ip) cavity for delivery of neuromuscular blockers and Ringer solution (3 ml kg<sup>−1</sup> hr<sup>−1</sup>), and the animal was inserted in a custom stereotaxic frame that did not obstruct vision. All wound margins were infused with bupivacaine. A suture was made in the scalp and the skin resected over the posterior half of the skull. A small opening in the cranium was drilled over V1 with a dental drill (Medidenta). The dura covering the brain at the craniotomy site was removed over a 1 mm × 1 mm area to allow for electrode placement. Craniotomies were made over V1 of each hemisphere. The eyelids were sutured open, and contact lenses were placed on the eyes to prevent corneal damage. Before visual stimulation commenced, the ferret was paralyzed with the neuromuscular blocker gallamine triethiodide (10–30 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> hr<sup>−1</sup>) through the ip cannula to suppress spontaneous eye movements, and the nitrous oxide : oxygen mixture was adjusted to 1:1. The animal’s ECG was continuously monitored to ensure adequate anesthesia, and the percentage of isoflurane was increased if the ECG indicated any distress. Body temperature was maintained at 37°C. At the conclusion of the experiment, the animal was killed with an overdose of sodium pentobarbitol (200 mg/kg, IP) and transcardially perfused to retrieve the brain for histology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>32 channel electrodes (Plexon S probes, 50 um inter-tetrode spacing; 50 µm intra-tetrode spacing) were used for all recordings. The signal was amplified using the RHD2000 amplifying/digitizing chip and USB interface board (Intan Technologies). Stimulus timing information was acquired using a Micro1401 acquisition board and Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Spike sorting was performed offline using JRClust running in Matlab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jun et al., 2017</xref>). An electrode was inserted into the brain using a Sutter Instruments MP-285 manipulator. To reduce sampling bias, we recorded from any site that had a signal-to-noise ratio sufficient for isolation and had a response that appeared to be modulated by the presentation of drifting gratings. Data are reported from all units that are responsive enough to be included in analysis (see below). After finishing the recording at one site, the electrode was lowered at least 640 microns before attempting to identify a suitable subsequent recording site. The experiment was concluded when successful recordings were made from one or both hemispheres.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Locating monocular neurons</title><p>After placing the electrode at a minimum depth of 200 μm in the brain, entering the brain at an angle of 30–45 degrees, the search for monocular neurons commenced. The electrode was driven into the brain until monocular neurons were discovered. A population of neurons was deemed monocular if their receptive fields were in the periphery of the eye contralateral to the recording hemisphere. Monocularity was ensured by determining whether movement in the central visual and ipsilateral visual fields evoked a response; any such responses indicated binocularity. If no purely monocular cells were found in a given penetration, the electrode was removed and another penetration was made elsewhere in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Locating the optic disk</title><p>An indirect ophthalmoscope (Heine Omega 600) and handheld 78 or 90D lens (Volk) were used to locate the optic disk and determine the orientation of the eye. This was necessary as the orientation of the eye is necessary for determining the true eccentricity of receptive fields. When one investigator had the optic disk in the center of view of the indirect ophthalmoscope, another investigator introduced a wooden rod into the line of sight and moved it until the end of the rod was centered on the image of the optic disk (also the center of view). The position of the end of the rod was then measured in X, Y, and Z relative to the animal’s eye to make the optic disk direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Visual stimuli</title><p>Visual stimuli were created in MATLAB (MathWorks) using the Psychophysics Toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brainard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pelli, 1997</xref>) and displayed on a 21-inch flat face CRT monitor (GDM-520, Sony) with a resolution of 800×600 and a refresh rate of 100 Hz. We manually mapped receptive fields by displaying circular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings at different positions and moving the monitor to accommodate different eccentricities while listening to the responses on a loudspeaker.</p><p>Drifting grating stimuli were full-field, drifting sinusoidal gratings (4 s duration; 3.5 s interstimulus interval) presented pseudorandomly, with direction of motion (in steps of 45°) in either of the two directions orthogonal to the axis of orientation. Each individual grating stimulus was full screen and had a single set of parameters (direction, spatial frequency, temporal frequency) and was separated from the other stimuli by a gray screen interstimulus interval. We ran two sets of stimuli where multiple grating parameters were covaried in order to sample a wide variety of receptive field properties in our multi-neuron recordings. In the first set, orientation (angles 0°/horizontal, 45°, 90°/vertical, 135°) was co-varied with 8 different spatial frequencies (0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.24, 0.32, 0.64, 0.90, and 1.25), and 6 different contrasts (0.04, 0.08, 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, and 1), while temporal frequency was held constant at 4 Hz. In this first set of stimuli, gratings drifted back and forth every 4 cycles; for example, horizontal stimuli drifted upward and then downward. In a second set of stimuli, direction (0°/up, 45°, 90°/right, 135°, 180°/down, 225°, 270°/left, 315°) was co-varied with stimuli of 7 different temporal frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 Hz) at 100% contrast and a fixed spatial frequency of 0.1 cycles/° visual angle. In this second set of stimuli, gratings drifted in a single direction and did not move back and forth. Each stimulus set had a blank, control stimulus that was the same duration as the other stimuli where the screen did not change. The first set of stimuli was repeated five times, and the second set seven times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Responses were determined by examining either the mean response during the entire stimulus or by taking the F1 component of the response. The same analysis (mean, or F1 at the temporal frequency of the stimulus of interest) was performed for the closest blank (control) stimulus and the response to the control stimulus was subtracted to yield the stimulus-driven response. For each tuning curve for orientation, direction, and spatial frequency analyses, we examined whether the mean or the F1 response was higher, and used those responses for analysis and fits. For temporal frequency analysis, we only used mean responses because we found a profound response suppression in many cells. Inclusion/exclusion: For each stimulus type, we examined the set of all responses to visual stimuli and blanks with an ANOVA test to evaluate the null hypothesis that the mean response to all of these stimuli was the same; cells with a p&lt;0.05 to this visual responsiveness test were included in fits and analyses, and cells with p&gt;0.05 were excluded.</p><p>Orientation selectivity was examined in the first set of stimuli at the preferred spatial frequency for each cell.

This was followed by placement in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C until sectioning. The brain was sectioned sagittally into 100 μm sections using a sliding microtome (Leica SM2010R). We washed sections in 0.1 M PBS 3×5 min and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton-X 100 diluted in PBS for 2 hr at room temperature on a shaker. Then slices were incubated in fluorophore-conjugated anti-NeuN antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 Rabbit anti NeuN, Millipore ABN78A4) at a 1:300 dilution overnight (&gt;12 hr) at room temperature on a shaker. Sections were then washed 3×5 min in PBS and mounted on slides and allowed to air dry. Slides were then cover-slipped with Fluoromount-G media (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) and edges were sealed using nail polish. Histological sections were viewed using a fluorescent microscope (Keyence BX-Z 710) and electrode tracks were reconstructed using DiI dye traces.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

The laboratory has long experience in quantitative studies of visual response properties across development and this study reflects their expertise.</p><p>The investigators find little or no difference in mean orientation and direction selectivity, or in spatial frequency tuning, as a result of early eye opening but marked differences in temporal frequency tuning. These changes are especially interesting as they relate to deficits seen in prematurely delivered children. Temporal frequency bandwidth for responses evoked from early-opened contralateral eyes were broader than for controls; this is the case for animals in which either one or both eyes were opened prematurely. Further, when only one eye was opened early, responses to low temporal frequencies were relatively stronger.</p><p>The investigators also found changes in firing rate and sign of response to visual stimuli. Premature eye-opening increased spontaneous rates in all test configurations. When only one eye was opened early, firing rates recorded from the ipsilateral cortex were strongly suppressed, with more modest effects in other test cases.</p><p>As the authors' discussion notes, these observations are just a starting point for studies underlying mechanism. The experiments are so difficult to perform and so carefully described that the results will be foundational for future studies of how premature birth influences cortical development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106513.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this paper, Griswold and Van Hooser investigate what happens if animals are exposed to patterned visual experience too early, before its natural onset. To this end, they make use of the benefits of the ferret as a well-established animal model for visual development. Ferrets naturally open their eyes around postnatal day 30; here, Griswold and Van Hooser opened either one or both eyes prematurely. Subsequent recordings in the mature primary visual cortex show that while some tuning properties like orientation and direction selectivity developed normally, the premature visual exposure triggered changes in temporal frequency tuning and overall firing rates. These changes were widespread, in that they occurred even for neurons responding to the eye that was not opened prematurely. These results demonstrate that the nature of the visual input well before eye opening can have profound consequences on the developing visual system.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by the data, but in the initially submitted version of the paper, there were a few questions regarding the data processing and suggestions for the discussion:</p><p>(1) The assessment of the tuning properties is based on fits to the data. Presumably, neurons for which the fits were poor were excluded? It would be useful to know what the criteria were, how many neurons were excluded, and whether there was a significant difference between the groups in the numbers of neurons excluded (which could further point to differences between the groups).</p><p>(2) For the temporal frequency data, low- and high-frequency cut-offs are defined, but then only used for the computation of the bandwidth. Given that the responses to low temporal frequencies change profoundly with premature eye opening, it would be useful to directly compare the low- and high-frequency cut-offs between groups, in addition to the index that is currently used.</p><p>(3) In addition to the tuning functions and firing rates that have been analyzed so far, are there any differences in the temporal profiles of neural responses between the groups (sustained versus transient responses, rates of adaptation, latency)? If the temporal dynamics of the responses are altered significantly, that could be part of an explanation for the altered temporal tuning.</p><p>(4) It would be beneficial for the general interpretation of the results to extend the discussion. First, it would be useful to provide a more detailed discussion of what type of visual information might make it through the closed eyelids (the natural state), in contrast to the structured information available through open eyes. Second, it would be useful to highlight more clearly that these data were collected in peripheral V1 by discussing what might be expected in binocular, more central V1 regions. Third, it would be interesting to discuss the observed changes in firing rates in the context of the development of inhibitory neurons in V1 (which still undergo significant changes through the time period of premature visual experience chosen here).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.106513.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Griswold</surname><given-names>Sophie V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Brandeis University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Waltham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Van Hooser</surname><given-names>Stephen D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Brandeis University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Waltham</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) Figure 1: It might be simpler to streamline acronyms for different test cases, e.g, E01contra, E01 ipsi (rather than EO1IPS), E02, and control.

Unfortunately, with drifting gratings, it is difficult to establish these properties, which could be better assessed with standing or square-wave-modulated gratings or other stimuli.

First, it would be useful to provide a more detailed discussion of what type of visual information might make it through the closed eyelids (the natural state), in contrast to the structured information available through open eyes. Second, it would be useful to highlight more clearly that these data were collected in peripheral V1 by discussing what might be expected in binocular, more central V1 regions. Third, it would be interesting to discuss the observed changes in firing rates in the context of the development of inhibitory neurons in V1 (which still undergo significant changes through the time period of premature visual experience chosen here).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, good ideas. Let’s take these three suggestions in turn.</p><p>First, in the discussion, we added a subsection “ Biology of early development in mustelids ” that focuses on the developmental conditions of wild and laboratory animals:</p><p>In the wild, mustelids raise their young in nests in the ground, in cavities such as holes in trees or caves, or in areas of dense vegetation (Ruggiero et al. 1994). They may move the young from one nest to another as they grow, but otherwise the young are primarily in the relatively dark nest. It is highly likely that some light penetrates and that information about the 24-hour cycle is available, but the light is likely to be dim and unlikely to provide a basis for high luminance, high contrast stimulation through the closed lids. The animals begin to spend substantial time outside the nest after eye opening.</p><p>The ferret is a domesticated strain of the European polecat. In laboratory settings, ferret jills give birth and keep their kits in a nest box. A laboratory typically maintains a 24-hour cycle with 12 or 14 hours of light, and the light reaching the closed lids must first pass through the cage, the nest box, and the nesting material. Therefore, developing ferrets have an obvious circadian light signal but the light available for image formation is likely dim and of low contrast.</p><p>Although the light that reaches the close lids in developing ferrets is likely to be relatively dim, and any image-forming signal passing through the closed lids would be highly filtered in luminance, spatial frequency, and contrast, it is important to remember that visual input before natural eye opening (through the closed lids) can drive activity in retina, LGN, and cortex (Huttenlocher 1967, Chapman and Stryker 1993, Krug et al., 2001, Akerman et al., 2002,Akerman et al., 2004). Further, orientation selectivity can be observed through the closed lids (Krug et al., 2001), indicating that some coarse image-forming information does make it through the closed lids.</p><p>Second, we added text speculating about binocular cortex (lines 492 - 500): … our recordings were performed in monocular cortex so that we could be sure of the developmental condition of the eye that drove the classic responses. It is interesting to speculate about what might occur more centrally in binocular visual cortex. Ocular dominance shifts are not induced when one eye is opened prematurely (Issa et al 1999), indicating that ocular dominance plasticity is not engaged at this early stage, but one might imagine that the impacts on temporal frequency and spontaneous firing rates would still be present.</p><p>Third, on inhibition, we added a paragraph (lines 502 - 509):</p><p>We introduced premature patterned vision at a time when cortical inhibition is undergoing substantial changes. GABAergic signaling has already undergone its switch (Ben-Ari, 2002) from providing primarily depolarizing input to hyperpolarizing input by P21-23 (Mulholland et al., 2021). In the days prior to eye opening, inhibitory cells exhibit activity that is closely associated with the emerging functional modules that will reflect orientation columns (Mulholland et al., 2021), but do not yet exhibit selectivity to orientation, in contrast to excitatory neurons, which do exhibit selectivity to orientation at that time (Chang and Fitzpatrick, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In the methods section, the statement 'actively kept in nesting box' is unclear. Presumably this means that the jill prevents the kits from leaving the nesting box? It also would be worth at least mentioning in this context that there obviously are still visual events in the nesting box too.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We improved this description (lines 118 - 121): Ferret kits in laboratory housing receive limited visual stimulation through their closed lids, as the mother actively keeps the kits in their relatively dark nest . In order to ensure that animals with early-opened eyes actually had patterned visual experience (and animals with closed lids had the same stimulation filtered through the lids) , animals were brought to the lab for 2 hours a day for 4 consecutive days beginning at P25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The stimulus presentation could be more clearly described. Is every stimulus presented in an individual trial (surrounded by periods with a blank screen), or are all stimuli shown as a continuous sequence? The description of the parameter screening is also potentially confusing ('orientation was co-varied with stimuli consisting of drifting gratings at different spatial frequencies' sounds as if there are separate stimuli for orientation; might be better to say something like 'in the first set, orientation, spatial frequency, ... were covaried...')</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thank you, we fixed this (lines 184 - 201). We deleted the text indicated and added a sentence “Each individual grating stimulus was full screen and had a single set of parameters (direction, spatial frequency, temporal frequency), and was separated from the other stimuli by a gray screen interstimulus interval.”. We also deleted a repetition of 100% contrast in the description of the second set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Description of low-pass index is unclear. What is the 'largest temporal frequency response observed'? The maximum response or the response to the largest temporal frequency tested?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks. We added a paragraph at line 236:</p><p>We defined a low-pass index as the response to the lowest temporal frequency tested (in this case 0.5 Hz) to the maximum response obtained to the set of temporal frequencies shown. LPI = R(TF=0.5 Hz)/max(R(TF=0.5Hz), R(TF=1Hz), … R(TF=32Hz)). If a cell exhibited the highest firing for a temporal frequency of 0.5 Hz, then it would have an low-pass index of 1. If it exhibited a similar firing rate in response to a temporal frequency of 0.5 Hz even if the preferred temporal frequency were higher, then the low-pass index would still be near 1. If the cell responded poorly at a temporal frequency of 0.5 Hz, then it would have a low-pass index near 0.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) The discussion should also cite the results of strobe-reared cats by Pasternak et al (1981 and 1985).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the omission. We now write (lines 430-435): Cats raised in a strobe-light environment (mostly after eye opening) exhibited strong changes in subsequent direction selectivity (Kennedy and Orban 1983; Humphrey and Saul 1998) and behavioral sensitivity to motion (Pasternak et al., 1981; Pasternak et al., 1985) that partially recovers with motion detection training . However, temporal frequency tuning of these animals has not been reported in detail. Pasternak et al (1981) reported that strobe-reared ferrets exhibited greater difficulty in distinguishing slow moving stimuli from static stimuli compared to controls, an ability that slightly improved with practice, suggesting possible temporal frequency deficits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Finally, it would be useful to include a mention of the early development of MT in marmosets in the discussion of impacts of prematurity on motion vision (Bourne &amp; Rosa 2006).</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, thank you. We cited Bourne &amp; Rosa and also Lempel and Nielsen (for ferret PSS). (Lines 492-501):</p><p>Several other basic mechanistic questions remain unanswered. It is unclear where in the visual circuit cascade these deficits first arise. Does the lateral geniculate nucleus or retina exhibit altered temporal frequency tuning? Is the influence of the patterned visual stimulation instructive, so that if one provided premature stimulation with only certain temporal frequencies, one would see selectivity for those temporal frequencies, or would tuning always be broad? Other questions remain concerning the top-down influence on V1 from “higher” motion areas such as MT (monkeys) or PSS (ferret); MT exhibits mature neural markers earlier than V1 (Bourne and Rosa, 2006), and suppression of PSS impacts motion selectivity in V1 (Lempel and Nielsen, 2021). Future studies will be needed to address these questions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
