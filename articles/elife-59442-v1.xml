roles in tumor progression and metastasis. However, the contribution of ECM proteins to early metastatic onset in the peritoneal cavity remains unexplored. Here, we suggest a new route of metastasis through the interaction of integrin alpha 2 (ITGA2) with collagens enriched in the tumor coinciding with poor outcome in patients with ovarian cancer. Using multiple gene-edited cell lines and patient-derived samples, we demonstrate that ITGA2 triggers cancer cell adhesion to collagen, promotes cell migration, anoikis resistance, mesothelial clearance, and peritoneal metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, phosphoproteomics identify an ITGA2-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway leading to enhanced oncogenic properties. Consequently, specific inhibition of ITGA2-mediated cancer cell-collagen interaction or targeting focal adhesion signaling may present an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of metastatic spread in ovarian cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>integrin alpah 2</kwd><kwd>Collagen</kwd><kwd>omentum</kwd><kwd>Peritoneal metastasis</kwd><kwd>Cell adhesion</kwd><kwd>focal adhesion kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sinergia 171037</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothen-Rutishauser</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Heinzelmann-Schwarz</surname><given-names>Viola</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008375</institution-id><institution>University of Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMM2051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Yen-Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FreeNovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FreeNovation 2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jacob</surname><given-names>Francis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of ITGA2-mediated cancer cell-collagen interaction or targeting focal adhesion kinase activity may present an opportunity for therapeutic intervention of metastatic spread in ovarian cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peritoneal metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and results in a 17–39% 5 year survival rate due to the majority of patients being diagnosed at advanced stage of disease (&gt;75%, FIGO stage III/IV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Halkia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vaughan et al., 2011</xref>). The accompanying development of massive ascites, a transudate predominantly seen in EOC, fosters the rapid spread of tumor cells through transcoelomic mechanisms in the peritoneal cavity including the omentum as a preferred site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Naora and Montell, 2005</xref>). Ascites-derived tumor cells (ATCs) contribute to an invasive and chemo-resistant cell population with high potential to form metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kipps et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawrenson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sodek et al., 2009</xref>). Emerging studies highlight the dynamic interplay between malignant, stromal and immune cells in the premetastatic niche promoting cancer cell adhesion, invasion, and progression leading to peritoneal metastasis. The peritoneal tumor microenvironment consists of mesothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenny et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>), adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieman et al., 2011</xref>) cancer-associated fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lau et al., 2017</xref>), macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Etzerodt et al., 2020</xref>), as well as non-cellular components such as growth factors and the extracellular matrix (ECM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilkes et al., 2014</xref>) which provide critical cues for sustained tumor growth and metastasis. Collagens are major components of the ECM and account for ~90% of the total ECM, not only providing structural integrity but also regulating diverse cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilkes et al., 2014</xref>). Dysregulation of collagens positively correlate with poor outcome in EOC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheon et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, altered collagen organization also influences tissue mechanics and compromises drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Loeffler et al., 2006</xref>) thus contributes to the poor response to chemotherapy in EOC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jazaeri et al., 2005</xref>). Despite solid evidence on the role of collagens in the already established tumor microenvironment, their contribution at the metastatic niche of early peritoneal dissemination remains largely unexplored.</p><p>Functional integrins act as heterodimeric cell-surface receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the ECM in tumor progression. Altered integrin expression not only supports oncogenic growth factor signaling, but also facilitates anoikis resistance of tumor cells in various malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). A subset of integrins, namely α1, α2, α10, and α11 exhibiting high collagen-binding affinity, are responsible for transducing biochemical or mechanical cues to regulate a variety of cellular functions such as cell proliferation, adhesion, migration, and hemostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorno-Cruz and Liu, 2019</xref>). Recent studies highlight the critical role of integrin α5 (ITGA5) in mediating cancer cell interaction to fibronectin during peritoneal metastasis through an c-Met/FAK/Src-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwanicki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenny et al., 2014</xref>). However, considering the high abundance and dysregulation of collagens in the tumor microenvironment, there is a need for understanding the molecular mechanism of how collagens and collagen-binding integrins regulate tumor progression and metastasis.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the collagen-binding integrin α2 (ITGA2) on EOC cells is required for direct and selective cell adhesion to various collagens which are enriched in the omentum. Using multiple cell lines and patient-derived samples, we provide functional evidence that ITGA2 promotes cancer cell adhesion, anoikis resistance, and tumor spheroid-mediated mesothelial clearance in vitro as well as peritoneal metastasis in vivo. (Phospho-)proteomics reveal that ITGA2-dependent signaling is transduced by phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Furthermore, functional blockade targeting ITGA2-collagen mediated cell adhesion or inhibiting downstream focal adhesion kinase activity provides the basis of the promising therapeutic potential for intervening with peritoneal metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Collagen-rich omentum is a metastatic niche for ITGA2-mediated cancer cell adhesion</title><p>To investigate the ECM composition of the omentum, representing the preferred metastatic site of EOC, we performed proteomic analysis of normal omentum from benign diseases and omental metastases from advanced EOC. We identified total 1298 proteins significantly upregulated in omental metastases including several ECM-related proteins dominant by collagens (e.g. COL1A1, COL3A1, and COL5A1), collagen-modifying hydroxylase (PLOD1 and PLOD2), and collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinase (MMP2 and MMP9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). Importantly, <italic>COL1A1, COL3A1,</italic> and <italic>COL5A1</italic> have been correlated with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilkes et al., 2014</xref>) and are predictors of overall survival for EOC patients as shown in the pooled hazard ratio model obtained from <italic>CuratedOvarianData</italic> (HR 1.16–1.20, n = 2970) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In line with a previous study showing that extensive collagen deposition is recognized as a pathological characteristic resulting in increasing tumor stiffness and promoting metastasis of EOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce et al., 2018</xref>). Although collagens have been widely accepted to elicit biochemical or biophysical signaling in tumor progression in the established tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), the interplay between collagens and tumor cells in the premetastatic niche remains unclear. Here, we identified that collagen-encoding genes share a similar mRNA expression profile among normal omentum, ovary and fallopian tube using the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset (n = 17,382) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In particular, type I collagen (encoded by <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic>) shows the highest collagen gene expression in normal ovary and omentum as well as in the omental metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). It is also noticed that the origins of high <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, and <italic>COL3A1</italic> expression positively correlate with fibroblast-specific markers (FAP) and smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), whereas <italic>COL4A1</italic>, <italic>COL4A2,</italic> and <italic>COL18A1</italic> seem to be predominantly expressed in ovarian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, this finding prompted us to investigate the role of collagen as a potential chemotactic matrix protein and to elucidate the interplay between collagen and associated receptors (integrins) in initial cancer cell adhesion to the omentum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Altered collagen expression predicts poor outcome in EOC patients coinciding with ITGA2 expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proteomic analysis identifies up- and downregulated ECM-associated proteins in omental metastasis <italic>versus</italic> normal omentum tissue (n = 8).

The ratio of cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial cells was significantly increased for 12 and 24 hr incubation (1.92- to 2.59-fold; WT/ Δ<italic>ITGA2</italic> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), supporting the role of ITGA2 in facilitating mesothelial cell adhesion. In addition to single cell-mediated adhesion, we also evaluated the invasiveness of cancer spheroids to mesothelial cells following the dynamics of mesothelial clearance. Constitutively EGFP-expressing mesothelial cells (MeT-5A) were cultured on different ECM components and allowed to form a confluent monolayer before co-culture with RFP-expressing ovarian cancer spheroids. Among the different types of ECM components, collagen markedly enhanced cancer spheroid invasion through the mesothelial monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) which further supports the premetastatic role of collagen in cancer cell dissemination. Furthermore, we evaluated cancer spheroid-mediated mesothelial clearance activity of different cell lines including WT, Δ<italic>ITGA2</italic> (n = 4), and ITGA2-OE cells (n = 4). The mesothelial clearance ratio of Δ<italic>ITGA2</italic> spheroids was significantly reduced compared to WT cells in IGROV1, OAW42, and ES2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C-D</xref>) and <italic>vice versa</italic> markedly increased in ITGA2-OE spheroids in SKOV3ip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, ITGA2-OE marginally promoted mesothelial clearance in BG1, OVCAR4, and A2780 cells.

The phosphorylation of AKT<sup>S124</sup> and AKT<sup>S129</sup> are also significantly reduced in the <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Both phosphorylation sites are reported in enhancing catalytic activity of AKT and promotes cell survival, suggesting a crosstalk between AKT and ITGA2-dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Maira et al., 2005</xref>). The phosphorylation of the proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase p-Src<sup>Y419</sup> as well as FAK at site Y397, Y577, S722, and S843 were also significantly downregulated in <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The oncogenic role for FAK has been shown to sustain tumor spheroid proliferation and chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Diaz Osterman et al., 2019</xref>). FAK<sup>Y397</sup> autophosphorylation is a hallmark of FAK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kleinschmidt and Schlaepfer, 2017</xref>) and collaborates with Src-dependent phosphorylation at FAK<sup>Y576/Y577</sup> leads to enhance adhesion-induced FAK activation. In order to evaluate whether inhibiting FAK phosphorylation would counteract with ITGA2-dependent spheroid formation and anoikis resistance, we tested FAK inhibitor in various in vitro assays. The FAK specific inhibitor Defactinib, previously showing initial signs of activity in relapsed EOC patients in combination with paclitaxel in a clinical phase I/Ib trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patel et al., 2014</xref>) was tested in this study. Here, Defactinib treatment in EOC cells showed no impact on inhibiting the upstream p-Src<sup>419</sup> but resulted in a significant reduction of p-FAK<sup>Y397</sup>, p-FAK<sup>Y576/577</sup>, and the downstream c-Raf, G1/S phase transition cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The inhibition of FAK phosphorylation by Defactinib led to a dramatic decrease in cell survival, anoikis resistance, and spheroid formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>). Blockade of either FAK or MAPK signaling axis showed no direct impact of cell-collagen adhesion but significantly reduced mesothelial clearance activity of EOC cells, supporting the functional involvement of ITGA2, and FAK/MAPK axis in ovarian cancer metastasis model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>). It is reasonable that the FAK/MAPK-dependent cell survival is downstream of integrin receptor signaling, therefore ITGA2-mediated initial cell adhesion is marginally affected. In line with phosphoproteomics and in vitro inhibition models, the EOC patients’ samples also revealed a remarkable upregulation of phosphorylated FAK<sup>Y397,S843</sup>, and ERK1/2 <sup>T202/Y204</sup> in ITGA2<sup>High</sup> omental metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).

There have been four collagen-binding integrin complexes (α1β1, α2β1, α10β1, and α11β1) implicated in a variety of malignancies with promoting activity in cancer cell dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zeltz and Gullberg, 2016</xref>). The transcriptomic analysis from CCLE database suggested that ITGA1 and ITGA2 are the major collagen-binding integrins in EOC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Analysis of protein expression shows only ITGA2 is significantly elevated in omental metastases compared to the normal omentum, suggesting its potential role in mediating metastatic events. High expression of ITGA2 has been reported to exacerbate experimental metastasis in melanoma, gastric, and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baronas-Lowell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolomé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Matsuoka et al., 2000</xref>). Additional studies revealed a ligand-mediated dynamic function of ITGA2 in promoting hepatic metastasis through binding to collagen IV in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yoshimura et al., 2009</xref>) as well as driving collagen-rich bone metastasis in a prostate tumor xenograft model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall et al., 2006</xref>). However, Ramirez et al. demonstrated that ITGA2 acts as a metastasis suppressor by increasing tumor cell intravasation in <italic>Itga2</italic> deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramirez et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In regards to ovarian cancer, a recent study demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells with elevated ITGA2 led to poor prognosis and survival. Overexpression of ITGA2 promoted in vitro cancer cell aggressiveness and in vivo tumor growth through regulation of the phosphorylation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and AKT phosphorylation, which provided the mechanism for ITGA2-mediated paclitaxel-resistance in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains uncertain how ITGA2 regulates AKT/Foxo1 axis and how ITGA2 is regulated in the ovarian cancer cells. Another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shield et al., 2007</xref> showed that enhanced cellular expression of integrin α2β1 influence spheroid disaggregation and proteolysis responsible for the peritoneal metastases. Functional blockade with monoclonal antibodies binding to α2, β1, and α2β1 integrin inhibited disaggregation and activation of MMP2/MMP9 in cancer spheroids. Although the participation of specific integrins in spheroid formation is not fully characterized, it is reasonable that in a spheroid scenario is more related to cell–cell rather than cell-ECM interaction that will influence integrin expression profile. Taken together, a comprehensive understanding of integrin-ECM interaction, a crucial step of cancer cell dissemination, is uncertain but of immense importance in order to prevent peritoneal metastasis.</p><p>In this study, we report a high abundance of ITGA2 in more than 60% of patients investigated present in primary, ATCs, and omental metastases of the investigated cancer samples, suggesting a selective potential of tumor cell adherence to the collagen-rich omentum. We propose that ITGA2 facilitates early events of peritoneal metastasis by enhancing anchorage-independent cell growth, cell adhesion to collagen, and displacement of mesothelial layer leading to peritoneal metastasis both in vivo and in vitro and by using several <italic>ITGA2</italic> knockout (n = 5) and overexpressed (n = 4) cell lines representing various histological histotype of EOC. Additionally, upregulation of multiple ECM proteins including COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL11A1, FN1, and VCAN was also observed in omental metastases. ECM proteins have been associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis as shown by multilevel evidences from transcriptomics, proteomics, digital histopathology data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce et al., 2018</xref>), as well as in a pooled hazard ratio model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For example, COL1A1 promotes primary ovarian cancer cell adhesion and initiates tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burleson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moser et al., 1996</xref>). Hypoxia stimulates collagen remodeling by mesothelial cells and can be pharmacologically inhibited to reduce tumor burden in murine omental metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Natarajan et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the enhanced expression of COL5A1, COL11A1, and VCAN through regulation of TGF-β1 signaling was identified in ovarian cancer metastasis. Consistently, elevated COL11A1 expression is also a predictor for poor survival in patients with serous ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the origin of high COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 expression identified in the normal omentum and omental metastases positively correlates with fibroblast activation protein-1α (FAP) and α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Considering that fibroblasts possess very high contractile ability, promote angiogenesis, and stimulate epithelial tumor growth via secretion of growth factors and a variety of ECM, this might explain the correlation with poor prognosis of patients with elevated cancer-associated fibroblasts and collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, the matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP2, 9, and 14) capable of degrading collagens and proteoglycans were also found to be upregulated in omental metastases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), consistent with the idea that ECM degradation and remodeling are essential steps for cancer cell invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shield et al., 2007</xref>). On the other hand, downregulation of the matrix proteins in omental metastases including LAMA4, LAMB1, LAMC1, TNXB, and COL15A1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is associated with the integrity of mesothelial basement membrane and tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pearce et al., 2018</xref>). Peritoneal metastasis is common in patients with adenocarcinomas of ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal origin and underlying biological mechanisms have been mainly focusing on an integrin α5β1-fibronectin interaction. Kenny et al. has demonstrated that the interaction of integrin α5β1-fibronectin between cancer cells and mesothelial cells can be blocked by a monoclonal antibody, resulting in lesser peritoneal metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kenny et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study highlighted the role of fibroblast-secreting EGF in promoting ITGA5<sup>high</sup> spheroid-mediated peritoneal dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). However, a recent phase II trial using the anti-α5β1 integrin antibody, Volociximab, showed no clinical improvement in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, and 75% of the patients experienced study-related adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell-McGuinn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ricart et al., 2008</xref>). Here, the redundancy of overlapping ligand specificities between integrins may be a possible escape mechanism of tumor cells. Therefore, our finding provides an alternative therapeutic potential of blocking ITGA2-mediated collagen adhesion using a selective α2β1 integrin antagonist, TC-I-15. Considering that cancer cell dissemination is the initial event of peritoneal metastasis, it is reasoned that the proposed integrin blockade may not be effective when metastasis has already taken place. As a result, a maintenance therapy after cytoreductive surgery might be more favorable to delay tumor recurrence.</p><p>Mechanistically, we have identified that ITGA2-collagen interaction fosters cancer cell survival, cell migration, and anoikis resistance through the FAK/MAPK signaling axis. As a result, targeting integrin-dependent downstream effectors may also provide a similar inhibitory effect as integrin inhibition to prevent cancer cell dissemination. Increased expression of FAK signaling proteins has been identified in omental metastases, which is linked to poor prognosis in EOC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nolasco-Quiroga et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sood et al., 2004</xref>). In agreement with previous findings that depletion of FAK also inhibits local invasion and metastasis in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Provenzano et al., 2008</xref>), we could demonstrate that FAK inhibitor Defactinib dramatically reduces cancer cell proliferation, spheroid formation, and mesothelial clearance. Moreover, the growth factor family receptors (e.g. EGFR, VEGFR) can also induce the FAK/Src/MAPK activation in an integrin-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bromann et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that targeting FAK may provide an ancillary effect to inhibit the growth of tumor cells.</p><p>Overall, we describe the critical contribution of collagens elevated in the premetastatic niche and the mechanism of how ITGA2-mediated cancer cell dissemination during peritoneal metastasis. The ITGA2-dependent phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2 triggers focal adhesion and MAPK signaling, leading to increased anoikis resistance and mesothelial invasion of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The herein provided in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo evidence suggests that selectively blocking cancer cell-to-collagen interaction or targeting FAK/MAPK-mediated signaling may present another

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please aim to submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter we also need to see the corresponding revision in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Huang et al. address the role of interactions between collagens and integrin α 2 (ITGA2) in the seeding of ovarian cancer cells to the omentum. Strengths of the study include the use of a lot of clinical samples, and the first demonstration of a dependence on integrin α 2 (ITGA2) for cell adhesion and migration in ovarian cancer. There is an enormous amount of carefully performed work, and a lot of comprehensive profiling. However, the study has some weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p><p>In this study, the authors begin by using proteomics to assess the expression of proteins in the normal omentum, versus omentum with an embedded metastatic ovarian cancer. This identified upregulation of a number of collagens, fibronectin, and matrix metalloproteases, among others. They found that a number of integrins were expressed similarly in both normal omentum and omentum bearing a metastasis, whereas, ITGA2 was expressed at higher levels in the metastatic setting. They showed that ITGA2 and CDH1 are expressed in more than half of spheroids among ascites tumor cells (ATCs). ITGA2 was knocked out in 5 distinct ovarian cancer cell lines of various cell types. This did not affect proliferation, but did reduce chemotaxis (10% FBS)-induced cell motility and tumor cluster formation, and increase anoikis, implying defects in attachment.</p><p>The authors directly demonstrate that knockdown of ITGA2 reduces adhesion to collagen but not fibronectin, and reduced cell spreading and formation of focal adhesions, and overexpression of ITGA2 increases adhesion. Analyzing patient samples, they show distinct paterns of expression of ITGA2 and ITGA5. They show that the ITGA2 inhibitor TC-I-15 blocks collagen adhesion even in ovarian cancer cells overexpressing both ITGA2 and ITGA5. They demonstrate that cell lines lacking ITGA2 have reduced adhesion to mesothelial cells, are less capable of mesothelial clearance, and form fewer tumors following IP injection. Finally, the authors perform proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling of ITGA2 wt and mutant cells grown in the presence of collagen. They find loss of ITGA2 causes cells to acquire more epithelial features, and to downregulate the focal adhesion signaling cascade. They then show that treatment with a focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor defactinib reduces EOC growth, and identify a correlation with high ITGA2 expression and high activation of FAK and associated proteins (SRC, ERK) in omental metastases.</p><p>The manuscript contains some interesting data. Further understanding of the functional role of ITGA2 in OC is important, as the role of this protein has not been extensively explored, with only a few previous publications. Overall, the work employed appropriate methods to interrogate the effects of genetic loss, pharmacologic inhibition or overexpression of ITGA2 in OC cells, including use of multiple cell lines and human OC tumor/ascites specimens and generally rigorous analyses. The clinical correlation in Figures 1-2 are a nice clinically relevant start for the manuscript.</p><p>However, some parts of the manuscript seem more like a collection of phenotypic/descriptive data rather than experiments aimed and investigating the big question – the role of ITGA2-col axis in EOC metastasis. Findings are sometimes generalized across all cell lines when the data for individual cell lines show key significant differences. While the phosphoproteomic analysis is interesting, it only one cell line was subjected to analysis. FAK/MAPK signaling may play a major role in collagen-ITGA2 mediated signaling, but phosphoproteomic survey alone is insufficient to definitively demonstrate this is the primary mechanism, particularly if a single cell line was used.</p><p>The major limitation of the study is that there is little mechanistic insight. The authors could increase the impact by investigating at least some of the potential lead further: how does ITGA2 contributes to anoikis resistance in a ligand independent manner (as the a2 inhibitor had no effect on spheroid formation), why does loss of a2 induce epithelial features – is a2 contributing to anchorage independence and metastasis triggering loss through regulation of EMT/stemness features? What is the role of a2-collagen feed-forward signaling (Figure 7) to supporting a collagen rich metastatic niche? Suggestions are offered below to strengthen the data presented and further support the conclusions of the study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although ITGA5 is listed as non-significantly elevated in patient samples, it looks as if very few normal specimens were profiled for this integrin, compared to the others, for some reason. This is a particularly important issue to evaluate carefully, given several publications that have noted a specific and critical role for ITGA5 in promoting ovarian cancer metastasis (among others, PMID: 30710055, PMID: 23499550, PMID: 18381440), given the images provided in Figure 1E suggest the expression of this protein is particularly heterogeneous among tumors, and given the authors' data in Figure 5A actually suggests it is abundant. They also exclude ITGA5 from important subsequent analysis (e.g., database and direct cell line evaluation in Figure 2, 4, etc). This eliminates a critical benchmark; for example, the authors demonstrate using three cell lines in which ITGA5 is knocked out that binding to collagen is lost. If these three lines happen to be rare ones lacking ITGA5 expression, this could explain the dramatic phenotype. Information about ITGA5 should be added consistently.</p><p>2) In a survey of cell models, ITGA2 expression did not correlate with histotype or TP53 mutation status. This is curious, since serous ovarian cancers are the most aggressive and metastatic; one might expect to see higher levels in this cancer type. What is the author's explanation for this?</p><p>3) In Figure 5, the PIs use the ITGA2-specific inhibitor in cell lines overexpressing both ITGA2 and ITGA5 to demonstrate that inhibition of ITGA2 is sufficient to disrupt binding to collagen. However, they use this inhibitor at 40 μM. From the Tocris web page, &quot;Potent α2β1 integrin inhibitor (IC50 values for the inhibition of human platelet adhesion to type I collagen are 12 and 715 nM for platelets under static conditions and under flow, respectively). Displays selectivity for α2β1 over αvβ3, α5β1, α6β1 and αIIbβ3 at concentrations exceeding 1000 nM.&quot; 40 μM is far in excess of these concentrations. The assay should be performed at appropriate concentrations; for instance, 1 μM. In addition, Tocris sells an α5 inhibitor, ATN161; this should be used in parallel assays, with the expectation it would not have an effect at concentrations where it is active for ITGA5 but not ITGA2.</p><p>4) Interestingly, from the data in Figure 5A show a partial although incomplete overlap between ITGA2 and ITGA5 expression. In Figure 5B, the authors show &quot;a strong positive correlation between the percentage of ITGA2+ ATCs and the adhesion efficiency to collagen&quot;. A similar analysis should be done for ITGA5.</p><p>5) The importance of FAK signaling in EOC is well-established, and targeting of FAK is already being explored clinically in these cancers (for instance, PMID: 31478830), reducing the novelty of the last part of the study. Hence, bolstering conviction of an activity specific for ITGA2 is important. FAK is activated by multiple integrins, and its activation in response to ITGA5 is well-established. It would be important to benchmark ITGA2 and ITGA5 in some of the experiments in Figure 7. For instance, do the cell lines analyzed by phosphoproteomic analysis express or not express ITGA5? Do the metastatic cells in the omentum with high ITGA2 also have ITGA5? Are there examples with high ITGA2 but not ITGA5? These seemed to be relatively rare based on data shown in Figure 5A. These data are extremely important for assessing the specificity of the signaling, and in understanding the relevant clinical populations likely to respond to FAK inhibitors.</p><p>6) It is actually interesting that expression of ITGA2 and ITGA5 seem to correlate (based on data provided). Do the authors have any thoughts as to whether this correlation is real, and if so, what is causing it?</p><p>7) The data in Figure 5-7 are the most exciting. Are the metastatic foci rich in collagen? Does FAK inhibition have an effect on this? FAK is a key regulator of anoikis but also functions downstream of integrin to regulate adhesion turnover etc. Is the FAKi effect (Figure 7G-H) limited only to inhibiting sphere growth or does it also influence the mesothelium clearance/collagen interaction? The authors should clarify their description and interpretation of the elevated expression of collagens in omentum bearing metastases. Certainly, the fact that the omentum changes expression of collagens over time is well known, as is the relationship of this to onset of aging-related pathologies (one recent review – PMID: 29996539). Some of these changes may &quot;prime the soil&quot; for seeding by ovarian cancers expressing cognate integrins. However, the analysis of phosphoproteomic and TCGA data at the end of the paper seems to suggest the collagens are being produced by the tumor cells themselves – which would lead to a different model.</p><p>8) Although ITGA2 has not been as heavily investigated as other integrins for a role in EOC, one study found it to be upregulated in ovarian cancer (PMID: 31443152), and a more recent one showed it contributed to paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer by activating AKT/paclitaxel (PMID: 32202508). The discussion should discuss these works in greater detail; in particular, it would be useful to place the current work in the context of AKT pathway activation, given this is a major regulator of anoikis, and engages in cross-talk with FAK, SRC, and ERK.</p><p>9) Authors state that ΔITG2A cells &quot;maintained adhesion to laminin and fibronectin (Figure 4, A-B)&quot;, but the data showed variability across cell lines, suggesting this was not generalizable. While true for SKOV3 cells, other cell lines showed significant differences in one or the other substrate. This variability in effect on FN or LN binding is also observed in experiments utilizing the ITGA2 inhibitor TC-I-15 (shown in Figure 5). The text describing the findings in the context of FN and LN should be modified.</p><p>10) Although the authors tested the effects of TC-I-15 on AS20 cells and showed no significant change, use of these cells only does not fully address the specificity of TC-I-15 for ITGA2 as ITGA5 protein levels in these cells are mid-range. Testing of cells that exhibit ITGA2 low ITGA5 high would further support the selectivity of drug effect for ITGA2.</p><p>11) The finding that TC-I-15 has no effect on spheroid formation seems at odds with the prediction that ITGA2 is a key contributor to – if not essential for – sphere formation and escape from detachment-induced anoikis as shown in Figure 3D and E. The authors show OE of ITGA2 results in increased anchorage independent colony formation.

They also exclude ITGA5 from important subsequent analysis (e.g., database and direct cell line evaluation in Figure 2, 4, etc). This eliminates a critical benchmark; for example, the authors demonstrate using three cell lines in which ITGA5 is knocked out that binding to collagen is lost. If these three lines happen to be rare ones lacking ITGA5 expression, this could explain the dramatic phenotype. Information about ITGA5 should be added consistently.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the important role of the fibronectin binder ITGA5 in ovarian cancer metastasis. It is well described in the current literature as pointed out by the reviewers. The original manuscript has already mentioned the involvement of ITGA5 in mediating cancer cell interaction to fibronectin as one possible disseminating process in peritoneal metastasis through an c-Met/FAK/Src dependent signaling (Gao et al., 2019; Iwanicki et al., 2011; Kenny et al., 2014) which can be found in the Introduction and Discussion. However, we do see the point raised by the reviewer and aimed to incorporate the ITGA5 more prominent in the context of our newly suggested ITGA2-collagen driven mechanism promoting ovarian cancer metastasis to the omentum. Accordingly, we evaluated the expression of ITGA5 consistently in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer on the heterogeneous and abundant expression of ITGA5 among tumor samples as seen in Figure 1E and 5A, respectively. We explain the difference noticed by the reviewer with the different experimental methodology applied as well as human specimens investigated. The Western blot analysis in bulk tumor tissue whole cell protein lysates (Figure 1E) shows the expression of ITGA5 independent of composition and cell types (e.g. stromal, immune, endothelial, and tumor cells). In contrast, the flow cytometry analysis in Figure 5A reflects the cell surface protein expression in the tumor spheroid isolated from patient-derived ascites. The high abundance of ITGA5 in those samples is also consistent with a previous finding demonstrating elevated ITGA5 expression in ovarian cancer spheroids as compared to the primary tumor for promoting cell adhesion and peritoneal metastasis (Gao et al., 2019). Upon request and to further strengthen our data, we have consistently added supplementary data for ITGA5 expression to the CCLE dataset as well as our cell line panel used throughout the manuscript (Figure 2B, Figure 2E, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, and Figure 7H). The generated data support our initial findings that altered ITGA5 expression unlikely associated with ITGA2-mediated cancer cell-collagen binding.</p><p>Refer to the last question, the three <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cell lines (SKOV3, OVCAR3, and IGROV1) used for cell-ECM binding assay showing completely lost of collagen binding is independent of ITGA5 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In a survey of cell models, ITGA2 expression did not correlate with histotype or TP53 mutation status. This is curious, since serous ovarian cancers are the most aggressive and metastatic; one might expect to see higher levels in this cancer type. What is the author's explanation for this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that there is no correlation between <italic>ITGA2</italic> expression and serous histotype/ <italic>TP53</italic> mutational status in the CCLE dataset (Figure 2A and 2C). In consistency with the cell line survey mentioned by the reviewer, already provided ovarian cancer transcriptomic data GSE51088 (n=172) (Karlan et al., 2014) as well as our own cohort (n=200) on ITGA2 protein expression suggest an histotype-independent ITGA2 expression considering <italic>TP53</italic> mutation as dominating genetic alteration in serous ovarian cancer. An inconsistent pattern in this regards was observed for three additional publicly available datasets showing a significant upregulation of <italic>ITGA2</italic> expression in endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancer in both (GSE73614; n=107) (Winterhoff et al., 2016) and GSE2109 (n=204). In contrast, no significant difference was observed for GSE9891 (n=285) (Tothill et al., 2008) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). The discrepancy among datasets may likely due to the different methodology applied, the biological heterogeneity of the ovarian tumor samples investigated, or the overall insufficient numbers of non-serous histotypes of ovarian cancer. Additionally, we also confirmed that the mutational status of <italic>TP53</italic> does not correlate with ITGA2 expression (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B-C). Taken together, having investigated five independent transcriptomic data sets on ITGA2 gene and protein expression without revealing a consistent pattern throughout the majority of the studies further support our initial data that ITGA2 cannot clearly be linked to current clinicopathological parameters or mutational status.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 5, the PIs use the ITGA2-specific inhibitor in cell lines overexpressing both ITGA2 and ITGA5 to demonstrate that inhibition of ITGA2 is sufficient to disrupt binding to collagen. However, they use this inhibitor at 40 μM. From the Tocris web page, &quot;Potent α2β1 integrin inhibitor (IC50 values for the inhibition of human platelet adhesion to type I collagen are 12 and 715 nM for platelets under static conditions and under flow, respectively). Displays selectivity for α2β1 over αvβ3, α5β1, α6β1 and αIIbβ3 at concentrations exceeding 1000 nM.&quot; 40 μM is far in excess of these concentrations. The assay should be performed at appropriate concentrations; for instance, 1 μM. In addition, Tocris sells an α5 inhibitor, ATN161; this should be used in parallel assays, with the expectation it would not have an effect at concentrations where it is active for ITGA5 but not ITGA2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. As requested, we have tested a newly manufactured batch of α2β1 integrin inhibitor and repeated all inhibition assays using 1μM (Figure 5D-E). In brief, the inhibitor specifically blocks ITGA2-collagen interaction in a lower range of 0.2-1μM and is in line with data initially reported for 40 μM.</p><p>Additionally, we tested the suggested ITGA5 inhibitor ATN161, a noncompetitive inhibitor of the fibronectin PHSRN sequence. However, we could not observe any reduction in cell-adhesion to fibronectin even up to 100 μM treatment using experimental conditions as applied for ITGA2. This is consistent to previous studies showing that ATN-161 does not block integrin-dependent adhesion to ECM (fibronectin), but may inhibit integrin-dependent signaling as part of its mechanism of action (Plunkett and Mazar, 2002)</p><p>In order to demonstrate the ligand specificity of both ITGA2 and ITGA5, we additionally generated ITGA5-KO cells using CRISPR-<italic>Cas9</italic> in the IGROV1 and SKOV3 cell line (detailed information provided in the Materials and methods). Genetic loss of ITGA5 was confirmed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). The cell-ECM adhesion of <italic>ΔITGA5</italic> revealed the expected reduction to its well-known ligand, fibronectin, but only marginal change for binding to collagen. These results indicate that the potential cross-reactivity of cell surface ITGA5 to collagen is marginal and are in line with our response to reviewer’s comment 1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interestingly, from the data in Figure 5A show a partial although incomplete overlap between ITGA2 and ITGA5 expression. In Figure 5B, the authors show &quot;a strong positive correlation between the percentage of ITGA2+ ATCs and the adhesion efficiency to collagen&quot;. A similar analysis should be done for ITGA5.</p></disp-quote><p>We re-analyzed the correlation of ITGA2 and ITGA5 expression with regards to cell-ECM adhesion efficiency for collagen I and fibronectin (Figure 5B). In brief, cell surface ITGA2 levels positively correlate with cancer cell adhesion to collagen I (R=0.6858, *<italic>p</italic>=0.0286) but not correlate to fibronectin (R=-0.04, <italic>p</italic>=0.902). <italic>Vice versa</italic>, cell surface ITGA5 levels positively correlate only with fibronectin (R=0.6694, *<italic>p</italic>=0.0342) but not collagen I. Taken together, we provide further evidence that <italic>ΔITGA5</italic> marginally impacts cell-collagen binding (please see response 3), and that ITGA2 and ITGA5 show independent receptor-ligands specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The importance of FAK signaling in EOC is well-established, and targeting of FAK is already being explored clinically in these cancers (for instance, PMID: 31478830), reducing the novelty of the last part of the study. Hence, bolstering conviction of an activity specific for ITGA2 is important. FAK is activated by multiple integrins, and its activation in response to ITGA5 is well-established. It would be important to benchmark ITGA2 and ITGA5 in some of the experiments in Figure 7. For instance, do the cell lines analyzed by phosphoproteomic analysis express or not express ITGA5? Do the metastatic cells in the omentum with high ITGA2 also have ITGA5? Are there examples with high ITGA2 but not ITGA5? These seemed to be relatively rare based on data shown in Figure 5A. These data are extremely important for assessing the specificity of the signaling, and in understanding the relevant clinical populations likely to respond to FAK inhibitors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s statement as it is indeed well known that multiple integrins triggered the activation of FAK signaling including ITGA5 (Harburger and Calderwood, 2009), and the oncogenic role for FAK activation has been shown to sustain tumor sphere proliferation and chemo-resistance in ovarian cancer (Diaz Osterman et al., 2019). Here, we could not exclude the involvement of ITGA5-dependent activation of FAK signaling. However, the selection of five ovarian cancer cell lines for gene editing represents the heterogeneity of ovarian cancer displaying differential expression of both integrins as shown in Figure 2E (see also comment 1). As suggested, we investigated additional cell lines (<italic>ΔITGA2</italic> in SKOV3 and OVCAR3) expressing low levels of endogenous ITGA5 using phosphoproteomic analysis (Please see further details in comment 13).</p><p>To further support our finding in addition to phosphoproteomic analysis, we also analyzed omental metastasis samples shown in Figure 7H of the original submission, here demonstrating that ITGA5 expression is abundant in almost every sample but less likely linked to activate FAK-dependent signaling. As a result, the significant fold change of identified phosphoproteins under collagen stimulation condition is most likely the causality of ITGA2 deletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is actually interesting that expression of ITGA2 and ITGA5 seem to correlate (based on data provided). Do the authors have any thoughts as to whether this correlation is real, and if so, what is causing it?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that our statement is not clear that although the expression pattern of ITGA2 and ITGA5 in our ascites samples (N=20) seems partly overlap, but there is no significant correlation between the integrins with regards to expression in our cohort. Of note, it is widely known that to sustain the anchorage-independent growth and anoikis resistance, ascites-derived tumor spheroids undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and upregulated integrin expression to facilitate cell-ECM adhesion and subsequent tumor implantation (Ma et al., 2020). Such a unique ascites microenvironment may explain the positive upregulation of both integrins on tumor spheroids, however, the molecular signatures of ascites-derived tumor cells and their primary and metastatic tumor counterpart likely being significantly different (Gao et al., 2019). We also examined the correlation of the collagen binder ITGA2 to fibronectin binder ITGA5 in the CCLE dataset. We now include the correlation scatter plot in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and show that there is no significant correlation between ITGA2 and ITGA5 expression in CCLE (ovarian cells <italic>p</italic>=0.46, all cancer cells <italic>p</italic>=0.057) dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The data in Figure 5-7 are the most exciting. Are the metastatic foci rich in collagen? Does FAK inhibition have an effect on this? FAK is a key regulator of anoikis but also functions downstream of integrin to regulate adhesion turnover etc. Is the FAKi effect (Figure 7G-H) limited only to inhibiting sphere growth or does it also influence the mesothelium clearance/collagen interaction? The authors should clarify their description and interpretation of the elevated expression of collagens in omentum bearing metastases. Certainly, the fact that the omentum changes expression of collagens over time is well known, as is the relationship of this to onset of aging-related pathologies (one recent review – PMID: 29996539). Some of these changes may &quot;prime the soil&quot; for seeding by ovarian cancers expressing cognate integrins. However, the analysis of phosphoproteomic and TCGA data at the end of the paper seems to suggest the collagens are being produced by the tumor cells themselves – which would lead to a different model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this very positive and enthusiastic feedback. The initial thought of our study was based on the assumption that the ECM composition in the omentum contributes to early onset of metastasis and thus, serves as pre-metastatic niche. Beside the established ITGA5-fibronectin interaction in ovarian cancer, we noticed that the normal omentum is rich in collagen (Figure 1C) and particularly type I collagen (triple helix of COL1A1 and COL1A2; (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Therefore, we have analyzed the collagen expression in normal and metastatic omentum by immunohistochemistry and found that the metastatic foci is also rich in collagen (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). In line with the proteomic analysis already shown in Figure 1A, that COL1A1 is significantly upregulated in omental metastasis samples. A recent study has well-described that the upregulation of COL1A1, COL11A1, VCAN, FN1, COMP, and CTSB, is associated with cancer progression, poor prognosis, and malignant cell invasion in ovarian cancer (Pearce et al., 2018). Interestingly, the authors also reported that normal omental ECM stained highly positive and evenly distributed COL1A1, but malignant omentum showing strong but uneven staining likely due to the expression of matrix remodeling proteases.</p><p>In regard to the last question, <italic>th</italic>e analysis of phosphoproteomic and TCGA data in Figure 7—figure supplement 1B is mainly to provide evidence that ITGA2 expression positively correlates and various ECM proteins including collagens. Of note, we should be aware that the transcriptomic analysis of tumor is based on bulk RNA-sequencing and therefore not necessary being produce by tumor cells itself. Additionally, to address this interesting thought on the potential impact of self-secreted collagen by cancer cells, we analyzed the mRNA expression of collagens in the CCLE ovarian cancer cell lines dataset. Ovarian cancer cell lines express predominantly COL4A1, COL4A2, and COL18A1 whereas human fibroblasts are well-known to produce high abundant of COL1A1 and COL1A2 give rise to type I collagen (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). The origin of high COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 expression identified in the normal omentum and omental metastases positively correlate with fibroblast-specific markers including fibroblast activation protein 1α (FAP), and α-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2) described in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C of the original manuscript. Although we could not completely exclude the impact of self-secreted collagens by ovarian cancer cells, our in vitro colony formation and proliferation assay (please see our response to comment 15 for more details) revealed that cancer cell-secreted COL4 and COL18 may not be the primary ligands for ITGA2-dependent cell growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Although ITGA2 has not been as heavily investigated as other integrins for a role in EOC, one study found it to be upregulated in ovarian cancer (PMID: 31443152), and a more recent one showed it contributed to paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer by activating AKT/paclitaxel (PMID: 32202508). The discussion should discuss these works in greater detail; in particular, it would be useful to place the current work in the context of AKT pathway activation, given this is a major regulator of anoikis, and engages in cross-talk with FAK, SRC, and ERK.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed the recent critical work about ITGA2 in ovarian cancer in the discussion according to the reviewer’s suggestion (please see response to comment 14). Briefly, Ma <italic>et al.</italic>, demonstrated the AKT/Foxo1 signaling axis confer paclitaxel resistance and cell survival in three ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, A2780, and SKOV3) in vitro and xenograft model. They showed that phosphorylation of AKT S473 is increased in an ITGA2-dependent manner. Although we did not identify the downregulation of pS473 in ITGA2 knockout cells using a phosphoproteomic discovery approach, the phosphorylation of AKT S124 and S129 are significantly reduced in the ITGA2-collagen signaling axis in both EOC cell lines (Figure 7—figure supplement 1D) and patient samples (Figure 7H). Both phosphorylation sites were required for elevated AKT1 activity (Di Maira et al., 2005), suggesting that AKT activation is also engaging in cross-talk with ITGA2-dependent FAK signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Authors state that ΔITG2A cells &quot;maintained adhesion to laminin and fibronectin (Figure 4, A-B)&quot;, but the data showed variability across cell lines, suggesting this was not generalizable. While true for SKOV3 cells, other cell lines showed significant differences in one or the other substrate. This variability in effect on FN or LN binding is also observed in experiments utilizing the ITGA2 inhibitor TC-I-15 (shown in Figure 5). The text describing the findings in the context of FN and LN should be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the insufficient description of the data obtained for cell binding assays to FN and LN. We made the correction to the corresponding text in Figure 4A-B.</p><p>“Notably, the consistently strong cell adhesion efficiency to collagen type I, III, and IV in parental cell lines significantly diminished upon ITGA2 deletion. However, cell adhesion to laminin and fibronectin appeared in a cell line-dependent manner in ΔITGA2 cell lines which may be due to the redundancy of multiple integrin subunits. (Figure 4, A-B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Although the authors tested the effects of TC-I-15 on AS20 cells and showed no significant change, use of these cells only does not fully address the specificity of TC-I-15 for ITGA2 as ITGA5 protein levels in these cells are mid-range. Testing of cells that exhibit ITGA2 low ITGA5 high would further support the selectivity of drug effect for ITGA2.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we selected three independent group of ATCs that exhibits ITGA2<sup>low</sup>/ITGA5<sup>high</sup> (AS14, AS15, AS17), ITGA2<sup>high</sup>/ITGA5 <sup>high</sup> (AS4, AS11, AS18) and ITGA2<sup>low</sup>/ITGA5<sup>low</sup> (AS13, AS19, AS20) for subsequent cell-ECM adhesion analysis in the presence of TC-I-15. Related data are shown in Figure 5. In line with our previous finding, re-analysis of ATCs (n=9) adhesion suggested that TC-I-15 treatment can specifically block ITGA2 interaction to collagen with marginal difference to fibronectin and importantly, independent of ITGA5 expression (Figure 5D). However, whether the discrepancy of cell-collagen adhesion efficiency between ITGA2<sup>low</sup>/ITGA5<sup>high</sup> and ITGA2<sup>low</sup>/ITGA5<sup>low</sup> is due to the redundancy of other collagen-binding integrins or not (e.g. ITGA1, ITGA10 or ITGA11), requires further investigation. Furthermore, the ligand-binding specificity is also supported by our newly established <italic>ΔITGA5</italic> cells showing decreased adhesion to fibronectin but not to the collagens as discussed above (see response 3, Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The finding that TC-I-15 has no effect on spheroid formation seems at odds with the prediction that ITGA2 is a key contributor to – if not essential for – sphere formation and escape from detachment-induced anoikis as shown in Figure 3 D and E. The authors show OE of ITGA2 results in increased anchorage independent colony formation. Was the effect of deletion of ITGA2 on anchorage independent colony size and number tested (WT vs ΔITG2A cells)?</p></disp-quote><p>We are also aware of the reviewer’s concern about the cancer sphere formation. The initially submitted manuscript showed that overexpression of ITGA2 increased colony forming ability in BG1 and A2780 cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). However, other cell lines (SKOV3, OVCAR3, OAW42, and ES2) did not form rigorous spheroids using the anchorage-independent soft agar assay. Thus, we could not generalize the effect of deletion of ITGA2 for those cell lines. Nevertheless, we additionally performed the anchorage-independent spheroid formation for IGROV1 cells in the ITGA2 knockout background in order to acknowledge reviewers comment. In line with previous findings, we found significantly reduced colony formation in <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cells (both diameter and number of spheroids) as compared to the parental IGROV1 cells. Data obtained have been added to Figure 4—figure supplement 1F.</p><p>In regard to the effect of TC-I-15 on spheroid formation, the inhibitor itself does not involve in reducing transcriptional and translational activity of ITGA2 expression, however acting as an allosteric inhibitor blocking collagen-ITGA2 engagement site and subsequent signaling (Miller et al., 2009). Therefore, other ITGA2 binding ligands may remain actively involved in ITGA2-mediated signaling in spheroid formation. Besides canonical integrin signaling, ligand-independent integrin signaling has also been reported through the anchoring receptor-mediated cell adhesion to transmit a mechanical stimulus to the integrin that signals independently of ECM binding (Ferraris et al., 2014)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) in vivo analysis of SKOV3 WT and ΔITGA2 cells injected in nude mice showed significant reduction of total tumor implants in the ΔITGA2 xenografts. In Figure 3D, the authors show that SKOV3 ΔITGA2 cells grown on non-adherent plates exhibited a high degree of cell death (46.6%) as compared to SKOV3 control cells (12.9%). Was the potential difference in viability of the injected cells addressed to exclude the possibility that the reduction in tumor growth was due to significantly reduced viability of ΔITGA2 resulting in fewer cells to capable of growth? This is an essential point to clarify before one can conclude that ITGA2 is promoting dissemination and invasion of collagen rich omentum.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer and appreciate for pointing this out. Indeed, the <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cells showed significantly increased anoikis compared to parental cells 3 days after cultivation in non-adherent condition (Figure 3D). We performed additional experiments in reply to comment 15 below and observed a significant cell proliferation benefit on collagen-coated plates in parental cell lines as compared to <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cells (Figure 3A-B). These results suggest that ITGA2-mediated adhesion of ovarian cancer cells to the ECM is critical for cell survival. The elevated cell death only occurs while cells cultivated in a non-adherent condition, however, this is unlikely to be in the case of mouse abdominal cavity in which the peritoneum or omentum are covered by a mono-layer of mesothelium and richness of extracellular matrix proteins. This is also supported by a recent study shown by Gao et al. demonstrating that intraperitoneal injection of SKOV3 cells and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAFs) were able to instantly adhere to the metastatic tropism of omentum, peritoneum, and mesentery 4 hour after initial injection of tumor cells. Further spreading and development of tumor nodules was also pronounced in 1-2 weeks. Additionally, we did not identify a significant reduction of the <italic>ΔITGA2</italic>-derived tumor implants in organ such as peritoneum, intestine, kidney, stomach and lung (Figure 6H). Overall, we are confident the reduction of tumor growth in the omentum is not primarily due to the reduced viability in <italic>ΔITGA2</italic> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Phosphoproteomic analysis led the authors to conclude that ITGA2-collagen interaction fosters cancer cell survival, cell migration and anoikis resistance through the FAK/MAPK signaling axis. The only cell line mentioned in this analysis is IGROV-1. The implications of the findings would be substantially strengthened by analysis of additional cell lines with comparative analysis across lines to substantiate key findings. Functional assays would lend further support to the conclusion that FAK/MAPK signaling axis is the primary mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s statement that the implication would be substantially strengthened by analyzing additional cell lines. We performed phosphoproteomic analysis in two additional cell lines which are both ITGA2<sup>+</sup> but ITGA5<sup>Low</sup> (SKOV3 and OVCAR3, please also refer to comment 8). Despite less phosphoproteins identified in those two additional cell lines, we identified 69 down-regulated phosphoproteins shared across all three <italic>∆ITGA2</italic> cell lines (Figure 7A-B, and Supplementary file 1B). Next, we applied the gene ontological (GO) analysis to classify the biological process regulated by ITGA2-collagen signaling using Gene Ontology Database (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3954044 Released 2020-07-16). We found that the top 7 cell components enriched in the genes regulated by ITGA2, were related to cell organization, polarity and GTPase activity, which was further supported by GSEA analysis revealing that MAPK1/3 activation and cell junction organization being significantly regulated by ITGA2 axis (Figure 7C-D). Importantly, down-regulation of the T204 phosphorylation on MAPK3 and Y577, T700, S843 phosphorylation on FAK were also present in the additional two cell lines (Figure 7—figure supplement 1C) as well as in omental metastasis tissues (Figure 7H). Data of phosphoproteomic analysis were provided in Figure 7—source data 1.</p><p>To further address reviewer’s concern about supporting FAK and MAPK as the primary mediators of the ITGA2-collagen dependent signaling, we performed cell adhesion and mesothelial clearance assay in the presence of ITGA2, FAK and MAPK(ERK1/2) inhibitors, respectively. Interestingly, only TC-I-15 treatment blocks cell adhesion to collagen (Figure 7—figure supplement 3E). Blockade of either FAK or MAPK signaling axis showed no direct impact of cell-adhesion to collagen I in vitro. It is reasonable that the FAK/MAPK-dependent cell survival is the downstream of integrin receptor signaling, therefore ITGA2-mediated initial cell adhesion is marginally affected. On the other hand, blocking ITGA2 or downstream FAK/MAPK signaling pathway significantly reduced mesothelial clearance activity of ovarian cancer cells, supporting the functional involvement of ITGA2 and FAK/MAPK axis in ovarian cancer metastasis model (Figure 7—figure supplement 3F). Furthermore, in line with our previous finding showing that Defactinib treatment inhibiting p-FAK<sup>Y397</sup>, p-FAK<sup>Y576/577</sup> and the downstream effector cyclin D1 expression (Figure 7F), two cell lines share also a similar trend with supporting the oncogenic role of FAK/MAPK signaling involved in cell survival, anoikis resistance and ITGA2-dependent cancer metastasis (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) The findings of this study should include deeper discussion in the context of prior work investigating the role of ITGA2 in OC. For example, Shield et al., 2007, showing a prominent role for ITGA2 in spheroid formation and disaggregation and proteolysis required for OC dissemination, and that function blocking antibodies abrogate these effects. In addition, a recent paper by Ma et al., 2020, focused on the role of ITGA2 in OC asking similar questions to those in this submission, with some notable similarities and differences in key findings.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to acknowledge the reviewers’ comment on an extended discussion about recent research published by Shield et al., and Ma et al. focusing on the role of ITGA2 in ovarian cancer, as well as different types of cancers, we have modified the Discussion accordingly as shown below:</p><p>“The role of ITGA2 remains controversial in different cancer types with elevated ITGA2 expression reported to exacerbate experimental metastasis in melanoma, gastric, and colon cancer (Baronas-Lowell et al., 2004; Bartolome et al., 2014; Matsuoka et al., 2000){Yoshimura, 2009 #1}.{Yoshimura, 2009 #1}{Yoshimura, 2009 #1}{Yoshimura, 2009 #1} […] As a result, a comprehensive understanding of integrin-ECM interaction, a crucial step for cancer cell dissemination, is uncertain but of immense importance for development of potential therapeutics targeting peritoneal metastasis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) The data in Figure 3 lack relevance to collagen (unless the cells secrete abundant collagen, which has not been investigated).

Intrigued by the comment we have analyzed the cell proliferation in the presence of either collagen or fibronectin in our entire cell line panel. In brief, the cell proliferation was examined in the presence of type I collagen and fibronectin using MTT and colony formation assay. As the reviewer’s might expect, significantly reduced cell proliferation was observed in <italic>∆ITGA2</italic> cells only on collagen coated wells. In contrast, neither classical plastic nor fibronectin coated plates showed such a difference (Figure 3A-B and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Besides providing further evidence on the specificity of ITGA2-mediated binding to collagen, these results also support that the collagen-ITGA2 dependent axis might be an important mechanism in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
