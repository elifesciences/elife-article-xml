The structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, however, remains poorly understood. The unexpected recent finding of asymmetric ectodomain dimer structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR (dEGFR) suggests a possible structural basis for Her2 heterodimerization, but all available structures for dimers of human EGFR family ectodomains are symmetric. Here, we report results from long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations indicating that a single ligand is necessary and sufficient to stabilize the ectodomain interface of Her2 heterodimers, which assume an asymmetric conformation similar to that of dEGFR dimers.

Humans have four ErbB proteins, which span the plasma membrane of cells. These proteins respond to interactions with molecules outside the cell—such as growth factors and hormones—by sending signals along the appropriate signaling pathway within the cell.</p><p>ErbB proteins have three portions: an ectodomain that extends outside the cell; a single helix that spans the membrane; and a cytoplasmic domain inside the cell. When a signaling ligand molecule outside the cell binds to the ectodomain of an ErbB protein, this protein must then combine with another ErbB protein to form a dimer before a signal can be sent within the cell. These dimers can include two copies of the same ErbB protein or two different ErbB proteins. However, one of the ErbB proteins—Her2—works in a different way. It cannot bind ligands outside the cell, and it can only send a signal within the cell if it first forms a dimer with an ErbB protein of another type, which itself must be bound to an external ligand.</p><p>The four ErbB proteins diverged from a common ancestor relatively recently, yet they are now diverse enough to play key roles in a variety of complex signaling networks. In particular, the fact that Her2 cannot bind external ligands, and that it must form a dimer with a different ErbB protein before it can send a signal, has led to suggestions that the role of Her2 is to amplify the signals from other ErbB proteins. Since high levels of Her2 are associated with aggressive forms of breast and ovarian cancer, understanding how it is activated could improve our understanding of these cancers.</p><p>Arkhipov et al. have now used computer simulations to model how Her2 forms dimers with other ErbB proteins in human cells. They based these simulations on crystal structures of human ErbB proteins and dEGFR, a growth-factor receptor found in fruit flies that closely resembles the ErbB proteins found in humans. They found that the dimers were stable as long as one protein within the dimer was bound to a ligand. Removing this ligand, however, distorted the ectodomain of the host protein, creating a gap that weakened the dimer and prevented Her2 from sending a signal within the cell. Similar results were obtained with the fruit fly dEGFR proteins. These simulations suggest that ErbB proteins form dimers and send signals through a mechanism conserved in evolution. Research in this field might help ongoing efforts to develop new treatments for human tumors characterized by high levels of Her2 expression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00708.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00708.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Her2/ErbB2 activation</kwd><kwd>extracellular domain conformation</kwd><kwd>dimerization interface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural basis for Her2's role as a dedicated heterodimerization partner for other EGFR family receptors is elucidated with long-timescale atomistic simulations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Her2 (also known as Neu or ErbB2), a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family that also includes EGFR/Her1, Her3, and Her4, is an important component of cell-signaling networks, and is implicated in the growth of a variety of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hynes and Lane, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Riese et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baselga and Swain, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). The receptors of the EGFR family activate through dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which is promoted by the binding of ligands from the EGF family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ushiro and Cohen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schreiber et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2010</xref>) to the receptors’ extracellular regions (‘ectodomains’). This activation process relies on a number of allosteric interactions in the extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular portions of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Endres et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkhipov et al., 2013</xref>), which lead to the formation of a specific asymmetric active dimer of the intracellular kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>). Her2 is unique in the family in that it does not homodimerize under normal conditions, and its ectodomain does not bind ligands. Instead, it activates through heterodimerization with other members of the family (EGFR and Her3, in particular) when they are bound to ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Citri and Yarden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baselga and Swain, 2009</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00708.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Receptors of the human EGFR family and conformations of their ectodomains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: the four members of the human EGFR family, each consisting of an ectodomain, a single-pass transmembrane helix, and an intracellular module that includes a kinase domain.

EGFR families in invertebrates have only one member, but gene duplication gave rise to two-member EGFR families in early vertebrate species, such as fishes. Further gene duplication eventually generated the four members of the mammalian EGFR family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stein and Staros, 2000</xref>). The increase in the number of EGFR family members, accompanied by increasing diversity of the extracellular ligands they interact with, gave rise to a complex signaling network: homo- and heterodimerization of various EGF receptors, induced by ligand binding, began to generate a variety of unique signaling outputs controlled by the identity of the bound ligands.</p><p>The unique dimerization properties of Her2 are believed to be essential to its critical role as a potent signal amplifier for the other receptors of the EGFR family. The Her3–Her2 heterodimer is particularly prevalent and potent in signaling. The prominence of Her3–Her2 heterodimers is particularly intriguing, since Her2 itself lacks an activating ligand and Her3 is impaired in its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These receptors act primarily through heterodimerization. The unique partnership of Her2 and Her3 has been aptly dubbed ‘the deaf and the dumb’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Citri et al., 2003</xref>). By activating several downstream pathways, including those of MAPK, PI3K, phospholipase C, protein kinase C, and Janus kinase, the Her3–Her2 heterodimer plays a pivotal role in the determination of cell lineage in a variety of tissues in epithelial organs. Experiments have shown that knocking out Her2 and Her3 genes leads to defective development of the heart, mammary gland, and nervous system in mice phenotypes. It is thus not surprising that Her3–Her2 heterodimers are implicated in a number of forms of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Citri et al., 2003</xref>) or that Her2 is an important drug target in cancer therapeutics.</p><p>The structural mechanism underlying Her2’s dimerization properties remains incompletely understood. In particular, the conformations of Her2 homo- and heterodimers remain obscure, and how these conformations relate to the dimerization affinities is uncertain. Moreover, the manner in which ligands binding to Her2’s heterodimerization partners regulate the conformations and stability of the heterodimers is poorly understood. Although various structural and electrostatic factors that may affect Her2 dimerization have been discussed in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), further structural elucidation is needed for a better molecular understanding of Her2 activation.</p><p>Crystal structures of the ectodomains of human EGFR-family receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemmon, 2009</xref>) provide a starting point for elucidation of the structural mechanisms of Her2 heterodimerization. In these structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), the ectodomains (each consisting of four domains numbered I, II, III, and IV) are found either as monomers or as symmetric homodimers with ligands bound to both dimer subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In the homodimer structures, domain II constitutes most of the ectodomain’s dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and its conformation is critical to ectodomain dimerization. A bent domain II is found in all ligand-free, inactive ectodomains of the EGFR-family receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), while a straight domain II is associated with the (ligand-bound) active dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The domain II of Her2 appears to be constitutively bent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garrett et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franklin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>), which is consistent with its poor homodimerization. Unfortunately, no crystal structure is available for human EGFR family heterodimers with only a single ligand bound, as is the case for Her2 heterodimers.</p><p>Intriguingly, recent crystal structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR (dEGFR) ectodomains reveal asymmetric dimers that bear only one fully formed ligand binding site, with the other partially closed, regardless of whether one or both subunits are ligand-bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>). These dEGFR structures hint at a possible structural mechanism for Her2 heterodimerization, but translating the dEGFR results to human Her2 is difficult due to differences between these receptors. First, dEGFR dimers assume an asymmetric conformation even when ligands are bound to both dimer subunits, whereas all existing human EGFR-family dimer structures exhibit a symmetric conformation. Second, the ectodomains of Her2 and other members of the human EGFR family each comprise four domains, whereas the dEGFR ectodomain includes a fifth domain, consisting of 166 residues immediately N-terminal to the transmembrane helix.</p><p>Here we investigate the dimerization of Her2 using molecular modeling and long-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We modeled and simulated the EGFR–Her2 and Her3–Her2 heterodimers as well as the Her2 homodimer. The heterodimers were found to be stable when a ligand was bound to the EGFR or Her3 subunit. Our simulations further showed that, when the single bound ligand was removed from a Her2 heterodimer, a substantial gap developed in the dimer interface. A similar gap was also observed in our simulation of the Her2 homodimer, which explains the weak homodimerization of Her2. Structural analysis shows that such a gap arises from the bending of the domain IIs in both subunits due to the absence of bound ligands. These observations are strikingly similar to the findings from the crystal structures of dEGFR homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>): the ligand-free, but not the ligand-bound, dEGFR dimer exhibits a gap in the dimer interface, which explains the reduced dEGFR dimerization in the absence of ligands. In agreement with the recent experimental data showing that a single bound ligand is sufficient to activate an EGFR dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), our simulations demonstrate that the activation mechanism of the receptors of the human EGFR family and of Her2 in particular conserves <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR’s capacity to form stable asymmetric ectodomain dimers upon the binding of a single ligand.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Simulations reproduce the gap in the interface of the dEGFR dimer</title><p>The general approach of this study was to use long-timescale MD simulations to infer from crystal structures of EGFR ectodomain dimers the structures of dimers with different constituent receptors or with different bound ligands. To examine the validity of this approach, we first applied it to dEGFR, for which the structures of both the ligand-bound and ligand-free ectodomain dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>) have been resolved. Our simulations correctly demonstrated that, once the ligands are removed from the ligand-bound structure, a substantial gap between the two subunits develops, leading to a reduced dimerization interface.</p><p>Unlike the symmetric human ‘2-ligand’ EGFR dimer (in which both subunits bear fully formed and occupied ligand binding sites; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the 2-ligand dEGFR dimer is asymmetric: although both ectodomain subunits are ligand-bound, only one bears a fully formed ligand binding site and a straight domain II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The ‘1-ligand’ dEGFR dimer (in which only one subunit is ligand-bound) is essentially identical to the 2-ligand dimer, except for the missing ligand. The gap between the two subunits is closed in both dEGFR dimers. Conversely, the ligand-free dEGFR dimer is symmetric, featuring a bent domain II in both subunits, and a gap in the dimer interface. We removed both ligands from the crystal structure of the 2-ligand dEGFR dimer (PDB entry 3LTF) and simulated the resulting system. In two independent simulations, a substantial gap emerged in the dimer interface, and the resulting conformation resembled that of ligand-free dEGFR crystal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows a significant reduction in the surface area buried within the dimer interface, consistent with the buried areas in the crystal structures of the ligand-free dEGFR dimers. We note that the dimer conformation drifted away from that of the ligand-free crystal structure after ∼2 µs. This reflected the high flexibility of the simulated dimer, likely a result of the truncation of the domain IVs in the resolved crystal structure from which the simulations were initiated and the lack of inter-subunit contact between the two domains. The fact that our dEGFR simulations were able to reproduce the gap in the dimer interface found in the crystal structures of ligand-free dEGFR dimers lends support to the approach we adopted for the analysis of Her2 dimerization.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00708.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Simulations reproduce the gap in the interface of the dEGFR ectodomain dimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The schematic shows the 2-ligand dEGFR ectodomain dimer on the left.

The dEGFR gap results in a reduced dimer interface area of ∼2300 Å<sup>2</sup>, compared to ∼3400 Å<sup>2</sup> in the 1- and 2-ligand dEGFR dimers, where the gap is closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This reduction of the dimer interface area is believed to account for the relatively weak dimerization affinity of the ligand-free dEGFR, which is ∼30 times lower than that of ligand-bound dEGFR. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that the reduction of the dimer interface is similarly observed in our simulations of the ligand-free EGFR–Her2 heterodimer and Her2 homodimer: when the gap is wide open, the surface area buried within the interface is ∼2600 Å<sup>2</sup>, compared to ∼3500 Å<sup>2</sup> in the ligand-bound heterodimer. We thus suggest that the same structural mechanism that weakens ligand-free dEGFR homodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2010</xref>) also disfavors ligand-free EGFR–Her2 dimerization and Her2 homodimerization. On the other hand, ligand binding in the EGFR subunit helps to keep domain II straight, which prevents the opening of the gap and stabilizes the dimer interface of EGFR–Her2 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This is reminiscent of the recent finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>) that one bound ligand is sufficient to activate an EGFR dimer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Her3–Her2 heterodimer</title><p>Among the dimerization partners of Her2, Her3 is particularly notable in that the Her3–Her2 heterodimers are potent signaling units, and in that the normal and pathogenic signaling through Her2 and Her3 relies strongly on Her3–Her2 dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baselga and Swain, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemmon, 2009</xref>). We thus studied the Her3–Her2 heterodimer in ways similar to our study of EGFR–Her2 heterodimers and the Her2 homodimer. We first modeled the Her3–Her2 heterodimer using the resolved crystal structure of the Her3 monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho and Leahy, 2002</xref>) and our model of the EGFR–Her2 heterodimer as templates (‘Materials and methods’).

After ∼4 µs of simulation the ligand was removed, and the resulting ligand-free heterodimer was then simulated again. Without the ligand, the Her3 subunit underwent conformational changes similar to those described above for the ligand-free EGFR subunit, including a bending of domain II. As a result, a gap again emerged in the dimer interface. In the first series of simulations the gap in the Her3–Her2 heterodimer was often partially closed, but re-opened repeatedly and resulted in a significant decrease in the buried surface area in the dimer interface. In the second series, the gap was steadily open once the ligand was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These observations suggest that Her3–Her2 heterodimerization, similar to that of EGFR–Her2, is promoted by the stabilization of the dimer interface following ligand binding.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00708.008</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Her3–Her2 heterodimer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Snapshots from the simulations of the Her3–Her2 heterodimer with (left) and without (right) HRG bound to Her3.

We found that the asymmetric dimers we examined—the EGFR–Her2 and Her3–Her2 heterodimers, the 1-ligand EGFR homodimer, and the 1- and 2-ligand dEGFR homodimers—all shared certain key atomic-level interactions between subunits. In particular, hydrogen bonds between Gln194 (in EGFR or Her3 numbering) of the ligand-bound subunit and Cys213 and His215 (in Her2 numbering; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) of the ligand-free subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) were particularly stable. The presence of these hydrogen bonds is consistent with the reported crystal structures of the dEGFR asymmetric dimers after a 180° χ<sub>2</sub> rotamer flip at the histidine (which would presumably be consistent with the same electron density). In contrast, these hydrogen bonds are not present in the crystal structure or in simulations of the symmetric 2-ligand EGFR dimer, and they are precluded by the gap in the dimer interface of all ligand-free dimers we examined (including the ligand-free dEGFR crystal structure and our simulations of ligand-free EGFR and Her2 homodimers and EGFR–Her2 heterodimers). Our observations suggest an important role for Gln194 of the ligand-bound subunit in stabilizing 1-ligand dimers. Notably, the glutamine residue is conserved in EGFR, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR, which bind ligands, but not in Her2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), which does not. Mutating Gln194 in EGFR and Her3 may thus hinder their heterodimerization with Her2, and mutating the corresponding residue (Gln189) in dEGFR may hinder its homodimerization.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00708.009</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Details of the dimer interfaces in Her2 heterodimers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The sequence alignments of EGFR, Her2, Her3, and dEGFR for the part of domain II corresponding to EGFR residues 167–286.

In particular, Arg228 of EGFR interacted stably with Glu243 of Her2 through a salt bridge in our simulations of the ligand-bound EGFR–Her2 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, Arg228 of Her3 interacted stably with the same glutamate through a water bridge in our simulations of the Her3–Her2 heterodimer. Although this arginine is present in both EGFR and Her3, it is not present in Her2, Her4, or dEGFR. Notably, EGFR and Her3 are the two common dimerization partners of Her2 in the EGFR family, and only Her2 bears a negatively charged residue at the position of the Glu243 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This is consistent with the notion that Her2 has been fine-tuned for heterodimerization with EGFR and Her3.</p><p>Experimentally, heterodimerization between Her2 and ligand-bound EGFR or Her3 ectodomains is much weaker than homodimerization of EGFR, Her4, or dEGFR ectodomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ferguson et al., 2000</xref>). Our simulations suggest that this difference in stability may be due to unique conformational dynamics in the dimerization arm of Her2. The dimerization arm plays a key role in maintaining dimer stability, and dimerization arm-mediated interactions are very similar in crystal structures of dEGFR and human EGFR dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarado et al., 2010</xref>). In our simulations, however, the dimerization arm of Her2 in the EGFR–Her2 dimer deviated significantly from its initial conformation in the course of the simulation, whereas the dimerization arms of EGFR and dEGFR in homodimers did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A cation–π interaction at the tip of the dimerization arm in the 1-ligand EGFR dimer between Tyr251 and Arg285 of the unliganded subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) appears to be particularly important in stabilizing the dimer. The residue at the position of Tyr251 is conserved as tyrosine or phenylalanine in dEGFR and all members of the human EGFR family. The residue at the position of Arg285 is conserved as arginine, except in Her2, where it is replaced by leucine (Leu291; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). It is tempting to suggest that this missing arginine in Her2 may explain its weak ectodomain heterodimerization compared to the homodimerization of dEGFR, EGFR, and Her4, and that an L291R mutation in Her2 may promote Her2 heterodimerization and facilitate the crystallization of a Her3–Her2 or EGFR–Her2 dimer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the implication of Her2 in disease and its central role in mediating cell signaling, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms regulating Her2 activation is of great importance. The long-timescale MD simulations reported here support the notion of a simple and evolutionarily conserved structural mechanism controls homo- and heterodimerization of Her2, and thereby Her2 activation. Our simulations revealed inherent instability in the dimer interfaces of the ligand-free EGFR–Her2 and Her3–Her2 heterodimers and the Her2 homodimer, and indicated that the binding of a single ligand is sufficient to stabilize the heterodimer interfaces. These observations complement the crystallographic analysis, shedding further light on the structural mechanism underlying the preference of Her2 to partner with a ligand-bound EGFR or Her3, rather than with Her2 or ligand-free EGFR or Her3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lemmon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graus-Porta et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nagy, et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our simulations showed the conformation of domain II, which is determined by ligand binding, to be critical to the stability of the dimer interface. A ligand bound to EGFR (or to another member of the family) acts as a wedge that pushes domains I and III apart, straightening the otherwise bent domain II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2009</xref>). (Domain II is bent in the crystal structures of ligand-free EGFR, Her2, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR.) We simulated the transition from the straight to the bent conformation of domain II upon removal of the bound ligand in EGFR and Her3 and the consequent development of the gap in the dimer interface. Our simulations suggest that, for the gap to open, both domain IIs of the two subunits in a dimer need to adopt a bent conformation.</p><p>One feature unique to the dimerization and activation of receptors of the EGFR family (Her2 included), but not to other families of receptor tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>), is that the dimer interface is mediated by the receptors and does not involve any direct contribution from the bound ligands. Instead of directly participating in the dimerization, a bound ligand regulates the conformation of domain II and potentiates it for dimerization. In this context, it is not surprising that the seemingly minor effect of ligand binding on the conformation of domain II in the heterodimerization partners of Her2 demonstrated by our simulations is of great importance to the regulation of Her2 activity. Our consistent observation of the gap that disrupts the dimer interfaces in the ligand-free EGFR–Her2 and Her3–Her2 heterodimers, and in Her2 and dEGFR homodimers, as well as the fact that domain II is bent in crystal structures of ligand-free EGFR, Her2, Her3, Her4, and dEGFR, suggests that the structural mechanism for the control of dimerization has been preserved from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to the human EGFR family.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Modeling of dimers</title><p>Because EGFR, Her2, and Her3 are closely related phylogenetically and share a high degree of sequence identity, we used the EGFR ectodomain homodimer as a structural template for the modeling of the Her2 ectodomain homodimer and the EGFR–Her2 and Her3–Her2 ectodomain heterodimers. The sequence identity between the ectodomains of EGFR and Her2 is 40%, while that between the ectodomains of EGFR and Her3 is 41%. In the structural alignments for the modeling, we used the region corresponding to EGFR residues 240–309, since this is the part of domain II that appears to be essential for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dawson et al., 2005</xref>), and since in our simulations of EGFR the N-terminal portion of domain II exhibited bending around the hinge situated approximately at residue 240 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Specifically, Her3 residues 166–188, 189–238, and 239–307 were separately aligned with their EGFR counterparts. The residues at the borders between the parts of Her3 that were aligned as rigid bodies were then adjusted to ensure appropriate connectivity; a few minor clashes between the domains of Her3 and between Her3 and Her2 were eliminated by adjusting amino acid side chains.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Axel Brunger, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General assessment:</p><p>The mechanism of Her2 activation and signaling is of considerable importance considering its role in human disease (including cancer) and as a drug target. The available biochemical data suggest that the activation process upon ligand binding requires formation of a heterodimer consisting of Her2 and Her3. Her2 lacks ligand binding (or binding is weak), whereas Her3 does not have significant kinase activity. Thus, it is only upon hetero-dimerization that ligand binding can initiate kinase activity. Yet, structural studies by x-ray crystallography of the human EGFR-family receptors ectodomains showed only symmetric dimers with ligands bound in both monomers. Intriguingly, crystal structures of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR ectodomains showed asymmetric dimers with only one ligand bound. The question, however, was if the <italic>Drosophila</italic> crystal structures are representative, what is going on for the human EGFR receptors as well. This work now suggests that this is indeed the case: starting from the crystal structures of the human Her2 homodimer as well as the Her2-Her3 heterodimer, long-timescale (microsecond) molecular dynamics simulations were performed. The simulations were first successfully tested starting from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heterodimer structures.</p><p>Highlight:</p><p>The simulations show that a model of the human Her2 homodimer is not stable, but, rather, that the dimer interface opens to produce a large gap. In contrast, a model of the Her2-Her3 heterodimer with one bound ligand was stable. This work thus suggests that the asymmetric <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR ectodomain crystal structures indeed represent the norm, rather than the exception.</p><p>While this is an important finding, the simulations should allow the authors to draw some mechanistic conclusions about how the conformational changes within the various dimers occur and how the different interfaces are stabilized. Such additional mechanistic insights would also illustrate the power of their long-time simulations and considerably strengthen this work.</p><p>Required revisions:</p><p>1) By taking the richness of the MD simulations and reducing them to cartoons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3A, 4, and 5</xref>, the authors do not go much beyond simply confirming conclusions already drawn from the studies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR. Surely the purpose of simulations such as those described here is to generate informative models that make experimentally testable predictions? In the crystallographic studies of dEGFR, identification of residues involved in interactions across the asymmetric dimer interface was informative. The nature of this new interface is crucial for understanding the fly receptor, but here the authors unfortunately give no details for the analogous interfaces in the human heterodimers studied. This omission deprives those in this field of the most useful information to be gleaned from the simulations presented. Are the interfaces (e.g., at the top of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) similar to those seen in dEGFR? Do they involve conserved residues?</p><p>2) The “structural explanation for the preference of Her2 to partner with a ligand-bound EGFR or Her3, rather than with Her2 or ligand-free EGFR or Her3” is not really a result of this paper. Quite frankly, this was already clear from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> work. What the present (excellent) study does add to this, though, is the potential of a detailed view – yet the authors disappointingly describe no details that can be used for designing experiments. The brief discussion does not suffice and key areas of contact are omitted from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. Are there key residues in the domain II interface in the asymmetric hEGFR dimer (outside the region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) that are well conserved? Can predictions be made for mutations that might selectively destabilize the asymmetric hEGFR dimer but not the symmetric 2-ligand dimer? These would be useful outcomes of the modeling studies and analysis of these questions are likely to yield valuable insight in and of itself.</p><p>3) Why are heterodimers formed between the EGFR and Her2 (or Her2 and Her3) ectodomains so much weaker than EGFR-EGFR ectodomain homodimers? This is a clear experimental result in the literature. In fact, EGFR-Her2 ectodomain heterodimers have not yet been directly observed, following ligand binding, although there are hints from biophysical studies that weak Her2-Her3 ectdomain dimers may form (this varies from study to study). By contrast, EGFR and dEGFR ectodomain dimers are strong (at least 50-fold stronger). The simulations might address the question of different dimerization strengths. By ignoring the well-established affinity differences – when taken at face value – the presentation in this work is a little misleading. For example, what do the authors mean by suggesting that the Her3-Her2 heterodimers are particularly robust? If they mean that the affinity of Her3 for Her2 is particularly strong, they are not correct – there is no evidence for this. Evidence for heterodimer formation is qualitative at best, and the only quantitative data show that EGFR-EGFR homodimers and Her4-Her4 homodimers are much “tighter” than any homodimer, at least where ectodomains are concerned. Analysis and description of the dimer interfaces could provide insight into this issue too.</p><p>4) Although this manuscript is well-written and beautifully illustrated, it is spoiled by its logical framework. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the symmetrical human EGFR (hEGFR) dimer. It also shows tethered and untethered forms of the monomer, but specifically does not address them. If these are not addressed, why illustrate them. The fact that Her2 without a ligand looks superficially like hEGFR with a ligand makes one want to assume that this is how Her2 works. Also, it should be made clearer (e.g., in the figure caption) which specific crystal structures of which domains and homo or heterodimers have been determined, along with their PDB IDs.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the symmetric <italic>Drosophila</italic> EGFR (dEGFR) dimer, the logical counter-part of the symmetric human EGFR dimer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It also shows the effect of a simulation on dEGFR without both its ligands. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows a simulation of hEGFR without one its ligands. It seems that both the human and <italic>Drosophila</italic> x-ray structures should be introduced together so as to emphasize their different symmetries.</p><p>6) The results of parallel simulations in both hEGFR and dEGFR need to be shown. This may require additional work as hEGFR has been simulated without one ligand whereas dEGFR has been simulated without both ligands.</p><p>7) The results of the MD simulations seem reproducible in that two independent several-micro-second simulations give similar results for this huge system with almost 300,000 atoms. This remarkable result could be emphasized more explicitly by comparison of the final structures of the respective pairs of simulations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00708.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The simulations show that a model of the human Her2 homodimer is not stable, but, rather, that the dimer interface opens to produce a large gap.

In particular, we report residue-specific details of the interfaces of asymmetric EGFR family dimers in the new sub-section of the Results and the new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Based on the conformational dynamics of the dimer interfaces, we determined that the interactions of Gln194 (EGFR numbering) with Cys213 and His215 (Her2 numbering), which are stable in our simulations of the 1-ligand EGFR homodimer and the Her2 heterodimers with ligand-bound EGFR or Her3, are critical to the stability of these asymmetric dimers. These interactions are also formed in the crystal structures of the asymmetric dEGFR dimers. We have added a discussion of these interactions, and of the conservation of the residues involved, to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The “structural explanation for the preference of Her2 to partner with a ligand-bound EGFR or Her3, rather than with Her2 or ligand-free EGFR or Her3” is not really a result of this paper.

These would be useful outcomes of the modeling studies and analysis of these questions are likely to yield valuable insight in and of itself</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the overall structural mechanism of Her2 dimerization may largely be inferred from the structures of the dEGFR dimers, and that much of the value of our work lies in its potential to provide a detailed view of the relevant dimer interfaces. As the reviewers suggested, we have thus revised the manuscript to place more emphasis on the atomic details of our Her2 heterodimer models, with a particular focus on the dimer interfaces. We have also revised the relevant high-level statements in the manuscript to reflect this understanding. The new version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> presents important details of the interactions between the N-terminal regions of the domain IIs in the asymmetric dimers, in addition to the interactions around the “dimerization arms”. Because the interactions centered on Gln194 (EGFR numbering) are stable in the asymmetric EGFR family dimers but not in their symmetric counterparts, we suggest in the revised manuscript that mutation of this residue would destabilize the former more than the latter dimers. Additionally, we have now highlighted the salt bridge between Arg228 (EGFR numbering) and Glu243 (Her2 numbering), which is likely important to the stability of the Her2 dimers. In the revised manuscript we further suggest that mutating Arg228 may hinder the heterodimerization of EGFR and Her3 with Her2, but not the homodimerization.</p><p><italic>3) Why are heterodimers formed between the EGFR and Her2 (or Her2 and Her3) ectodomains so much weaker than EGFR-EGFR ectodomain homodimers? This is a clear experimental result in the literature. In fact, EGFR-Her2 ectodomain heterodimers have not yet been directly observed, following ligand binding, although there are hints from biophysical studies that weak Her2-Her3 ectdomain dimers may form (this varies from study to study). By contrast, EGFR and dEGFR ectodomain dimers are strong (at least 50-fold stronger). The simulations might address the question of different dimerization strengths.

For example, what do the authors mean by suggesting that the Her3-Her2 heterodimers are particularly robust? If they mean that the affinity of Her3 for Her2 is particularly strong, they are not correct – there is no evidence for this. Evidence for heterodimer formation is qualitative at best, and the only quantitative data show that EGFR-EGFR homodimers and Her4-Her4 homodimers are much “tighter” than any homodimer, at least where ectodomains are concerned. Analysis and description of the dimer interfaces could provide insight into this issue too</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers are correct that there is no evidence indicating that the affinity of Her3 for Her2 is particularly strong. We have revised the sentence of the original manuscript that appeared to suggest otherwise, and we have clarified the point we intended to convey, which was the functional importance of full-length Her3–Her2 heterodimers.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have also attempted to address the reviewers’ question of why ectodomain heterodimerization of Her2 and Her3 is weaker than ectodomain homodimerization of dEGFR, EGFR, and Her4. To elucidate the structural basis for the different dimerization strengths, we re-examined the interactions at the dimerization interfaces. In the revised manuscript, we now identify variance at key residues that may explain the strength of dEGFR and human EGFR homodimers relative to Her2 heterodimers. Specifically, we suggest that a cation–π interaction between Tyr251 and Arg285 (EGFR numbering) in the homodimers may be key to the stabilization of the dimerization arms in the dimer interfaces. Furthermore, we suggest that the replacement of the arginine in Her2 by a leucine, which distinguishes it from dEGFR and the other members of the EGFR family, may explain the weak ectodomain heterodimerization of Her2 ectodomains relative to the homodimerization of dEGFR and human EGFR ectodomains. We further speculate that the L291R Her2 mutation, which may stabilize Her2 heterodimers with EGFR and Her3, may facilitate crystallization of Her2–Her3 and Her2–EGFR dimers.</p><p><italic>4) Although this manuscript is well-written and beautifully illustrated, it is spoiled by its logical framework. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the symmetrical human EGFR (hEGFR) dimer. It also shows tethered and untethered forms of the monomer, but specifically does not address them. If these are not addressed, why illustrate them. The fact that Her2 without a ligand looks superficially like hEGFR with a ligand make one want to assume that this is how Her2 works. Also, it should be made clearer (e.g., in the figure caption) which specific crystal structures of which domains and homo or heterodimers have been determined, along with their PDB IDs</italic>.</p><p>As suggested, we have removed the tethered conformation from the figures and specified which crystal structures the cartoon diagrams represent by including their PDB IDs. We have also attempted to improve the manuscript’s logical framework by presenting the dEGFR dimer together with the symmetric EGFR dimer in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, as described below in our response to reviewer comment 5.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the symmetric</italic> Drosophila <italic>EGFR (dEGFR) dimer, the logical counter-part of the symmetric human EGFR dimer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

At the end of the Methods section in the revised manuscript, we now report that the average structures observed in three simulations of the 1-ligand EGFR homodimer differ by 1.9–4.8 Å in terms of the RMSD of the Cα atoms, which is comparable to the Cα RMSD between the two available crystal structures of the 2-ligand EGFR dimer (4.0 Å). This comparison differs only slightly from the one the reviewers suggested in that the average, rather than the final, conformation of each simulation is used, in light of the fact that the average conformation of a simulation generally represents the ensemble of conformations sampled by the simulation better than the final one.</p></body></sub-article></article>
