Prolonged stress responses induce maladaptive cellular, circuit, and systems-level changes that can lead to pathological brain states and corresponding disorders in which mood and memory are affected. However, it is unclear if repeated activation of cells processing negative memories induces similar phenotypes in mice. In this study, we used an activity-dependent tagging method to access neuronal ensembles and assess their molecular characteristics. Sequencing memory engrams in mice revealed that positive (male-to-female exposure) and negative (foot shock) cells upregulated genes linked to anti- and pro-inflammatory responses, respectively. To investigate the impact of persistent activation of negative engrams, we chemogenetically activated them in the ventral hippocampus over 3 months and conducted anxiety and memory-related tests. Negative engram activation increased anxiety behaviors in both 6- and 14-month-old mice, reduced spatial working memory in older mice, impaired fear extinction in younger mice, and heightened fear generalization in both age groups. Immunohistochemistry revealed changes in microglial and astrocytic structure and number in the hippocampus. In summary, repeated activation of negative memories induces lasting cellular and behavioral abnormalities in mice, offering insights into the negative effects of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors on human health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>engram</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Transformative Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018128</institution-id><institution>Ludwig Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suthard</surname><given-names>Rebecca L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000181</institution-id><institution>Air Force Office of Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA9550-21-1-0310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pew Scholars Program in Biomedical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Systems Neuroscience and Neurophotonics Center at Boston University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>Nationai Institutes of Health Early Independence Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP5 OD023106-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Steve</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repeatedly activating negative memory-bearing cells produces cellular and behavioral abnormalities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stress has profound impacts on both physical and mental health. In particular, chronic stress is recognized as a potent risk factor for numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In humans, repeated negative thinking can parallel the effects of chronic stress. These effects include hippocampal hyperactivity and accelerating the onset of mild cognitive impairment and dementias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marchant et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, the ability of memories to influence cognition and behavior has been well established. For example, our lab previously demonstrated that reactivating ensembles of hippocampal neurons encoding a positive memory is sufficient to induce anti-depressant effects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>), and studies in rodents have shown that repeated reactivation of negative memories enhances fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether modulating a chronic negative memory is sufficient to induce aberrant cellular and behavioral states that recapitulate chronic stress.</p><p>The ventral hippocampus (vHPC), specifically vCA1, has been extensively studied for its role in emotional processing. As a modulator of stress responses, vCA1 dysfunction is intimately associated with pathological affective states (Fanselow and Dong, 2010), and its structure and function are heavily impacted by stressors. Additionally, vCA1 neurons project to various downstream targets and route target-specific streams of information to the basolateral amygdala, nucleus accumbens, and prefrontal cortex. These diverse connections are integral to the formation of emotional memory, as well as regulating anxiety and the stress response. Within vCA1, stimulation of negative engram cells has been shown to modulate social avoidance behavior and enhance fear responses, but whether chronic stimulation of fearful memories produces enduring effects on brain activity and behavior remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Young and old individuals are differentially susceptible to the hippocampal effects of stress and chronic negative thinking behaviors. Epidemiological population-based studies in humans have established adverse childhood experiences as a risk factor for the development of psychopathologies later in life. Notably, the development of depression and PTSD may increase with the number of these adverse events, suggesting an increased susceptibility of the developing, young brain to the perturbations induced by such events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McLaughlin et al., 2010</xref>). However, work in older humans and rodents has shown that there are changes in their stress response and cortisol levels following adverse experiences. Aged rodents have increased stress vulnerability, as repeated stress increased anxiety-like behaviors, induced spatial memory impairments, and raised corticosterone levels more compared to younger animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we chronically reactivated negative memory engrams to mimic the effects of stress or chronic negative thinking-related behaviors in mice. We first characterized the genetic landscape of negative and positive memory engrams to search for putative genetic markers involved in healthy and dysfunctional brain states. We then tested whether stimulating negative memory-bearing neurons would be sufficient to induce cellular abnormalities as well as behavioral impairments in young (6 months) and aged (14 months) mice. Our manipulation induced behavioral abnormalities that manifested as increased anxiety, decreased spatial working memory, and increased fear response during extinction and generalization. We also observed cellular alterations, including changes in the number and morphology of microglia and astrocytes. Together, our data suggest that negative memory engrams are a potent means by which to induce cellular and behavioral changes that provide insight into pathological states.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ventral hippocampal negative and positive engram cells differentially express genes associated with inflammation</title><p>The vHPC parses out negative and positive memories into anatomically segregated, functionally distinct, and molecularly diverse neuronal ensembles or ‘engrams’ that have unique transcriptional profiles and DNA methylation landscapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shpokayte et al., 2022</xref>). As positive and negative memories have been respectively implicated in driving approach and avoidance-related behaviors in mice, we first sought to test if these two vHPC engrams differentially upregulated genes in response to each experience. We previously performed an RNA-seq experiment described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shpokayte et al., 2022</xref>. Briefly, we utilized an activity-dependent labeling technique to visualize and manipulate the cells processing a specific memory in the hippocampus by leveraging the cFos protein as an indicator of neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Our approach combines a doxycycline (DOX)-dependent strategy with a dual-viruses approach consisting of AAV9-c-fos-tTA+AAV9-TRE-ChR2-eYFP or control AAV9-TRE-eYFP, 24 hr prior to a behavioral experience, DOX is removed from the animal’s diet which will allow tTa to bind to TRE and drive the expression of any downstream effector, such as the fluorescent protein eYFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). After the behavioral experience, that is, contextual fear conditioning (CFC) or male-to-female exposure, the animal is placed back on DOX to close the tagging window for the negative or positive experience. Thus, the cells involved in processing a discrete experience express the eYFP protein that can be used in fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate only the eYFP+ as ‘tagged’ engram cells for genetic sequencing. To analyze this RNA-seq dataset, we selected specific gene sets and conducted Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to compare the up- and downregulation of these genes in positive or negative engram cells. The GSEA showed that the anti-inflammatory gene set was enriched in positive engram cells, with higher expression compared to negative engram cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). Further, the pro-inflammatory gene set was enriched in negative engram cells, with higher expression compared to positive engram cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e and f</xref>). Interestingly, this gene set included <italic>Spp1</italic>, <italic>Ttr</italic>, and <italic>C1qb1</italic>, which are involved in inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. Together, these data provide the start to uncovering the molecular landscape that positive and negative memory-bearing cells may contain that links them to protective or pathological functioning, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) of RNA-sequencing data of positive and negative ventral hippocampus (vHPC) engram upregulate genes associated with neuroprotective and neurodegeneration, respectively.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) C57BL/6J mice were bilaterally injected with a 1:1 viral cocktail of AAV9-c-Fos-tTA and AAV9-TRE-eYFP into the vHPC.

This system couples the <italic>cfos</italic> promoter to the expression of the tetracycline transactivator (tTA), which binds to the tetracycline response element (TRE) in its protein form.

Prior to surgery, mice were placed on a Dox diet to inhibit the labeling of active neurons.

On day 10 after viral expression and recovery, the mice were taken off of Dox prior to engram tagging to open the labeling window. On day 11, mice were subjected to contextual fear conditioning (CFC) or male-to-female interaction to label negative or positive neurons, respectively. Mice were placed immediately back on Dox to close this tagging window. Then, 24 hr later, mice were sacrificed and brains were obtained for sequencing experiments.

To further understand the impact of negative engram cells, we next asked if chronic stimulation of a negative engram could induce behavioral changes in anxiety and memory-related tasks. To that end, we combined excitatory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) with a Fos-based transgenic mouse, Fos-tm2.1(iCre-ERT2) raised on a C57BL/6 background (TRAP2), to label active cells under the control of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">DeNardo et al., 2019</xref>). Then, 3- and 11-month-old TRAP2 mice were bilaterally injected with a Cre-dependent AAV-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry or control AAV-DIO-mCherry into the vHPC. After 2 weeks for viral expression and surgical recovery, all mice were subjected to CFC, consisting of four, 1.5 mA foot shocks in context A (Cxt A). Also, 30 min after CFC, mice received a 40 mg/kg injection of 4-OHT to label cells sufficiently active during this fearful experience (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>). The animals were returned to their home cages, where they received water-soluble deschloroclozapine dihydrochloride (DCZ), a highly potent, selective, and brain-penetrable muscarinic hM3D(Gq) actuator, for 3 months in their daily water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>). DCZ was selected because even at very low concentrations this ligand is able to increase neuronal activity with binding to hM3D(Gq) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagai et al., 2020</xref>). To avoid unnecessary pain or stress to the animal with chronic administration of DCZ intraperitoneally (IP), we selected the voluntary oral route (PO), which has been utilized in the past for chemogenetic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhan et al., 2019</xref>) and shows no significant differences in behavior at the same dose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferrari et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental timeline for chronic modulation of a negative engram in TRAP2 mice.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of tagging a negative engram in young (3 months) and old (11 months) TRAP2 mice followed by 3 months of chronic engram stimulation and a battery of behavioral tests.

Ultimately, our observations from open field and zero maze support the hypothesis that chronic activation of a negative memory is sufficient to increase anxiety-like behaviors.</p><p>The mice also underwent y-maze testing in order to test the hypothesis that chronic activation of a negative memory is sufficient to impair spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In this task, mice were required to remember the most recent arm of the maze that was explored and subsequently navigate to a ‘novel’ arm. Mice freely explored the three arms of the maze (A, B, C) and spatial working memory was assessed by measuring the percentage of spontaneous alternations (i.e., ABC, CBA, CAB), or three consecutive entrances to a novel arm without repetition. A lower percentage of spontaneous alternations indicates a deficit in spatial working memory as they cannot recognize what arm they were in just moments prior. We observed a higher percentage of spontaneous alterations in 14-month-old mCherry than 14-month-old hM3Dq mice (two-way ANOVA); interaction: F(1,40) = 4.088, p=0.0499; age: F(1,40) = 0.3080, p=0.5820; group: F(1,40) = 7.517, p=0.0091; Tukey’s [group]: 14MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.0045 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3cii</xref>). However, no significant difference in the percentage of spontaneous alterations was observed between 6-month-old mCherry and hM3Dq mice (Tukey’s [group]: 6MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.9634) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3cii</xref>). Additionally, we observed no significant differences in the total distance traveled or total number of entries across all groups (two-way ANOVA; [total distance traveled] interaction: F(1,44) = 0.2668, p=0.6081; age: F(1,44) = 0.5106, p=0.4787; group: F(1,44) = 1.181, p=0.2831; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3ci</xref>).

Therefore, our observations suggest an inability of the mice to remember which arms of the y-maze they previously explored and may represent an impairment in working memory in the 14-month cohort.</p><p>Finally, mice had a ‘negative’ engram tagged in a fearful CxtA before the initiation of chronic activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). During this CFC session, mCherry and hM3Dq mice in the 3- and 11-month groups displayed no differences in freezing behavior, as expected (two-way ANOVA; interaction: F(1,42) = 0.1342, p=0.7150; age: F(1,42) = 12.20, p=0.0011; group: F(1,42) = 2.913, p=0.0953) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ai–ii</xref>). However, to test the hypothesis that chronic negative engram activation is sufficient to induce impaired fear memory recall and extinction, mice were subjected to remote memory recall after 3 months of treatment. The only significant difference in remote recall behavior was an increase in freezing between 6- and 14-month mCherry mice (two-way ANOVA; interaction: F(1,41) = 2.531, p=0.1193; age: F(1,41) = 10.08, p=0.0028; group: F(1,41) = 6.406, p=0.0153; Tukey’s [age]: 6 vs. 14MO mCherry, p=0.0101; 6 vs. 14MO hM3Dq, p=0.6672.

Mice typically display increased freezing behavior as they age, so these effects during remote recall are expected. For the extinction session in the same context, there were no significant differences across all groups at 6 and 14 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4ci–ii</xref>). However, we observed a strong trend showing an increase in freezing in the 6-month-old hM3Dq mice that was like remote recall (two-way ANOVA; interaction: F(1,41) = 2.618, p=0.1133; age: F(1,41) = 2.335, p=0.1342; group: F(1,41) = 5.763, p=0.0210; Tukey’s [group]: 6MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.0590; 14MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.9269) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4di–ii</xref>). This may suggest that these mice are displaying an increase in fear during remote recall of a fearful experience from 3 months prior and have difficulty appropriately decreasing levels of fear during extinction. Finally, mice were placed in a neutral, novel context B at this remote time point after chronic activation to test for generalization of fear. In this context B, mice in the hM3Dq groups at both 6 and 14 months of age displayed increased freezing in a neutral context compared to mCherry controls (two-way ANOVA; Iinteraction: F(1,41) = 0.09801, p=0.7558; age: F(1,41) = 2.624, p=0.1129; group: F(1,41) = 26.53, p&lt;0.0001; Tukey’s [group]: 6MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.0053; 14MO mCherry vs. hM3Dq, p=0.0026) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g and h</xref>).

This stimulation protocol induced detrimental behavioral effects as evidenced by increased anxiety-like behaviors, decreased working memory, and increased fear responses across extinction and generalization. Notably, our chronic negative engram activation significantly impacted microglial and astrocytic number and morphology within the hippocampus. Together, these findings present evidence for the role of negative memories in producing maladaptive cellular and behavioral responses within a rodent model and further our understanding of the broad impacts of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors that may detrimentally affect human health.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Molecular features of engram cells</title><p>First, to characterize the molecular features of engram cells, we performed RNA-sequencing and utilized GSEA to compare gene expression profiles in cells that were labeled during a positive or negative experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rao-Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fuentes-Ramos et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sardoo et al., 2022</xref>). Using a priori gene sets of interest, we found that negative engram cells upregulated genes that were associated with pathways involved in neurodegeneration, proinflammatory processes, and apoptosis. In contrast, positive engram cells upregulated genes involved in neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory processes. Notable genes that were significantly upregulated in the negative engram cells were secreted phosphoprotein 1 (<italic>Spp1</italic>) and transthyretin (<italic>Ttr</italic>). SPP1, also known as osteopontin, is an extracellular matrix protein widely expressed in immune cells, such as macrophages and microglia, mediating inflammatory responses. Blocking SPP1 protein expression in cells within the hippocampus has been shown to attenuate inflammation-induced depressive-like behaviors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2023</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Spp1</italic> gene is consistently upregulated after chronic social stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stankiewicz et al., 2015</xref>), recall of contextual fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2012</xref>), and in rats with increased trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Díaz-Morán et al., 2013</xref>). Mice receiving chronic negative memory stimulation in our study displayed similar increases in anxiety-like behaviors and impairments in fear responses. Further, TTR is a serum transporter for thyroid hormones and retinol binding proteins that has been shown to be detrimental when misfolded and aggregated in various forms of amyloidosis, while also having evidence of protective effects in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxbaum et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sharma et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, TTR mRNA and protein were increased in both male and female rats that underwent acute or chronic stress, emphasizing the potential impact of glucocorticoid hormones on TTR protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinho et al., 2012</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that genes upregulated in negative engram cells are linked to stress-induced changes in anxiety, fear, and depressive-like behaviors.</p><p>Strikingly, negative engram cells also significantly upregulated amyloid precursor protein (<italic>App</italic>) and apolipoprotein E (<italic>Apoe</italic>) genes. APP plays a central role in AD pathology through generation of amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>Apoe</italic> genotype accounts for the majority of AD risk and pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schuff et al., 2009</xref>), with the E4 isotype accounting for as much as 50% of AD in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raber et al., 2004</xref>). The upregulation of these genes involved in neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation is in line with human research showing a link between repetitive negative thinking and increased risk of cognitive decline and vulnerability to dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schlosser et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, negative engram cells downregulated neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory genes, notably brain-derived neurotrophic factor (<italic>Bdnf</italic>). BDNF is a key molecule involved in memory in the healthy and pathological brain. Interventions such as exercise and antidepressant treatments enhance the expression of BDNF protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miranda et al., 2019</xref>). Future studies may further investigate the neuroprotective role of positive engrams to test, for instance, if activating a positive engram in a mouse model of AD confers protective effects on the brain and slows the progression of disease. Indeed, evidence of positive memory impact on mice with a depression-like phenotype has already shown promising results in this area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these genetic data begin to uncover the molecular landscape that differentiates positive and negative memory-bearing cells, linking them to either protective or pathological brain states, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Chronic stimulation of engrams alter behavior and cellular responses</title><p>Chronic modulation of engram cells in rodents has differential effects of behavior, depending on the brain region and valence of the tagged neurons.

Further, chronic stimulation of dorsal or ventral hippocampal fear engrams produced a context-specific reduction or enhancement of fear responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, chronic optogenetic activation of dorsal hippocampal fear engrams results in context-specific reduction in fear expression that resembles extinction, even in mice with impaired extinction due to ethanol withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cincotta et al., 2021</xref>). Activation of negative engram cells labeled during chronic social defeat stress induced social avoidance, a behavior common in human patients with MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that activity-dependent modulation of hippocampal cells over prolonged periods of time is sufficient to modify behavioral responses and brain states in mice.</p><p>Engram studies have predominantly focused on the neuronal phenotypes resulting from activity-dependent manipulations; however, glial cell responses to chronic memory activation and subsequent behavioral changes are unknown. Microglia are the brain’s resident immune cells, actively surveying the environment to maintain homeostasis and protect against insult and disease. Under normal conditions, microglial cells display small cell bodies and fine, highly ramified processes that allow them to detect and respond to threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nimmerjahn et al., 2005</xref>). Once a threat is detected (i.e., pathogens, debris, injury), microglia retract and exhibit large soma size and thickening, entering an ‘ameboid’ state. Evidence has accumulated that microglial morphology may be more complex than this dichotomy between ‘surveying’ and ‘ameboid’ microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vidal-Itriago et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leyh et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reddaway et al., 2023</xref>). Our chronic negative engram activation may induce an ‘insult’ on the brain, as evidenced by an increase in Iba1 expression and hyper-ramified morphology, indicating a complex change in microglial phenotype. In support of these findings, chronic stress similarly induced an increase in Iba1 expression and hyper-ramified microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that was correlated with impaired spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinwood et al., 2013</xref>). Further supporting these findings, a mouse model of PTSD displayed a similar increase in Iba1+ and hyper-ramified microglial cells in the PFC and CA1 layer of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Together, the changes in microglial cell number and morphology observed in the context of chronic negative engram stimulation are reminiscent of the alterations seen in chronic stress, PTSD, and related depression-like behaviors.</p><p>Further, astrocytes express glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a critical intermediate filament responsible for maintaining their cytoskeletal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang and Wang, 2015</xref>). Chronic restraint stress has been associated with static GFAP+ astrocytic number and atrophy of astrocytic processes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and retrosplenial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kassem et al., 2013</xref>). Studies have primarily shown a decrease in GFAP+ astrocyte numbers and atrophy in rodent brains subjected to chronic and acute stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tynan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banasr and Duman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gosselin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miguel-Hidalgo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Codeluppi et al., 2021</xref>). However, recent studies have found a variety of changes in astrocytic morphology and number depending on the type of stressor and brain region. Conversely, others report an increase in GFAP+ cells in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jang et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, unpredictable chronic mild stress substantially increased GFAP immunoreactivity and promoted a more branched, reactive morphology in the hippocampus, which was correlated with increases in anxiety and anhedonic-like behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du Preez et al., 2021</xref>). This observed phenotype was coupled with similar changes in Iba1+ microglia, featuring increased branching complexity and ramification, longer processes, and increased volume of occupation, as discussed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Du Preez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hinwood et al., 2013</xref>). In the case of humans, the discourse on glial changes in chronic stress and depression-like behaviors has been similarly complex. GFAP concentrations in the cerebellum, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex have been reported to decrease in patients with major depression compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fatemi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Si et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Webster et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobb et al., 2016</xref>). However, a recent study found increased GFAP concentrations in the cerebral spinal fluid of patients with major depression compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Michel et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings that astrocytes increase in number and branch length in the hippocampus after chronic negative memory stimulation mirror the impacts of chronic stress on glial morphology. Further research is needed to understand these nuanced changes across brain regions, animal models, and type of stressors and influence on behavior.</p><p>Our previous work demonstrated that global chronic activation of vHPC excitatory neurons or astrocytes for three months was sufficient to induce a variety of behavioral and cellular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Suthard et al., 2023</xref>). In the current study, we modulated hippocampal cells in an activity-dependent manner, gaining access to the specific impact of chronic negative memory activation on behavioral and cellular responses. Collectively, our data show a similar impact of CaMKII+ neuron and negative fear memory activation on fear extinction behaviors – namely, an increase in freezing responses. However, GFAP+ astrocyte activation induced a mild decrease in anxiety-related behaviors in the open field, while our negative memory activation significantly increased anxiety. Histologically, our previous work had mild impacts on glial number and morphology with non-memory-specific neuron or astrocyte chronic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Suthard et al., 2023</xref>). The current study demonstrates a much more potent increase in both microglia and astrocyte number, as well as robust changes in morphological characteristics like ramification index, cell territory volume, and branch lengths, which underscore the efficacy of chronic negative engram stimulation. A concern, however, is that activation of vHPC neurons could induce local tissue pathology as evidenced by inflammation and glial response. As this previous work activated all CaMKII+ neurons in vHPC and induced very modest changes in glial cells, we expect that in the current work, stimulating a smaller ensemble of cells would induce less of such ‘off-target’ inflammation. Together, these findings highlight the differences between modulating cells in a cell-type-specific or activity-dependent manner (e.g., vHPC neurons or negative engram cells) and the resulting phenotypes that emerge.</p><p>Previous work from our lab and others has shown that there are differential effects of chronic activation of negative, positive, and neutral ensembles within the hippocampus. As discussed earlier, chronic reactivation of a positive valence engram was sufficient to reverse the effects of stress on depression-like behaviors, whereas modulating a neutral ensemble did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramirez et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we speculate that chronic activation of a positive engram in healthy, unstressed mice may produce behavioral outcomes similar to those effects seen in chronic environmental enrichment, with improved cognitive flexibility, memory, and even enhanced levels of anti-inflammatory proteins like BDNF (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bayne, 2018</xref> for review). We further speculate that unlike neutral or negative memories, chronic stimulation of a positive memory may provide prophylactic effects against stress, degeneration, and aging, though this work remains an opportunity for future experiments. Other studies utilizing repeated negative memory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cincotta et al., 2021</xref>) showed content- and context-specific effects, such as bi-directional control over the strength of a fear memory in healthy and addiction-related states, with no changes observed in a neutral control group. Although our experiments here do not compare the effects of positive or neutral memory stimulation directly but rather compare a negative memory group to a fluorophore-only control, which is therefore a current limitation, we believe that chronic stimulation of each would produce unique sets of cellular and behavioral phenotypes that raise the intriguing notion of manipulating memories to mimic or ameliorate various pathological states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relevance of chronic negative thinking-like behaviors to human health</title><p>Chronic memory activation may mimic symptoms of rumination, negative thinking, and ongoing worry shared by individuals with GAD, MDD, and PTSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brewin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Newman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Watkins, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McEvoy et al., 2013</xref>), but the mechanisms behind this connection are currently unknown. In the healthy brain, ‘inhibitory control’ of the prefrontal cortex on the hippocampus is thought to keep these symptoms at bay. Recent work has suggested a framework where stress may compromise GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaiyed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banasr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2021</xref>), allowing a state of hippocampal hyperactivity to persist. This elevated hippocampal activity and dysfunction of GABAergic interneuron is evident in human patients with major depression and PTSD, and the activity levels are correlated with behavioral rumination and flashback intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Osuch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rayner et al., 2016</xref>). Human functional imaging work has supported this framework by showing that fronto-hippocampal inhibitory control via GABAergic signaling underlies this inability to suppress unwanted thoughts. Further, GABAergic signaling in the hippocampus has been shown to produce impaired extinction of conditioned fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Müller et al., 2015</xref>) and increased anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crestani et al., 1999</xref>). This mirrors our findings of increased anxiety and decreased extinction ability in mice that experienced negative memory activation. Further exploration into how chronic engram activation impacts excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) imbalance may provide a link between memory modulation and induction of effects on the brain similar to those related to rumination, negative thinking, and worry.</p><p>In humans, persistent worrying and rumination behaviors that are common in neuropsychiatric disorders can affect the health of the entire body. In the context of our findings, the concept of allostatic load refers to the ‘wear and tear’ the body experiences as a result of chronic exposure to stressful events. While the body attempts to produce a physiologically adaptive response through the process of allostasis, it is proposed that repeated cycles of allostasis in response to chronic stressors results in allostatic overload. In this state, the cumulative impact of chronic stress has overcome the body’s ability to cope, ultimately culminating in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McEwen and Stellar, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McEwen, 2004</xref>). This applies to the nervous system, wherein rumination has been shown to increase the risk of alcohol and substance abuse, especially in young individuals, as a form of compensatory behavior to numb the persistent negative thoughts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nolen-Hoeksema and Watkins, 2011</xref>). Rumination after a stressful event is also linked to insomnia, poor sleep quality, and pre-sleep intrusive thoughts, as well as an increase in the risk of heart disease and cardiovascular issues via autonomic dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guastella and Moulds, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busch et al., 2017</xref>). Together, we hope that the current study provides a novel framework in which memory itself may affect, and lead to, the maladaptive brain and body states described here.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Chronic engram reactivation and its differing effects on freezing behavior</title><p>Previous work showed that experimental activation of recall-induced populations in the dentate gyrus leads to fear attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khalaf et al., 2018</xref>), while our experimental manipulation produces lasting negative impacts on the brain and behavior. Specifically, this study posits that this fear attenuation occurs in neuronal ensembles through updating or unlearning of the original memory trace via the engagement, rather than suppression, of an original traumatic experience. Notably, one major difference is that our experiment reactivated an ensemble that was tagged during memory encoding, while they activated a remote recall-induced ensemble that was tagged 1 month after encoding. Although there is high overlap between the encoding and recall ensembles when mice are exposed to the conditioning context, these ensembles are not identical and may result in different behavioral phenotypes when chronically reactivated. Further, Khalaf et al. relied on reactivation of the recall-induced ensemble during extinction to facilitate rapid fear attenuation. This differs experimentally from our current work as their reactivation occurred during the extinction process in the previously conditioned context, while we reactivated chronically in the animal’s home cage over the course of a longer time period. It may be necessary that the memory is reactivated, and thus, more liable to re-contextualization, in the original context compared to an unrelated home cage environment where there are no related cues present. Importantly, this previous work tested the attenuation of fear shortly after an extinction process, while we did not extinguish the memory with aid of the memory reactivation. Finally, we tested remote recall (i.e., 3 months post-conditioning), as opposed to a shorter time interval (28 days). Despite these discrepancies, it is indeed possible that our chronic reactivation of a fear acquisition ensemble over time mildly attenuates or changes the original memory in some way. Future work could build on the findings of Khalaf et al. and/or show differences in the activation of a conditioning vs. recall-induced ensemble on fear attenuation during extinction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations of the study</title><sec id="s3-5-1"><title>Limitations of chronic chemogenetic modulation</title><p>In this study, we rely on the successful chemogenetic modulation of fearful neuronal ensembles to assess its impact on behavior over a long period of time. This strategy requires that our ligand, DCZ, maintains an effect on neuronal excitability across our 3 months of chronic reactivation. Previous work has shown that CNO administration in drinking water over 1 month consistently inhibited hM4Di+ neurons without altering baseline neuronal excitability as measured by firing rate and potassium currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xia et al., 2017</xref>). Although this is only for 1 month, it is administered via the same oral route as our DCZ protocol and suggests that at least for that amount of time we are likely producing similar effects. However, this must be experimentally tested as CNO and DCZ are unique ligands for chemogenetic modulation and must be extended out from 1 month to 3 months to assess the longevity of its effects in the brain. If DCZ is only having an effect for 1 vs. 3 months, we are still observing enduring changes that resulted from this shorter-term disturbance, which nonetheless informs our understanding of negative memory’s effects on the brain and behavior. On this same note, assessment of DREADD impact on E/I balance must be quantified utilizing both excitatory and inhibitory markers in future work to understand how chemogenetic modulation of engram cells may truly impact circuit-level E/I dysfunction.</p><p>Related to this, other work has shown evidence of DREADD toxicity at high titer levels of AAV2/7-CaMKII-hM4Di-mCherry in the HPC at 5 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goossens et al., 2021</xref>). We mitigated this risk by utilizing a viral strategy that targets a smaller number of engram cells using the AAV9-DIO-Flex-hM3Dq-mCherry virus at a lower titer, unlike this previous work that targeted all CaMKII+ cells in the HPC. Despite these efforts, we wanted to assess signs of decreasing neuronal health that may have resulted from chronic DREADD expression and utilized NeuN counts within multiple hippocampal subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yousef et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we note that we did not observe significant decreases in NeuN across active Gq receptor or mCherry control groups in either of the age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Ophthalmic ointment was applied to the eyes to provide adequate lubrication and prevent corneal desiccation. The hair on the scalp above the surgical site was removed using Veet hair removal cream and subsequently cleaned with alternating applications of betadine solution and 70% ethanol. 2.0% lidocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was injected subcutaneously as local analgesia prior to midsagittal incision of the scalp skin to expose the skull. 0.1 mg/kg (5 mg/kg) subcutaneous (SQ) dose of meloxicam was administered at the beginning of surgery. All animals received bilateral craniotomies with a 0.5–0.6 mm drill-bit for vCA1 injections. A 10 µL airtight Hamilton syringe with an attached 33-gauge beveled needle was slowly lowered to the coordinates of vCA1: –3.16 anteroposterior (AP), ± 3.10 mediolateral (ML) and both −4.25/–4.50 dorsoventral (DV) to cover vertical the axis of vHPC. All coordinates are given relative to bregma (mm). A total volume of 300 nL of AAV9-DIO-Flex-hM3Dq-mCherry or AAV9-DIO-Flex-mCherry was bilaterally injected into the vCA1 at both DV coordinates (150 nL at each site) listed above. The needle remained at the target site for 7–10 min post-injection before removal. Incisions were sutured closed using 4/0 non-absorbable Nylon Monofilament Suture [Brosan]. Following surgery, mice were injected with 0.1 mg/kg IP dose of buprenorphine (volume administered was dependent on the weight of the animal at the time of surgery).

Ramification index is a measure of the complexity of astrocyte and microglial morphology, with a higher ramification index indicating a more complex and extensive branching structure. This is computed by dividing the cell territorial volume by the cell volume. Average centroid distance (µm) helps us understand the distribution of cells in the brain, with a larger centroid distance indicating the glial cells are further apart. Using a 3D reconstruction of each cell skeleton, branches are labeled as primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The number of branch points (#) is calculated by the intersections of each branch type and endpoints (#) are counted at the termination of these branches.

At the end of the session, each mouse was placed into a separate cage until all of its cage mates had also gone through the behavioral test. They were all placed back into the home cage once this occurred. An automated video-tracking system, AnyMaze v4.3 (Stoelting Co, Wood Dale, IL), was used to measure total distance traveled, number of entries into the center, and total time spent in the center.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Zero-maze test</title><p>The zero-maze test is a pharmacologically validated assay of anxiety in animal models that is based on the natural aversion of mice to elevated, open areas.

The entire ring is 8 cm in height and sits at an elevation of 66 cm off the ground. All animals at each time point were tested on the same day. Mice were placed in the closed area at the start of a 10 min session. The following parameters were analyzed: time spent in the open area, number of entries into the open area, etc. The maze was cleaned with 70% ethanol between mice.

The apparatus consisted of a clear plexiglass maze with three arms (36.5 cm length, 7.5 cm width, 12.5 cm height) that were intersected at 120°. A mouse was placed at the end of one arm and allowed to move freely through the maze for 10 min without any reinforcements, such as food or water. Entries into all arms were noted (center of the body must cross into the arm for a valid entry) and a spontaneous alternation was counted if an animal entered three different arms consecutively. Percentage of spontaneous alternation was calculated according to the following formula: [(number of alterations)/(total number of arm entries - 1) × 100]. To prevent bias in data analysis, the test was carried out in a blind manner by the experimenter and behavior was analyzed blindly in AnyMaze. Additionally, total distance traveled was calculated for the test to rule out changes in locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Fear conditioning, recall, and extinction</title><p>For CFC, all time points took place in mouse conditioning chambers (Coulbourn Instruments, Holliston, MA). The grid floor was connected to a precision animal shocker (Coulbourn Instruments), which delivered a total of four foot shocks (2 s duration, 1.5 mA) at the 120, 180, 240, and 300 s time points during the 360 s session. This mouse conditioning chamber (18.5 × 18.5 × 21.5 cm) was composed of metal walls, plexiglass front and back walls, and a stainless-steel grid floor (16 grid bars). For recall, all animals were placed back into the same chambers they were originally fear conditioned in for a total of 300 s in the absence of foot shocks. For extinction, all animals were placed back into the same chambers they were originally conditioned in for a total of 1800s in the absence of foot shocks. To record the animal’s freezing activity, a video camera was mounted to the ceiling of the chamber and fed into a computer running FreezeFrame software (Actimetrics, Wilmette, IL). The program determined movement as changes in pixel luminance over a set period of time. Freezing was defined as a bout of 1.25 s or longer without changes in pixel luminance and verified by an experimenter blind to treatment groups.

Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilk and Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests. Outliers were removed using the ROUT method, which uses identification from nonlinear regression. We chose a ROUT coefficient Q value of 10% (false discovery rate), making the threshold for outliers less-strict and allowing for an increase in power for outlier detection. No more than 1–2 mice were removed in any group as outliers for any behavioral measure. To analyze differences between groups (mCherry and hM3Dq) and across age groups (3 and 11 months old [fear conditioning]; 6 and 14 months old [all other behavioral tasks]), we used a two-way ANOVA (between-subject factor: group; within-subject factor: age). To analyze the differences between groups and across time within a single session (i.e., fear conditioning) or across months (i.e., body weight), we used two-way RM ANOVAs (between-subjects factor: group; within-subjects factor: time/month).

This limited evidence does not sufficiently support the claim of potent long-term activation. The discussion in the revision stating &quot;...even if our manipulation is only working for 1 month, rather than 3 months...&quot; is unconvincing, particularly given that the title and abstract still claims &quot;chronic activation of...&quot;. To substantiate the technical validity of the study, at least cFos staining at various time points is necessary, which is less burdensome compared to more direct demonstrations such as slice physiology. Thus, although I believe it could be an interesting study for some audiences, I cannot support the strength of the evidence presented in the study.</p><p>Furthermore, in response to all reviewers' concerns regarding the quantification of GABA, the authors have removed the data from the study rather than providing properly acquired images or quantified data.

They test this idea by using mouse engram-tagging technology to label dentate gyrus ensembles activated during a negative experience (fear conditioning).

In this study, we also address that even if our manipulation is only working for 1 month, rather than 3 months, we are observing the long-term effects of this shorter-term stimulation. This is still relevant, and only changes how we interpret these findings, as shorter-term stimulation or disruption of neuronal activity can still have detrimental effects on behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, although the authors use the mCherry vector as a control, they did not have a vehicle/saline control for the hM3Dq AAV. Thus, the long-term effects such as the increase in glial cells could simply be due to the toxicity of DREADD expression, rather than an induced activity of these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>For chemogenetic studies, our experimental rationale utilized a standard approach in the field, which includes one of two control options: (1) active receptor vs. control vector + ligand or (2) active receptor + ligand or saline control. We chose the first option, as this more properly controls for the potential off-target effects of the ligand itself, as shown in other previous work (Xia et al., 2017). This is particularly important for studies using CNO, as many off-target effects have been noted as a limitation (Manvich et al., 2018). We chose to use DCZ as it is closely related to CNO and newer ligands, but comes with added benefits of high specificity, low off-target effects, high potency and brain penetrance (Nagai et al., 2020), but any potential off-target effects of DCZ are yet to be completely investigated as this ligand is very new.</p><p>Evidence of DREADD toxicity has been shown at high titer levels of AAV2/7- CamKIIα-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry in the hippocampus at 5 weeks, as the reviewer pointed out in their above comment (Goossens et al., 2021). Our viral strategy is targeted to a much smaller number of cells using AAV9-DIO-Flex-hM3Dq-mCherry at a lower titer, unlike expression within a much larger population of CaMKII+ excitatory neurons in this study. Additionally, visual comparison of their viral load and expression with ours shows much more intense expression that spans a larger area of the hippocampus (Goossens et al, 2021; Figure 1D), whereas ours is isolated to a smaller region of vHPC (see Figure 1B).</p><p>Further, we attempted to quantify a decrease in neuronal health (Yousef et al., 2017) resulting from DREADD expression via NeuN counts within multiple hippocampal subregions for the 6- and 14-month groups across active Gq receptor and mCherry conditions and did not observe significant decreases in NeuN as a result (Supplemental Figure 1). However, immunohistochemistry of an individual marker may not be sufficient to capture the entire health profile of an individual neuron and future work should consider other markers of cell death or inflammation, which we have added to the Limitations &amp; Future Work section of our Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 and the rest of the study are disconnected</p><p>The authors used the cFos-tTA system to label positive/negative engram populations, while the TRAP2 system was used for the chronic activation experiments. Although both genetic tools are based on the same IEG Fos, the sensitivity of the tools needs to be validated. In particular, the sensitivity of the TRAP2 system can be arbitrarily altered by the amount of tamoxifen (or 4OHT) and the administration protocols. The authors should at least compare and show the percentage of labeled cells in both methods and discuss that the two experiments target (at least slightly) different populations. In addition, the use of TRAP2 for vHP is relatively new; the authors should confirm that this method actually captures negative engram populations by checking for reactivation of these cells during recall by overlap analysis of Fos staining or by artificial activation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and opportunity to discuss the marked differences between TRAP2 and DOX systems. In particular, we agree that while both systems rely on the the Fos promoter to drive an effector of interest, their efficacy and temporal resolution vary substantially depending on genetic cell-type, brain region, temporal parameters of Dox or 4-OHT delivery, subject-by-subject metabolic variability, and threshold to Fos induction given the promoter sequences inherent to each system. For example, recent studies have reported the following:</p><p>- The TRAP2 line labels a subset of endogenously activeCA1 pyramidal cells (e.g. 5-18%) while the DOX system labels 20-40% of CA1 pyramidal cells (DeNardo et al, 2019; Monasterio et al, <italic>BioRxiv</italic> 2024 ).</p><p>- The temporal windows for each range from hours in TRAP2 to 24-48 hours for DOX (DeNardo et al, 2019; Denny et al, 2014; Liu &amp; Ramirez et al, 2012).</p><p>- The efficacy of “tagging” a population of cells with TRAP2 vs. with DOX will constrain the number of possible cells that may overlap with cFos upon re-exposure to a given experience e.g. see the observed overlaps in vCA1 - BLA circuits (Kim &amp; Cho, 2020), compared to vCA1 in general (Ortega-de San Luis et al, 2023) and valence-specific vCA1 populations (Shpokayte et al, 2022).</p><p>- Tagging vCA1 cells with both the TRAP2 and DOX systems are nonetheless sufficient to drive corresponding behaviors (e.g. vCA1 terminal stimulation drives behavioral changes with the DOX and TRAP2 system (Shpokayte et al, 2022) and vCA1 stimulation of an updated fear-linked ensemble drives light-induced freezing in a neutral context utilizing the TRAP2 and DOX systems (Ortega-de San Luis et al, 2023)).</p><p>Finally, and promisingly, as more studies continue to link the in vivo physiological dynamics of these cell populations tagged using each system (e.g. compare Pettit et al, 2022 with Tanaka et al, 2018) and correlating their activity to behavioral phenotypes, our field is in the prime position to uncover deeper principles governing hippocampus-mediated engrams in the brain. Together, we believe a more comprehensive understanding of these systems is fully warranted, especially in the service of further cataloging cellular similarities and differences within such tagged populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Interpretation of the behavior data</p><p>In Figures 3a and b, the authors show that the experimental group showed higher anxiety based on time spent in the center/open area. However, there were no differences in distance traveled and center entries, which are often reduced in highly anxious mice. Thus, it is not clear what the exact effect of the manipulation is. The authors may want to visualize the trajectories of the mice's locomotion instead of just showing bar graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>Our findings show that our experimental group displays higher levels of anxiety-like behaviors as measured via time spent in center/open area, while there are no differences in distance traveled or center entries. For distance traveled, our interpretation is in line with complementary research (Jimenez et al, 2018; Kheirbek et al, 2013) that shows no changes in distance traveled/distance traveled in the center coupled with changes in anxiety levels as a result of manipulation within anxiety-related circuits. More broadly, any locomotion-related deficit could cause a change in distance traveled that is unrelated to anxiety-like behaviors alone. For example, a reduction in distance traveled could be coupled with a decrease in time spent in the center, but could also result only from motor or exploratory deficits. We hope that this explanation clarifies our interpretation of the open field and elevated plus maze findings in light of other literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the data shown in Figure 4b is somewhat surprising - the 14MO control showed more freezing than the 6MO control, which can be interpreted as &quot;better memory in old&quot;. As this is highly counterintuitive, the authors may want to discuss this point. The authors stated that &quot;Mice typically display increased freezing behavior as they age, so these effects during remote recall are expected&quot; without any reference. This is nonsense, as just above in Figure 4a, older mice actually show less freezing than young mice. Overall, the behavioral effects are rather small and random. I would suggest that these data be interpreted more carefully.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4B, we present our findings from remote recall and observe increased freezing levels in control mice with age, as mentioned by the reviewer, indicating increased memory. This is in line with previous work from Shoji &amp; Miyakawa, 2019 which has been added as a reference for the quotation described above; we thank the reviewer for pointing this error out. As the reviewer has pointed out, above in Figure 4A, we measured freezing levels across all groups during contextual fear conditioning before the start of chronic stimulation, as this was the session we ‘tagged’ a negative memory in. Although it appears that there may be slightly lower levels of freezing in older (14-month old) mice, our findings do not determine statistical significance for difference between age group, only effects of time and subject which are expected as freezing increases within the session and animals display high levels of variability in freezing levels across many experiments (Figure 4A i-iii). We also find in previous work that control mice receiving 3-, 6- and 9-months of chronic DCZ stimulation in the vHPC with empty vector (mCherry) receptor show an increase in freezing with age (Suthard et al, 2023; Figure 2A ii).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Lack of citation and discussion of relevant study</p><p>Khalaf et al. 2018 from Gräff lab showed that experimental activation of recall-induced populations leads to fear attenuation. Despite the differences in experimental details, the conceptual discrepancy should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, Khalaf et al. 2018 showed that experimental activation of recall-induced populations in the dentate gyrus leads to fear attenuation. Specifically, they pose that this fear attenuation occurs in these ensembles through updating or unlearning of the original memory trace via the engagement, rather than suppression, of an original traumatic experience. Despite the differences in experimental details with our current study and this work, we agree that the conceptual discrepancy should be discussed. First, one major difference is that we are reactivating an ensemble that was tagged during fear memory encoding, while Khalaf et al. are activating a remote recall-induced ensemble that was tagged one month after encoding. Although there is high overlap between the encoding and recall ensembles when mice are exposed to the conditioning context, these ensembles are not identical and may result in different behavioral phenotypes when chronically reactivated. Further, Khalaf et al rely on reactivation of the recall-induced ensemble during extinction to facilitate rapid fear attenuation. This differs from our current work, as their reactivation is occurring during the extinction process in the previously conditioned context, while we are reactivating chronically in the animal’s home cage over the course of a longer time period. It may be necessary that the memory is first reactivated, and thus, more liable to re-contextualization, in the original context compared to an unrelated homecage environment where there are presumably no related cues present. Importantly, this previous work tests the attenuation of fear shortly after an extinction process, while we are not traditionally extinguishing the context with aid of the memory reactivation. Finally, we are testing remote recall (3 months post-conditioning), while they are testing at a shorter time interval (28 days). In line with these ideas, future work may seek to tease out the mechanistic differences between recent and remote memory extinction both in terms of natural memory recall and chronically manipulated memory-bearing cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Jellinger, Suthard, et al. investigated the transcriptome of positive and negative valence engram cells in the ventral hippocampus, revealing anti- and pro-inflammatory signatures of these respective valences. The authors further reactivated the negative valence engram ensembles to assay the effects of chronic negative memory reactivation in young and old mice. This chronic re-activation resulted in differences in aspects of working memory, and fear memory, and caused morphological changes in glia. Such reactivation-associated changes are putatively linked to GABA changes and behavioral rumination.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Much of the content of this manuscript is of benefit to the community, such as the discovery of differential engram transcriptomes dependent on memory valence. The chronic activation of neurons, and the resultant effects on glial cells and behavior, also provide the community with important data. Laudable points of this manuscript include the comprehensiveness of behavioral experiments, as well as the cross-disciplinary approach.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several key claims made that are unsubstantiated by the data, particularly regarding the anthropomorphic framing of &quot;rumination&quot; on a mouse model and the role of GABA. The conclusions and inferences in these areas need to be carefully considered.</p><p>(1) There are many issues regarding the arguments for the behavioural data's human translation as &quot;rumination.&quot; There is no definition of rumination provided in the manuscript, nor how rumination is similar/different to intrusive thoughts (which are psychologically distinct but used relatively interchangeably in the manuscript), nor how rumination could be modelled in the rodent. The authors mention that they are attempting to model rumination behaviours by chronically reactivating the negative engram (&quot;To understand if our experimental model of negative rumination...&quot;), but this occurs almost at the very end of the results section, and no concrete evidence from the literature is provided to attempt to link the behavioural results (decreased working memory, increased fear extinction times) to rumination-like behaviours. The arguments in the final paragraph of the Discussion section about human rumination appear to be unrelated to the data presented in the manuscript and contain some uncited statements. Finally, the rumination claims seem to be based largely upon a single data figure that needs to be further developed (Figure 6, see also point 2 below).</p><p>(2) The staining and analysis in Figure 6 are challenging to interpret, and require more evidence to substantiate the conclusions of these results. The histological images are zoomed out, and at this resolution, it appears that only the pyramidal cell layer is being stained. A GABA stain should also label the many sparsely spaced inhibitory interneurons existing across all hippocampal layers, yet this is not apparent here. Moreover, both example images in the treatment group appear to have lower overall fluorescence intensity in both DAPI and GABA. The analysis is also unclear: the authors mention &quot;ROIs&quot; used to measure normalized fluorescence intensity but do not specify what the ROI encapsulates. Presumably, the authors have segmented each DAPI-positive cell body and assessed fluorescence however, this is not explicated nor demonstrated, making the results difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the collective discussion from all reviewers on the completeness of our GABA quantification and its implications, we have decided to remove this figure and perform more substantive analysis of this E/I imbalance in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A smaller point, but more specific detail is needed for how genes were selected for GSEA analysis. As GSEA relies on genes to be specified a priori, to avoid a circular analysis, these genes need to be selected in a blind/unbiased manner to avoid biasing downstream results and conclusions. It's likely the authors have done this, but explicitly noting how genes were selected is an important context for this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our Methods section, gene sets were selected based on pre-existing biology and understanding of genes canonically involved in “neurodegeneration” such as those related to apoptotic pathways and neuroinflammation or “neuroprotection” such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, to name a few. A limitation of this method is that we must avoid making strong claims about the actual function of these up- or down-regulated genes without performing proper knock-in or knock-out studies, but we hope that this provides an unbiased inventory for future experiments to perform causal manipulations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors note that negative ruminations can lead to pathological brain states and mood/anxiety dysregulation. They test this idea by using mouse engram-tagging technology to label dentate gyrus ensembles activated during a negative experience (fear conditioning). They show that chronic chemogenetic activation of these ensembles leads to behavioral (increased anxiety, increased fear generalization, reduced fear extinction) and neural (increases in neuroinflammation, microglia, and astrocytes).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The question the authors ask here is an intriguing one, and the engram activation approach is a powerful way to address the question. Examination of a wide range of neural and behavioral dependent measures is also a strength.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness is that the authors have found a range of changes that are correlates of chronic negative engram reactivation.

These ROIs were matched for dimensions and brain regions across all groups for each hippocampal subregion quantified. We initially proposed to normalize these NeuN counts over DAPI, but because DAPI includes all nuclei (microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and neurons), we weren’t sure this was the most optimal tool. We do agree that further quantification of excitatory and inhibitory cell markers would be vital to more concrete interpretation of our findings and we have added this to our Limitations &amp; Future Work section of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The DOX tagging window lacks temporal precision.

That is, is DCZ as effective in increasing neuronal excitability on day 90 as it is on day 1. This could be addressed with electrophysiology, or with IEG induction. Alternatively, the authors could refer to previous literature-- for example, Xia et al (2017) eLife-- that examined whether there was any blunting of the effects of DREADD ligands after sustained delivery via drinking water. There, of course, may be other papers as well.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted by the reviewer, it is important to determine if DCZ maintains its effects on neuronal excitability throughout the 3 month administration period. To address this, previous work has shown that CNO administration in drinking water over one month consistently inhibited hM4Di+ neurons without altering baseline neuronal excitability as measured by firing rate and potassium currents (Xia et al, 2017). Although this is only for one month, it is administered via the same oral route as our DCZ protocol and suggests that at least for that amount of time we are likely producing consistent effects. In our reply above to Reviewer #1’s comment, we also note that even if DCZ is only having an effect for one month, rather than 3 months, we are still observing enduring changes that resulted from this short-term disturbance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please double check there is no group effect on weight in 6-month-old mice in Figure 2C.</p></disp-quote><p>Two-way RM ANOVA showed no main effect of Group within the 6-month-old control and hM3Dq groups.</p><p>Group: F(1,17) = 1.361, p=0.2594.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The shock intensity is much higher than is typical for fear conditioning studies in mice. Why was this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we do agree that this shock intensity is on the higher side of typical paradigms in mice, however, our lab has utilized 0.75mA to 1.5mA intensity foot shocks for contextual fear conditioning in the past (Suthard &amp; Senne et al, 2023; 2024; Dorst &amp; Senne et al, 2023; Grella et al., 2022; Finkelstein et al., 2022) and we maintained this protocol for internal consistency. However, it would be interesting to systematically investigate how differing intensities of foot shock, subsequent tagging of this ensemble and reactivation would uniquely impact behavioral state acutely and chronically in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Remote freezing is very low. The authors should comment on this-- perhaps repeated testing has led to some extinction?</p></disp-quote><p>A reviewer above suggested a similar phenomenon may be occuring, specifically fear attenuation as a result of chronic stimulation. They referenced previous work from Khalaf et al. 2018, where they reactivated a recall-induced ensemble, while we reactivated an ensemble tagged during encoding. We expand upon this work in light of our findings within the Limitations &amp; Future Work section of our Discussion. However, we do appreciate the lower levels of freezing observed in remote recall and sought out other literature to understand the typical range of remote freezing levels. One thing that we note is that our remote recall is occurring 3 months after conditioning, which is much longer than typical 14-28 day protocols. However, we find that freezing levels at remote timepoints from 21-45 days results in contextual freezing levels of between 20-50% approximately (Kol et al., 2020), as well as 40-75% approximately in a variety of 28 day remote recall experiments (Lee et al., 2023). This information, together with our current experimental protocol demonstrates a wide range of remote freezing levels that may depend heavily on the foot shock intensity, duration of days after conditioning, and animal variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) &quot;mice display increased freezing with age&quot;: please add a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies, we missed the citation for that claim and it has been added in-text and in the references list (Shoji &amp; Miyakawa, 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Related to the low freezing levels for remote memory, why is generalization minimal? Many studies have shown that there is a time-dependent emergence of generalized fear, yet here this is not seen. Is it linked to extinction (as above)? Or genetic background?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous work has shown that rats receiving multiple foot shocks during conditioning displayed a time-dependent generalization of context memory, while those receiving less shocks did not (Poulos et al., 2016), as the reviewer noted in their comment. In our current study, we observe low levels of generalization in all of our groups compared to freezing levels displayed in the conditioned context at the remote timepoint, in opposition to this time-dependent enhancement of generalization. It is possible that the genetic background of our C57BL/6J mice compared to the Long-Evans rat strain in this previous work accounts for some of this difference. In addition, it is possible that the longer duration of time (3 months) compared to their remote timepoint (28 days) resulted in time-dependent decrease in generalization that decreases with greater durations of time from original conditioning. As noted above, it is indeed plausible that the reactivation of a contextual fear ensemble over time is attenuating freezing levels for both the original and similar contexts (Khalaf et al, 2018). We discuss the differences in our study and this 2018 work more comprehensively above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Morphological phenotypes of astrocytes/microglia.

In our experiments (Shpokayte et al., 2022), Dox was administered for 24 hours (D12-D13), which was followed by sacrificing the animal for cell suspension and sequencing of the positive and negative engram populations. This figure also shows the viral strategy for the Tet-tag system (Figure 1A), as well as representative viral expression in vHPC (Figure 1B). We are happy to add additional experimental design/timeline information to this figure that would be helpful to the reviewer.</p></body></sub-article></article>
