mammalian cells. Here, we develop CRISPR-engineered mouse lines that enable rapid and highly specific degradation of tagged endogenous proteins in vivo. Most but not all cell types are competent for degradation. By combining ligand titrations with genetic crosses to generate animals with different allelic combinations, we show that degradation kinetics depend upon the dose of the tagged protein, ligand, and the E3 ligase substrate receptor TIR1. Rapid degradation of condensin I and II – two essential regulators of mitotic chromosome structure – revealed that both complexes are individually required for cell division in precursor lymphocytes, but not in their differentiated peripheral lymphocyte derivatives. This generalisable approach provides unprecedented temporal control over the dose of endogenous proteins in mouse models, with implications for studying essential biological pathways and modelling drug activity in mammalian tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>degron</kwd><kwd>genetic tools</kwd><kwd>condensin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Unit award to the MRC Human Genetics Unit</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>Lewis</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Gillian C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brisbane</surname><given-names>Jennifer Margaret</given-names></name><name><surname>Christodoulou</surname><given-names>Ersi</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_PC_21040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Gillian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102560/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>Lewis</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylor</surname><given-names>Gillian C</given-names></name><name><surname>Brisbane</surname><given-names>Jennifer Margaret</given-names></name><name><surname>Christodoulou</surname><given-names>Ersi</given-names></name><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>Lucy</given-names></name><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JR FDN-143334</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rossant</surname><given-names>Janet</given-names></name><name><surname>Gu</surname><given-names>Bin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In rodents, conditional approaches typically make use of recombinases such as CRE and FLP, which allow the controlled excision, inversion, or translocation of DNA flanked by recombinase target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kos, 2004</xref>). Despite the immense contribution that recombinase-based systems have made to mouse genetics, their utility in studies of protein function is fundamentally limited by the fact that they target DNA.</p><p>DNA manipulations impact protein function with kinetics that are determined by the natural half-life of pre-existing mRNA and protein molecules. Chemical genetic approaches such as the auxin-inducible degron (AID) provide a potential solution to these problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Natsume and Kanemaki, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). Auxins (e.g. indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) are plant hormones that bind to TIR1, the substrate receptor subunit of a Cullin Ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). IAA binding greatly increases the affinity of TIR1 for target proteins containing a degron polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tan et al., 2007</xref>), leading to the formation of a ternary complex, ubiquitination of the target protein, followed by its rapid degradation by the proteosome.</p><p>Pioneering work by the Kanemaki laboratory showed that this plant-specific system can be co-opted to conditionally degrade target proteins in non-plant species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Natsume et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). This is achieved by genetically fusing short degron tags (44 amino acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morawska and Ulrich, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nora et al., 2017</xref>) to a protein of interest in cells that heterologously express a plant <italic>Tir1</italic> transgene. Addition of IAA ligand then induces rapid degradation of the degron-tagged protein, often with a half-life of less than 30 min, in a manner which is both reversible and dosage controllable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>). Other degron tag systems such as dTAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nabet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nabet et al., 2018</xref>), and HaloPROTAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2015</xref>) work on a similar conceptual basis, albeit via different molecular mechanisms.</p><p>These genetically encoded strategies for targeted protein degradation have revolutionised functional studies of essential proteins in cultured mammalian cells and invertebrates, providing insights into a range of ‘fast’ processes such as transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narita et al., 2021</xref>), chromosome looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nora et al., 2017</xref>), and the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hégarat et al., 2020</xref>). However, targeted protein degradation in genetically engineered mammals remains in its infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>), and it has not yet been possible to degrade tagged endogenous proteins in adult tissues. Such an ability would enable protein function to be compared across a wide range of ‘normal’ cell types and disease models.</p><p>In a proof-of-principle study, we (BG and JR) previously observed degradation of transcription factors in early mouse embryos that were mosaic for expression of both TIR1 and the AID-tagged target protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, a modified AID system (AID2) was shown to induce degradation of a randomly integrated <italic>GFP</italic> transgene in adult and embryonic mouse tissues following intraperitoneal (I.P.) ligand injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). However, the original and more extensively characterised AID system was not tested in this study due to difficulties in deriving stable mouse lines expressing <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> TIR1.</p><p>Here, we derive novel transgenic mouse lines to show that the original AID system is highly effective for acutely depleting endogenously expressed proteins in adult tissues, embryos, and primary cells. Using a proteome-wide approach, we show that AID is highly specific for the target protein in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that the dosage of TIR1, IAA ligand and the AID-tagged target protein are all key determinants of degradation efficiency in primary cells. We then focus on the two mammalian condensin complexes to show that IAA-responsive mice allow the comparison of ‘essential’ protein function over short time-scales across cell lineages, and at different stages of differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of mouse models for auxin-inducible degradation of condensin subunits</title><p>The condensin I and II complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) are essential for mitotic chromosome formation and chromosome segregation in vertebrate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2003</xref>), and are thought to work via a DNA-dependent motor activity to generate loops in chromosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>).

We reasoned that the transient overexpression of TIR1 from the many copies of injected donor plasmids may have led to non-specific protein degradation in embryos and prevented us from generating live founder pups. We circumvented this hurdle by first generating a single-copy insertion of a conditionally activatable Lox-STOP-Lox (LSL) allele (<italic>Rosa26-CAG-LSL-TIR1-9myc</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Western blotting revealed broad expression of TIR1 across tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). However, although TIR1 expression is driven by a constitutive CAG promoter from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> safe harbor locus, we did observe differential expression levels among the tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), consistent with previous observations for LacZ reporters and creERT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hameyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mao et al., 1999</xref>). As shown below, the expression of TIR1 in relevant tissues appears to be sufficient to facilitate target protein degradation. However, further characterisations are required to detail the expression pattern of TIR1 at tissue and single-cell levels to comprehensively characterise the TIR1 knock-in mouse lines and facilitate broader applications.</p><p>In order to generate IAA-responsive mice, we performed crosses to combine the <italic>Rosa26<sup>Tir1</sup></italic> allele with either <italic>Ncaph<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic> or <italic>Ncaph<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic> in double transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The presence of TIR1 has previously been reported to induce ‘basal’ degradation of some AID-tagged target proteins even in the absence of exogenous IAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mendoza-Ochoa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sathyan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>).

Protein levels began to recover within 6 hr post-injection before returning to baseline levels within 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This shows that degradation of endogenous proteins via the AID system is reversible in vivo.</p><p>Target protein was also efficiently degraded in 2 hr within mitotic crypt cells of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, we observed individual interphase cells that appeared resistant to degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>, white arrow). Similarly, bone marrow erythroblasts (TER119<sup>+</sup>) retained Clover fluorescence after IAA exposure in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). TIR1 protein was robustly expressed in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>), ruling out cell-lineage-specific transgene activity as the source of cell-lineage-specific IAA pharmacodynamics. Nonetheless, the barrier to IAA activity in erythroblasts was cell intrinsic rather than a property of the tissue environment, because TER119<sup>+</sup> cells in ex vivo bone marrow cultures also failed to degrade NCAPH in response to IAA treatment, whereas CD19<sup>+</sup> cells in the same culture degraded efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>Protein degradation was also inefficient in dividing spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In this case, we speculate that the blood–testes barrier could prevent IAA from entering seminiferous tubules to effect protein degradation, although cell intrinsic barriers to degradation cannot be excluded.</p><p>Finally, we tested the ability of IAA to degrade NCAPH<sup>AID:Clover</sup> protein in embryos.

Embryos were collected 4 hr later, and NCAPH levels were quantified by immunofluorescence performed on whole-mount embryonic cryosections co-stained with antibodies recognising E-Cadherin (CDH1). This revealed near complete protein degradation within CDH1-positive regions of the developing surface ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Similarly, profound degradation was observed within PDGFR<sup>+</sup> cells of the embryonic mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D, E, F and G</xref>). These data show that IAA is able to cross the placenta to achieve robust protein degradation in embryonic cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we describe an approach that opens up new possibilities for studying the consequences of acute protein loss in mammalian primary cells, tissues and whole organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The ability to trigger protein degradation using small molecules has numerous advantages over alternative reverse genetic approaches. Most importantly, protein function is removed in less than 2 hr; substantially quicker than would be possible using gene editing nucleases, recombinases, or RNAi. Rapid removal is particularly important for studying essential cell cycle proteins such as condensins, where secondary and tertiary phenotypes arising downstream from abnormal cell division can quickly obscure primary phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hocquet et al., 2018</xref>). Given the central importance of condensins in establishing chromosome architecture during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gibcus et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ono et al., 2003</xref>), combined with persistent and unresolved questions about their involvement in other physiological processes in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dowen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 2019</xref>), we anticipate that the two mouse models described here will provide an important resource for the chromosome biology community.</p><p>To demonstrate the utility of this system, we compared the ability of non-immortalised primary lymphocyte populations, from different lineages and stages of differentiation, to undergo a single round of cell division in the near absence of Ncaph and Ncaph2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our results show that different cell types differ in their ability to complete a single round of cell division in the near absence of these proteins, adding to an increasing body of data suggesting cell-type-specific differences in the consequences of condensin perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elbatsh et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gosling et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woodward et al., 2016</xref>). Elucidating the cause of these differences was beyond the scope of the current study, but it could potentially involve cell-type-specific chromosome topology (e.g. fewer catenations to remove in mature cells), or cell cycle checkpoints (e.g. greater sensitivity to mitotic arrest in precursor cells). In the future, we expect these two degrader mouse lines will provide valuable insights into chromosome biology and mitotic chromosome structure in the context of in vivo cellular heterogeneity, development, and disease.</p><p>Protein degradation was achievable in a range of cell types, including B and T lymphocytes at different developmental stages (precursor and mature, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), gut epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), embryonic CDH1<sup>+</sup> cells of the developing surface ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), and PDGFR<sup>+</sup> cells of the embryonic mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, a minority of cell types proved refractory. For example, erythroid progenitors failed to degrade AID-tagged proteins due to a cell intrinsic block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) that was not attributable to silencing of the <italic>Tir1</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We speculate that erythroblasts fail to express one or more endogenous subunits of the SCF<sup>Tir1</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, or another component of the ubiquitin proteosome system that is necessary for degradation via the AID system. Spermatocytes also failed to degrade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>), possibly due to poor ligand transit across the blood testes barrier, poor expression of TIR1 or required endogenous factors. An analogous barrier prevents many small molecules from penetrating into the adult brain. Poor expression of condensins in post-mitotic tissues prevented us from testing AID function in the brain; however, a structurally related ligand for the AID2 system (5’Ph-IAA) was found to have relatively weak protein degradation activity in this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>By combining ligand titrations with genetic crosses to generate animals bearing different allelic combinations, we showed that the dosage of all three components of the ternary complex formed between the target protein, ligand and TIR1 substrate receptor protein, can determine the kinetics of protein degradation in mammalian primary cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Specifically, reduced expression of TIR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), or increased expression of degron-tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), can both decrease the efficiency of protein degradation. Notably, reduced expression of the CRBN substrate receptor, and increased expression of non-essential neosubstrates, have emerged as mechanisms through which haematological malignancies can develop resistance to thalidomide analogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Heintel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sperling et al., 2019</xref>). Saturation of protein degradation activity is therefore a general property of molecular glue compounds, which might limit their activity on highly expressed targets and influence protein degradation efficiency in both clinical and research contexts.</p><p>Concerns have been raised about the AID system because a subset of AID-tagged proteins can undergo TIR1-dependent turnover even in the absence of exogenous IAA. We showed that the presence of TIR1 had little or no effect on the expression of two different AID-tagged condensin subunit proteins in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but enabled their rapid degradation, often to levels below 10% of baseline, within 1–2 hr of ligand exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Regulated induction of TIR1 expression in yeast has demonstrated that leaky degradation of target proteins occurs as a consequence of TIR1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mendoza-Ochoa et al., 2019</xref>). Achieving TIR1 expression levels sufficient for IAA-inducible degradation yet insufficient for IAA-independent degradation is therefore of paramount importance. That leaky degradation did not cause problems in our study suggests that the single-copy <italic>Rosa26<sup>Tir1</sup></italic> allele generated via genome editing is expressed within this desirable range, at least for these two proteins. Further work is required to determine whether other AID-tagged targets show leaky degradation in combination with the <italic>Rosa26<sup>Tir1</sup></italic> allele generated here.</p><p>While our work was ongoing, point mutations in TIR1 (F74A and F74G) have been identified that, in combination with a modified ligand, eliminate TIR1-dependent leaky degradation, and allow degradation to be induced at much lower ligand concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishimura et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore predict that AID tagging should be applicable to study a broad range of intracellular proteins in mice and their primary cell derivatives.</p><p>A very recent publication has reported targeted degradation of endogenously tagged NELFB protein using dTAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abuhashem et al., 2022</xref>): another promising degron-tagging approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nabet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nabet et al., 2020</xref>). dTAG uses distinct tags, ligands, and E3 ligase interactions, and should therefore be compatible with the AID system developed here to enable orthogonal chemical control of two different proteins in mice. In contrast to AID, which requires exogenous expression of the E3 ligase protein TIR1, dTAG uses endogenous E3 ligases to achieve protein degradation and could therefore be simpler to establish in mice. However, this same property could also prevent future applications that require tissue- or cell-type selective protein degradation. This is achievable using AID via tissue-specific expression of TIR1, as shown in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Although not tested here, the Rosa26 loxP-STOP-loxP TIR1 allele generated during this study could allow spatial restriction of IAA pharmacodynamics to cell types co-expressing Cre recombinase.</p><p>Although the AID system presents a few important advantages over more traditional conditional genetic systems such as Cre-loxP, including speed and reversibility, several issues remain to be addressed after our proof-of-concept study. First, AID and other degron-tagging approaches require genetic fusion of the tag to an endogenous protein. Compared to the intronic loxP sites for the Cre-loxP system, it is more likely that protein tags will interfere with normal protein function (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). The effect of a fusion tag is highly dependent on the unique properties of the target protein and needs to be analysed and validated on a case-by-case basis. Second, the toxicity profile of IAA in rodents has only been characterised in a limited manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Furukawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), in contrast to Tamoxifen: the most broadly used chemical induction reagent for the Cre-loxP system. Although we did not observe overt toxicity following single dose administration of IAA at 100 mg/kg in our study, further work is needed to characterise the potential toxicities. Third, the potential ‘leaky’ degradation of proteins by TIR1 without IAA administration needs to be properly controlled.</p><p>At this point, three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses can be speculated for the mechanism of leaky degradation. First, the leaky degradation may be an intrinsic property of the TIR1 protein. As described above, the AID2 system uses mutations in the TIR1 protein and a chemically modified ligand, which were able to minimise leaky degradation for several proteins in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>). Given that our study used the original AID system and did not observe substantial leaky degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), further work is warranted to establish whether AID or AID2 is intrinsically more leaky in mice. Second, the leakiness, and indeed the efficiency, of auxin-inducible degradation may be dependent on the structural and biochemical properties of each target protein, as recently observed with PROTAC degradation systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bondeson et al., 2018</xref>). Third, dietary factors might promote leaky degradation. Although all mice in this study were fed on standard plant-based chow, plant-based foods could theoretically introduce more IAA-like molecules than, for example, casein-based diets. The gut microbiome might also play a role in producing IAA-like molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lai et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, detailed knowledge of the housing and feeding condition of mouse colonies might be an important factor for the precise reproduction of experiments using AID systems.</p><p>In conclusion, these issues need to be resolved in order to establish AID as a general system for conditional genetic manipulation for the broader mouse genetics community. Nonetheless, our demonstration that degron tagging systems are effective in living mice should enable more versatile conditional alleles to study protein function, and to model drug activity, in mouse models of development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>O. sativa</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>osTIR1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>64,945</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene fragment (<italic>A. thaliana</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>mAID</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nora et al., 2017</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>IAA17</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>CD1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Crl:CD1(ICR</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>C57BL/6</italic>J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Charles River</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rosa26-LSL-osTIR1-9myc</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>CD1-Gt(ROSA)26Sorem1(CAG-LSL-osTIR1-myc)Jrt</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Rosa26-osTIR1-9myc (Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>CD1-Gt(ROSA)26Sorem1.1(CAG-LSL-osTIR1-myc)Jrt</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>pCX-NLS-cre (Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belteki et al., 2005</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ICR-Tg(CAG-cre</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/J:99607">http://www.informatics.jax.org/reference/J:99607</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ncaph<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ncaph<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ncaph2<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Ncaph2<sup>AID:Clover</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pRosa26-CAG-LSL-osTIR1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belteki et al., 2005</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse maintenance and husbandry</title><p>All animal work was approved by a University of Edinburgh internal ethics committee and was performed in accordance with institutional guidelines under license by the UK Home Office.

Sample was applied to a double-layer Empore C18 Extraction Disk (3 M) prepared with methanol. Membrane was washed twice with 0.1% TFA and protein was eluted with elution buffer (50% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.05% TFA), dried using a CentriVap Concentrator (Labconco) and resuspended in 15 µl 0.1% TFA. Protein concentration was determined by absorption at 280 nm on a Nanodrop 1000, then 2 µg of de-salted peptides were loaded onto a 50 cm emitter packed with 1.9 µm ReproSil-Pur 200 C18-AQ (Dr Maisch, Germany) using a RSLC-nano uHPLC systems connected to a Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (both Thermo, UK). Peptides were separated by a 140-min linear gradient from 5% to 30% acetonitrile, 0.5% acetic acid. The mass spectrometer was operated in DIA mode, acquiring a MS 350–1650 Da at 120 k resolution followed by MS/MS on 45 windows with 0.5 Da overlap (200–2000 Da) at 30 k with a NCE setting of 27.

Pellets were resuspended in Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD Bioscience, 554722) following the manufacturer’s instructions and washed in Perm/Wash buffer (BD Bioscience, 554723). If required, samples were incubated with fluorescently conjugated antibodies against intracellular markers for 20 min at room temperature. For intracellular γH2AX staining, samples were further permeabilised by resuspending in Perm/Wash buffer (1 ml) for 15 min at 4°C before antibody incubation. After intracellular antibody incubation, all stained samples were then washed in Perm/Wash buffer (300 × <italic>g</italic>/5 min/4°C). Cell Trace Yellow (Thermo Fisher C34567) experiments were conducted according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were resuspended in DAPI staining solution (1 µg/ml DAPI in PBS). DAPI-stained samples were incubated on ice for at least 15 min before data acquisition.</p><p>Data acquisition (BD LSRFortessa) was performed no more than 24 hr following sample fixation. Identical laser power was used to quantify Clover signal across all experiments. Data analysis was conducted using FlowJo software (Treestar). Cellular debris/aggregates were excluded using strict forward- and side-scatter gating strategies. Cell cycle stages were gated based on DNA content (DAPI) fluorescence. Our protein degradation experiments focused on S/G2/M phase cells in order to control for cell cycle differences between cell types, and because condensins function primarily during cell division. Wildtype samples lacking Clover expression were processed and stained in parallel to transgenic samples. To correct for autofluorescence, background fluorescence was measured for each cell population from wildtype samples, and then subtracted from transgenic fluorescence values. To generate boxplots, the background-corrected fluorescence value from each of &gt;1000 cells was expressed relative to the mean of the vehicle only condition. We focused exclusively on S/G2/M cells, gated on DNA content, for quantifications to avoid the confounding effects of quiescent cells, where condensins are expressed at very low levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Primary cell culture</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Thymic and bone marrow ex vivo cultures</title><p>Single-cell suspensions of thymus tissue were generated by gentle dissociation of whole thymus tissue through 40 µm filters (Fisherbrand, 22-363-547) into PBS.

To reduce autofluorescence, staining of small intestine sections also included an additional treatment with 0.1% Sudan Black in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 20 min immediately prior to DAPI stain and mounting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Image capture and analysis</title><p>Images of small intestine sections were acquired at ×100 magnification using a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 CCD camera and a Zeiss AxioImager A1 fluorescence microscope with a Plan Apochromat 100 × 1.4 NA objective, a Nikon Intensilight Mercury based light source (Nikon UK Ltd, Kingston-on-Thames, UK) and either Chroma #89,014ET (3 colour) or #89,000ET (4 colour) single excitation and emission filters (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT) with the excitation and emission filters installed in Prior motorised filter wheels. A piezoelectrically driven objective mount (PIFOC model P-721, Physik Instrumente GmbH &amp; Co, Karlsruhe) was used to control movement in the z dimension. Hardware control and image capture were performed using Nikon Nis-Elements software (Nikon UK Ltd, Kingston-on-Thames, UK). Deconvolution of 3D data was performed in Nis-Elements (Richardson Lucy, 20 iterations). 3D datasets were visualised and analysed for fluorescence intensity using Imaris V9.5 (Bitplane, Oxford Instruments, UK). DNA volume was calculated by manually rendering a surface around the DAPI signal in pH3S10<sup>+</sup> cells within Imaris, and immunofluorescence signal was calculated from mean voxel intensity within that surface. The percentage protein remaining following IAA treatment was calculated by setting the mean voxel intensity measured in pH3S10<sup>+</sup> cells from negative control (e.g. <italic>Ncaph<sup>+/+</sup> Ncaph2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) sections to 0%, and the mean voxel intensity from vehicle-treated sections to 100%.</p><p>Images of embryonic whole-mount cryosections were acquired in 2D using a Zeiss Axioscan Z1 with a Plan-Apochomat 40 × 0.95 Korr M27 objective and an Axiocam 506 camera using DAPI channel as focus. Images were acquired in Zen 3.1 software, and analysed using QuPath 0.3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bankhead et al., 2017</xref>). Five regions per embryo were selected based on lineage marker staining (Cdh1 and Pdgfr), and mean pixel intensity was calculated in the 647 channel, corresponding to Ncaph-AID:Clover detected with an anti-GFP-647 nanobooster. The percentage protein remaining value was then calculated as described for small intestine sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Proteomics data underlying <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> ave been submitted to the PRIDE database under accession PXD032374.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Guillaume Pavlovic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lluis Montoliu (Reviewer #2); Channabasavaiah B Gurumurthy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In agreement with the other two reviewers, we feel that your paper is of high quality without any major comments. This paper also does not appear to require any additional experiments.</p><p>2) A very careful reading of your paper led us to some minor comments mainly related to clarity, presentation, and improving, even more, the Discussion section. I find it interesting that as authors you incorporate these remarks, especially since they are only very minor rewrites of the article and have the potential to improve your paper even more.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript proposes a new technological tool that has good potential but which needs to be confirmed in the future by other studies. That is why it seems particularly interesting in this case that the tools are made easily accessible to the scientific community. The lines generated in this project, in particular, the R26-CAG-LSL-TIR1-9myc lines (before and after the cre deletion of LSL), should thus be deposited in an international repository as https://www.infrafrontier.eu/. This will greatly simplify the evaluation of this technology for other target genes.</p><p>Some of the conclusions are overly assertive (especially when it comes to addressing the drawbacks of this technology). It is only necessary to nuance them (see next).</p><p>I did not find in Appendix S1 / Table S1 the complete nucleotide sequences for the guide RNA target sequences and repair templates as indicated in the manuscript (only found the proteome data). This appendix seems missing.</p><p>This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the system in reducing the expression of the two genes analyzed. However, insufficient arguments are developed on the possible biases of this system:</p><p>• Toxicity of IAA: what is already known and what needs still to be addressed?</p><p>• Leakiness of RosaTir1 (like a creERT vs a creERT2?) in the absence of IAA (as seen in Figure 1 G Ncaph).</p><p>• Specific phenotype from RosaTir1 line, i.e. &quot;off-target&quot; protein degradation by OsTir1: proteome result is a first very positive but insufficient argument: need of RosaTir1 line phenotyping and also proteome data on other organs and compared with wild-type controls (not only mutants with or without IAA). Indeed, the authors failed to generate the constitutive OsTIR1 line and hypothesize an impact of TIR1 on non-specific protein degradation (lines 149-158). The risk of TIr1-related phenotype seems therefore important.</p><p>• Mosaic expression of OsTir1: likely, Tir1 is not expressed in all cells (as no real ubiquitous line exists to date). See one of the following remarks for details.</p><p>• Impact of the integration of AID:Clover sequence in the target gene. C-terminus integration is much more likely to disturb the target gene function than, for example, in a cre system the integration of loxP in intronic sequences. In this paper Ncaph2AID:Clover homozygotes are less fertile and smaller than heterozygote by heterozygote breeding. It is therefore very likely that this line has strong phenotypes. Is the generated Ncaph2AID:Clover allele a hypomorph?</p><p>Although it seems to be unrealistic and inappropriate to ask the authors to answer these questions through experiments in this one article, it seems however indispensable to discuss more in detail these potential issues (and solutions) in the Discussion section. Especially, for the cre and creERT2 systems, the presence of the right control groups will allow to avoid misinterpretations of data. This request seems to me to be particularly important in view of the experience acquired with cre and creERT2 systems where poor (but avoidable) experimental designs have led to wrong interpretations in various publications (see this paper as an example10.1074/jbc.M512373200).</p><p>Page 3 line 65: &quot;DNA manipulations impact protein function slowly&quot;. This is not always the case (see this paper as a contrary example 10.1038/s41598-017-08845-7). It seems more accurate to say: &quot;DNA manipulations impact protein function through kinetics determined by&quot;.</p><p>Result: Rapid degradation of AID-tagged endogenous proteins in primary cells</p><p>• I think it would be clearer to divide this chapter into two from line 115 to 178: creation of the mouse models and then line 179-183: Rapid degradation of AID-tagged endogenous proteins in primary cells.</p><p>• In this first chapter, the phenotypic study of both Ncaph and Ncaph2 lines is far too limited to conclude that there is no damaging phenotype. In the context of this article, the fact that this has not been demonstrated does not diminish the intrinsic interest of the auxin-inducible degrons tool (proof of concept of efficiency not the absence of any drawback of the technology). I think it is however important to remain much more circumspect about the absence of phenotype in the lines and therefore to be more nuanced in the conclusion of this chapter. For example, &quot;essential functions of NCAPH and NCAPH2 147 are largely retained by the tagged&quot; should be nuanced, e.g. &quot;essential functions of NCAPH and NCAPH2 147 may be largely retained by the tagged&quot;.</p><p>• &quot;we conclude that the Rosa26osTir1 transgene did not cause biologically significant levels of auxin-independent degradation for either target protein&quot;. I'm not sure the authors can conclude this. Experiments performed here are not sufficient to demonstrate the absence of leakiness of Rosa26osTir1 transgene in the absence of auxin. The absence of leakiness of the auxin-inducible degrons tool seems to me to be essential to demonstrate, but this is the subject of another paper. Again, in my opinion, the purpose of this one is to lay the foundations for the effectiveness of the approach. Here it does not seem necessary to me to make additional experiments but rather to nuance the results.</p><p>A dedicated figure that details schematically, step by step, how this auxin-inducible degrons tool works in the mouse would be a plus for the reader.</p><p>Figure S1: section B.: M and F below Ncaph and Ncaph2 respectively: it seems it is a typo.</p><p>Figure 2: panels C, D, and E: it may be interesting to indicate the complete genotype of each cell type to facilitate understanding, e.g. Rosa26Tir1/Tir1; NcaphAID:Clover/ AID:Clover.</p><p>Figure 3 B and C. X-axis: the logarithmic scale is unreadable (characters are too small).</p><p>Figure 4 B add Rosa26Tlr1/Tlr1 genotype for greater clarity.</p><p>Figure 5 E: because Gaussian distribution cannot be assessed using a non-parametric test (Mann-Whitney) for statistical analyses.</p><p>Line 147: the data here is not sufficient to be a demonstration of retained function: &quot;essential functions of NCAPH and NCAPH2 147 are largely retained by the tagged&quot;.</p><p>Line 314-328: some small intestine cells and some spermatocytes appeared to be resistant to degradation.</p><p>An additional hypothesis not discussed by the authors is the expression of OsTir1 under the control of the pCAG promoter from the Ros26Tir1 allele. Indeed, if we draw a parallel with so-called &quot;ubiquitous&quot; cre or creERT2 systems, it is clear that no promoter allows constitutive expression in all cell types (e.g. doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00019.2007 or Tg(CAG-Bgeo/ALPP)1Lbe/J and http://mousecre.phenomin.fr/histo/317).</p><p>Line 326: blood-testis barrier hypothesis: This barrier hypothesis preventing molecule entry has also been frequently used for tamoxifen to explain its lack of efficacy in the brain for example (blood-brain barrier).</p><p>In the brain, this hypothesis is defeated by the fact that some specific brain creERT2 deleters work well (e.g. CamK2a-creERT2) and by this paper dosing TAM and derivatives in the brain (doi: 10.3389/fncel.2016.00243). Concerning the blood-testes barrier, we can ask ourselves the same question. This paper DOI: 10.1002/mrd.22772 shows efficiency TAM mediated recombination in caput epididymis. Like tamoxifen, IAA seems to be a small molecule, an expert on the blood-brain barrier could really answer this but I personally see no arguments to prove that a small molecule would not pass the barrier.</p><p>All figures: in the body of the text, the international nomenclatures are strictly applied, but in some figures, it would be necessary to check the nomenclatures of the genes (especially italics).</p><p>Line 344: I do not believe that the current level of validation of the auxin-inducible degrons tool allows being certain that it is a widely applicable approach. I think it is more accurate to say, for example, &quot;In this paper, we describe an approach that opens up new possibilities for studying the consequences of acute protein loss in mammalian primary cells, tissues and whole organisms.&quot;</p><p>Line 374-390: see the same point in the results, your assumptions are possible but not the only ones. Here we can rely on the knowledge of creERT2 systems to flesh out the hypotheses explaining the lack of efficiency in certain cell types: again is the OsTir1 transgene expressed or sufficiently expressed in non-responder cells?</p><p>Line 391: saturation of the system: this chapter raises the question of the use of this approach for highly expressed genes.</p><p>Line 414: &quot;That leaky degradation did not cause problems in our study&quot; the proteomic data are only done on CD8<sup>+</sup> cells comparing mutants with or without IAA and only for Ncaph2. It is therefore far from having a global vision: this point must be nuanced.</p><p>Line 418: &quot;If leaky degradation were a problem for other target proteins, this could be kept to a minimum through the use of Rosa26Tir1 heterozygotes&quot;. Without doing the experiment it is difficult to really give strength to this suggestion.</p><p>Again, your system is likely very close to a creERT2 approach in its biases. To properly evaluate a phenotype using auxin-inducible degrons tool, you will need at least 5 control groups (wt, wt + IAA, RosaTir, TargetAID:Clover; RosaTir + TargetAID:Clover + vehicle) in addition to the experimental group (RosaTir + TargetAID:Clover + IAA). To carry all these controls on a whole project becomes very complicated, very expensive, and requires a lot of animals (3R) but it seems also important to discuss the need for these controls.</p><p>Line 433: if the LSL cassette of your R26-CAG-LSL-TIR1-9myc line is not leaking (good transcription stop which prevents the expression of TIR protein in the presence of the LSL cassette), this line can be crossed with a well-characterized cre tissue-specific transgenic. You will end up with a triple transgenic, it is far from being simple to use and requires good controls but it is also a possibility opened by your approach.</p><p>Line 495 loxp = loxP.</p><p>Line 504 delete wild.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a beautiful sophisticated study, technically demanding but brilliantly solved, with a systematic stepwise approach, with adequate control experiments documenting every single compound and variable to be considered, which is applied to address a biological question: the role of some specific proteins present in consendin chromosomal complexes. The results obtained suggest that not all cell types and developmental stages are sensitive to the degradation of these otherwise considered essential proteins. Some cells appear to overcome the absence of these degraded proteins in order to complete their cell cycle processes. This novel finding also suggests the existence of additional compensatory mechanisms, yet to be understood, that might exist in some cells and would require further studies.</p><p>I do not have further suggestions for the authors. I consider this is a well-designed, performed, and interpreted study, prudently alerting of the potential limitations of this approach. The conclusions provided by the authors are aligned to their results and do not oversell the method, as seen in other innovative techniques that fail to be replicated. I anticipate this AID system will have a significant impact on molecular and developmental biology studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77987.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript proposes a new technological tool that has good potential but which needs to be confirmed in the future by other studies.

Indeed, the authors failed to generate the constitutive OsTIR1 line and hypothesize an impact of TIR1 on non-specific protein degradation (lines 149-158). The risk of TIr1-related phenotype seems therefore important.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the following statements to address the need for more comprehensive phenotypic characterization after the section describing the mouse line generation:</p><p>Line 208:</p><p>“We conclude that the Rosa26<sup>Tir1</sup> transgene did not cause levels of auxin-independent degradation that were sufficient to induce overt phenotypes in combination with either of the AID-tagged target proteins studied here.

As shown below, the expression of TIR1 in relevant tissues appears to be sufficient to facilitate target protein degradation. However, further characterizations are required to detail the expression pattern of TIR1 at tissue and single-cell levels to comprehensively characterize the TIR1 knock-in mouse lines and facilitate broader applications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Impact of the integration of AID:Clover sequence in the target gene. C-terminus integration is much more likely to disturb the target gene function than, for example, in a cre system the integration of loxP in intronic sequences. In this paper Ncaph2AID:Clover homozygotes are less fertile and smaller than heterozygote by heterozygote breeding. It is therefore very likely that this line has strong phenotypes. Is the generated Ncaph2AID:Clover allele a hypomorph?</p><p>Although it seems to be unrealistic and inappropriate to ask the authors to answer these questions through experiments in this one article, it seems however indispensable to discuss more in detail these potential issues (and solutions) in the Discussion section. Especially, for the cre and creERT2 systems, the presence of the right control groups will allow to avoid misinterpretations of data. This request seems to me to be particularly important in view of the experience acquired with cre and creERT2 systems where poor (but avoidable) experimental designs have led to wrong interpretations in various publications (see this paper as an example10.1074/jbc.M512373200).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have addressed this point in the extended Discussion section, as detailed in our response to the first point (see line 524).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 3 line 65: &quot;DNA manipulations impact protein function slowly&quot;.

In the context of this article, the fact that this has not been demonstrated does not diminish the intrinsic interest of the auxin-inducible degrons tool (proof of concept of efficiency not the absence of any drawback of the technology). I think it is however important to remain much more circumspect about the absence of phenotype in the lines and therefore to be more nuanced in the conclusion of this chapter. For example, &quot;essential functions of NCAPH and NCAPH2 147 are largely retained by the tagged&quot; should be nuanced, e.g. &quot;essential functions of NCAPH and NCAPH2 147 may be largely retained by the tagged&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have implemented this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• &quot;we conclude that the Rosa26osTir1 transgene did not cause biologically significant levels of auxin-independent degradation for either target protein&quot;. I'm not sure the authors can conclude this. Experiments performed here are not sufficient to demonstrate the absence of leakiness of Rosa26osTir1 transgene in the absence of auxin. The absence of leakiness of the auxin-inducible degrons tool seems to me to be essential to demonstrate, but this is the subject of another paper. Again, in my opinion, the purpose of this one is to lay the foundations for the effectiveness of the approach. Here it does not seem necessary to me to make additional experiments but rather to nuance the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have modified this section to address this point as follows (Line 208):</p><p><bold>“</bold>We conclude that the Rosa26<sup>Tir1</sup> transgene did not cause levels of auxin-independent degradation that were sufficient to induce overt phenotypes in combination with either of the AID-tagged target proteins studied here.

Indeed, if we draw a parallel with so-called &quot;ubiquitous&quot; cre or creERT2 systems, it is clear that no promoter allows constitutive expression in all cell types (e.g. doi:10.1152/physiolgenomics.00019.2007 or Tg(CAG-Bgeo/ALPP)1Lbe/J and http://mousecre.phenomin.fr/histo/317).</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point with modified text (Line 169), as detailed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 326: blood-testis barrier hypothesis: This barrier hypothesis preventing molecule entry has also been frequently used for tamoxifen to explain its lack of efficacy in the brain for example (blood-brain barrier).</p><p>In the brain, this hypothesis is defeated by the fact that some specific brain creERT2 deleters work well (e.g. CamK2a-creERT2) and by this paper dosing TAM and derivatives in the brain (doi: 10.3389/fncel.2016.00243). Concerning the blood-testes barrier, we can ask ourselves the same question. This paper DOI: 10.1002/mrd.22772 shows efficiency TAM mediated recombination in caput epididymis. Like tamoxifen, IAA seems to be a small molecule, an expert on the blood-brain barrier could really answer this but I personally see no arguments to prove that a small molecule would not pass the barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>The comparison with CRE-ERT2 is interesting, but Tamoxifen and IAA are different molecules (size is not the only determinant of BBB permeability) so we don’t consider this informative to discuss here.</p><p>We previously stated (Line 386) “we speculate that the blood-testes barrier could prevent IAA from entering seminiferous tubules to effect protein degradation, although cell intrinsic barriers to degradation cannot be excluded”.
