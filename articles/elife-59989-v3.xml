all parts of the cell. It is driven by an oscillator whose various components are localized in the nucleus, centrosome, and cytoplasm. In principle, the cellular location with the fastest intrinsic rhythm should act as a pacemaker for the process. Here we traced the waves of tubulin polymerization and depolymerization that occur at mitotic entry and exit in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts back to their origins. We found that mitosis was commonly initiated at sperm-derived nuclei and their accompanying centrosomes. The cell cycle was ~20% faster at these initiation points than in the slowest regions of the extract. Nuclei produced from phage DNA, which did not possess centrosomes, also acted as trigger wave sources, but purified centrosomes in the absence of nuclei did not. We conclude that the nucleus accelerates mitotic entry and propose that it acts as a pacemaker for cell cycle.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>Cdk1</kwd><kwd>trigger waves</kwd><kwd>bistability</kwd><kwd>pacemaker</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM110564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrell</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM131792</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ferrell</surname><given-names>James E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM120286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buss</surname><given-names>Garrison K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Just as the sinoatrial node acts as pacemaker for the heart, the nucleus acts as pacemaker for the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryonic cell cycle.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitotic entry is driven by a circuit of proteins that regulates cyclin-dependent protein kinase-1 (Cdk1) and its opposing phosphatases. The circuit includes at least five interlinked positive and double-negative feedback loops and functions as a bistable toggle switch, which transitions from a stable interphase state with low Cdk1 activity and high PP2A-B55 activity, to a stable M-phase state with high Cdk1 activity and low PP2A-B55 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sha et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pomerening et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mochida et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vinod et al., 2013</xref>). In some contexts, like the <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> embryonic cell cycle, the cell cycle operates as a relaxation oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsai et al., 2008</xref>), with the bistable trigger firing, and the cell cycle repeating, with a precise (Â±Â a few percent) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Newport and Kirschner, 1982a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Newport and Kirschner, 1982b</xref>) fixed period.</p><p>Systems with a bistable trigger have the potential to generate trigger waves, propagating fronts of activity that spread outward from a source without slowing down or diminishing in amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tyson and Keener, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelens et al., 2014</xref>). Familiar examples of biological trigger waves include the action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodgkin and Huxley, 1952</xref>), calcium waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornell-Bell et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilkey et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stricker, 1999</xref>), and apoptotic waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Ferrell, 2018</xref>). As predicted in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Novak and Tyson, 1993</xref>), mitosis spreads through the cytoplasm via constant velocity (~60 Âµm/min) trigger waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>).</p><p>A trigger wave typically originates from wherever the oscillator has the fastest intrinsic rhythm. For example, heartbeats originate at the sinoatrial node, which has a typical frequency of 60â90 min<sup>â1</sup> in humans, and spread to and override the slower rhythms of the atrioventricular node (whose intrinsic frequency is 40â60 min<sup>â1</sup>) and ventricles (30â40 min<sup>â1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pappano and Wier, 2019</xref>).</p><p>At present, it is uncertain where mitotic trigger waves begin. Plausible candidates include the centrosome, where cyclin B1-Cdk1 and Cdc25C have been found to concentrate in late interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>); the nucleus, to which cyclin B1-Cdk1 and Cdc25C translocate just prior to prometaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagting et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos et al., 2012</xref>); or the cytoplasm, since cyclin A2-Cdk1/2 may shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasm late in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Boer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pines and Hunter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meraldi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, studies with FRET probes microinjected into mammalian cells have suggested that mitosis might be initiated in all parts of the cell essentially simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gavet and Pines, 2010</xref>). This may well be true for somatic cells, where distances are on the order of 10 Âµm, whereas in larger cells like frog eggs it is clear that mitotic events happen in different parts of the cell at different times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hara et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>Here we set out to determine which subcellular compartment serves as the pacemaker for mitotic oscillations, through video microscopy studies of cycling <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts in a 96-well plate format.

During interphase, the NLS-mCherry accumulates in the reconstituted nuclei, and it disperses when the nuclear envelope breaks down at the onset of mitosis. SiR-tubulin is a docetaxel derivative that increases in fluorescence when bound to microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">LukinaviÄius et al., 2014</xref>), allowing visualization of the oscillation between interphase (high microtubules) and mitotic (low microtubules) arrays. Oscillations in microtubule fluorescence were temporally coupled with the cycles of NLS-mCherry accumulation and dispersion, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>).</p><p>After warming to room temperature, the extract began to self-organize into cell-like compartments (e.g. <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top left image; SiR-tubulin fluorescence is shown in red) (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng and Ferrell, 2019</xref>). During the first interphase, this organization occurred only around sperm and/or centrosomes. The partially-organized extract then underwent mitosis, as detected by a decrease in the overall concentration of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As the extract exited mitosis and entered the second interphase, the entire well self-organized into cell-like compartments, even in regions that were not near sperm and/or centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, second row).

Notably, only sperm-associated compartments, with their centrosomes, divided.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spatial dynamics of mitotic initiation</title><p>The first mitosis in the extract shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref> occurred in a nearly concerted manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, top row), with mitosis spreading quickly and irregularly through the whole well. Similar results were reported for extracts imaged in Teflon tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>). This spread most likely represents a phase waveâa type of wave that arises from differences (in this case small differences) in intrinsic timing rather than spatial coupling, like the waves of flashing lights on a movie marquee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tyson and Keener, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Winfree, 1974</xref>). Mitotic waves in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo have also been attributed to phase waves of Cdk1 activity, and theory predicts a switch from phase waves to trigger waves as the cell cycle slows down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vergassola et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, during the second cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, second row) and subsequent cycles, mitosis generally initiated from well-defined sources and spread outward via regular circular waves of microtubule depolymerization. These waves expanded with constant speed and could be seen as linear fronts on kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For example, at the start of mitosis 2 in this experiment, waves of microtubule depolymerization originated in the vicinity of two nuclei and spread outward at a speed of 65 Âµm/min, similar to previously-reported mitotic wave speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>). This was followed about 10 min later by a slower (40 Âµm/min) wave of microtubule polymerization that initiated from a microtubule aster in the same location.</p><p>For 33 events from different experiments where mitotic waves clearly emerged from newly-formed nuclei, we produced radial kymographs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> shows the average of the 33 kymographs. The mitotic wave velocity was 54Â Â±Â 13 Âµm/min (mean Â± S.D.), similar to speeds reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>). The microtubule polymerization waves at the beginning of interphase were slower, with a mean velocity of 32Â Â±Â 6 Âµm/min. This velocity is similar to that reported by Ishihara and colleagues for aster growth (22Â Â±Â 3 Âµm/min) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ishihara et al., 2016</xref>). The waves of microtubule depolymerization and repolymerization are taken to be trigger waves, and the constant speed at which they expand is determined by the rate at which the biochemical reactions of the bistable mitotic trigger proceed and the rate at which the mitotic regulators diffuse locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tyson and Keener, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Showalter and Tyson, 1987</xref>).</p><p>As the nuclei and their associated centrosomes divided and separated, so did the trigger wave sources (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>). This underscores the tight correlation between one or both of these structures and the trigger wave sources.</p><p>The qualitative behavior present here was commonly seen in other replicates, but not in all. Replicates that did not follow this general pattern typically either ceased cycling after a few cycles, possibly due to apoptosis, failed to form nuclei until later cycles, or showed trigger waves only during later cycles. Data from all experiments used for this study have been deposited in the Stanford Digital Repository and are available for examination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Trigger wave sources</title><p>In the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1âvideo 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1âvideo 2</xref>, mitosis initiated primarily from where nuclei and their associated centrosomes were located. However, this was not always the case. For example, sometimes mitosis began at a location at the edge of the well, with no nearby nucleus present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This phenomenon has been noted previously in studies of mitotic trigger waves and apoptotic trigger waves in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Ferrell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forbes et al., 1983</xref>), and it is seen in mathematical models of trigger waves as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nolet et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, there are at least two types of sources: nuclear sources and edge sources. Both nuclear and edge sources generally produced well-defined, circular or semicircular, respectively, trigger wave fronts.</p><p>Mitosis also sometimes initiated from locations that were neither close to a nucleus nor to the edge of the well (denoted âotherâ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These âotherâ sources were often seen in the first mitosis (before the extract was fully organized) and late in subsequent mitoses, and they usually did not generate well-defined circular waves.

Mitotic waves were taken to be fronts of microtubule depolymerization that expanded from one frame to the next. By this definition, for the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, there were 11 mitotic waves by the 38 min time point. Note that initially (at 35 min) there had been numerous microtubule-depleted areas that superficially resembled mitotic regions but did not expand with time, and so these were not classified as mitotic. The centroid of a mitotic region in its first frame was generally taken to be the mitotic source. There were a few instances where the region was dumbbell-shaped; in these cases we considered mitosis to have originated nearly simultaneously from two distinct sources.</p><p>We then constructed heat maps to show when mitosis began at different locations in the well for each cell cycle. The darker the color, the earlier the time at which mitosis happened at that source. The heat map for the cycle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and for comparison, the heat maps for 10 cycles from the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> are shown as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>We identified mitotic sources for each cycle and sorted them into three classesânuclear sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, orange), edge sources, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, red), and other sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue). We also identified the last 15% of the pixels to enter mitosis, which often were regions that appeared not to have been entrained by a trigger wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, green). We used these late pixels as a benchmark and expressed the time at which mitotic entry was advanced at the various trigger wave sources relative to these late regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mitotic sources are often associated with nuclei and/or centrosomes</title><p><xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2âvideo 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> show how the sources evolved through the first 9 cycles of the experiment used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>. In the first cycle, most of the extract entered mitosis at about the same time. Numerous mitotic sources were identified, mostly in the âotherâ (blue) category, and the sources tended to have entered mitosis only slightly earlier than the surrounding cytoplasm. By the third cycle, nuclei had appeared, and many of them acted as sources for trigger waves. These nuclear sources did not appear to generally be positioned where the âotherâ sources had been in the initial cycle; they were new sources rather than stronger versions of the initial sources. By the ninth cycle, the strongest nuclear trigger wave sources entrained large areas, whereas most of âotherâ sources had disappeared.</p><p>We repeated the automated procedure for 107 cycles from 25 different experiments. Overall, 717/3140 (23%) of the sources were close (&lt;100 Âµm) to nuclei and their accompanying centrosomes. This proportion wasÂ ~5 times higher than would be expected by random chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). To further test the robustness of this association, we calculated p-values by bootstrapping for each of the cycles individually. In 69/107 of the cycles, the number of trigger wave sources found to be close (&lt;100 Âµm) to a nucleus was greater than would be expected by chance (p&lt;0.05) (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), supporting the significance of the association between trigger wave sources and nuclei/centrosomes. As the cell cycles proceeded, the proportion of trigger waves that emanated from nuclei/centrosomes rose (as did the number of nuclei), and the proportion not associated with any obvious structure fell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The âbestâ trigger wave sources (those that were in the earliest 10% of sources to appear in a cycle, which were also the sources that controlled the largest areas of cytoplasm) were generally associated with nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The cell cycle is accelerated by ~20% in the vicinity of nuclear sources</title><p>By definition, mitotic sources are regions where the cell cycle is faster than it is in the surrounding cytoplasm. One way to estimate how much faster the cycles are is to look at early cycles where trigger waves are present in some of the well, but have not taken over the whole well, and compare the timing of the cell cycle at the trigger wave sources to that at the slower, unentrained regions. For example, in the kymograph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, at the onset of mitosis 2 there are two trigger wave sources, one near the top of the kymograph and one approximately 800 Âµm below the middle of the kymograph. The time from the start of M1 to the start of M2 at the two trigger wave sources was 35 and 39 min, respectively, whereas the slowest regions in the middle and at the bottom of the kymograph had cycles of 46 and 48 min, indicating that the cell cycle is on the order ofÂ ~10 min orÂ ~20% faster at the nuclear trigger wave sources than in these slowest region.</p><p>The same type of analysis can be extended from the one-dimensional kymograph slice to the whole two-dimensional area of a well using the heat map representation. For the cycle shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, the time courses of the changes in tubulin intensity at each of the mitotic sources and in the benchmark unentrained region are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>. The latest regions of the cytoplasm for this experiment had an average cell-cycle duration of 40.5Â Â±Â 0.5 min (mean Â± S.D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, green). Mitotic sources that were in proximity to nuclei entered mitosis 10.1Â Â±Â 1.4 min earlier, whereas most of the âotherâ sources and the edge-associated sources were advanced by lesser amounts (3.4Â Â±Â 2.1 min and 3.5Â Â±Â 2.9 min, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H</xref>). Thus, the nuclei and/or centrosomes appeared to be the most effective pacemakers, and they accelerated the cell cycle by 25 Â± 3% in this experiment.</p><p>The same trend was seen in the aggregated data from 22 experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), with mitosis beginning from the nucleus-associated trigger wave sources 10Â Â±Â 4.4 min early, which is 20% quicker than the slowest regions of the well. Other classes of sources were accelerated by smaller amounts (3.5Â Â±Â 3.4 min for edge-associated sources and 2.9Â Â±Â 2.2 min for other sources, mean Â± S.D.). These findings indicate that either the nucleus, the associated centrosomes, or the two structures together are particularly effective at accelerating the cell cycle and acting as a pacemaker structure. All told, 85% of the sources that accelerated mitosis by more than 10 min were nucleus-associated.</p><p>In summary, trigger waves that arise in the vicinity of nuclei and their associated centrosomes accelerate the cell cycle by approximately 10 min or 20%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Edge-associated sources are accelerated to a lesser extent</title><p>We next compared the behavior of these sperm-containing extracts to extracts with no added sperm chromatin, to determine where, in the absence of nuclei and centrosomes, mitosis was likely to originate.

During the second interphase, cell-like compartments appeared, and two relatively strong edge sources emerged (at positions 12:00 and 1:00 on the heat map). These two edge sources grew to dominate the mitotic dynamics over the next several cycles; the self-organizing character of trigger waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gelens et al., 2014</xref>) is particularly apparent in these experiments where new sources are not being generated from nuclear division.

The acceleration seen in the phage DNA experiments may be an underestimate; the nuclear sources initially present in the phage-supplemented extracts were so numerous that little if any of the extract appeared to not be entrained by a trigger wave. Alternatively, it is possible that nuclei formed around phage DNA have somewhat slower intrinsic rhythms than nuclei formed around sperm chromatin, or that nuclei lacking centrosomes have slower rhythms than nuclei that possess them.</p><p>To test this third possibility, we incubated extracts with purified HeLa cell centrosomes plus phage DNA and assessed mitotic dynamics. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5âvideo 2</xref>, the centrosomes facilitated the organization of the extract and allowed the cell-like compartments to divide, as expected. However, it appears that the presence of centrosomes had slowed down the acceleration of the cell cycle by the phage DNA to 4.1Â Â±Â 2.5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) as measured by the Îcycle times in 12 experiments. Thus, if there an additional effect of having centrosomes present as a staging platform for mitosis, it is too subtle for this type of analysis to detect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we used <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and reconstitution to determine what structure acts as pacemaker for the mitotic oscillator. We found that nuclei that were formed from <italic>Xenopus</italic> sperm chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>) or phage DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) acted as robust sources of mitotic trigger waves. This could be attributed to an acceleration of the cell cycle by about 10 min. In the absence of nuclei, added centrosomes facilitated the organization of cell-like compartments and allowed the cell-like compartments to divide, but had little ability to act as trigger wave sources (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that the nucleus normally serves as the cell-cycle pacemaker. It seems plausible that the ability of the nucleus to concentrate Cdc25C and cyclin B-Cdk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pines and Hunter, 1991</xref>) could be the mechanistic basis for the pacemaking, although a direct experimental test of this hypothesis has not yet been carried out.</p><p>These studies underscore that diverse biological processes, for example heart beats and cell cycles, may occur on different time scales (~1 s vs. ~40 min) and involve different classes of proteins (ion channels vs. kinases, phosphatases, and ubiquitin ligases), but share an underlying unity in terms of their systems-level logic. In both cases the rhythms are generated by a relaxation oscillator circuit with a bistable trigger, and in both cases this allows the rhythm to spread in an orderly fashion from a spatially-distinct pacemaker locus via trigger waves.</p><p>That said, mechanisms other than trigger waves can be responsible for spatiotemporal activity waves, even in the regulation of mitosis. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, mitosis sweeps through the embryo, but these waves have been attributed to a pre-existing spatial gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deneke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vergassola et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, even in this system, the ingredients required for trigger wavesâbistability plus a local coupling mechanismâare present, and it is predicted that the phase waves become trigger waves when the cycle slows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vergassola et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>What might be the advantages to a cell for having mitosis spread from a nuclear pacemaker as opposed to, say, from a focus on the cell periphery, or from some random position in the cytoplasm? It is possible that the mechanics of mitosis are more reliable when nuclear events such as chromatin condensation occur prior to cytoplasmic events such as the fragmentation of the endoplasmic reticulum and cortical events such as cell rounding. Alternatively, it is possible that the cell is simply taking advantage of the partitioning of mitotic regulators between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (e.g. Myt1 and PP2A are cytoplasmic whereas Wee1 and Gwl are nuclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heald et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mueller et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2016</xref>]) to add a spatial switch to the reactions of mitotic initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Santos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferrell, 1998</xref>). Just as reaction dynamics (e.g. bistability) can give rise to spatial patterns (e.g. trigger waves), spatial factors (e.g. regulated translocation) can contribute to reaction dynamics.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, Nolet and colleagues published a paper that also argues that nuclei function as cell-cycle pacemakers in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts, based on a combination of theory and experiments in a one-dimensional extract system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nolet et al., 2020</xref>). Our work agrees with, complements, and extends their findings by directly assessing the contribution of the centrosome to the pacemaker function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background</td><td valign="top"><italic>Xenopus laevis</italic></td><td valign="top">NASCO</td><td valign="top">LM00535MX</td><td valign="top">female</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line</td><td valign="top">HeLa centrin-GFP</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tsou and Stearns, 2006</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">GST-NLS-mCherry</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chang and Ferrell, 2013</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">SiR-tubulin</td><td valign="top">Spirochrome</td><td valign="top">CY-SC002</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">aphidicolin</td><td valign="top">Calbiochem</td><td valign="top">CAS 38966-21-1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Î»-DNA</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">N3011S</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">custom-made Matlab scripts</td><td valign="top">available at <break/><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://purl.stanford.edu/fm814ch0699">https://purl.stanford.edu/fm814ch0699</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top">demembranated sperm</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murray, 1991</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Extract preparation</title><p>Frog handling and egg extract preparation is as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chang and Ferrell, 2018</xref>, except that the extract was typically clarified 3 times for 8 min at 16,000 g to improve optical transparency.

The authors build on previous findings from their group showing the existence of mitotic waves in <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts and the ability of extracts to organize their cytoplasm in structures resembling those observed in syncytia (see energids in fly embryos). By analyzing the timing and pattern of mitosis in two-dimensional extracts the authors conclude that mitosis starts at the nucleus. This is an interesting finding and the experiments described in the paper are creative and well-executed. However, there are two important points (points 1 and 2) where the presentation of this paper needs to be improved as well as few more minor points where some discussion might be interesting.</p><p>1) The authors contrast their results to previous findings from the Pines' group which found no difference in the activity of Cdk1 in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, there is a likely possibility that the difference in the findings of this paper to the previous study by Pines' group can be explained by the largely different spatial dimensions of the two systems. It is possible that nuclear and cytoplasmic dynamics are correlated over small spatial scales but not large ones. This should be acknowledged. The importance of (individual) nuclei might become predominant in systems where inter-nuclear distances are very large.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that in the early stages of their extracts, waves are fast with several origins. They use this observation to argue that those waves might be phase waves. A mechanism for the generation of phase waves by gradients of Cdk1 activity has been described by Vergassola et al., 2018. This paper should be cited, and the possible explanation acknowledged. Notice that the recent paper by Nolet et al., also likely observed a similar transition from phase (sweep) waves to trigger waves.</p><p>3) Figure 1F shows that the nuclei in the extract are unable to self-organize in a regular pattern and generate regions of very different nuclear densities. It would be interesting to point this out and contrasts to systems like the fly embryo where nuclei self-organize in equally-spaced pattern. Are the nuclei just amplifying inhomogeneity in the initial conditions?</p><p>4) In Figure 2D the authors compared the probability of observing a source at a given distance from a nucleus and see that sources are enriched near nuclei. This is convincing. However, I wonder whether a model in which the sources are randomly distributed is too conservative. Ultimately, when nuclei are very sparse it might take forever for them to spread a wave to a region that is far away. Probably an analysis that keeps that into account would give stronger statistics.</p><p>5) It would be nice if the statement that the wave of mitotic exit travels slower than the one of mitotic entry was quantified in some statistical way. What are the error bars on the wave speeds?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper studies the initiation of mitotic (trigger) waves through in vitro experiments. The main conclusions overlap with the recent paper by Nolet et al.,: the nucleus serves as a pacemaker that triggers waves and speeds up the cell cycle. Nevertheless, I find the Results of the current paper more direct and compelling. Nolet et al., work in an effectively 1D system, in contrast to the 2D system here. The data analysis of the current paper is fully automated, in contrast to that of Nolet et al., which was hard to parse. Most importantly, here the data analysis involves little modeling, relying instead on basic statistical analysis. In contrast, Nolet et al., have to resort to simulations of rather complex mathematical models in order to validate their conclusions.</p><p>The authors show that nuclei are significantly more likely to be wave initiation centers, and that this effect becomes more pronounced in later cycles. They also perform beautiful experiments in which they decouple the relative contributions of centrosomes from nuclei (again, well beyond what was achieved in the Nolet et al., paper), thereby showing that nuclei help initiate waves and speed up the cell cycle, while the centrosomes play a role in forming compartments. Overall, the paper is clearly written and accessible, and the results are of broad interest. For these reasons, I recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Entry into and exit from mitosis is driven by activation and inactivation of Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), respectively. It was previously demonstrated that Cdk1 activation in cell free frog egg extracts occurs as a bistable &quot;trigger wave&quot; and proposed, based on analysis of surface contraction waves in intact <italic>Xenopus</italic> eggs that the nucleus acts as a pacemaker for such waves (Chang and Ferrell,, 2013). A very recent study (Nolet et al., 2020) tested this hypothesis and concluded that, yes, nuclei do indeed serve as pacemakers for Cdk1 waves in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and thus, presumably, intact cells as well.</p><p>In the current study, Afanzar et al., confirm the results of the recent e<italic>Life</italic> paper using the same basic approach (ie imaging Cdk1 waves in frog egg extracts containing nuclei and a probe for nuclear assembly) but with several differences in the assays and the manipulations. The assay differences of most interest are that Afanzar use a fluorescent microtubule binding probe for all of their experiments and use a quasi-2D environment (the bottom of wells in 96-well plates) whereas Nolet et al., (the authors of the recent paper) used nuclei themselves and quasi-1D environments (tubes of varying widths). The use of fluorescent tubulin and the 2D environment makes visualization of the waves quite straightforward and, because microtubules will cycle in the absence of nuclei or centrosomes, doing experiments with and without added nuclei or centrosomes is also straightforward. The manipulation differences of most interest are that Afanzar et al., included experiments with purified centrosomes and purified centrosomes mixed with phage DNA which, in principle, made it easier to rule out the centrosome as the pacemaker.</p><p>Afanzar et al., make a convincing case that nuclei do indeed serve as pacemakers in the extract system, thus confirming the results of Nolet et al. Afanzar et al., also clearly demonstrate that centrosomes alone do not serve as pacemakers, a point directly addressed by Nolet et al., and one other feature stands out: Afanzar et al., provide a welcome description of the rich variability of the system, which is made possible by the microtubule probe and the 2D environment. Thus, we learn that phase waves can coexist (in the same extract) with trigger waves, we learn that the trigger waves can arise at the edge of the well, and we learn that in the complete absence of added nuclei, mitotic sources can develop spontaneously and persist for several cell cycles.</p><p>I have one experimental suggestion. The results with the phage DNA-generated nuclei are puzzling in that while these can clearly serve as mitotic sources, they just as clearly have a far more modest effect in terms of cell cycle acceleration than the demembranated sperm. Consequently, it could be argued that while isolated centrosomes alone cannot serve as mitotic sources, a centrosome closely opposed to a nucleus makes it a better source. Unfortunately, the experiment where the phage DNA and the purified centrosomes are combined doesn't really help, in that there is no evidence that the two are close to each other once added to the extract, as they would be in a real cell or, for that matter, an extract seeded with demembranated sperm.</p><p>If, however, the authors were able to block centrosome replication by adding a pharmacological inhibitor of centriole replication (e.g. centrinone), and if centrosomes are completely superfluous, it would be expected that the mitotic sources that develop after several cell cycles in sperm-supplemented extras would be just as enthusiastic as those formed in the absence of the replication inhibitor.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The nucleus serves as the pacemaker for the cell cycle&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

As suggested, we now cite the two Vergassola/Di Talia et al., papers on <italic>Drosphila</italic> Cdk1 waves in the Results and in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F shows that the nuclei in the extract are unable to self-organize in a regular pattern and generate regions of very different nuclear densities. It would be interesting to point this out and contrasts to systems like the fly embryo where nuclei self-organize in equally-spaced pattern. Are the nuclei just amplifying inhomogeneity in the initial conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>Right when we put nuclei into an extract at low concentrations. On the other hand, if you put nuclei in an extract at high enough concentrations, they do end up migrating on microtubules and forming a fairly regularly spaced array of cell-like compartments with nuclei, sometimes with multiple nuclei per cell-like compartment. This is discussed in detail in Cheng and Ferrell, 2019. We think that this regime may be more like what is happening in the fly embryo.</p><p>Likewise, in the experiments we present here, as the nuclei divide the daughter nuclei form a regularly spaced area of cell like compartments much as they do in the fly embryo (e.g. what was Figure 1F and is now Figure 1C). So, the nuclei do not spread out evenly through the whole area of the well, but in the part of the well where there are nuclei, they do end up positioned in a regular way.</p><p>The nuclei do amplify inhomogeneity; the mitotic wave sources get âdeeperâ, in the topographic map sense, as the cycles proceed. However, it is not clear they amplify initial inhomogeneity. There is not always an obvious connection between where mitosis initiates in the first cycle, before nuclei have formed, and the positions of the nuclear sources in the subsequent cycles. Take Figure 2C for example. In the first mitosis, there are numerous shallow sources, some at the boundary (red) and some not associated with an obvious structure (blue). Then by mitosis 3, there are nuclei present, and the âdeepestâ sources are associated with nuclei. But the nuclear are not generally positioned where initial blue sources were. So, the pair of nuclear sources near the edge at 11:00, the pair at 2:00, the single deep source at 4:00, and the single deep source at 7:00, all reside in regions where there was no source in mitosis 1.</p><p>We now point this out in subsection âMitotic sources are often associated with nuclei and/or centrosomesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 2D the authors compared the probability of observing a source at a given distance from a nucleus and see that sources are enriched near nuclei. This is convincing. However, I wonder whether a model in which the sources are randomly distributed is too conservative. Ultimately, when nuclei are very sparse it might take forever for them to spread a wave to a region that is far away. Probably an analysis that keeps that into account would give stronger statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>The bootstrapping results seem pretty easy to understand. We are not sure how to implement the non-random source model the reviewer suggests. If you think this would be helpful for the revised paper, could you explain further what you are thinking here?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It would be nice if the statement that the wave of mitotic exit travels slower than the one of mitotic entry was quantified in some statistical way. What are the error bars on the wave speeds?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now include averages and standard deviations for the mitotic entry wave speed and the aster growth speed (subsection âSpatial dynamics of mitotic initiationâ). We also added a new figure panel (Figure 1F) that shows averaged entry and exit waves from 33 mitoses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Entry into and exit from mitosis is driven by activation and inactivation of Cyclin dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), respectively.
