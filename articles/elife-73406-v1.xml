Little is known about the function of feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex.

NG cells fire much earlier than HZ cells following odor onset, a difference that can be attributed to the faster odor-driven excitatory synaptic drive that NG cells receive from the olfactory bulb. As a result, NG cells strongly but transiently inhibit odor-evoked excitation in layer 2 principal cells, whereas HZ cells provide more diffuse and prolonged feedforward inhibition.

Cortical interneurons are classified into dozens of subtypes with distinctive morphological, transcriptomic, and electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kawaguchi and Kubota, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zeng, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gouwens et al., 2020</xref>). These diverse interneurons are embedded in at least three types of cortical inhibitory circuits – feedforward inhibition, feedback inhibition, and disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kullmann and Lamsa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denève and Machens, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>). Within these three categories there exist numerous variants that implement a variety of neural computations. For example, feedforward and feedback inhibition exert different effects depending on whether the effector interneurons innervate the perisomatic or distal dendritic regions of their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pardi et al., 2020</xref>), and disinhibition can depend on the subtypes of interneurons involved and the origin of their inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In this paper we focus on feedforward inhibition in the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex, and report that a surprising complexity of inhibitory processing is also a feature of this type of inhibition in the paleocortex.</p><p>Feedforward inhibition is conventionally understood as an input-tracking mechanism that does not depend on local circuit activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tremblay et al., 2016</xref>). In the primary neocortex, feedforward inhibition is often mediated by parvalbumin-expressing fast-spiking basket cells localized in the deeper layers that receive direct afferent input from first-order thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beierlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cruikshank et al., 2007</xref>). In this role feedforward inhibition improves sensory discrimination by favoring coincidence detection, but in addition it can provide gain modulation through input normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bruno and Sakmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carandini and Heeger, 2011</xref>). More recently it has been reported that feedforward inhibition is also prominent in layer 1 of the neocortex, where it can engage afferent input from other cortical regions and from higher-order thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>). However, the properties and functions of layer 1 neocortical interneurons have received relatively little attention and remain enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The piriform cortex (PCx) is unusual in that it receives all of its primary afferent input from the olfactory bulb into the superficial part of layer 1 (layer 1a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neville and Haberly, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>). Layer 1a mostly contains the apical dendrites of glutamatergic principal cells located in layers 2 and 3, as well as the somas, axons, and dendrites of two classes of GABAergic interneurons, namely, neurogliaform (NG) cells and horizontal (HZ) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). NG and HZ cells in layer 1a are thus ideally situated to provide feedforward inhibition onto the distal dendrites of layer 2/3 principal cells. Classic work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Biedenbach and Stevens, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haberly, 1973</xref>) as well as more recent studies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luna and Schoppa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sheridan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stokes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Large et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Large et al., 2016b</xref>) have used electrical stimulation to explore some of the basic properties of feedforward inhibition in the PCx. However, less is known about how particular types of interneurons respond to odor stimulation. The existence and importance of odor-evoked inhibition in the PCx has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhan and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>) but the identities and properties of neurons responsible for the different kinds of inhibition are, for the most part, uncertain.</p><p>Here, we approach this question by using two-photon-targeted whole-cell patch clamping and functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to record from visually identified NG and HZ cells in layer 1a of the PCx in vivo. We find that the odor-evoked feedforward inhibition provided by these two types of interneurons is strikingly different: NG cells express a powerful and transient inhibition that begins rapidly after odor onset, whereas HZ cells provide a more diffuse and delayed form of feedforward inhibition. Thus, two distinctive feedforward inhibitory circuits exist in the superficial layer of the PCx, where they are well placed to generate dynamically complex patterns of inhibition in the distal dendrites of principal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interneurons that provide feedforward inhibition in the PCx can be targeted ‘in vivo’</title><p>In this study we took advantage of the simple architecture of the PCx to examine in isolation only those neural circuits that generate feedforward synaptic inhibition. Afferent input from the olfactory bulb via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) to the PCx is strictly confined to layer 1a (L1a) of the PCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Neville and Haberly, 2004</xref>). Hence, only those interneurons with dendrites concentrated in L1a, where they are able to intercept axons from the LOT, are able to generate feedforward inhibition (red cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two such interneuron types have been identified in the PCx, HZ cells and L1a NG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). Conversely, feedback inhibition is largely mediated by interneurons with dendrites concentrated in deeper associational layers, two prominent types being fast-spiking (FS) and regular-spiking (RS) interneurons (blue cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Inhibition is commonly observed at the soma of principal cells in response to odors in vivo (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zhan and Luo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>), although it is not immediately clear whether this inhibition is dominated by feedforward or feedback inhibitory circuits. We decided to explore feedforward inhibition in this study because the relevant interneurons (NG and HZ cells) are close to the cortical surface and more readily accessible to two-photon-targeted patch clamping in vivo.</p><p>In GAD67-GFP (Δneo) mice, NG and HZ cells can readily be distinguished under the two-photon microscope: HZ cells are only found close to the LOT whereas NG cells are distributed throughout L1a; HZ cell somata have an elongated shape whereas NG somata are spherical; and HZ cells express much lower levels of GFP than NG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, top; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010b</xref>). After whole-cell recording, their identities could be confirmed by their dendritic morphology (NG: short, thin, highly branched dendrites; HZ: longer, less branched, often spiny; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom) and distinctive intrinsic electrical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), similar to in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). Thus, we were confident that we could record from identified NG and HZ cells in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NG and HZ cells respond strongly to odors</title><p>We applied up to 15 odorants from a variety of chemical functional groups to urethane-anesthetized mice and measured the voltage responses of identified NG and HZ cells in the anterior PCx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Three features were apparent in these responses: first, both cell types responded to many different odors (i.e. they were broadly tuned); second, regular oscillations in the membrane potential (<italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic>) often became larger in the presence of odor; and third, HZ cells appeared to respond more slowly to odors than did NG cells. Each of these features is examined in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NG and HZ cells are broadly excited by odors</title><p>Our palette of odorants was drawn from a variety of chemical functional groups intended to span a large part of ‘odor space’ (although this term is difficult to define; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ravia et al., 2020</xref>). We measured odor responsiveness by median-filtering each trace to remove action potentials (APs) then testing whether the z-scored <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> amplitude exceeded a positive threshold during the period of odor application (Experimental procedures; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data were analyzed in two different ways: (i) by calculating the fraction of odors that each cell responded to, then averaging across cells (‘cell-averaged index’); and (ii) by calculating the fraction of cells each odor activated, then averaging across odors (‘odor-averaged index’).

To test this idea, we first recorded from NG and HZ cells in slices and applied patterned electrical stimuli to the LOT while pharmacologically blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. For brief trains of stimuli (6 pulses at 40 Hz, modeled on in vivo patterns; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</xref>), the response was the exact opposite of what was required: NG cells facilitated and HZ cells depressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, top).

This stimulus produced a modestly depressing envelope of EPSPs in both NG and HZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, bottom).

In contrast, connectivity between HZ cells was weaker (1/19 = 5.3%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right). To sum up, these connectivity experiments suggest that odor-evoked synaptic inhibition of both NG and HZ cells most likely comes from NG cells after they are excited by the LOT.</p><p>If NG cells are responsible for much of the inhibition of layer 1a interneurons, do NG cells also receive privileged input from the LOT? We addressed this question by making dual whole-cell recordings from an NG and HZ cell in a slice while applying a train of minimal electrical stimuli (five at 20 Hz) to the LOT while pharmacologically blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In some of these experiments (4 out of 7 pairs), a clear plateau region was seen in a plot of EPSC amplitude versus stimulus number as the stimulus strength was progressively increased in small steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom left, stimulus numbers 20–45); this is suggestive of a unitary input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010</xref>). Notably, the EPSC in the NG cell was always much smaller than that in the HZ cell for the first EPSC in the train (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom left and top right). This result did not depend on which cell was closer to the LOT or stimulating electrode (data not shown). A similar effect was seen in the three experiments in which a plateau was not observed (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, because of the characteristic short-term facilitation and depression of LOT inputs to NG and HZ cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>), the imbalance in the strength of LOT inputs to these two cells changed during the train. This effect was quantified by calculating the ratio of the EPSC amplitude in the NG cell to that in the HZ cell for each of the five EPSCs in the train (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom right). For the first EPSC, the mean NG:HZ amplitude ratio was 0.27 ± 0.03 (mean ± standard error of the mean [SEM], <italic>n</italic> = 7 cell pairs), but by the third EPSC this ratio had increased to 1.38 ± 0.32 (significantly different, p = 0.0002, <italic>n</italic> = 7, one-way ANOVA with Tukey; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom right). These results show that NG cells do not receive privileged input from the LOT compared to HZ cells; rather, the reverse is the case for the first EPSC in a train. Later in the train, however, the inputs become more equal. Given the known dynamics of afferent input from the olfactory bulb (i.e. modulated bursts of APs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cang and Isaacson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003</xref>), these results suggest that NG and HZ cells mostly operate in a regime where they receive similar afferent excitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Feedforward inhibition alters the synaptic responsiveness of SP cells</title><p>Lastly, we explored the functional consequences of HZ and NG cell inhibition for one of their major targets, layer 2 superficial pyramidal (SP) cells.

First, NG stimulus recordings were made distant (&gt;400 µm) from the LOT to avoid stimulating HZ cell axons, which are clustered around the LOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). On the other hand, HZ stimulus recordings were made near the LOT, where a mixture of HZ and NG cell axons were likely excited. Second, we warped the stimulus patterns so the respiration trace recorded for each stimulus pattern matched a reference respiration trace (shown in gray, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, bottom; see Materials and methods; a similar approach was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This warping of the time base was done to preserve any respiration-synchronized structure in the stimulus patterns (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) when averaging across different patterns. Such synchronization is apparent in the respiration-locked oscillations in the averaged IPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, black traces). These results show that NG cells generate a large, rapid IPSP in SP cells, whereas HZ cells generate a smaller and more diffuse IPSP that persists beyond the end of odor application.</p><p>In a final series of experiments we examined the effect of these two types of synaptic inhibition on spiking patterns in postsynaptic SP cells. The method described in the previous paragraph was employed, except that a dynamic clamp was used to replay into the SP cell an odor-evoked excitatory postsynaptic conductance (EPSG) that had previously been recorded from an SP cell in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7scode1">Figure 7—source code 1</xref>). Again, the EPSG and all stimulus patterns were warped to match their respiration traces. When injecting the EPSG alone, an in vivo-like train of APs was evoked in the SP cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, black traces). When patterned extracellular stimuli were applied at the same time, eliciting IPSPs, fewer APs were evoked in the SP cell by the EPSG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, blue traces; spikes that dropped out are indicated by red asterisks above the black traces).

We find that both NG cells and HZ cells are broadly excited by different odors, but the time to reach peak excitation is much slower in HZ cells than in NG cells. This difference can be explained by a twofold slower time to peak of the odor-evoked compound EPSC in HZ cells compared to NG cells. Synaptic inhibition of HZ cells by NG cells may also help to suppress early firing of HZ cells, and suggests how lateral inhibition and feedforward inhibition may interact in the same circuit. In addition, these two cell types differ in their oscillatory response to odors, with NG cells showing larger-amplitude respiration-coupled EPSPs during odor sampling. Lastly, we show that NG and HZ cells have distinctive effects on the excitability of downstream pyramidal neurons: NG cells generate powerful inhibition immediately after odor onset, whereas HZ cells exert more diffuse and prolonged inhibition. Our findings reveal different types of inhibitory responses at the first stage of cortical odor processing, and add to a growing understanding of the role of afferent-driven feedforward inhibition in cortical processing more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Khubieh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Use of anesthesia</title><p>Two-photon-targeted patch clamping and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging as implemented in this study required direct access to the surface of the PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Margrie et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>).

Surprisingly, however, these kinetic differences cannot be explained by the properties of short-term synaptic plasticity at LOT synapses, assayed in slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). What might be alternative explanations?</p><p>The LOT is a heterogeneous fiber tract that contains the axons of two distinct types of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb, mitral and tufted cells. Mitral cells have been reported to respond about twofold more slowly to odor stimulation than tufted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>) because of differences in synaptic inhibition in the bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fukunaga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Geramita and Urban, 2017</xref>). An appealing possibility is that mitral and tufted cell axons preferentially target HZ and NG cells, respectively; that is, the delayed odor response of HZ cells may originate in the olfactory bulb rather than at synaptic terminals in the PCx. A difficulty with this idea is that the axons of tufted cells in the dorsal olfactory bulb do not extend far from the LOT and only reach about halfway along the length of the anterior PCx, that is, to ~1 mm anterior to Bregma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Igarashi et al., 2012</xref>). Our in vivo recordings were made close to the LOT but more caudally, around 0.6 mm anterior to Bregma. However, it remains possible that tufted cells in other parts of the olfactory bulb (not just in the dorsal bulb) have a more caudal projection. This hypothesis could be tested in future work.</p><p>A second possible explanation is that HZ cells may receive delayed bulbar input via an intermediary, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haberly and Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McGinley and Westbrook, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kay and Brunjes, 2014</xref>). Although AON axons are sparser in layer 1a than in deeper layers, they are consistently seen there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haberly and Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Russo et al., 2020</xref>). This hypothesis could be tested anatomically or by silencing the AON during odor application.</p><p>A third possibility is that lateral inhibition from NG cells counteracts early excitation in HZ cells, delaying depolarization. In support of this idea, NG cells profusely innervate HZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and an odor-evoked hyperpolarization with the right time course can be observed in HZ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, NG cells receive facilitating excitatory input from the LOT, driving them at least as strongly as HZ cells during the bursts of spikes that typify odor-evoked output from the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cang and Isaacson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, NG cells also receive odor-evoked synaptic inhibition, presumably from other NG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), yet do not exhibit delayed odor responses like HZ cells. It is plausible that inhibition from NG cells is larger in HZ cells but it was not apparent here because the number of experiments was relatively small.</p><p>It should be kept in mind that both NG and HZ cells may also receive feed<italic>back</italic> inhibition from interneurons located in deeper layers, particularly from layer 3 somatostatin-positive RS interneurons with axons that ramify in L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). HZ cells can extend their dendrites into L1b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>) so might be especially susceptible to feedback inhibition of this kind. Thus, depending on patterns of activity in afferent and associational circuits, feedforward and feedback inhibition may interact.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Functional significance of feedforward inhibition in the PCx</title><p>Feedforward inhibition is generally recognized as an input-tracking mechanism which, in the hippocampus and neocortex, can synchronize spike timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pouille and Scanziani, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>) and modulate gain through input normalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pouille et al., 2009</xref>). The PCx is unusual in that it receives its feedforward inhibitory input onto the distal apical dendrites of principal cells, rather than onto perisomatic regions as in other cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lourenço et al., 2020</xref>). What are the consequences of this atypical architecture for the role of feedforward inhibition in the PCx?</p><p>One slice study has shown that feedforward inhibition works together with feedback inhibition to provide spatially and temporally modulated inhibition during bursts of olfactory input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010</xref>). Intriguingly, the shift in inhibition reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stokes and Isaacson, 2010</xref>, is in the opposite direction to that found in other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pouille and Scanziani, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Silberberg and Markram, 2007</xref>). These results suggest that feedforward inhibition in the PCx is functionally important but has unusual features.</p><p>More recently, an in vivo unit recording study in awake mice showed that odor-evoked spiking in feedforward inhibitory neurons in the PCx increases only slowly and weakly after inhalation, suggesting that these neurons provide tonic inhibition and do not play a major role in sculpting odor-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). Modeling confirmed that feedforward inhibition provides modest subtractive normalization in the PCx, in contrast to the divisive normalization it provides in other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stern et al., 2018</xref>). An intuitive explanation is that PCx uses a temporal or rate-based code that is more susceptible to ‘recurrent normalization’ provided by feedback inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sturgill and Isaacson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Stern et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>). Hence, the evidence of Bolding and colleagues suggests that feedforward inhibition plays a minor role in odor processing under the conditions of their experiments.</p><p>The results of Bolding and colleagues seem at variance with our finding that many layer 1a interneurons, especially NG cells, respond vigorously to odors. The discrepancy may lie in the different recording conditions, for example, whole-cell versus unit recordings, placement of the electrodes (close to or far from the LOT), or our use of anesthesia. Further work is required. However, if feedforward inhibition in the PCx is, indeed, weakly engaged in normal olfactory processing, what other functions might it serve?</p><p>The key property of feedforward inhibition in the PCx may be its dendritic localization. By inhibiting the distal apical dendrites of layer 2/3 principal cells, NG and HZ cells have the potential to dampen passive propagation of afferent EPSPs to the soma and to veto dendritic electrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Larkum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Palmer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pardi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anastasiades et al., 2021</xref>). Indeed, it has been directly shown in vitro that a single layer 1 interneuron can inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the distal dendrites of PCx principal cells in a branch-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stokes et al., 2014</xref>). Feedforward inhibition might then provide a mechanism for regulating processes that involve dendritic electrogenesis and plasticity – including burst-firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Tseng and Haberly, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Protopapas and Bower, 2001</xref>), spike timing-dependent plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kanter et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Johenning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassenaer and Laurent, 2012</xref>), and NMDA spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>) – and which may only become apparent during experimental paradigms that engage olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilson and Stevenson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shakhawat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Meissner-Bernard et al., 2019</xref>). Future work would need to explore this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Two types of feedforward inhibition</title><p>We have previously shown in slices that layer 1a NG cells and HZ cells generate slow-rising (2–3 ms) and fast-rising (1 ms) feedforward unitary IPSPs, respectively, in layer 2 principal neurons, leading us to suggest that NG cell-mediated feedforward inhibition is slower and more diffuse than that provided by HZ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). In the present report, after taking into account the much slower odor-evoked excitatory drive received by HZ cells, we reach the opposite conclusion. Our results are a reminder that the unitary properties of synapses, measured in vitro, can be less important than the patterns of concerted synaptic activity occurring in vivo.</p><p>What might be the value of delivering fast (NG) and slow (HZ) feedforward inhibition? We have shown in a slice simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) that NG cells can strongly inhibit firing in principal cells immediately after a step application of odor. Although this effect was not observed in the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>, there nevertheless appears to be scope for a physiological role for this kind of fast inhibition. For instance, NG cells generate GABA transients that spill out of the synaptic cleft and can activate heterosynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karayannis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Overstreet-Wadiche and McBain, 2015</xref>). Future work could explore ways in which this ‘volume transmission’ could enhance computational complexity in the PCx.</p><p>The role of HZ cell-mediated feedforward inhibition is more puzzling. Our slice simulation showed that HZ cells generate a delayed, diffuse response with little effect on principal cell excitability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Trained rodents can discriminate odors within a single sniff (&lt;100 ms; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rinberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Resulaj and Rinberg, 2015</xref>). What could be the relevance of late-firing HZ cells in this scenario? Two unique features of HZ cells suggest that they are potentially important. First, HZ cells are only found close to the LOT (&lt;~200 µm), giving them privileged inhibitory influence over a spatially restricted subset of principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). Second, they are the only class of interneuron in the PCx, and one of few in the cerebral cortex, that are profusely spiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haberly, 1983</xref>). Given the importance of spines for synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Toni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsuzaki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tonnesen et al., 2014</xref>), HZ cells are poised to receive learning-dependent synaptic excitation, which in turn may allow them to exert adjustable inhibitory control over neurons in their neighborhood.</p><p>In summary, we have shown that two forms of odor-evoked feedforward inhibition, fast and slow, are expressed in layer 1a of the PCx. Our work reveals previously unknown circuit elements in the PCx, and adds to a growing understanding of the role of neurons in layer 1 of the cerebral cortex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GAD67-GFP (Δneo)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tamamaki et al., 2003</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.10905">https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.10905</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">GAD67-GFP mice have <break/>the EGFP gene targeted to <break/>the <italic>Gad1</italic> locus. <break/>Breeders were obtained <break/>from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tamamaki et al., 2003</xref>. <break/>The colony was maintained on <break/>a C57BL6/J background</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABC kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vector Laboratories</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vectastain Elite<break/>ABC Kit,Cat #

The colony was maintained on a C57BL6/J background. Animals were aged 35–75 days and weighed 17–24 g. For surgery, an animal was sedated with chlorprothixene (5 mg/kg i.p.) then injected with urethane (0.7 g/kg s.c.) for general anesthesia plus atropine (0.2–0.3 mg/kg s.c.) to reduce secretions. The correct level of anesthesia was confirmed by observing regular respiration and the complete absence of a pinch reflex; a topup dose of urethane was sometimes required after 5–6 hr. A local anesthetic (prilocaine, 0.2 mg/kg) was applied topically to incision sites during surgery. Access to the PCx was via the cheek and upper mandible, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tantirigama et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the following surgical procedure was used (total duration ~2 hr). After retracting the skin, superficial blood vessels of the cheek were cauterized, then the temporalis muscle was carefully detached and retracted toward its base near the eye, revealing the temporal aspect of the skull. The zygomatic bone and the upper sections of the mandible, including the coronoid and the condyloid processes, were removed, followed by the upper section of the masseter muscle, exposing the basolateral surface of the skull. At this point, the PCx was visible under the translucent skull, identifiable using anatomical landmarks such as the LOT and the middle cerebral artery (MCA), which are roughly perpendicular to each other. A metal head post was then glued on top of the skull and the head was stabilized. A craniotomy (~2 mm<sup>2</sup>) was made with a fine drill (Osada Electric, Nagoya, Japan, or Ram Products Inc, Dayton, NJ) just caudal to the MCA and close to the LOT. This placement of the craniotomy ensured that all recordings were made in the anterior PCx at approximately +0.6 mm from Bregma. In many experiments the dura was left intact, but in some the dura was carefully removed using a needle and fine forceps. After completion of the surgery, a small chamber made from a plastic weighboat and dental cement was constructed around the site. To keep the area hydrated and allow immersion of the microscope objective, the chamber was filled with a Ringer’s solution containing (mM) 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 HEPES at pH 7.4. For all the above procedures, as well as during recordings, the animal was placed on an electrically heated surface at ~37°C and was kept hydrated by periodic s.c. injections of normal saline with 2% dextrose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Two-photon targeted patch clamping</title><p>GFP-positive interneurons in GAD67-GFP (Δneo) mice were visualized using a two-photon MOM microscope (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) with a 40×/0.8 NA water immersion objective (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) and a Chameleon Ultra Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 800–820 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>). Frames (512 × 512 pixels) were acquired simultaneously through a red and green channel at ~5 Hz under the control of ScanImage (Vidrio Technologies, Ashburn, VA). Patch pipettes were pulled with a longer taper than usual and had resistances of 5–8 MΩ when filled with internal solution comprising (in mM) 135 KMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 7 NaCl, 0.1 EGTA, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.3 GTP, 10 HEPES at pH 7.2, supplemented with 0.2–0.4% biocytin (295–300 mOs/kg). This solution had a Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration of 11 mM and a measured junction potential of –7 mV. For voltage clamp experiments CsMeSO<sub>3</sub> replaced KMeSO<sub>4</sub>. These solutions also contained Alexa Fluor 594 (20 µM) for visualizing the electrode in the red channel. Patch electrodes were positioned using a micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) and electrical recordings were obtained with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA). Data were filtered at 10 kHz and sampled at 20–50 kHz using an Instrutech ITC-18 digitizing interface (HEKA, Ludwigshafen, Germany) under the control of Axograph X (Axograph Scientific, Sydney, Australia). The reference electrode was a Ag/AgCl wire inserted under the skin. The patch electrode was advanced rapidly to penetrate the dura, then more slowly to approach the selected cell and obtain a gigaseal whole-cell recording in the usual way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Margrie et al., 2002</xref>). For current clamp recordings, bridge balance and capacitance neutralization were adjusted and the cell was allowed to remain at its resting potential.

Patch electrodes were prepared and filled as for targeted patch clamping, then an electrode was positioned at the surface of the anterior PCx using a dissection microscope. The micromanipulator (MP-285, Sutter Instrument) was zeroed at the surface, then the electrode was advanced rapidly to the search depth (150–280 µm, corresponding to layer 2) while applying high pressure (25 kPa), after which the pressure was reduced (4–8 kPa) and a whole-cell recording obtained using standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Margrie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>). Data were acquired as described above. EPSGs were calculated from EPSCs recorded under voltage clamp at a holding potential of –70 mV, close to the chloride reversal potential for these solutions. Layer 2 principal neurons (SL and SP cells) were identified by their intrinsic electrical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</xref>) and by the recording depth (SL: 150–200 µm; SP: 200–280 µm). Cell identity was also confirmed by fixing the brain at the end of the experiment and recovering the morphology of the recorded neuron as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Suzuki et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>‘In vivo’ functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging</title><p>Imaging used the red-shifted Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cal-590 AM (AAT Bioquest, Sunnyvale, CA), which was prepared and injected as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tischbirek et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the dura was removed and dye (1 mM) was pressure-injected into the PCx at a depth of ~200 µm using a glass pipette (tip diameter ~10 µm). A coverslip was glued over the PCx and imaging commenced &gt;1 hr after injection. Imaging frames were acquired at 30 Hz using a custom-modified B-scope two-photon microscope (Thorlabs, Newton, NJ) with a 16×/0.8 NA water immersion objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), resonance-galvanometer scanners and a Chameleon Ultra Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) tuned to 800–820 nm. Cells were included in the dataset if they unambiguously satisfied the fluorescence and soma morphology criteria given in Results, and if they exhibited clear odor responses according to the criteria under Data analysis, below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Odor presentation</title><p>A custom-built flow-dilution olfactometer was used to deliver up to 15 odors which were diluted to 10% of their saturated vapor pressure in charcoal-filtered medical air (flow rate 1 L/min; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bozza et al., 2004</xref>). The odors used in this study were: acetophenone, anisole, benzaldehyde, butyric acid, ethanol, ethyl-<italic>n</italic>-butyrate, eugenol, 1-heptanal, 2-heptanone, lavender oil, limonene, 1-pentanol, propionic acid (Merck/Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), amyl acetate and isoamyl acetate (MP Biomedicals, Sydney, Australia). Odors were presented for 3 s at 60 s intervals. Control experiments used a miniPID photo-ionization device (Aurora Scientific, Aurora, Canada) to confirm that odors were presented in a step-like manner (20–80% rise time in 46 ± 2 ms, <italic>n</italic> = 9 odors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, there was a consistent delay of 242 ± 6 ms (<italic>n</italic> = 9) between the switching time of the final valve and the arrival of the odorant at the detector inlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). All odor arrival times in the paper have been corrected for this delay. The mouse was freely breathing and its respiration was recorded using a piezoelectric strap (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) around the abdomen. Control experiments confirmed that the onset of inhalation coincided with the start of the downward step visible in some respiration traces (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the beginning of exhalation corresponded to the peak of the upward spike. Because the upward spike was a more reliable feature, we estimated inhalation onset by reference to the exhalation. In a subset of experiments in which both features were clear, we measured the mean latency from the peak of the exhalation spike to the start of the following inhalation (239 ± 8 ms; mean time between exhalation spikes, 365 ± 12 ms; <italic>n</italic> = 10 mice). Hence, expressed as a fraction of a respiration cycle, inhalation onset occurred at 0.654 ± 0.007 after the exhalation spike; this was used to estimate the time of onset of inhalation for all experiments. Odor stimulus onset was defined as the time of the first estimated onset of inhalation that occurred following the corrected odor arrival time. To avoid habituation, each odor was presented only once. Cross-habituation between different odors was not observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Slice experiments</title><p>Coronal slices (300 µm thick) were obtained from the anterior PCx of GAD67-GFP (Δneo) mice aged 20–30 days, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). Briefly, slices were prepared on a tissue slicer (Campden Instruments, Loughborough, UK) in ice-cold high-Mg<sup>2+</sup> cutting solution comprising (in mM) 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 6 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2 ascorbate, 3 pyruvate, and 10 glucose (osmolarity 305 mOs/kg), bubbled with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub> (carbogen). The slices were incubated for 40 min at 34°C in carbogen-bubbled artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; composition below) then were held at room temperature until required.</p><p>Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made from visually identified GFP-positive interneurons using an Olympus BX51WI microscope equipped with infrared differential interference contrast and wide-field fluorescence, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2012</xref>). Slices were superfused with warmed ACSF containing (in mM) 125 NaCl, 3 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and 25 glucose (310 mOs/kg), bubbled with carbogen and maintained at 33°C ± 1°C. For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> the bath solution contained 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX, 10 µM) and D-aminophosphonovaleric acid (D-AP5, 50 µM) to block ionotropic glutamate receptors (Tocris, Abingdon, UK). For the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> the bath solution instead contained 100 µM picrotoxin (Merck/Sigma-Aldrich), while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref> it contained 20 µM SR 95531 (gabazine; HelloBio, Bristol, UK), in both cases to block GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Patch electrodes had resistances of 4–6 MΩ when filled with KMeSO<sub>4</sub>- or CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>-based internal solution (same as used in vivo). Unless stated otherwise, compounds were obtained from Merck/Sigma-Aldrich.</p><p>Recordings were obtained using the same instrumentation and software as for the in vivo experiments. The stimulating electrode was made from a low-resistance patch electrode (~1 MΩ) filled with ACSF and coated with conductive paint. For connected pair recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the pre- and postsynaptic electrodes were filled with KMeSO<sub>4</sub>- and CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>-based internal solutions, respectively, allowing the postsynaptic neuron to be voltage clamped at a holding potential of +50 mV while the presynaptic neuron was allowed to remain at its resting potential in current clamp mode. For the dual recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), both recording electrodes were filled with the KMeSO<sub>4</sub>-based internal solution, and trains of extracellular stimuli (5 × 200 µs at 20 Hz) were delivered by a constant-voltage stimulator (Digitimer, Welwyn Garden City, UK) over the range 0–85 V in 0.1–5 V increments. Cells were included in the dataset if they had a stable resting potential more hyperpolarized than –60 mV (current clamp) or a stable holding current &lt;100 pA when held at –70 mV (voltage clamp). At the end of the experiment the slice was fixed and processed with an ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), allowing recovery of the morphologies of the recorded neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Patterned stimulation and dynamic clamp experiments in slices</title><p>In vivo-like patterns of inhibitory synaptic stimulation in slice experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) were adjusted to a common respiration time base as follows. First, a subset of odor-evoked firing patterns from NG and HZ cells, together with their associated respiration traces, was randomly selected from the full dataset for each cell type (sample data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7scode1">Figure 7—source code 1</xref>). For each subset, one firing/respiration combination was chosen as a reference, and the first upward peak in the reference respiration trace after odor onset was defined as <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. Every other odor-evoked firing pattern in that subset was translated in time to align its first respiration peak after odor onset to <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>. Working forward and backward from <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, for each respiration interval the respiration trace (and associated firing pattern) of each other firing pattern was excised from the original data recording and linearly stretched (‘warped’) so the duration of that respiration interval matched the corresponding interval in the reference respiration trace. Finally, all of these warped segments were concatenated in their original order, and the resultant stimulus patterns (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red traces) were used as the trigger to the extracellular stimulator in slice experiments. The same method was used to align the EPSG to the inhibitory stimulation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7scode1">Figure 7—source code 1</xref>). In this case the respiration trace for the EPSG was used as the reference time base.</p><p>The EPSG used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> was obtained from an EPSC recorded blind in vivo from an SP cell in response to a 3-s-long application of ethyl-<italic>n</italic>-butyrate (data in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7scode1">Figure 7—source code 1</xref>). Although the in vivo EPSC was measured near the chloride reversal potential to minimize contamination due to direct inhibition onto that cell, the EPSC will still be the result of excitatory input from all other neurons in the circuit, including other SP cells that have received their own feedforward inhibition. Furthermore, injecting an excitatory conductance at the soma does not accurately replicate excitatory synaptic inputs distributed across the dendrites. These details were disregarded for the purpose of this simple in vitro simulation. For each neuron the conductance magnitude was adjusted to produce a similar firing rate with the extracellular stimulus switched off, then the stimulator was switched on to record the effect of synaptic inhibition. To provide a reference firing rate for normalizing the PSTH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), a fixed conductance stimulus was inserted at the end of the EPSG, well past the odor period (not visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The dynamic clamp was implemented using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7scode1">Figure 7—source code 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis</title><p>All analysis was done using Igor Pro, Axograph X, Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA), or R (running under RStudio, Boston, MA).</p><p>AP properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) were measured as previously described for slice experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010a</xref>). Latency to the first AP was the delay from the beginning of the current step to the first AP at rheobase. AP height was the difference between the peak of the first AP at rheobase and its threshold voltage (defined as the membrane potential [<italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic>] at which <italic>dV<sub>m</sub></italic>/<italic>dt</italic> first exceeded 15 V/s). AP halfwidth was the width of the first AP at rheobase measured at half its height. Respiration-correlated oscillations in <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) were characterized as follows. Respiration traces were band-pass filtered at 1–50 Hz and normalized to oscillate between 0 and 1. The time between successive exhalation spikes was used to calculate the mean respiration frequency in three 3-s-long windows (−6 to –3 s, 0–3 s, and 16–19 s, all with respect to odor onset). The same three windows were used for the analysis of oscillations in <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic>. First, <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> was median-filtered to remove APs. Mean peak-to-peak amplitude of the oscillations in <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> was found by excising segments of <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> between successive exhalation spikes, linearly stretching (‘warping’) them so they had the same time axis, then averaging together all segments within each of the three analysis windows. Mean peak-to-peak amplitude was taken as the difference between the maximum and minimum amplitude of the averaged segment of <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic>. For cross-covariance analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the respiration trace was replaced by a normalized series of Gaussians representing the upward spikes in the respiration cycle; this was done to eliminate the effect of differences in the amplitude of the recorded respiration trace. The amplitude of the largest positive peak in the covariance was found, as well as the location of this peak expressed as a fraction of the mean time between exhalation spikes for that window.</p><p>The odor response indices were found by: (i) calculating the fraction of odors that each cell responded to, then averaging across cells (‘cell-averaged index’) and (ii) calculating the fraction of cells each odor activated, then averaging across odors (‘odor-averaged index’). Odor responsiveness was determined using a z-score criterion: median-filtered <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> segments demarcated by exhalation spikes were excised as above, and the mean <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> in each of these segments was calculated for the entire odor trial. These values were converted to a z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the list of mean <italic>V<sub>m</sub></italic> values during the 8-s-long pre-odor baseline period. An odor response was said to occur if this z-score value exceeded 2.5 for any respiration segment during the 3-s-long odor application period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Lifetime and population sparseness were calculated with modified expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>) that used the peak z-scored response (without thresholding) as the variable.</p><p>Individual odor-evoked EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), EPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and IPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) were notch-filtered at 2–4 Hz, if required, to remove respiration-associated oscillations prior to averaging (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To estimate the latency to peak and halfwidth, each individual EPSC was fitted to the equation <italic>I</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) = <italic>a</italic>(1 <italic>− e<sup>-t/τ1</sup></italic>)<italic><sup>2</sup>e<sup>-t/τ2</sup></italic>, where <italic>a</italic> is amplitude and <italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub> are the rising and falling time constants, respectively. The latency and halfwidth were then measured from this fitted curve.</p><p>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) were analyzed by manually drawing regions of interest around the somas of identified neurons in the green channel then measuring mean somatic fluorescence, <italic>F</italic>, in the red channel for each frame. Baseline fluorescence (<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>) for each neuron was defined as the median of the lower 80% of all values of <italic>F</italic> measured in all frames acquired prior to odor application.

The peak postsynaptic current was found within a 5- or 10-ms-long window starting 2 ms after the time of the presynaptic AP or extracellular stimulus, then the mean peak amplitude (<italic>a<sub>pk</sub></italic>) was found by averaging over a 1 ms long window around the peak and subtracting the averaged baseline over a 5- or 10-ms-long window ending 2 ms before the time of the presynaptic AP or extracellular stimulus. For the connected-pair recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) the same measurement procedure was repeated for 200 randomly-chosen times during the 500-ms-long baseline period preceding the time of the presynaptic AP, and the standard deviation (<italic>s<sub>b</sub></italic>) of these baseline mean amplitudes was calculated. A synaptic connection was identified if |<italic>a<sub>pk</sub></italic>| &gt; |<italic>3 s<sub>b</sub></italic>|. For the dual recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) the mean NG:HZ EPSC amplitude ratio was calculated as follows. For each stimulator setting, all evoked EPSC amplitudes at that setting (typically <italic>n</italic> = 5) were averaged together and the ratio was calculated. In the case of experiments with a clear plateau (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, bottom left), the individual ratios for EPSCs on the plateau were averaged together to yield the overall mean NG:HZ ratio for that experiment. In the case of experiments without a clear plateau (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), the overall mean only included individual ratios for which both EPSCs were &gt;10 pA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analysis was done using R (version 3.6.0) running under RStudio.

They find that these two cell types have different responses and different connectivity, which partially explains their different responses.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: J. Julius Zhu (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As Reviewer #1 suggested, the experiments shown in Figure 5 need to be redone with inhibition blocked.</p><p>2) Please pay attention to the different inputs to HZ and NG. Reviewer #1 suggests that you can address this relatively straightforwardly by doing paired recordings from HZ and NG cells and stimulating the LOT through a range of strengths, including minimal stimulation. E.g. Stokes and Isaacson did this for a FFI and PYR and showed they got inputs from the same LOT fiber. Such careful characterization can strengthen the conclusion and improve the manuscript.</p><p>3) There are discrepancies on the strengths of inhibitory inputs onto HZ and NG cells. For example, the manuscript nicely shows strong, almost equivalent inhibition in HZ and NG cells in vivo, but the connectivity analyses show almost no inhibitory inputs onto NGs. So who is inhibiting them? Additional experiments need to be performed to address this issue.</p><p>4) Both Reviewer #1 and #2 feel that the functional implications (as stated in the title) are lacking, please tune down conclusions here.</p><p>5) Please add the missing quantification, details requested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– I also don't understand the warping of the respiration traces.

Franks et al., 2011 did not record in vivo.</p><p>L. 344-5 – “Our findings reveal a remarkable richness in inhibitory control at the very first stage of cortical odor processing…” Their findings show differences in the responses they recorded in NG vs. HZ cells in slices or to strong and prolonged odor pulses in deeply anesthetized mice that are missing half their face without any perturbation or analysis of functional significance. Let’s tone down the hyperbole a bit.</p><p>L. 365-6 – The Fontanini and Tantirigama citations are correct but the takeaway from Bolding et al., 2020 was that the piriform cortex was surprisingly robust to ketamine/xylazine anesthesia,</p><p>l. 477-83. The authors should also cite the recent paper from Jackie Schiller's group (Amit et al., 2018) that shows that piriform neurons can support NMDA spikes. Dendritic-targeting inhibition may be important for gating these too.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The in vivo experiments performed in this study are incredibly difficult and the findings are fundamental to understanding the circuitry that underlies olfactory processing. This novel characterization of the odor response properties of NG and HZ interneurons is well done. The main finding that NG and HZ cells broadly tuned but show differing responses in strength and temporal dynamics is compelling. It is also interesting that the underlying excitatory synaptic dynamics in part, contribute to differences in odor response properties. The authors addressed a discrepancy between the short-term plasticity of afferent excitatory synaptic inputs recorded in vitro and in vivo responses. Although this only partially explained responses in NG neurons but not HZ neurons. The authors also provide insight into inhibitory dynamics between NG and HZ neurons that also might contribute to the overall response properties of these classes. Finally, the authors use dynamic clamp to investigate a model of how the NG and HZ interneurons influence the feedforward processing of superficial pyramidal neurons. This last set of experiments was underwhelming. Overall this study provides a solid characterization of the odor response properties of NG and HZ interneurons. The study inspires several future directions. However, the mechanisms by which these two classes are integrated into the circuit and function in feedforward odor processing are less well developed and makes the study seem incomplete.</p><p>1) Both NG and HZ neurons show comparable broad tuning for odor identity. Was there any attempt to investigate the concentration dependence of their firing rates? Recent studies from the Rinberg and Schaefer labs have shown that putative tufted cells show concentration invariant onset responses possibly similar to NG neurons while mitral cells show more prolonged responses like Hz neurons that may be concentration dependent. Is there a parallel here? The authors do raise the possibility that M/T cells might differentially excite NG and HZ cells resulting in the different time courses of the excitatory synaptic inputs. Investigating the concentration dependence of odor responses could provide some insight.</p><p>2) In the absence of different excitatory drive to NG or HZ neurons are there potentially differences in dendritic filtering that could underlie the fast vs slow integration of excitation.</p><p>3) The difficulties of assessing the functional roles of the two classes interneurons in vivo are appreciated, so using dynamic clamp (or computational modeling) is a valid option. But the dynamic clamp experiments seem contrived. It is not surprising that strong onset firing modeled for stimulation of NG neurons evokes strong onset inhibition in pyramidal neurons that in turn decreases onset firing rates. Moreover, this tool provided no insight to how HZ neurons transform pyramidal neuron responses. However, dynamic clamp might be useful in an inverse approach. The EPSC recorded in vivo and used to generate the EPSG is likely not purely excitatory and is probably already influenced by NG or HZ inputs (as are pyramidal neuron spike recordings in vivo). Could the information attained in the present study about the spiking patterns and synaptic inhibition (previous work from the lab) be used to design inhibitory conductances that could effectively be subtracted from overall conductances based on in vivo recordings of pyramidal neurons? This might mirror an optogenetic silencing study. If this were to be applied to an array of pyramidal neurons odor responses that vary by timing, tuning or concentration dependence one could get some insight into how these might have been shaped by feedforward inhibition from NG or HZ neurons in isolation or conjunction. This could be particularly interesting with respect to responses from neurons that are suppressed by odor inputs, or are weakly responsive as have also been shown by this group.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It seems that the missed the opportunity to examine the odor-mimic stimulation-evoked EPSPs and EPSCs when performing the simultaneous recordings from both L1 neurogliaform and horizontal cells. These experiments would address the hypothesis that the heterogeneous lateral olfactory tract fiber tracts may differentially innervate two types of L1 interneurons. The results should also help to reveal the kinetics of evoked responses, validate the exact effect of &quot;distant&quot; NG stimulus and &quot;near&quot; HZ stimulus on these two cell types, and later use the observed responding EPSPs to test their impacts on postsynaptic pyramidal neurons. The impact of this study would be significantly improved if the authors choose to include such experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73406.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As Reviewer #1 suggested, the experiments shown in Figure 5 need to be redone with inhibition blocked.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments in fact included 100 µM picrotoxin in the bath, as we routinely do for experiments of this kind (see <italic>e.g.</italic> Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006, 2010, 2011).

We have tried to clarify this by making changes in the Results (p 16) and Materials and methods (p 37). We also now provide a folder (Figure 7 – source code 1) which contains the Igor source code, sample data, and a ReadMe file giving details on how to install and run the code.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L. 94.

This novel characterization of the odor response properties of NG and HZ interneurons is well done. The main finding that NG and HZ cells broadly tuned but show differing responses in strength and temporal dynamics is compelling. It is also interesting that the underlying excitatory synaptic dynamics in part, contribute to differences in odor response properties. The authors addressed a discrepancy between the short-term plasticity of afferent excitatory synaptic inputs recorded in vitro and in vivo responses. Although this only partially explained responses in NG neurons but not HZ neurons. The authors also provide insight into inhibitory dynamics between NG and HZ neurons that also might contribute to the overall response properties of these classes. Finally, the authors use dynamic clamp to investigate a model of how the NG and HZ interneurons influence the feedforward processing of superficial pyramidal neurons. This last set of experiments was underwhelming. Overall this study provides a solid characterization of the odor response properties of NG and HZ interneurons. The study inspires several future directions. However, the mechanisms by which these two classes are integrated into the circuit and function in feedforward odor processing are less well developed and makes the study seem incomplete.</p><p>1) Both NG and HZ neurons show comparable broad tuning for odor identity. Was there any attempt to investigate the concentration dependence of their firing rates? Recent studies from the Rinberg and Schaefer labs have shown that putative tufted cells show concentration invariant onset responses possibly similar to NG neurons while mitral cells show more prolonged responses like Hz neurons that may be concentration dependent. Is there a parallel here? The authors do raise the possibility that M/T cells might differentially excite NG and HZ cells resulting in the different time courses of the excitatory synaptic inputs. Investigating the concentration dependence of odor responses could provide some insight.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good suggestion, but unfortunately we did not look at the effect of changing odor concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the absence of different excitatory drive to NG or HZ neurons are there potentially differences in dendritic filtering that could underlie the fast vs slow integration of excitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t think dendritic filtering alone is able to explain the difference. As mentioned in the Results (p 12) and reported previously (Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010, 2012), the rise time of electrically-evoked individual EPSPs in NG and HZ cells (milliseconds) is much faster than the rise time of odor-evoked compound EPSPs reported here (hundreds of milliseconds). Differences in dendritic filtering could only account for millisecond differences. For this reason we disregarded dendritic filtering and instead focused on how slowly-rising compound EPSPs might be constructed from trains of individual EPSPs (Figure 5A, B). This has now been clarified (Results, p 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The difficulties of assessing the functional roles of the two classes interneurons in vivo are appreciated, so using dynamic clamp (or computational modeling) is a valid option. But the dynamic clamp experiments seem contrived. It is not surprising that strong onset firing modeled for stimulation of NG neurons evokes strong onset inhibition in pyramidal neurons that in turn decreases onset firing rates. Moreover, this tool provided no insight to how HZ neurons transform pyramidal neuron responses. However, dynamic clamp might be useful in an inverse approach. The EPSC recorded in vivo and used to generate the EPSG is likely not purely excitatory and is probably already influenced by NG or HZ inputs (as are pyramidal neuron spike recordings in vivo).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the dynamic clamp approach is not optimal but, as we say in the Results (p 16), it is difficult to perform a ‘functional’ experiment like this in vivo. The EPSC used to generate the EPSG was recorded near the chloride reversal potential to minimize contamination due to direct inhibition onto that cell. However, it is true that the EPSC will still be the result of excitatory input from all other neurons in the circuit, including other SP cells that have received their own feedforward inhibition. This and other limitations of our dynamic clamp approach are now made more explicit in the Materials and methods (pp 37-38).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the information attained in the present study about the spiking patterns and synaptic inhibition (previous work from the lab) be used to design inhibitory conductances that could effectively be subtracted from overall conductances based on in vivo recordings of pyramidal neurons? This might mirror an optogenetic silencing study. If this were to be applied to an array of pyramidal neurons odor responses that vary by timing, tuning or concentration dependence one could get some insight into how these might have been shaped by feedforward inhibition from NG or HZ neurons in isolation or conjunction. This could be particularly interesting with respect to responses from neurons that are suppressed by odor inputs, or are weakly responsive as have also been shown by this group.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting suggestion but we feel there are too many ill-defined parameters to make it feasible at this time. An optogenetic or chemogenetic silencing study would be the way to go in the future, we believe, as soon as techniques are available for selective expression of transgenes in layer 1a NG and HZ cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It seems that the missed the opportunity to examine the odor-mimic stimulation-evoked EPSPs and EPSCs when performing the simultaneous recordings from both L1 neurogliaform and horizontal cells. These experiments would address the hypothesis that the heterogeneous lateral olfactory tract fiber tracts may differentially innervate two types of L1 interneurons. The results should also help to reveal the kinetics of evoked responses, validate the exact effect of &quot;distant&quot; NG stimulus and &quot;near&quot; HZ stimulus on these two cell types, and later use the observed responding EPSPs to test their impacts on postsynaptic pyramidal neurons. The impact of this study would be significantly improved if the authors choose to include such experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have done new experiments in which we made simultaneous whole-cell recordings from NG and HZ cells while applying both minimal and strong electrical stimulation to the LOT. The results are shown in the new Figure 6C and Figure 6 —figure supplement 2. Briefly, we found that, when applying a train of stimuli to the LOT, the first EPSC was always smaller in the NG cell than in the HZ cell, even when using ‘minimal’ stimulation or when the NG cell was closer to the LOT. After the second or third EPSC in the train, however, the EPSC amplitudes in the two cell types became more similar because of the previously-reported differences in short-term plasticity at these two inputs (Suzuki and Bekkers, 2010; see also upper right panel in Figure 6C). Given the dynamics of afferent input from the olfactory bulb (<italic>i.e.</italic> modulated bursts of APs), these results suggest that NG and HZ cells mostly operate in a regime where they receive similar afferent excitation. This finding is now discussed in the Results (pp 14-15) and Discussion (p 22).</p></body></sub-article></article>
