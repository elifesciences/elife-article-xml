However, this process requires the assembly of tens of thousands of ice-like water molecules that align together to initiate freezing at these relatively high temperatures. Water ordering on this scale is mediated by the ice nucleation proteins (INPs) of common environmental bacteria like <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas borealis</italic>. However, individually, these 100 kDa proteins are too small to organize enough water molecules for frost formation, and it is not known how giant, megadalton-sized multimers, which are crucial for ice nucleation at high sub-zero temperatures, form. The ability of multimers to self-assemble was suggested when the transfer of an INP gene into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> led to efficient ice nucleation. Here, we demonstrate that a positively charged subdomain at the C-terminal end of the central β-solenoid of the INP is crucial for multimerization. Truncation, relocation, or change of the charge of this subdomain caused a catastrophic loss of ice nucleation ability. Cryo-electron tomography of the recombinant <italic>E. coli</italic> showed that the INP multimers form fibres that are ~5 nm across and up to 200 nm long. A model of these fibres as an overlapping series of antiparallel dimers can account for all their known properties and suggests a route to making cell-free ice nucleators for biotechnological applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ice nucleation proteins</kwd><kwd>ice nucleation</kwd><kwd>protein self-assembly</kwd><kwd>cryo-electron tomography</kwd><kwd>bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>β-solenoid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRN 148422</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davies</surname><given-names>Peter L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Braslavsky</surname><given-names>Ido</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001735</institution-id><institution>Weizmann Institute of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudich</surname><given-names>Yinon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post-Doctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Shuaiqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI087946</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Wangbiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Self-assembly of bacterial ice nucleation proteins is required for efficient activity and is mediated by electrostatic interactions, creating long and thin fibres.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ice crystals grow from ice embryos, which are crystalline aggregates of water molecules that spontaneously form (homogeneous nucleation) in pure H<sub>2</sub>O at approximately −38 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoose and Möhler, 2012</xref>). Ice can arise in nature at much warmer temperatures because various surfaces act as stabilizers of ice embryos (heterogeneous nucleation). Only once an ice embryo reaches a critical number of organized water molecules will it become stable enough to spontaneously grow at elevated temperatures, a process called ice nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vali et al., 2015</xref>). The most active heterogeneous ice nucleators are bacterial ice nucleation proteins (INPs), which can stabilize an ice embryo at temperatures as warm as −2 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukas et al., 2022</xref>). INP-producing bacteria are widespread in the environment where they are responsible for initiating frost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindow, 1983</xref>) and atmospheric precipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2014</xref>). As such, these bacteria play a significant role in the Earth’s hydrological cycle and in agricultural productivity.</p><p>As described in the literature, INPs are large proteins (up to ~150 kDa) that are thought to form multimers on the surface of the bacteria that express them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govindarajan and Lindow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindow et al., 1989</xref>).

Shorter versions of similar arrays have convergently evolved in insects to form the ice-binding sites of several hyperactive antifreeze proteins (AFPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graether et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Graham et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kristiansen et al., 2011</xref>). These arrays are thought to organize sufficient ice-like water molecules on their surface to facilitate AFP adsorption to the ice crystal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Garnham et al., 2011a</xref>). In the much longer INP arrays, which further form multimers, the organizing effect on nearby water molecules is thought to increase to the point where ice embryos can be sufficiently stabilized to cause spontaneous growth of ice at high sub-zero temperatures. Consistent with this idea, we recently demonstrated that interrupting these water-organizing motifs decreased the ice nucleation temperature by the same amount as extensive deletions of the water-organizing coils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we showed that the 12 C-terminal coils lack the water-organizing motifs and that deleting these coils resulted in a near total loss of ice nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, the necessity for these C-terminal coils was demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Green and Warren, 1985</xref> in the first publication of an INP sequence but was not further investigated. While the water-organizing coils (WO-coils) are characterized by their conserved TxT, SxT, and Y motifs, the defining feature of the C-terminal-most coils, other than the lack of these motifs, is that position 12 of the 16-residue coil is typically occupied by arginine. Thus, we refer to these non-WO-coils as R-coils. Since both coil types maintain the same predicted fold but serve different functions, we consider them subdomains of the same β-solenoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kajava and Steven, 2006a</xref>). In the WO-coils, position 12 is usually occupied by residues of the opposite charge, Asp and Glu. This charge inversion is noteworthy as it has been shown that electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of INP multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Madzharova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lukas et al., 2020</xref>). It has also been shown that INP activity is affected by pH, which is consistent with a role for electrostatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schwidetzky et al., 2021</xref>). We and others have suggested that INPs may multimerize through salt-bridging of the side chains in these positions of the coil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Juurakko et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Radiation inactivation analysis suggests a multimer size of 19 MDa (&gt;100 monomers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govindarajan and Lindow, 1988</xref>). Computational estimates predict increased activity upon the assembly of up to a 5-MDa (34 INPs) multimer, which is on the same order of magnitude as that determined experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). The tendency to form such large structures is one of many factors that makes these proteins difficult to work with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lukas et al., 2022</xref>) and may be part of why, despite many attempts, very little is known about them at a molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roeters et al., 2021</xref>). The size of these structures does, however, make them amenable to size-based separation from other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schmid et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2022</xref>). INP multimers are also large enough to be visible using negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on enriched samples, revealing a fibril-like morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Novikova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In nature, these multimers form on the surface of bacteria, anchored to the outer membrane by the N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012</xref>). When expressed recombinantly in <italic>E. coli</italic>, INPs have full activity, suggesting that multimers are still able to form and that they are the product of self-assembly. Remarkably, INPs with N-terminal truncations are only slightly less active, suggesting that assembly on the cell surface is not mandatory, and it can occur in the cytoplasm whether anchored to the inner surface of the plasma membrane or free in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kassmannhuber et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kassmannhuber et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have studied the role of the R-coils in INPs through a series of mutations and rearrangements. Additionally, using cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), we have observed the fibrillar morphology of INP multimers <italic>in situ</italic> within cells recombinantly expressing INPs. The R-coils’ length, location, and sequence are critical for INP multimerization and hence INP activity. Although we report results using <italic>Pb</italic>INP, the bioinformatic analysis presented here indicates that these findings are universally applicable to the INP family, including the more commonly studied InaZ from <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bioinformatic analysis reveals conservation in the number of R-coils across all INPs</title><p>A bioinformatic analysis of bacterial INPs was undertaken to identify their variations in size and sequence to understand what is common to all that could guide experiments to probe higher order structure and help develop a collective model of the INP multimer. In <italic>Pb</italic>INP, there are 53 WO-coils and 12 R-coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), each composed of 16 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To determine whether this ratio of coil types is consistent across known INPs, we analysed INP and INP-like solenoid sequences in the NCBI’s non-redundant protein (nr) database. The long tandem arrays of coils in INPs make them prone to mis-assembly when using short-read DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wick et al., 2017</xref>) so we opted to limit our dataset to sequences obtained by long-read technologies (Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences SMRT sequencing). From this bioinformatics study, it is apparent that the number of WO-coils varies considerably from over 70 coils to around 30, with a median length of 58 coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the length of the R-coil region is much less variable across sequences, with 107 of 120 sequences containing either 10 or 12 R-coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The stark difference in length variation between the numbers of WO-coils and the R-coils supports the hypothesis that these two regions have different functions.</p><p>The differences observed between the <italic>Pb</italic>INP WO-coil consensus sequence and the R-coil consensus sequence, which include the loss of putative WO motifs in the former and the appearance of basic residues at position 12 in the latter, are consistent across the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is apparent from the sequence logos comparing them.

In theory, replacement of R-coils by WO-coils could result in a gain of function as the water-organizing surface increased in area. However, as the number of R-coils was reduced, the nucleation temperature decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>). Replacing two or four R-coils to leave ten or eight in place resulted in a slight loss of activity compared to the wild-type protein (<italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> = −9.1 and −10.2 °C, respectively, where <italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> is the temperature at which 50% of droplets have frozen, p &lt; 0.001). Reducing the R-coil count to six dramatically decreased the activity (<italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub> = −35.7 °C). The construct with only four R-coils in place showed only the slightest amount of activity, and activity was entirely lost in the construct containing only one R-coil. Evidently, small decreases in the R-coil region length produce disproportionately large decreases in activity.

The length of the WO-coil region and the continuity of the water-organizing motifs were shown to directly affect ice nucleation temperature. Although the R-coil region lacks water-organizing motifs, its presence was critical for ice nucleation activity, which led us to propose a key role for this region in INP multimer formation. Here, we have characterized the R-coil subdomain in terms of the attributes it needs to support INP multimerization and have shown by cryo-ET the first <italic>in situ</italic> view of what these multimers look like. In addition, we have advanced a working model for the INP multimer structure that is compatible with all of the known INP properties.</p><p>In the aforementioned work, we showed that removal of up to half of the <italic>Pb</italic>INP solenoid (reducing the number of WO-coils from 53 to 21) only dropped the ice nucleation activity by ~2 °C. Here, we have confirmed this tolerance of WO-coil count variation through bioinformatic analysis of natural INPs. The majority of bacterial INPs have WO-coil counts between 30 and 70. <italic>Pb</italic>INP is average in this respect with 53 WO-coils. It seems counterintuitive that these bacteria have not been uniformly selected for the highest WO-coil count, which might give them an advantage in causing frost damage to plants at the highest possible temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lindow et al., 1982</xref>). However, it is clear that INPs are not functioning as monomers but rather as large multimers, so any loss of water-organizing surface can potentially be compensated for by simply adding more monomers to the multimer.</p><p>The ability to form superstructures is a key property of INPs and centres on the R-coil subdomain. This was shown here in the same bioinformatic analysis where there is remarkably little variation to the R-coil length of 10–12 coils. The importance of a minimal R-coil region length is supported by experiments. Whereas over 30 of the WO-coils can be removed with slight loss of activity, when six of the 12 <italic>Pb</italic>INP R-coils were replaced by WO-coils there was a catastrophic loss of ice nucleation activity, and no activity at all with further shortening of the R-coils. We postulate that at least eight R-coils are required for efficient multimer formation and that the ice nucleation activity of a monomer is inconsequential in the natural environment.</p><p>In the absence of detailed structural information, we have probed the properties of the multimers to help develop feasible models for their structure and assembly. The location of the R-coils at the C-terminal end of the solenoid next to the highly conserved cap structure is critical, as they do not function in the middle of the WO-coil region, and only poorly at the N-terminal end. These R-coils have a strong positive charge from the Arg and Lys residues, whereas the WO-coils are negatively charged, and their interaction potentially provides an electrostatic component to the fibre assembly. As expected, changing the charge on the R-coils from positive to negative caused some loss of ice nucleation activity (~9 °C), consistent with charge repulsion between these two solenoid regions weakening the multimer structure. In wild-type INPs, the negative charges of the WO-coils are consistent throughout their length, which offers no clue as to where on the WO-coils the R-coils might interact. One possible advantage of this uniformity is that multimer assembly could still happen if the WO-coil length is appreciably shortened, as it can be in nature and by experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The minimal effects of pH change on native INP activity are reminiscent of the insensitivity of antifreeze activity to pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chao et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). The ice-binding sites of AFPs are typically devoid of charged residues and there should be no effect of pH on the ability of these sites to organize ice-like waters. The same can be said for the water-organizing motifs in INPs. We noted the extraordinary heat stability of INP multimers. Even after heating to 99 °C for 10 min, the bacterial extracts only lost 5 °C of ice nucleation activity, whereas the heat-stable internal GFP control was denatured at 75 °C. We cannot rule out the possibility that the INP multimers were also denatured by heat treatment but could reassemble on cooling.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Working model of the INP multimer</title><p>The fundamental unit of the INP multimer in this hypothetical model is a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

If these interactions can also form with the proteins at an approximate right angle, it should be possible for end-linked dimers to form a compact fibre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) with a diameter close to that seen by cryo-ET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The antiparallel arrangement of the dimers gives a sidedness to the multimer where TxT motifs (light green) face outwards and inwards in an alternating pattern with SxT motifs (on the underside) in the opposite phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Cross-sectional views of the INP fibre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) show the interactions between the negatively (red) and positively (blue) charged regions where the dimers overlap to form a ring of four solenoids, and here and elsewhere the interaction of the two monomers through the tyrosine ladder pairing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Working model of the INP multimer is consistent with the properties of INPs and their multimers</title><p>We previously showed that the length of the WO-coil region can be shortened by ~60% with only a few degrees Celsius decrease in ice nucleation temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>). The working model can accommodate these huge deletions simply by closing the gap between the dimers. For example, the deletion of 32 WO-coils, leaving just 21 along with the 12 R-coils, retains all the molecular interactions seen in the longer fibre but with fewer stacked tyrosine interactions. This can help explain the heat stability of the INP multimers and the minimal difference (2–3 °C) in activity loss between full-length <italic>Pb</italic>INP with 65 coils and the truncated version with 33 coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Similarly, longer WO-coil regions can be accommodated by lengthening the gap. This can explain the wide range of WO-coil lengths seen in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). They all fit in the same model.</p><p>Our model also shows how the interaction between the R-coils and the WO-coils of the adjacent dimers supports fibre formation. Any shortening of the R-coil subdomain jeopardizes the ability to link up the dimers. The catastrophic loss of ice nucleation activity seen below eight R-coils is because the interacting length of R- and WO-coils has too few electrostatic and other interactions to bridge the dimers together. The importance of electrostatic interaction has been illustrated in this study in two ways. First, when the R-coil basic residues were replaced by acidic residues, the ice nucleation activity was severely compromised but was fully restored when the mutated residues were all converted to lysines. Second, in cell-free extracts of lysed INP-producing <italic>E. coli</italic>, ice nucleation activity decreased by a few degrees Celsius at low pH values where the charge on acidic residue side chains was reduced or eliminated. When the carboxyl groups of aspartate and glutamate involved in electrostatic pairing lose their negative charges at low pH, they can still form hydrogen bonds with basic amino acid partners, which can explain why the lowering of pH was not as disruptive as reversing the charge on these residues. Another useful test of the electrostatic component to the multimer model would be to study the effects of increasing salt concentration on ice nucleation activity of the <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts.</p><p>The observation that low, variable levels of ice nucleation activity remained in the construct where the R-coil basic residues were replaced by acidic residues, suggests that there are additional binding interactions between the dimers other than electrostatic ones. We suggest the involvement of the highly conserved C-terminal capping structure. When three mutations designed to disrupt the cap fold were introduced, all ice nucleation activity was lost. Also of note is the disruptive effect of extending the tyrosine ladder further into the R-coil subdomain in the mutant where the acidic residues replaced the basic ones. The subtle details of the R-coil region will require detailed structural analysis for their elucidation.</p><p>The relocation of the R-coils to the N-terminal end of the solenoid caused a loss of just over 50% activity and it is possible to accommodate such a change in the model while retaining a charge interaction between the R- and WO-coils. However, the separation from the cap structure might account for some of the activity loss. Movement of the R-coils to the centre of the WO-coil region is not compatible with the model and sure enough, this construct was devoid of ice nucleation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Other features supporting the model are that the dimer’s C- and N-terminal ends are exposed and can accommodate tags and extensions without disrupting the fibre. Thus, the addition of a C-terminal GFP tag has no detrimental effect in ice nucleation activity. Nor is there any difference in activity if the N-terminal INP domain and linker region are present or not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kassmannhuber et al., 2020</xref>). Even the incorporation of a bulky protein like mRuby into the WO-coil region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Forbes et al., 2022</xref>) can be accommodated because the fibre is just a dimer rather than a bundle of solenoids.</p><p>Electron microscopy of newly synthesized INPs in a cell-free system shows them as thin molecules of dimensions 4–6 nm in diameter by a few hundred nm in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Novikova et al., 2018</xref>). Negatively stained images of recombinantly produced INP multimers isolated by centrifugation and chromatography show an elongated structure ~5–7 times longer than a monomer but not much wider (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartmann et al., 2022</xref>). The fibres seen <italic>in situ</italic> in INP-expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) are similarly long but slightly thinner, consistent with the absence of negative staining. The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is the thinnest structure we can project for a fibrillar multimer.</p><p>Solving the structure of the INP fibres at atomic detail will be the key to understanding the remarkable ability of biological ice nucleators to start the freezing process at high sub-zero temperatures. Structures of this type offer the promise of cell-free ice nucleation for use in biotechnological and food applications where there is a need to avoid the use of bacteria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Newly designed genes are all modifications of the INP found in <italic>Pseudomonas borealis</italic> (<italic>Pb</italic>INP) (GenBank accession: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/EU573998">EU573998</ext-link>).

For the P. borealis Ice Nucleating Protein (PbINP) studied here, earlier work had already determined clearly distinct roles for different subdomains of the protein in determining activity. Key players are the water-organizing loops (WO-loops) of the central beta-solenoid structure and a set of non-water-organizing C-terminal loops, called the R-loops in view of characteristically located arginines. Previous mutation studies (using nucleation activity as a read-out) had already suggested the R-loops interact with the WO loops, to cause self-assembly of PbINP, which in turn was thought to lead to enhanced ice-nucleating activity. In this paper, the activities of additional mutants are studied, and a bioinformatics analysis on the statistics of the number of WO- and R-loops is presented for a wide range of bacterial ice-nucleating proteins, and additional electron-microscopy results are presented on fibrils formed by the non-mutated PbINP in E coli lysates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-A very complete set of additional mutants is investigated to further strengthen the earlier hypothesis.</p><p>-A nice bioinformatics analysis that underscores that the hypothesis should apply not only to PbINP but to a wide range of (related) bacterial ice-nucleating proteins.</p><p>-Convincing data that PbINP overexpressed in E coli forms fibrils (electron microscopy on E coli lysates).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-The new data is interesting and further strengthens the hypotheses put forward in the earlier work. However, just as in the earlier work, the proof for the link between self-assembly and ice-nucleation remains indirect. Assembly into fibrils is shown for E coli lysates expressing non-mutated pbINP, hence it is indeed clear that pbINP self-associates. It is not shown however that the mutations that lead to loss of ice-nucleating activity also lead to loss of self-assembly. A more quantitative or additional self-assembly assay could shine light on this, either in the present or in future studies.</p><p>-Also the &quot;working model&quot; for the self-assembly of the fibers remains not more than that, just as in the earlier papers, since the mutation-activity relationship does not contain enough information to build a good structural model. Again, a better model would require different kinds of experiments, that yield more detailed structural data on the fibrils.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91976.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary: in this manuscript, Hansen and co-authors investigated the role of R-coils in the multimerization and ice nucleation activity of PbINP, an ice nucleation protein identified in Pseudomonas borealis.

This theoretical INP multimer model was introduced to promote discussion and elicit ideas on how to prove or disprove it. The length and width of the fibres are defined by cryo-ET results, in which the narrow width is just sufficient to accommodate a dimer of the INPs, and the long length requires that several INPs are joined end to end. Their antiparallel arrangement produces identical ends to the dimer and avoids steric clash of the C-terminal cap structures as well as the C-terminal GFP tag. This model can accommodate the wide range of INPs lengths seen in nature (due to different numbers of water-organizing coils) and introduced in mutagenesis experiments (Forbes et al. 2022). It defines a critical role for the R-coil subdomain in joining the dimers together and explains why this region cannot be shortened by more than a few coils either in nature or by experimentation.</p><p>In response to specific criticisms of the model (Fig. 9), we have redesigned this to be less schematic and to incorporate several copies of the AlphaFold-predicted structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper further investigates the role of self-assembly of ice-binding bacterial proteins in promoting ice-nucleation. For the P. borealis Ice Nucleating Protein (PbINP) studied here, earlier work had already determined clearly distinct roles for different subdomains of the protein in determining activity. Key players are the water-organizing loops (WO-loops) of the central beta-solenoid structure and a set of non-water-organizing C-terminal loops, called the R-loops in view of characteristically located arginines. Previous mutation studies (using nucleation activity as a read-out) had already suggested the R-loops interact with the WO loops, to cause self-assembly of PbINP, which in turn was thought to lead to enhanced ice-nucleating activity. In this paper, the activities of additional mutants are studied, and a bioinformatics analysis on the statistics of the number of WO- and R-loops is presented for a wide range of bacterial ice-nucleating proteins, and additional electron-microscopy results are presented on fibrils formed by the non-mutated PbINP in E coli lysates.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-A very complete set of additional mutants is investigated to further strengthen the earlier hypothesis.</p><p>-A nice bioinformatics analysis that underscores that the hypothesis should apply not only to PbINP but to a wide range of (related) bacterial ice-nucleating proteins.</p><p>-Convincing data that PbINP overexpressed in E coli forms fibrils (electron microscopy on E coli lysates).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>-The new data is interesting and further strengthens the hypotheses put forward in the earlier work. However, just as in the earlier work, the proof for the link between self-assembly and ice-nucleation remains indirect. Assembly into fibrils is shown for E coli lysates expressing non-mutated pbINP, hence it is indeed clear that pbINP self-associates. It is not shown however that the mutations that lead to loss of ice-nucleating activity also lead to loss of self-assembly. A more quantitative or additional self-assembly assay could shine light on this, either in the present or in future studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The control cryo-ET experiment where the R-coils were deleted and INP fibres were not seen is consistent with a link between the loss of ice-nucleating activity and the loss of self-assembly. However, we agree that a more direct measurement of the physical state of INP molecules is needed to prove the link.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Also the &quot;working model&quot; for the self-assembly of the fibers remains not more than that, just as in the earlier papers, since the mutation-activity relationship does not contain enough information to build a good structural model. Again, a better model would require different kinds of experiments, that yield more detailed structural data on the fibrils.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1 also raised these criticisms of the model, which we have responded to (above). Testing the model is a focus of our continuing experiments on INPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: in this manuscript, Hansen and co-authors investigated the role of R-coils in the multimerization and ice nucleation activity of PbINP, an ice nucleation protein identified in Pseudomonas borealis. The results of this work suggest that the length, localization, and amino acid composition of R-coils are crucial for the formation of PbINP multimers.</p><p>Strengths: The authors use a rational mutagenesis approach to identify the role of the length, localisation, and amino acid composition of R-coils in ice nucleation activity. Based on these results, the authors hypothesize a multimerization model. Overall, this is a multidisciplinary work that provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ice nucleation activity.</p><p>Weaknesses: Several parts of the work appear cryptic and unsuitable for non-expert readers. The results of this work should be better described and presented.</p></disp-quote><p>In revising the manuscript for reposting we have rewritten sections to make it more accessible to the non-expert.
