The precise thalamic regions involved, or the firing patterns related to the unconsciousness, remain unclear. Interestingly, the highly -expressed thalamic T-type calcium currents have been considered as a candidate for the ionic mechanism for the generation of thalamocortically driven change in conscious state. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD) might control neuronal firing during unconsciousness using Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channel knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD) mice under natural sleep and ethanol-induced unconsciousness. During natural sleep, the MD neurons in KO mice showed general characteristics of sustained firing across sleep stages. We found that KO and MD-specific KD mice showed enhanced resistance to ethanol. During the ethanol-induced unconscious state, wild-type (WT) MD neurons showed a significant reduction in neuronal firing from baseline with increased burst firing, whereas Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO neurons showed well-sustained neural firing, within the level of wakefulness, and no burst firing. Further, 20 Hz optogenetic and electrical activation of MD neurons mimicked the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice. These results suggest that maintaining MD neural firing at a wakeful level is sufficient to induce resistance to ethanol-induced hypnosis in WT mice. This work has important implications for the design of treatments for consciousness disorders using thalamic stimulation of deeper nuclei, including the targeting of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>ethanol</kwd><kwd>optogenetic</kwd><kwd>loss of consciousness</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R001-D1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Hee-Sup</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010446</institution-id><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBS-R001-D2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Hee-Sup</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The firing mode of mediodorsal thalamic neurons may act as a central switching mechanism for the level of arousal and consciousness in natural sleep and induced ethanol hypnosis in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug-induced unconsciousness can be achieved using numerous types of anesthetics with varying modes of action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alkire and Miller, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mashour, 2014</xref>). Ethanol, one of the most frequently abused drugs in human society, can induce sleep-like loss of consciousness at high doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morozova et al., 2014</xref>). While possible neuropharmacological and neural correlates of ethanol sedation have been proposed using in vitro and in vivo methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blomeley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Givens and Breese, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koob et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">White et al., 1990</xref>), recent studies have highlighted the slowing of thalamocortical-driven rhythms as a potent marker of unconsciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>). However, the region and the mechanism linked to thalamic modulation during ethanol-induced unconsciousness remain poorly understood.</p><p>Physiological correlates of thalamocortical rhythmic activities and consciousness state of the brain have been studied extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">LlinÃ¡s et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). T-type calcium channels are known generators of thalamocortical rhythms, through the modulation of cell excitability and rebound burst firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Simms and Zamponi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crunelli et al., 2018</xref>). During sleep, the transition from wakefulness to unconsciousness is associated with membrane hyperpolarization of thalamic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steriade et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royer et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that in ethanol sedation, as in natural sleep or absence seizure, the loss of consciousness is characterized by a switch from tonic to burst firing in thalamic neurons, which involves GABAergic inhibition-driven de-inactivation of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 (<italic>Cacna1g</italic>) T-type channels resulting in slow oscillatory response of the thalamocortical network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">White et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iyer et al., 2011</xref>). Acute intoxication at high doses of ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shin et al., 2005</xref>) induces both slow oscillations in the delta-theta frequency range and a loss of righting reflex (LORR), a classical proxy to assess the loss of consciousness. It has been shown that mice lacking global or thalamic Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 showed altered slow oscillations and sleep architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2004</xref>); delayed sleep induction under several anesthetics (i.e. isoflurane, halothane, sevoflurane, and pentobarbital) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Petrenko et al., 2007</xref>); and increased resistance to drug-induced absence seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). Notably, the absence or blockade of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 resulted in an increased preference for ethanol consumption and novelty-seeking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Newton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shin et al., 2005</xref>). In the current studies, we investigate the role of Ca3.1-mediated T-currents in brain state modulation during ethanol-induced sleep.</p><p>The thalamus is one of the major regions expressing Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talley et al., 1999</xref>) and holds a central role in information transmission and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schiff et al., 2014</xref>). In vitro and in vivo studies using genetically modified mice have revealed that Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type channels play a key role in the genesis of thalamocortical rhythms, such as 3 Hz spike-and-wave discharges, a signature of absence seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Song et al., 2004</xref>) and delta waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Royer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCormick and Pape, 1990</xref>). Previous investigations on thalamic control of consciousness revealed that nuclei within the dorsal medial thalamus (dMT) hold an important modulatory function in the interaction of attention and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saalmann, 2014</xref>). Particularly, the centromedian (CM) thalamic nucleus, and not the ventrobasal nucleus (VB), showed rapid shifts in local field potential (LFP) preceding brain state transitions such as non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and propofol-induced anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>). The paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVN) showed critical involvement in wake/sleep cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2015</xref>). The centrolateral (CL) thalamic nucleus has been implicated in the modulation of arousal, behavior arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giber et al., 2015</xref>), and improvement of level of consciousness during seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gummadavelli et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the direct electrical stimulation of the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) and, in particular, CL, promoted hallmarks of arousal and awakening in primates under propofol and ketamine propofol anesthesia. The MD, a subnucleus of dMT, on the other hand, has only recently been implicated in disorders of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2015</xref>) and ketamine/ethanol-induced loss of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2015</xref>) through the alteration of thalamocortical functional connectivity. In anesthetized primates, the stimulation of ILN and MD increased arousal and wakefulness score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastos et al., 2021</xref>). However, several key questions remain to be answered: (1) Is there a specific role for MD Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels in the control of ethanol-induced loss of consciousness? (2) Does Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channel-driven neuronal firing pattern have any role in the control of consciousness?</p><p>In this study, we identified that knockout (KO) and MD-specific silencing of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels results in increased ethanol resistance in mice. Using single-unit recordings, we compared MD activity of wild-type (WT) and KO mice while the mice transitioned from conscious to unconscious state and found that the KO mice showed more sustained MD activity, whereas the WT mice showed clearly reduced MD activity. Furthermore, and consistently with their resistant phenotype, KO mice showed sustained MD firing, well within the wakefulness level, under ethanol consumption. Finally, we demonstrate that both the optogenetic and electrical stimulations in MD, mimicking the sustained firing pattern of KO mice, were sufficient to induce the increased ethanol resistance in WT mice. These results reveal a causal control of brain state by MD during ethanol-induced unconsciousness and with an underlying neural mechanism governed by Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To understand the role of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in modulating the consciousness level, we compared the ethanol resistance between WT and Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO (<italic>Cacna1g</italic>â/â) littermates. We used the forced walking task (FWT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), an analog to the LORR assay, which enables a continuous and high-temporal resolution assessment of the loss of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hwang et al., 2010</xref>) (LOM). Moreover, the FWT objectively measures the latency to and duration of the first LOM, but also the total time spent in LOM using automatized analysis of video confirmed by electromyograms (EMGs) or accelerometer recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; see Methods).

Ethanol-induced fLOM, similarly to REM and NREM clusters, was distinct from awake clusters in WT mice and overlapped with the NREM clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, third to left panel). Here also, mutant MD neurons showed overlap with the awake clusters rather than the âlow consciousnessâ brain states. These results indicate that the firing mode and properties could define a brain state representation that shows distinctions in levels of consciousness.

Whole body Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KO and MD-specific Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 KD mice showed resistance to loss of consciousness induced by hypnotic dose of ethanol. In WT mice, MD neurons demonstrated a reduced firing rate in natural (sleep) and ethanol-induced unconscious states compared to awake states. This neural activity reduction was impaired in KO mice. In particular, transition to an unconscious state was accompanied by a switch of firing mode from tonic firing to burst firing in WT mice, whereas this mode shift disappeared in KO mice. Finally, optogenetic or electric stimulations of the MD after ethanol injection were sufficient to induce a resistance to loss of motion, supporting that the level of neural firing in the MD is critical to maintain conscious state and delay unconscious state. We showed that the expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 T-type calcium channels in MD is a cellular modulator associated with this effect.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>MD is a modulator of consciousness</title><p>The role of MD in perception, attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Courtiol and Wilson, 2014</xref>), and emotional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paydar et al., 2014</xref>) has been the dominant focus thus far. The recent investigations on thalamic control of consciousness revealed that nuclei within dMT hold an important modulatory function in the interaction of attention and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saalmann, 2014</xref>). Particularly, the CM, and not VB, showed rapid shifts in LFP preceding brain state transitions such as NREM and propofol-induced anesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>). The CL was implicated in the modulation of arousal and improvement of consciousness during seizure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gummadavelli et al., 2015</xref>), and the PVN showed critical involvement in wake/sleep cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colavito et al., 2015</xref>). The mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, however, has rarely been included as a possible pathway in the direct modulation of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2015</xref>). The MD receives projections from various parts of the basal forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>) and brainstem nuclei, such as the pedunculopontine nucleus, that control the ascending pathway of arousal and attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sarter and Bruno, 1999</xref>). The MD is known to innervate the limbic region, basal ganglia, and medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cassidy and Gale, 1998</xref>), and increased activity in MD might modulate the stability of cortical UP states (e.g. awaken, aroused, and attentive states) and synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schiff et al., 2014</xref>).

In addition, we found a strong association between the normalized tonic firing in MD and the arousal through brain states (i.e. walk to wake to sleep states), supporting that MD tonic firing could be interpreted both as a thalamic readout and as a modulator of the brain state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

However, considering the dramatic difference in tonic firing observed during the FWT following i.p. injection of ethanol, the change in tonic firing in MD was the focus of our analysis.</p><p>We observed a reduction in neural firing under ethanol sleep conditions in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D1 and D2</xref>), suggesting that low firing levels should be associated with a state of low consciousness as observed during NREM sleep. Mutant RS neurons in MD showed an overall lower excitability and variability of firing in various natural conscious and unconscious states compared to WT mice. Remarkably, Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice exhibited a clear increase in locomotor activity and an increased resistance to ethanol. The general lower firing rate and the high âarousalâ observed in mutant mice suggest that the relative change from state to state in tonic firing in MD, and not the absolute value of firing, might be a better correlate of change in brain state in the mice. Our optogenetic and electrical stimulation showed that sustained tonic-like stimulation in the MD at 20 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), a physiologically relevant firing rate in wake state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), could increase ethanol resistance in WT mice. Reducing MD firing using phasic inhibition under ethanol, potentially leading to inhibition and rebound burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shao et al., 2022</xref>), could also increase the duration of the fLOM in WT mice injected with a lower dose of ethanol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5âfigure supplement 5</xref>; 2.0 g/kg). We propose that the relative change in firing rate in MD RS neurons might be an important driver and indicator of the change of transition in and out of consciousness, as demonstrated for other nuclei of the dMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schiff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gummadavelli et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colavito et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the low variability in firing of MD in Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 mutant mice might be the driving force for the higher resistance to loss of motion under ethanol.

In addition, burst-like electrical stimulation of MD did not significantly affect ethanol resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

Mechanisms such as adenosine receptor depreciation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clasadonte et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Naassila et al., 2002</xref>) or GABA-receptor potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allan and Harris, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Suryanarayanan et al., 2011</xref>) would enhance ethanol resistance and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koob et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schulteis and Liu, 2006</xref>), spiraling into further sleep fragmentation, memory consolidation deficit, impulsivity, and other impairments associated with alcoholism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Ca<sub>v</sub>3.1 heterozygous mice (<italic>Cacna1g</italic><sup>+/â</sup>) were maintained in two genetic backgrounds, 129/svjae and C57BL/6J.

Mice were maintained with free access to food and water under a 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle, with the light cycle beginning at 8:00 AM. Animal care was provided, and all experiments were conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Basic Science and the Korean Institute of Science and Technology. All experiments were conducted using 12- to 16-week-old male mice. For group comparison and grouping, mice were randomly assigned to a group and pseudo-anonymized (mouse number and treatments were traceable through a spreadsheet).

Following anesthetic administration, mice (11-week-old for electrode implantation; 10 weeks for virus injection) were fixed in a stereotaxic device (David Kopf Instruments). For chronic recording of EEG and EMG, a stainless-steel screw electrode was fixed into the skull over the right parietal hemisphere, and an uncoated stainless-steel wire was tied to the nuchal muscle, respectively. For in vivo freely moving single-unit recording, we used a Harlan 4 Drive (Neuralynx Inc) mounted with three to four tetrode wires inserted to the caudal region of the right mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (anteroposterior, â1.4; lateral, +0.4; depth: 3.2 mm). Single tetrode wires were prepared from four twisted nichrome-formvar/PAC wires (Kanthal Precision Technology, OD 0.0127 mm) and gold-plated to achieve an impedance range of 150â400 kÎ© (1 kHz, in saline solution). A period of 7 days was given to allow a complete recovery from the surgical procedure. For all chronic implantation of electrodes, an additional screw was positioned over the occipital region and used as a reference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Optogenetic neurostimulation</title><p>For the optogenetic experiment, 16 mice were bilaterally injected with aav9-SYN-ChR2-sfGFP virus in the mediodorsal thalamus and implanted with optic fiber guides (125 Î¼m core diameter, Doric Lenses Inc) positioned at a 30-degree angle from the transverse plane. The mice were given 2â3 weeks to recover and to allow for the viral expression. These mice were then randomly assigned to a no stimulation (n=8) and a 20 Hz stimulation group (n=6).

Using these recordings, we verified the fidelity between the triggered laser stimulation and the single-unit response in the vicinity of the laser illumination. The spike per stimulation trial, spike initiation success rate, and the delayed triggered spiking (jittering) were estimated from these recordings. For all simulations, we used a high stability 473 nm (blue, MFB-III-473-AOM; Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd.) fiber coupled (FC) at an intensity of 6.0 mW.

This construct was favored over the halorhodopsin channel due to the long duration of the stimulation intended (60 min, 1 s pulse with a duty cycle of 50%, 0r 1 s ON-OFF sequence) and low toxicity. The mice were implanted with optic fiber guides (125 Î¼m core diameter, Doric Lenses Inc) positioned at a 30-degree angle from the transverse plane.

Given its unique functional roles and connectivity pattern, the finding that the mediodorsal thalamus has a fundamental role in regulating alcohol-induced transitions in consciousness state is both important for researchers investigating thalamocortical dynamics and more broadly interesting for understanding brain function. In addition, the author's examination of the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.1 provides considerable evidence that burst-firing mediated by this channel in the thalamus is functionally important for behavioral-state transitions. While many previous studies have suggested an analogous role for these channels in sleep-state regulation, the evidence for a role of this type of bursting in sedative-induced transitions is more limited so the evidence presented is of considerable value to the field. By performing comparative experiments across multiple thalamic nuclei which have been implicated in controlling state-transitions, the authors also validate their claim and establish the unique role of the mediodorsal thalamus. Overall, this study provides substantial mechanistic insight into how the thalamus influences drug induced transitions between different states of consciousness and opens avenues for future research into how thalamocortical interactions enable brain function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study employes multiple, complementary research approaches including behavioral assays, sh-RNA based localized knockdown, single-unit recordings, and patterned optogenetic interventions to examine the role of activity in the mediodorsal thalamus in the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcohol. Experiments and analysis included in the manuscript generally appear well conceived and generally well executed. Sample sizes are sufficiently large and statistical analysis appears generally appropriate. The findings presented are novel and provide interesting insight into the role of the thalamus as well as voltage gated calcium channels within this region in controlling behavioral state-transitions induced by alcohol. In particular, the observed effects of selective knockout along with recordings in total knockout oof the voltage gated calcium channel, Cav3.1, which has previously been implicated in bursting dynamics as well as state transitions, particularly in sleep, together suggest that the transition of thalamic neurons to a bursting pattern of firing from a more constant firing is important for transition to the sedated state produced by ethanol intoxication. While previous studies have similarly implicated Cav3.1 bursting in behavioral state-transitions, the direct optogenetic interventions and single-unit recordings provide valuable new insight. These findings may also have valuable implications for the relationship between sleep process disruption associated with ethanol dependence.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>While the authors have made substantial improvements to the analysis and presented important additional results, some of the methods given in the supplemental are still somewhat minimal in their description of the methods employed. In addition, the text of the manuscript still has multiple problematic issues with writing and editing that should be addressed. Such writing issues appear throughout the manuscript including in the abstract as well as in all other sections. While they do not reduce the value of the findings presented, they do make them more difficult to understand and so should be corrected.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93200.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study explores the role of the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and the T-type calcium channel Cav3.1 in ethanol-induced behavioral changes, focusing on transitions between sedation and shifts in brain-states. The authors utilize genetic knockdown, optogenetic manipulation, and electrophysiological recording techniques in mice to assess the contribution of MD Cav3.1 channels to ethanol's sedative effects. The central hypothesis is that Cav3.1-mediated burst firing in the MD is essential for regulating ethanol-induced sedation and arousal transitions.</p><p>The authors' detailed responses to reviewers' comments significantly improved the manuscript, particularly regarding experimental specificity and methodological transparency. They addressed concerns about the specificity of MD knockdowns versus neighboring thalamic nuclei by adding quantifications, enhancing figure clarity, and providing lesion localization data. The revised figures, with added quantification panels, strengthened the claim that the manipulations specifically targeted the MD. Improvements in lesion validation figures and electrode placement explanations further clarified the accuracy of their methods.</p><p>One major limitation, as highlighted by Reviewer 1, is the lack of direct evidence from inhibitory optogenetic studies to validate the role of Cav3.1 channels in modulating ethanol-induced transitions in the MD. While the authors acknowledged the challenges of such experiments, citing technical issues like the inability of Cav3.1 knockout to allow rebound burst firing, the absence of these controls limits definitive causal conclusions about the MD's role. Alternative experiments with varying ethanol doses and data on tonic versus burst firing were presented, but these do not fully compensate for the missing inhibitory optogenetics, leaving some uncertainty regarding the attribution of observed behavioral effects solely to Cav3.1-mediated burst activity in the MD.</p><p>Another challenge is the complexity of distinguishing the specific contribution of the MD from that of other thalamic nuclei involved in regulating arousal and brain-states. Although additional quantification was provided to demonstrate MD specificity, control experiments targeting adjacent regions like the central lateral nucleus (CL) would have strengthened the manuscript. While the practical constraints are understandable, this limitation slightly weakens the argument regarding the MD's unique role in state transitions. The provided explanations about spatial targeting and electrophysiological methods were reasonable, but a broader set of thalamic controls would have offered a more comprehensive understanding.</p><p>Overall, the authors successfully achieved their aims, providing strong evidence that Cav3.1-mediated burst firing in the MD is crucial for ethanol-induced sedation. The knockdown experiments showed a clear reduction in ethanol sensitivity, and the behavioral assays supported the conclusion that MD Cav3.1 activity plays a key role in regulating arousal states. The combined use of Cav3.1 knockdown and optogenetic stimulation effectively linked MD activity to ethanol-induced behavioral changes. The evidence presented establishes a clear mechanistic connection between neuronal activity and behavioral responses.</p><p>The expanded discussion and clarifications in response to reviewer feedback enhanced the manuscript's coherence, and the revisions to the figures improved the transparency of the findings. Despite not implementing all the additional experiments suggested by Reviewer 1, the authors provided sufficient alternative evidence and a clear explanation of practical limitations, making their conclusions credible given the available data.</p><p>This study significantly advances our understanding of thalamic involvement in behavioral state transitions, particularly ethanol-induced sedation. By clarifying the role of Cav3.1-mediated burst firing in the MD, the research provides new insights into how specific neuronal activity patterns influence global brain states and behavioral arousal, which has implications for understanding mechanisms underlying anesthesia, sedation, and sleep regulation. Moreover, the transparency in data sharing and detailed methodological revisions make this work a valuable resource for replication or adaptation in similar studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93200.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Latchoumane</surname><given-names>Charles-francois V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daejeon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Joon-Hyuk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daejeon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seong-Wook</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daejeon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jinhyun</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seoul</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shin</surname><given-names>Hee-Sup</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Basic Science</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Daejeon</named-content></addr-line><country>Republic of Korea</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and valuable study that uses multiple approaches to understand the role of bursting involving voltage-gated calcium channels within the mediodorsal thalamus in the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcohol. Given its unique functional roles and connectivity pattern, the idea that the mediodorsal thalamus may have a fundamental role in regulating alcohol-induced transitions in consciousness state would be both important for researchers investigating thalamocortical dynamics and more broadly interesting for understanding brain function. In addition, the author's examination of the role of the voltage-gated calcium channel Cav3.1 provides some evidence that burst-firing mediated by this channel in the thalamus is functionally important for behavioral-state transitions. While many previous studies have suggested an analogous role for sleep-state regulation, the evidence for an analogous role of this type of bursting in sedative-induced transitions is more limited. Despite the importance of these results, however, there is some concern that the manipulations and recording approaches employed by the authors may affect other thalamic nuclei adjacent to the MD, such as the central lateral nucleus, which has also been implicated in controlling state transitions. The evidence for a specific role of the mediodorsal thalamus is therefore somewhat incomplete, and so additional validation is needed.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study employs multiple, complementary research approaches including behavioral assays, sh-RNAbased localized knockdown, single-unit recordings, and patterned optogenetic interventions to examine the role of activity in the mediodorsal thalamus in the sedative-hypnotic effects of alcohol. Experiments and analyses included in the manuscript generally appear well conceived and are also generally well executed. Sample sizes are sufficiently large and statistical analysis appears generally appropriate though in some cases additional quantification would be helpful. The findings presented are novel and provide some interesting insight into the role of the thalamus as well as voltage-gated calcium channels within this region in controlling behavioral state transitions induced by alcohol. In particular, the observed effects of selective knockout along with recordings in total knockout of the voltage-gated calcium channel, Cav3.1, which has previously been implicated in bursting dynamics as well as state transitions, particularly in sleep, together suggest that the transition of thalamic neurons to a bursting pattern of firing from a more constant firing is important for transition to the sedated state produced by ethanol intoxication. While previous studies have similarly implicated Cav3.1 bursting in behavioral state transitions, the direct optogenetic interventions and single-unit recordings provide valuable new insight. These findings may also have interesting implications for the relationship between sleep process disruption associated with ethanol dependence, although the authors do not appear to examine this directly or extensively discuss these implications of their findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A key claim of the study is that the mediodorsal thalamus is specifically important for the sedative-hypnotic effect of ethanol and that a transition to a bursting pattern of firing in this circuit facilitates these effects due to a loss of a more constant tonic firing pattern. Despite the generally clear observed effects across the included experiments, however, the evidence presented does not fully support that the mediodorsal thalamus, in particular, is involved. This distinction is important because some previous studies have suggested that another thalamic nucleus which is very close to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus, has previously been suggested to play a role in preventing sedative-induced transitions. Despite its proximity to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus has a substantially different pattern of connectivity so distinguishing which region is impacted is important for understanding the findings in the manuscript. While sh- RNA knockdown appears to be largely centered in the mediodorsal thalamus in the example shown, (Figure 2) this is rather minimal evidence and it is also not well explained (indeed, the relevant panels do not even appear to be referenced in the text of the manuscript) and the consistency of the knockdown targeting is not quantified. Additional evidence should be provided to validate this approach. Similarly, while an example is shown for the expression of ChR2 (Fig. 5) there seems to be some spread of expression outside of the mediodorsal thalamus even in his example raising a concern about how regionally specific this effect.</p><p>The recordings targeting the mediodorsal thalamus could provide evidence of a direct association between changes in activity specifically in this part of the thalamus with the behavioral measures but there are currently some issues with making this link. One difficulty is that, although lesions are shown in Figure S5 to validate recording locations, this figure is relatively unclear and the examples appear to be taken from a different anterior/posterior location compared to the reference diagram. A larger image and improved visualization of the overall set of lesion locations that includes multiple anterior/posterior coronal sections would be helpful. Moreover, even for these example images, it is difficult to evaluate whether these are in the mediodorsal thalamus, particularly given the small size of the image shown. Ideally, an example image that is more obviously in the mediodorsal thalamus would also be included. Finally, an assessment of the relationship between the approximate locations of recorded neurons across the tetrode arrays and the behavioral measures would be very helpful in supporting the unique role of the mediodorsal thalamus. The lack of these direct links, in combination with the histological issues, reduces the insight that can be gained from this study.</p><p>In addition to the key experimental issues mentioned above, there are often problems in the text of the manuscript with reasoning or at least explanation as well as numerous minor issues with editing. The most substantial such issue is the lack of clarity in discussing the mediodorsal thalamus and other adjacent thalamic nuclei, such as the central-lateral nucleus, in the author's discussion of previous findings. Given that at last one of the manuscripts cited by the authors (Saalman, Front. Sys. Neuro. 2014) has directly claimed that central-lateral, rather than the mediodorsal, thalamus is important for arousal regulation related to a conscious state, this distinction should be addressed clearly in the discussion rather than papered over by grouping multiple thalamic nuclei as being medial. As part of this discussion, it would be important to consider additional relevant literature including Bastos et al., eLife, 2021 and Redinbaugh et al., Neuron, 2020 which are quite critical but currently do not appear to be cited. Considering additional literature relevant to the function of the mediodorsal thalamus would also be beneficial. While the methods employed generally seem sound, the description in the methods section is lacking in detail and is often difficult to follow. Analysis methods such as the burst index appear to only be given a brief explanation in the text and appear not to be mentioned in the methods section. Similarly, the staining method used in Figure 2 does not appear to be described in the methods section. The most substantial case is for the UMAP approach used in Figure 4-E which does not appear to be described in the methods or even described in the main text. The lack of detailed descriptions makes it difficult to evaluate the applicability and quality of the experimental and analytical approaches. Citations justifying the use of methods such as the approach to separate regular spiking and narrow spiking neuron subtypes are also needed.</p><p>Beyond the problems with content and reasoning discussed above, there are also some relatively minor issues with the clarity of writing throughout the paper for example, in the abstract the authors refer to &quot;the ethanol resistance behavior in WT mice&quot; but it is difficult to parse what they mean by this statement. Similarly, the next sentence &quot;These results support that the maintenance...&quot; while clearer, is not well phrased. Though individually minor, issues like this re-occur throughout the manuscript and sometimes make it difficult to follow so the text should be revised to correct them. There are also some problems with labels such as the labels of A1/A2 in Figure 4, which appear to be incorrect. Also, S7 has no label on the B panels. Finally, some references are not included (only a label of [ref]).</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In the current study, Latchoumane and collaborators focus on the Cav3.1 calcium channels in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus as critical players in the regulation of brain-states and ethanol resistance in mice. By combining behavioural, electrophysiological, and genetic techniques, they report three main findings. First, KO Cav3.1 mice exhibit resistance to ethanol-induced sedation and sustained tonic firing in thalamocortical units. Second, knocked-down Cav3.1 mice reproduce the same behaviour when the mediodorsal, but not the ventrobasal, thalamic nucleus is targeted. Third, either optogenetic or electric stimulation of the mediodorsal thalamus reduces ethanol-induced sedation in control animals.</p><p>Overall, the study is well designed and performed, correctly controlled for confounds, and properly analysed. Nonetheless, it is important to address some aspects of the report. The results support the conclusions of the study. These results are likely to be relevant in the field of systems neuroscience, as they increase the molecular evidence showing how the thalamus regulates brain states.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Aside from the additional quantification and clarification of the analysis discussed in the weakness section, in general, the experiments included in the manuscript seem reasonable. However, I would suggest one additional experiment as well as one control, both of which are relatively straightforward optogenetic experiments, that I feel would be helpful to further improve the study. First, as the authors note, the optogenetic interventions used do not directly address the relevance of the changes in bursting patterns observed in the knockout (KO), which are by far the most robust effect, with the changes in alcohol sensitivity. One approach that could help address this would be to use patterned suppression via inhibitory opsins (e.g. halorhodopsin) to &quot;rescue&quot; the periods of inhibition associated with bursting in the KO. Localizing this inhibition to the mediodorsal thalamus would also lend further credence to their claim that this nuclei is the relevant circuit for their observed effects. For the control, tonic activation of the ventrobasal nucleus, as the authors did for the mediodorsal nucleus, would be beneficial to rule out the possibility that the observed effect would occur with any thalamic nucleus. In addition to these experiments, I did not note the strategy for sharing data obtained through this study so this should be added.</p><p>R1 â 1: A key claim of the study is that the mediodorsal thalamus is specifically important for the sedative-hypnotic effect of ethanol and that a transition to a bursting pattern of firing in this circuit facilitates these effects due to a loss of a more constant tonic firing pattern. Despite the generally clear observed effects across the included experiments, however, the evidence presented does not fully support that the mediodorsal thalamus, in particular, is involved. This distinction is important because some previous studies have suggested that another thalamic nucleus which is very close to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus, has previously been suggested to play a role in preventing sedative-induced transitions. Despite its proximity to the mediodorsal thalamus, the central-lateral thalamus has a substantially different pattern of connectivity so distinguishing which region is impacted is important for understanding the findings in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-A1: The reviewer is right that CL has been pointed as another candidate structure with causal influence on arousal and consciousness. We have focused our efforts in including only recording single units that were from tetrode located in the MD specifically using the lesion code we explain in the method section and in response to R1 question#3. We also produced a quantification of Cav3.1 knock-down that clearly demonstrates that the KD experiment was itself specific to MD, bilaterally, and that CL to CM were minimally impacted by the knock-down process (Fig. 2C and D). Moreover, the optogenetic (fiber incidence was 30 degrees guaranteeing a central coverage rather than lateral; Fiber optic NA = 0.22) and electric stimulation (bipolar twisted electrodes, 50uA) experiments were also very selective and specific to the MD (Fig.S5). It remains clear that MD might not be the sole structure involved in the brain state control towards sedation and âanesthetic statesâ, and CL might be a significant contributor as well, however, we show that CL manipulations were rather irrelevant in our experiments (Fig. 2, S5, S9 and S11).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1-2: While sh-RNA knockdown appears to be largely centered in the mediodorsal thalamus in the example shown, (Figure 2) this is rather minimal evidence and it is also not well explained (indeed, the relevant panels do not even appear to be referenced in the text of the manuscript) and the consistency of the knockdown targeting is not quantified. Additional evidence should be provided to validate this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>R1-A2: In order to address this important question, we have created an additional panel quantification to fig2D. We have then quantified the intensity per area of Cav3.1 expression in sub zones of 4 regions of interest: MD (left, right; 2 subzones each), Centro Medial (CM; 1 subzones in total), Centrolateral/Paraventricular nucleus (CL/PCN; left, right; 2 subzones each) and the submedial nucleus (SMT; left, right; used as a control for the intensity normalization; 1 subzones in total). This panel clearly illustrates that MD was knocked-down bilaterally (p&lt;0.001). Moreover, CM (p&lt;0.05) and CL (p&lt;0.01) were also partially and unilaterally knocked down, as well. This analysis confirms that our KD had a high specificity to MD.</p><p>We added the relevant figure caption and text:</p><p>[Result section, Cav3.1 silencing in the MD, but not VB, increased ethanol resistance in mice, paragraph 3]</p><p>âWe then characterized the change in Cav3.1 expression following the shControl and shCav3.1 knockdown injections in three test regions MD (left and right), CM (centromedial nucleus) and CL (centrolateral nuclei, left and right side) and a negative control region SMT (submedial thalamic nuclei, left and right side). The average intensity was obtained from two coronal brain slices for each mice used in the experiment (see Methods sections, Cav3.1 Intensity quantification). Our results show that the targeting of the knockdown was very specific to the bilateral MD (p&lt;0.001; Fig. 2D). We noted that the CM (p&lt;0.05) and a marginal unilateral knock-down of the CL were also observed (p&lt;0.01). Notably, we tested the correlation between the level of knock-down in MD and the total time in LOM and observed a significant association (Fig. 2D inset; R = 0.599, p = 0.018). This result highlights that the Cav3.1 knock-down was specific to MD and with an intensity associated with ethanol-induced loss of motion.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1-3: One difficulty is that, although lesions are shown in Figure S5 to validate recording locations, this figure is relatively unclear and the examples appear to be taken from a different anterior/posterior location compared to the reference diagram.

Tetrodes that were found outside of the MD delimited region were discarded post analysis. A straight relationship between the closeness of the electrode is unfortunately not possible for tetrode recording, a straight silicone probe which maintains the spatial spacing in recording would have been a better approach in that case, but unfortunately, it was not performed in our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1-4: In addition to the key experimental issues mentioned above, there are often problems in the text of the manuscript with reasoning or at least explanation as well as numerous minor issues with editing.

Whole body Cav3.1 KO and MD-specific Cav3.1 KD mice showed resistance to loss of consciousness induced by hypnotic dose of ethanol. In WT mice, MD neurons demonstrated a reduced firing rate in natural (sleep) and ethanol-induced unconscious states compared to awake states. This neural activity reduction was impaired in KO mice. In particular, transition to an unconscious state was accompanied with a switch of firing mode from tonic firing to burst firing in WT mice whereas this modeshift disappeared in KO mice. Finally, optogenetic or electric stimulations of the MD after ethanol injection were sufficient to induce a resistance to loss of motion, supporting that the level of neural firing in the MD is critical to maintain conscious state and delay unconscious state. We showed that the expression of Cav3.1 t-type calcium channels in MD is a cellular modulator associated with this effect.â</p><p>[Discussion section, MD is a modulator of consciousness, paragraph 2 and 3]</p><p>âThe MD is known to innervate limbic region, basal ganglia and medial prefrontal cortex 50 and increased activity in MD might modulate the stability of cortical UP states (e.g. awaken, aroused and attentive states) and synchronization 9,26.

More importantly, under propofol anesthesia, Bastos et al.35 showed that intralaminar nucleus and MD stimulation lead to increased wake-up subscore and arousal, together with an increased in cortico-cortico and thalamo-cortical slow (delta) frequency power.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that MD KD (Fig. 2A), but not VB KD (Fig. S3) of Cav3.1 increased and is associated (Fig. 2D) with ethanol resistance in mice. We found that MD neurons in Cav3.1 mutant mice exhibited tonic firing within range of wakefulness (Fig. 3 and 4), indicative of resistance to ethanol and wake-like brain state. In addition, we found a strong association between the normalized tonic firing in MD and the arousal through brain states (i.e. walk to wake to sleep states), supporting that MD tonic firing could be interpreted both as a thalamic readout and a modulator of the brain state 11 (Fig. 3). Finally, direct optogenetic and electric MD stimulation increased resistance to loss of consciousness in WT mice (Fig.5 and Fig. S10). To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the causal involvement of mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the modulation of wakefulness and the resistance to ethanol-induced loss of consciousness in mice.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R1-5: While the methods employed generally seem sound, the description in the methods section is lacking in detail and is often difficult to follow.

First, the KO do not have burst firing as they are depleted from Cav3.1 low-threshold calcium channel. Therefore, under ethanol, even if there might exist a rhythmic inhibition that activates Cav3.1 channels and causes a rebound burst, the KO are unable to have it. Therefore, an optogenetic inhibition would only accentuate the total inhibition and could potentially induce an overall decrease in MD firing, resulting in an increase in LOM features. Alternatively, we showed that in a WT with low ethanol dose (where LOM induction is harder), the increased rhythmic inhibition does indeed increase significantly LOM duration and marginally decreases latency to LOM (Fig. S12), indicating that increased inhibition could indeed explain the hypothesis: â the stronger the decrease in MD firing, the faster and longer the LOM.â The only caveat of using WT here is that optogenetic inhibition might also include rebound burst post-inhibition. Injecting bursts only did not alter the response to ethanol (Fig. S10). These results point to the role of loss of firing in MD as a main factor for LOM, and potentially the contribution of burst necessitating a concurrent inhibition/loss of firing.</p><p>We agree that inhibition in KO would further validate this hypothesis, controlling for the role of burst.

Consciousness is a contentious subject. Even in humans, there is still intense research on the topic, not to mention animals, about which we still know very little. Moreover, consciousness is not quantified in this study, as there is no standard metric to do so. Accordingly, talking about 'modulation', 'transition', Ìlevel ', or 'reduction' of consciousness can be misleading. Hence, it is probably safer to strictly refer to brain-states and/or stages of the sleep-wake cycle in this study and reframe it entirely around these concepts.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A1. The reviewer points to an important point and we appreciate this highlight. Agreeing that the definition of consciousness is rather loose and arguably difficult to pinpoint. Here, we settle on a definition that relies on the loss of motion and loss of righting reflex. This definition is widely accepted as the âverifiedâ state in which the absence of responsiveness (to continuous stimuli, inducing reflex or discomfort) is observed and uninterrupted by jerks and spurious movements. Additional metrics needed would be the recording of EMG to quantify atonia and EEG to the settling of a dominantly slow-wave frequency (~4 Hz; ethanol-induced sedation at theta rhythm), as shown in Fig S1A. The driver of this 4Hz frequency and its correlation has been investigated previously (e.g. Choi et al, PNAS, 2012), leading to the accepted link between LOM/LORR and loss of consciousness. Our data present the advantage of showing single neuron recordings and that LOM is a state where the lowest firing activity is present (Fig S7AB) and comparable to deep sleep state activity (Fig3D). The first LOM is the most important as it highlights the deepest loss of consciousness before the ethanol starts to be metabolized and cleared, which would be consistent between animals.</p><p>As a result, we have edited the manuscript to clarify all mentions related to brain states and states of unconsciousness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2-2.

The methods (pg 27) state that two genetic backgrounds (129/svjae and C57BL/6J) were used in the study. Authors should show whether there were significant differences between those backgrounds in the key parameters assessed in the study (particularly resistance to ethanol sedation).</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A5. As mentioned in the method section, we only used the F1-background mice, which are the firstgeneration offspring produced by crossing 129/svjae and C57BL/6J strains. To produce F1 KO mice, we kept the heterozygote mice in two strains. We unfortunately did not study the particular difference of the respective KO of these two backgrounds; however, the pure C57BL/6J KO has been used in other studies by our group (Kim et al 2001; Na et al, 2008; Park et al., 2010). The F1 background allows us to work with mice that are less aggressive and can be handled with less inherent stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2-6. It would be convenient to produce a supplementary figure associated with Figure 1C to show the same data with averages per mouse. That is, 9 points for control and 9 points for KO mice. This also applies to all cases where data is not presented per mouse but pooled between animals.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A6. We have added a panel C in Figure S1, to show the scatter values for all the mice corresponding to the figure 1C. We have also generalized this presentation for all behavior graphics showing all the animals in the scatter plot next to the boxplot. We believe that this presentation increases further the transparency of the manuscript. We have then added the scatter plot for all mice in figure Fig1, Fig2, Fig5, Fig.S2, Fig.S3, Fig.S10 and Fig.S12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2-7. It would be informative to make a supplementary figure associated with Figure 1D to compare baseline raw activity levels (i.e., baseline walking recording) between control and KO mice. That is, do KO and control mice cover comparable distances and at similar speeds during baseline conditions? Figure 1D and Figure 4A suggest that the variability of locomotor activity is larger in KO mice. Hence, this parameter should be quantified and reported.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A7. We thank the reviewer for this comment. We strived to answer to this question in the manuscript in two ways:</p><p>- We first measure the overall hyperlocomotion of the mice using the open field total distance parkoured in our mice cohorts (FigS4C). We did observe that the KO mutant showed hyperlocomotion, but not MD or VB knock-down mice. Which indicates that the hyperlocomotion component is not specific to the two thalamic nuclei studied.</p><p>- Using the forced walking task, we impose on the animal to keep a steady pace of roughly 6cm/s. This assay allows to normalize the general walking behavior to a relatively fixed pace making it comparable for all animals.</p><p>The reviewer suggested reporting the mean and variance in walking of WT and KO during baseline (prior to the ethanol I.P. injection). We believe that the two points mentioned above are sufficient to describe in a more quantitative way the WT vs KO locomotion differences. Moreover, by construction the normalized locomotion on the forced walking task will return similar means for the baseline, the standard deviation would, however, potentially show differences but would remain inconclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2-8. The legend in Figure 1 states that 'the loss of consciousness is evaluated using normalized moving index using either video analysis (differential pixel motion), on- head accelerometer-based motion, or neck electromyograms'. Authors should clarify whether these methods are equivalent and support it with data.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A8. We understand the reviewer point and we have made a few modifications to the method description aligning better with what was done. For most mice, video analysis was used to obtain the moving index. When video recording was not available (2 mice), we had an accelerometer attached to the animalâs head stage which helped us derive a moving index that was similar to the video moving index. The neck electromyogram was rather used for animals implanted with the tetrodes to identify sleep stages based on local field potential frequency and muscle tone. We have then clarified the method for this matter and Figure 1 to avoid this confusion. Since no concurrent recording of both video and accelerometer was performed, we do not have the data to compute the correlation between the two measures, however, no noticeable deviation from loss of motion was observed between the two methods. We realize that this may be a weak argument, however, our observations showed that video and accelerometers returned very similar timings for loss of motion (only a few comparative instances insufficient to present a statistical comparison).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>R2-9. How were spike bursts defined? The authors should try different criteria and verify the consistency of results.</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A9 For in vivo single unit recording, we opted for a definition that is validated from our works and others as a silencing of at least 100 ms followed by a minimum of 3 spikes with:</p><p>- First spike pairs interspike interval less than 4 ms</p><p>- Remaining spike pairs interspike interval less than 20 ms</p><p>We have performed this analysis using a minimum of 2 spikes, and varied silencing periods between 50 and 100ms, without observing significant deviation of the results. As shown in Figure S6B, with this approach we observed that the burst distribution had a majority with &lt;10 spikes per burst. Figure S6C indicated that with a clear distribution of ISI for first spike within 2-4ms as observed in previous works (Desai and Varela, 2021; Alitto et al, 2019), importantly, not clearly capped at 4 ms, showing that the range for the first ISI might indeed be lower than 4ms for thalamic burst. Within burst spike waveforms can become very variable and the choice of 3 over 2 spikes minimum per burst stems from the aim to reduce false positive detection of ultra-short bursts, which in single unit recording remains controversial (Gray et al. 1995).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>R2-10: Figure 4A2 'Cav3.1(+/+)' should presumably be Cav3.1(-/-).</p></disp-quote><p>R2-A10: this is correct and we have corrected the figure label [This sentence is ambiguous.
