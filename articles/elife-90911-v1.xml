The over-expression of PD-L1 has been identified as a critical reason for radiotherapy resistance. Previous studies have demonstrated that nifuroxazide exerts antitumor activity by damaging the Stat3 pathway, but its efficacy against PD-L1 has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated whether nifuroxazide could enhance the efficacy of radiotherapy in HCC by reducing PD-L1 expression. Our results showed that nifuroxazide significantly increased the sensitivity of tumor cells to radiation therapy by inhibiting cell proliferation and migration while increasing apoptosis in vitro. Additionally, nifuroxazide attenuated the up-regulation of PD-L1 expression induced by irradiation, which may be associated with increased degradation of PD-L1 through the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, nifuroxazide greatly enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy in H22-bearing mice by inhibiting tumor growth, improving survival, boosting the activation of T lymphocytes, and decelerating the ratios of Treg cells in spleens. Importantly, nifuroxazide limited the increased expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues induced by radiation therapy. This study confirms, for the first time, that nifuroxazide can augment PD-L1 degradation to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy in HCC-bearing mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer continues to be the primary cause of death and a major public health issue globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Siegel et al., 2021</xref>). Among the various types of cancer, HCC has exhibited an increasing incidence and morbidity, and it is estimated that the number of new HCC cases will surpass one million by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anonymous, 2021</xref>). The current therapeutic options for HCC comprise surgery, targeted therapy, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, among others. Nevertheless, the majority of patients still experience an unfavorable prognosis. Consequently, the development of effective treatment strategies for HCC is a pressing and challenging issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tomášek and Kiss, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Radiation therapy is a widely used localized therapeutic approach for the treatment of HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Klein and Dawson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). It has been demonstrated that radiation therapy can induce DNA damage and mutations in tumor cells through the generation of X-rays or γ-rays, leading to the death of malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barber, 2015</xref>). Despite significant progress in recent decades, the effectiveness of radiation therapy is limited by various factors. Studies have shown that radiation therapy can contribute to the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) by promoting the infiltration of M2 macrophages, increasing the number of regulatory T cells, impairing the function of CD8 + T lymphocytes, and inducing the release of immunosuppressive cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shevtsov et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, improving the immunosuppressive state of HCC may enhance the clinical efficacy of radiation therapy.</p><p>Programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein predominantly expressed in T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, macrophages, and tumor cells. Upon binding with programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), PD-L1 generates inhibitory signals that suppress the proliferation of T lymphocytes and accumulation of antigen-specific T cells in lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sato et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Voli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Radiation therapy induces DNA damage and repair, activating and up-regulating PD-L1, and creating an immune-suppressive microenvironment, which is a major contributor to the radiotherapy resistance of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gong et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) also take part in shaping the tumor microenvironment by expressing PD-L1. In mice with tumors, inhibition of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway significantly stimulated the activation of macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sumitomo et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, in HCC, radiation therapy up-regulates the expression of PD-L1 via the IFN-γ-Stat3 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greten and Sangro, 2017</xref>). Therefore, blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway may be an effective systemic treatment for enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy.</p><p>The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway blockade has been shown to provide satisfactory clinical benefits for most tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Salmaninejad et al., 2019</xref>). However, the development and research of new drugs are time-consuming, costly, and uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Scannell et al., 2012</xref>), and exploring the potential indications of old drugs has been endorsed by scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wu, 2013</xref>). Nifuroxazide, an antidiarrheal drug, has been demonstrated to significantly inhibit the activation of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (Stat3) and has also exhibited effects in promoting the death of multiple myeloma cells and inhibiting tumor growth. Importantly, treatment with nifuroxazide has shown low toxicity that does not damage peripheral blood mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). However, the relationship between nifuroxazide and the expression of PD-L1 remains unknown, as well as whether nifuroxazide can enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy in tumors by blocking the expression of PD-L1.</p><p>We have revealed that nifuroxazide exerts a significant effect on promoting the degradation of PD-L1 in HCC cells. Notably, administration of nifuroxazide led to a reduction in the expression of PD-L1 in mice, which in turn enhanced the sensitivity of radiation therapy in mice with HCC. This approach may offer a promising combination strategy to counteract the radio-resistance of HCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The administration of Nifuroxazide augmented the radiosensitivity in the treatment of HCC</title><p>The study initially evaluated the impact of Nifuroxazide on HCC radiosensitivity by assessing cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. The CCK-8 assays showed that cell proliferation was significantly inhibited after adding Nifuroxazide for 24 hr, and the inhibitory effect was further enhanced when Nifuroxazide was added after radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, after 48 hr of radiotherapy, there was no significant inhibition of cell proliferation, but co-treatment with Nifuroxazide at concentrations of 2.5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μg/ml resulted in evident inhibition. The combination of Nifuroxazide and radiotherapy also significantly inhibited cell proliferation, as demonstrated by cell cloning results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Additionally, the wound-healing assay and transwell assay showed substantial hindrance of cell migration at both 24 and 48 hr after radiotherapy. The wound healing assay demonstrated that in comparison with the control group, the migratory ability of cells was significantly reduced after treatment for 24 hr in the Nifuroxazide alone group, the radiotherapy alone group, and the combination group (Nifuroxazide plus radiotherapy, showing the most significant reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, the inhibition of cell invasion was further enhanced when the cells were co-treated with Nifuroxazide and radiotherapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The combined treatment also resulted in a more potent pro-apoptotic effect on the cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> indicated that radiotherapy alone did not have a pro-apoptotic effect on HCC, but the combination of radiotherapy and Nifuroxazide at concentrations of 1.25, 2.5, and 5 μg/ml exhibited significant pro-apoptotic effects. These findings suggest that Nifuroxazide may serve as a promising candidate drug to improve the radiosensitivity of HCC treatment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The effect of radiotherapy in combination with nifuroxazide on the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of HepG2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effect of the radiotherapy in combination with nifuroxazide on the viability of HepG2 cells by CCK-8 assay.

Activation of the oncogene Stat3, which plays a critical role in tumor development, was effectively inhibited by radiotherapy in cells. Moreover, Nifuroxazide, an inhibitor of Stat3, was able to suppress the activation of Stat3 in HepG2 cells that had undergone radiotherapy, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. MMP2 plays an important role in cancer cell migration. The results showed that the combination therapy showed a significant inhibiting effect on the expression of MMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The expressions of PCNA and Ki67, which are closely linked to cell proliferation, were reduced by radiotherapy. Furthermore, when administered in conjunction with Nifuroxazide, this inhibitory effect was even more pronounced, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>. The combination therapy also suppressed the expression of cyclin D1, a protein involved in the cell cycle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>. In addition, the study examined apoptotic proteins, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–N</xref>. Caspase 3 is the primary enzyme responsible for the cleavage of cells during apoptosis. The results showed that the expression of cleaved-caspase 3 (c-caspase 3) was significantly increased at 24 or 48 hr after radiotherapy. Furthermore, the combination of radiotherapy and nifuroxazide resulted in a more pronounced upregulation of c-caspase 3, indicating a significant increase in cell apoptosis in HCC. Apoptosis can be induced through various pathways, with the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway being the most important. The results showed that the combination of radiotherapy and nifuroxazide had a significant impact on the expression of Bax, Bcl-2, and cytochrome C. Specifically, the combination therapy inhibited the expression of Bcl-2, which led to the translocation of Bax to mitochondria and the release of cytochrome C into the cytoplasm. The release of cytochrome C subsequently activated caspase 9, another pro-apoptotic protein. These events indicate that radiotherapy in combination with nifuroxazide significantly enhances apoptosis in HCC. PARP is the substrate of caspases and plays a vital role in regulating apoptosis. The activation of PARP is considered an important indicator of cell apoptosis and caspase 3 activation. The results demonstrated that the combination therapy increased the expression of c-PARP, suggesting that it had significant capabilities in inducing apoptosis. Overall, these findings suggest that the combination of radiotherapy and nifuroxazide can inhibit proliferation and increase apoptosis in HCC by regulating different tumor-related proteins.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The effect of radiotherapy in combination with nifuroxazide on the expressions of tumor-associated proteins in cells.</title><p>After radiotherapy, HepG2 cells were treated with nifuroxazide at the different dose.

Seven days after the final treatment, the tumors were extracted, and the size and weight of the tumors were measured. The results showed that both the radiation therapy and nifuroxazide treatment groups exhibited significant inhibition of tumor growth compared to the PBS group, as evidenced by smaller tumor size and weight. Moreover, the combination treatment group demonstrated even greater inhibition of tumor growth than either mono-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>).

Our investigation has confirmed that nifuroxazide can enhance the immune response against tumors induced by radiation therapy by promoting the degradation of PD-L1 in HCC. PD-L1 is predominantly expressed on the surface of tumor cells and severely obstructs the immune response against tumors by binding to PD-1. Several studies have indicated that overexpression of PD-L1 is a major cause of radioresistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boustani et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gong et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, inhibition of PD-L1 may prove to be an effective strategy to strengthen the antitumor effect of radiation therapy. D-mannose has been reported to significantly enhance the effects of radiotherapy by promoting PD-L1 degradation in triple-negative breast tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, Stat3 plays a key role in tumor progression and also regulates PD-L1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tong et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, investigating Stat3 inhibitors could offer a fresh perspective on suppressing PD-L1 expression. A new Stat3 inhibitor was discovered, which is nifuroxazide, previously used to treat diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>). Our study showed that nifuroxazide significantly inhibited the protein expression of PD-L1. Further investigations demonstrated that radiation therapy upregulated the gene level of PD-L1, while nifuroxazide did not change the gene level in vitro. Intriguingly, nifuroxazide covertly promoted the expression of GSK3β in cells that have undergone radiography. Simultaneously, the protease inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect on PD-L1 expression. This finding suggests that nifuroxazide modulates the PD-L1 pathway through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway rather than the mRNA pathway.</p><p>The anti-tumor role of nifuroxazide has been reported. However, the innovation of our study does not lie in confirming its antitumor effects but rather in demonstrating how nifuroxazide can enhance radiotherapy’s efficacy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting PD-L1 levels. We compared the efficacy of the combination therapy versus radiotherapy and found that compared to radiotherapy alone, the combination therapy more significantly inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration. In our animal model, we compared the therapeutic effects of the combination therapy, nifuroxazide alone, and radiotherapy alone on hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice. We observed that compared to individual treatment groups, the combination therapy more profoundly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor effects in the mice.</p><p>The primary objective of this study is to explore whether nifuroxazide can effectively enhance the degradation of PD-L1, thereby increasing the radiosensitivity of HCC. Our research reveals that compared to radiation therapy alone, combination therapy involving nifuroxazide and radiation significantly inhibits tumor growth in mice and boosts the anti-tumor immune response. This finding could potentially provide a valuable strategy for patients who exhibit resistance to radiation therapy in clinical practice. Moreover, clinical trial investigations have demonstrated that nivolumab, a PD-1 monoclonal antibody, when combined with radiotherapy for HCC, exhibits promising safety and efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de la Torre-Aláez et al., 2022</xref>). This evidence supports the future application of nifuroxazide in the treatment of HCC. However, to reach this objective, we must continue to conduct extensive research, including comparing nifuroxazide with existing therapies in clinical practice. In this study, nifuroxazide not only significantly inhibits the expression of PD-L1 protein in HCC cells but also functions as a PD-L1 inhibitor. Furthermore, it effectively curbs the proliferation and migration of HCC cells, induces tumor cell apoptosis, and may exhibit enhanced anti-tumor effects, making it a promising candidate for clinical use. We believe that the advantage of nifuroxazide over PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies lies in its ability not only to effectively inhibit PD-L1 expression but also to suppress tumor cell proliferation, migration, and promote tumor cell apoptosis.</p><p>We analyzed the underlying anti-tumor mechanism of nifuroxazide in terms of cell proliferation, migration, and drug action target. Research has shown that regulating the STAT3/PD-L1 pathway can effectively increase apoptosis in lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). Our study confirmed that nifuroxazide can effectively inhibit the expression of p-STAT3 and PD-L1 in liver cancer cells, which may be the reason for the increased apoptosis of these cells. Nifuroxazide has been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of p-STAT3, thereby suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Nelson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we observed that after 48 hr of treatment with nifuroxazide, the expression of p-STAT3 in irradiated cells was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, compared to radiotherapy alone, combining nifuroxazide and radiotherapy resulted in a more pronounced decrease in PCNA expression. Simultaneously, we performed additional detection of migration-related protein MMP2, confirming that combining nifuroxazide and radiotherapy led to a more significant inhibition of MMP2 expression. These findings suggest that the combination treatment may be responsible for the synergistic suppression of HCC cell proliferation and migration. Our initial results indicate that nifuroxazide inhibits the expression of PD-L1 at the protein level, but does not affect its mRNA level. Interestingly, upon treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132, the inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on PD-L1 was eliminated, suggesting that nifuroxazide may enhance the degradation of PD-L1 protein. Our experiments have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of Nifuroxazide on PD-L1 in both human and mouse cell lines.</p><p>Furthermore, the overexpression expression of PD-L1 hinders the antitumor immunity response by inhibiting T lymphocyte function and macrophage polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cousin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>). The activity of T lymphocytes is closely associated with tumor progression, but it can become dysregulated due to the interaction between PD-1 and PD-L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dammeijer et al., 2020</xref>). Blocking the PD-1 and PD-L1 pathways can reverse T-cell exhaustion and enhance their ability to eliminate tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budimir et al., 2022</xref>). In our study, treatment with nifuroxazide effectively boosted T-cell activation, with a more pronounced effect observed in mice receiving radiation therapy. Radiation therapy has been shown to induce an immunogenic effect that promotes T lymphocyte infiltration into tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lhuillier et al., 2019</xref>), but it also induces PD-L1 expression, which impairs T lymphocyte function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lan et al., 2021</xref>). Under these circumstances, nifuroxazide significantly enhanced T lymphocyte activation in mice receiving radiation therapy by reducing PD-L1 expression.</p><p>Moreover, the upregulation of PD-L1 on the surface of macrophages has been found to promote the reduction of M1 macrophage polarization, which is recruited by tumor cells, leading to the inhibition of antitumor immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ubil et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have indicated a distinct decline in M1 macrophages in tumor tissues of patients undergoing radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, a crucial strategy to enhance the antitumor effect of radiation therapy is to reverse macrophage polarization. Our research confirmed that nifuroxazide had a positive effect on promoting M1 macrophage polarization. Notably, while radiation therapy suppressed the infiltration of M1 macrophages, the number of M1 macrophages significantly increased in tumor tissues of mice treated with nifuroxazide and radiation therapy. These findings demonstrate that nifuroxazide plays a vital role in strengthening the antitumor immunity of radiation therapy for HCC by reversing macrophage polarization.</p><p>To summarize, the antitumor effect of radiation therapy is impaired due to the induction of PD-L1 expression. High expression of PD-L1 hinders the antitumor function of T lymphocytes and macrophages. However, nifuroxazide significantly inhibits PD-L1 up-regulation induced by radiation therapy, enhances the activation of T lymphocytes and the ratio of M1 macrophages, and decreases the number of Treg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We confirm that nifuroxazide improves the antitumor effect of radiotherapy and provides a synergistic therapeutic strategy for HCC patients, especially those who are radioresistant. However, to achieve the goal of applying nifuroxazide combined with radiation therapy for the treatment of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma, we still need to undertake extensive research, including validation on genetically identical mouse HCC tumor models.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The synergistic antitumor mechanism of radiotherapy in combination with nifuroxazide in tumor-bearing mice.</title><p>NK cell: natural killer cell.

Given that immune-suppressive microenvironment is a major mechanism underlying resistance to radiotherapy, they reasoned that a drug that blocks PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could improve efficacy of radiation therapy and chose to investigate the effect of Nifuroxazide, an inhibitor of stat3 activation, on radiotherapy efficacy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma cells. From in vitro experiments, they find combination treatment (Nifuroxazide+ radiotherapy) increases apoptosis and reduces proliferation and migration, in comparison to radiotherapy alone. From in vivo experiments, they demonstrate that combined treatment reduces size and weight of tumors in vivo and enhances mice survival. These data indicate a better efficacy of combination therapy compared to radiotherapy alone. Moreover, they also determined the effect of combination therapy on tumor microenvironment as well as peripheral immune response. Specifically, they find that combination therapy increases infiltration of CD4+, CD8+ t cells and NK cells, activates CD8+ t cells, enhances polarization of M1 macrophages and decreases Treg cells in the tumor microenvironment. These changes in tumor microenvironment is consistent with reduced tumor growth by combination therapy. The most intriguing part of the study is the determination of effect of Nifuroxazide on PD-L1 expression in the context of radiotherapy. Considering Nifuroxazide is a stat3 activation inhibitor and stat3 inhibition leads to reduced expression of PD-L1, one would expect Nifuroxazide decreases PD-L1 expression through stat3. However, they find the effect of Nifuroxazide on PD-L1 is dependent on GSK3 mediated Proteasome pathways and independent of stat3, in the given experimental context. To determine the relevance to human hepatocellular carcinoma, they also measured the PD-L1 expression in human tumor tissues of HCC patients pre- and post-radiotherapy. The increased PD-L1 expression level in HCC after radiotherapy is impressive.</p><p>Overall, the data are convincing and supportive to the conclusions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1.

Research has shown that regulating the STAT3/PD-L1 pathway can effectively increase apoptosis in lung cancer cells (1).

The primary objective of this study is to explore whether nifuroxazide can effectively enhance the degradation of PD-L1, thereby increasing the radiosensitivity of HCC. Our research reveals that compared to radiation therapy alone, combination therapy involving nifuroxazide and radiation significantly inhibits tumor growth in mice and boosts the anti-tumor immune response. This finding could potentially provide a valuable strategy for patients who exhibit resistance to radiation therapy in clinical practice. Moreover, clinical trial investigations have demonstrated that nivolumab, a PD-1 monoclonal antibody, when combined with radiation therapy for HCC, exhibits promising safety and efficacy (2). This evidence supports the future application of nifuroxazide in the treatment of HCC.However, to reach this objective, we must continue to conduct extensive research, including comparing nifuroxazide with existing therapies in clinical practice. We believe that nifuroxazide not only significantly inhibits the expression of PD-L1 protein in HCC cells but also functions as a PD-L1 inhibitor. Furthermore, it effectively curbs the proliferation and migration of HCC cells, induces tumor cell apoptosis, and may exhibit enhanced anti-tumor effects, making it a promising candidate for clinical use. We have incorporated relevant discussion content in the article to address these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zhao et al. aimed to explore an important question - how to overcome the resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma cells to radiotherapy?

In this study, we primarily compared the antitumor effects of nifuroxazide combined with radiotherapy versus either nifuroxazide or radiotherapy alone, and confirmed that the combined treatment demonstrated a more potent anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effect compared to single therapy. Furthermore, to achieve the goal of utilizing nifuroxazide for the treatment of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma, additional research is necessary, including comparisons with other clinically established therapies. We have also incorporated relevant discussions in our analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors embarked on an exploration of how nifuroxazide could enhance the responsiveness to radiotherapy by employing both an in vitro cell culture system and an in vivo mouse tumor model.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The researchers conducted an array of experiments aimed at revealing the function of nifuroxazide in aiding the radiotherapy-induced reduction of proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors did not provide the molecular mechanism through which nifuroxazide collaborates with radiotherapy to effectively curtail the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells. Moreover, the evidence supporting the assertion that nifuroxazide contributes to the degradation of radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway appears to be insufficient. Importantly, further validation of this discovery should involve the utilization of an additional syngeneic mouse HCC tumor model or an orthotopic HCC tumor model.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comments. Nifuroxazide has been demonstrated to inhibit the expression of p-STAT3, thereby suppressing tumor cell proliferation and migration (3, 4). In our study, we observed that after 48 hours of treatment with Nifuroxazide, the expression of p-STAT3 in irradiated cells was significantly inhibited. Furthermore, compared to radiation alone, combined Nifuroxazide and radiotherapy resulted in a more pronounced decrease in PCNA expression. Simultaneously, we performed additional detection of migration-related protein MMP2 expression (revised Fig 2B), confirming that combined Nifuroxazide and radiotherapy led to a more significant inhibition of MMP2 expression. These findings suggest that the combined treatment may be responsible for the synergistic suppression of HCC cell proliferation and migration. We have included relevant discussions in our manuscript.</p><p>Our initial results indicate that Nifuroxazide inhibits the expression of PD-L1 at the protein level, but does not affect its mRNA level. Interestingly, upon treatment with a proteasome inhibitor MG132, the inhibitory effect of Nifuroxazide on PD-L1 was eliminated, suggesting that Nifuroxazide may enhance the degradation of PD-L1 protein. Our experiments have demonstrated the inhibitory effect of Nifuroxazide on PD-L1 in both human and mouse cell lines. However, to translate these findings into clinical application for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, additional research is necessary, including validation in genetically engineered mouse models of HCC. We have addressed these points in the discussion section of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1.

What is the advantage of using a combination of nifuroxazide and radiotherapy in comparison to using a combination of anti-PD1/PDL1 and radiotherapy?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comments. We believe that the advantage of nifuroxazide over PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies lies in its ability not only to effectively inhibit PD-L1 expression but also to suppress tumor cell proliferation, migration, and promote cell apoptosis (Supplementary Fig 1). We have also expanded on these aspects in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We have measured the infiltration of NK and Treg cells in tumor tissues (Supplementary Fig 2), as well as the abundance of M1 macrophages (revised Fig 6) in the spleen, and provided additional relevant data to strengthen our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other comments:</p><p>1. The data in Fig 1 is solid. However, it is hard to distinguish the effect of increased radiosensitivity by nifuroxazide from combined anti-tumor effects by two different treatments. The anti-tumor role of Nifuroxazide has been reported in melanoma, colorectal carcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma previously (PMID: 26830149; 28055016, 26154152). Therefore, the increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and migration could be caused by nifuroxazide and not related to the sensitivity of cells to radiation therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your constructive feedback. As you suggested, the anti-tumor role of nifuroxazide has been reported. However, the innovation of our study does not lie in confirming its antitumor effects but rather in demonstrating how nifuroxazide can enhance radiotherapy's efficacy in treating hepatocellular carcinoma by inhibiting PD-L1 levels.</p><p>We compared the efficacy of combined therapy versus radiotherapy and found that compared to radiation alone, combined therapy more significantly inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and migration. In our animal model, we compared the therapeutic effects of combined therapy, nifuroxazide, and radiotherapy on hepatocellular carcinoma-bearing mice. We observed that compared to individual treatment groups, combined therapy more profoundly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor effects in the mice.</p><p>In response to your feedback, we have expanded the discussion on the impact of combined therapy versus nifuroxazide or radiotherapy on hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis (Supplementary Fig 1). The data show that compared to either individual therapy, combined therapy further inhibited cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There is no direct evidence to show the improved efficacy of radiation therapy by nifuroxazide through the degradation of PD-L1.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your valuable suggestions. In our cell experiments, we found that nifuroxazide inhibits the increased expression of PD-L1 in cells induced by radiation therapy, and this inhibitory effect is counteracted when using the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Therefore, we speculate that nifuroxazide may inhibit PD-L1 expression through a proteasome-dependent mechanism. To better reflect this, we have revised the title of our manuscript to &quot;Nifuroxazide Suppresses PD-L1 Expression and Enhances the Efficacy of Radiotherapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. &quot;The oncogene Stat3.....was effectively inhibited by radiotherapy in cells&quot; - this sentence may be rephrased to make the point clear.

This was evidenced by its synergistic effect in suppressing the proliferation and migratory capabilities of HCC cells, alongside its capacity to induce apoptosis in these cells. Furthermore, their findings underscored the substantial synergy between nifuroxazide and radiotherapy in retarding tumor growth, thereby extending survival rates in a tumor-bearing murine model. Moreover, the authors observed that nifuroxazide combined with radiotherapy significantly increases the tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and M1 macrophages. Finally, the authors found that nifuroxazide countered the radiotherapy-induced upregulation of PD-L1 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the evidence for supporting the main claims is only partially supported. The following are my concerns and suggestions.</p><p>1. In Figures 1 and 2, the authors convincingly demonstrate the synergistic impact of nifuroxazide and radiotherapy on curtailing the proliferation, colony formation, and migratory capabilities of HCC cells, while also instigating apoptosis in these cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. A recent study highlighted nifuroxazide's potential to impede the proliferation of glioblastoma cells and induce apoptosis via the MAP3K1/JAK2/STAT3 pathway (Wang X., et al., Int Immunopharmacol. 2023 May;118:109987. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2023.109987). It would be valuable for the authors to investigate whether nifuroxazide employs a similar molecular mechanism to regulate proliferation and apoptosis in the context of HCC. This could offer deeper insights into the mechanisms at play in their observed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your insightful comments. As you pointed out, previous studies have reported that nifuroxazide exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. However, in our experiments, we observed that radiation therapy significantly increased the expression of PD-L1, but showed a trend of decreased p-STAT3 expression. Therefore, we believe that nifuroxazide does not inhibit PD-L1 expression through the STAT3 pathway. Subsequently, our further research revealed that the inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on PD-L1 can be counteracted by a proteasome inhibitor. Thus, we propose that nifuroxazide inhibits PD-L1 expression through a proteasome-dependent mechanism, thereby enhancing the efficacy of radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figures 1 and 2 solely rely on the HepG2 cell line to establish their conclusions. To validate these findings robustly, it is recommended that another HCC cell line be included in the study. This additional cell line will contribute to the generalizability and reliability of the results, enhancing the overall credibility of the study's conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you very much for your suggestion. We have included additional experimental results with the relevant cell line Huh7 (supplementary Fig 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 3 demonstrates the use of only one syngeneic mouse H22 tumor model. To ensure the robustness and validity of this finding, it would be advisable to incorporate at least one more syngeneic mouse HCC tumor model or even an orthotopic mouse tumor model. The inclusion of additional models would bolster the significance and reliability of the observed results, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. In the H22 mouse tumor model, we conducted relevant assessments of survival rate and tumor growth. The results confirm that the combination of nifuroxazide and radiation therapy exhibits a promising synergistic antitumor effect. However, to achieve the goal of applying nifuroxazide combined with radiation therapy for the treatment of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma, we still need to undertake extensive research, including validation on genetically identical mouse HCC tumor models. We have also included relevant discussions in our ongoing discussions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 5, employing an alternative method, such as the flow cytometry assay, to analyze and corroborate the tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiling following various treatments would enhance the rigor of the study. This additional approach would provide a complementary perspective and validate the findings, strengthening the overall reliability and impact of the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your insightful suggestion. We have included additional experimental data to strengthen our study (supplementary Fig 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In Figure 7, the conclusion drawn regarding nifuroxazide's impact on PD-L1 expression through ubiquitination-proteasome mechanisms seems to lack the robust evidence needed to firmly establish nifuroxazide's role in regulating PD-L1 ubiquitination. To reinforce this aspect of the study, the authors may conduct comprehensive in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays. Performing these assays would offer direct insights into whether nifuroxazide genuinely influences PD-L1 ubiquitination, thus fortifying the credibility and importance of the reported findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable feedback. Our initial findings suggest that nifuroxazide inhibits the expression of PD-L1 protein levels, but does not affect the mRNA levels. Moreover, upon treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the inhibitory effect of nifuroxazide on PD-L1 was found to be abolished. Concurrently, we observed that nifuroxazide significantly enhances GSK-3β expression in both cell and animal experiments. Consequently, we propose that nifuroxazide augments the degradation of PD-L1 protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Statistical methods should be included in the captions of all the figures with statistical graphs. The size of the scale should be supplemented with a description in the captions.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your valuable suggestion. We have made the appropriate modifications to our study based on your recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Considering the outcomes presented in the study, it appears that the title &quot;Nifuroxazide enhances radiotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma by upregulating PD-L1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway&quot; may not accurately reflect the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your insightful feedback.
