Here, we describe how oxygen tensions sensed by mouse and human T cells at the moment of activation act to persistently modulate both differentiation and function. We found that in a protocol of CAR-T cell generation, 24 hr of low oxygen levels during initial CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell priming is sufficient to enhance antitumour cytotoxicity in a preclinical model. This is the case even when CAR-T cells are subsequently cultured under high oxygen tensions prior to adoptive transfer. Increased hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) expression was able to alter T cell fate in a similar manner to exposure to low oxygen tensions; however, only a controlled or temporary increase in HIF signalling was able to consistently improve cytotoxic function of T cells. These data show that oxygenation levels during and immediately after T cell activation play an essential role in regulating T cell function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>lymphocyte subsets</kwd><kwd>cytotoxic T cells</kwd><kwd>CAR-T cell therapy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>214283/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-01485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN2018/808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR2020-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/115612/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunha</surname><given-names>Pedro P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>Brennan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

For example, tumour hypoxia recruits immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, which can inhibit CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Facciabene et al., 2011</xref>). Hypoxia is also known to decrease expression of MHC class I molecules in tumour cells themselves, which in turn hampers T cell priming and cytotoxic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sethumadhavan et al., 2017</xref>). Tumour hypoxia can also have direct inhibitory effects on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by increasing the expression of checkpoint inhibitor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannoud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Noman et al., 2015</xref>) and cause mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharping et al., 2021</xref>). However, T cells infiltrate a wide variety of tissues throughout their progression to maturation and final differentiation; they therefore need to function within a wide range of oxygen partial pressures, including oxygenation levels that border on anoxia in some lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, oxygen-sensing mechanisms in T cells must be finely tuned for proper functioning in various tissue microenvironments.</p><p>In both preclinical studies and clinical manufacturing, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are typically cultured at atmospheric sea-level O<sub>2</sub> conditions (approximately 20.5%); however, reports have shown that physiologically relevant oxygen tensions (corresponding to 1–5% O<sub>2</sub>) can profoundly shift T cell differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atkuri et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gropper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larbi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loeffler et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naldini et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ross et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veliça et al., 2021</xref>). Lower oxygen levels alter CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector differentiation in a process that requires hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), the key transcriptional regulators of cellular responses to low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Culturing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells ex vivo at 1% O<sub>2</sub> has been found to dramatically reduce T cell proliferation, but increase antitumour activity, upon transfer into tumour-bearing mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gropper et al., 2017</xref>). Reduced oxygenation and increased HIF-α levels can thus both impair and enhance CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell cytotoxicity. We hypothesised that this might be related to the timing of hypoxic stress during T cell activation and differentiation.</p><p>In this study, by combining the use of low oxygen conditioning with pharmacological inhibition of negative HIF regulators, we show that hypoxia has an unexpected role at the point of activation and for a short period thereafter. The effects of short hypoxic conditioning are highly persistent, eliciting both ex vivo and in vivo increases in effector T cell differentiation and antitumour efficacy, and demonstrate the critical role oxygen plays in the earliest stages of T cell activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypoxia and increased HIF signalling drive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector differentiation</title><p>To assess the effect of different oxygen tensions in T cells, we first isolated polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from C57BL/6J mice that were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 dynabeads for 3 d in ambient oxygen (21%) and 5 or 1% O<sub>2</sub>. Low oxygen levels increased effector differentiation of T cells, upregulating molecules such as the IL-2 receptor alpha subunit CD25, the transcription factors EOMES, T-bet, and TOX, and the effector proteins granzyme B (GZMB) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). T cells cultured at 1% O<sub>2</sub> have increased expression of inhibitory receptors and impaired clonal expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The HIF transcription factors are one of the primary mechanisms by which T cells respond to hypoxia and are critical to T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>). Contrary to many cell types, an increase in HIF-1α mRNA and protein levels can occur in T cells even at high oxygen levels, following stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lukashev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). We first wished to determine whether the kinetics of HIF-1α stabilisation in ex vivo activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is dependant on surrounding oxygen tensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In all oxygen tensions tested, HIF-1α protein expression increased after T cell activation and peaked within 12 hr. Exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub> resulted in the greatest accumulation of HIF-1α during the 3 d of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). HIF-2α protein was also increased in T cells following activation, but was mostly found in the cytoplasmic protein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), as previously seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2003</xref>). This is consistent with data showing that deletion of HIF-1α, but not HIF-2α, abrogates hypoxia-driven increases in GZMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and other activation markers, and impairs antitumour T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypoxia and inhibition of negative hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signalling in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell effector differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat map illustrating expression of markers of differentiation as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) determined by flow cytometry 72 hr after activation of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in 21, 5, or 1% O<sub>2</sub>.

To determine whether increased HIF signalling can improve T cell function in vivo in CAR therapies and in human T cells, we employed a model of CAR-T cell therapy. We compared the effects of pharmacological inhibition of HIF degradation using FG-4592 ex vivo to the constitutive downregulation of HIF degradation using a vector construct to silence the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

A similar trend was found when we carried out exposures to 5% O<sub>2</sub> conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). On the other hand, incubation in low oxygen conditions (1 or 5% O<sub>2</sub>) during the last 3 d of culture had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>), despite leading to the highest levels of HIF-1α on day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Conditioning of T cells in 1% O<sub>2</sub> for the first 24 hr of activation (1% 1 d) increased both day 7 proportions of CD45RO<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>-</sup> cells and the expression of the effector molecule perforin, and did this regardless of how many times cell culture media was changed during the ambient oxygen expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>In fact, a single day of 1% O<sub>2</sub> conditioning, occurring at the time of activation, followed by 6 d of 21% O<sub>2</sub> culture, was sufficient to elicit a classical hypoxia/HIF-driven metabolic adaptation in T cells as characterised by an increased baseline glycolytic rate and glycolytic reserve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papandreou et al., 2006</xref>). This short-term exposure to hypoxia at the time of activation also led to increased baseline oxygen consumption rates, increased spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Non-glycolytic acidification, non-mitochondrial respiration, and proton leak were not impacted by low oxygen conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I and J</xref>).

Analysis of metabolites feeding the TCA cycle showed that 1% 1 d-treated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells accumulate acylcarnitines (namely, laurylcarninite, oleoylcarnitine, palmitoylcarninite, and mysteroylcarnitine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Acylcarnitines are intermediates in fatty acid metabolism that are involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCoin et al., 2015</xref>). Their accumulation suggests that the increased oxygen consumption rates displayed by hypoxia-conditioned T cells may result from an increased contribution of these lipids to oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously established that hypoxia rapidly modulates histone methylation and chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>). In line with this, our study reveals that even after 6 d of conditioning in ambient oxygen levels, exposure to 1% O<sub>2</sub> during T cell activation for a single day led to altered levels of specific post-translational histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).</p><p>The broad reduction in histone methylation could result from decreased methionine levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

While SAM levels were under the detection limit, analysis of metabolites involved in the methionine cycle showed that 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA) is reduced by short, low oxygen conditioning of T cells during activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). MTA participates in the methionine salvage pathway, and a reduction in its levels could explain the drop in methionine levels found in 1%1day CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

Moreover, 1% O<sub>2</sub> culture and PHD inhibition both decreased mTOR activation, as assessed by the reduction in phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448) and its target S6 Ribosomal Protein (Ser235/236) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). mTOR signalling is important for the growth and survival of activated T cells, and is also involved in the metabolic rewiring of T cells by driving the expression of c-Myc and HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

In fact, we observed that the increase in IL-2 production following 24 hr of T cell activation in hypoxia was accompanied by an increase in STAT5 phosphorylation (Y694) and in the expression of IL-2 receptor subunit CD25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). STAT5 is a positive regulator of IL-2 signalling previously shown to be induced by hypoxia in non-immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Joung et al., 2003</xref>), whereas CD25 is one of the most consistently upregulated targets in T cells cultured under low oxygen tensions or following increased HIF signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>). CD25 upregulation by hypoxia in T cells has also been shown by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caldwell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ross et al., 2021</xref>) In contrast with pSTAT5 and CD25, expression of Blimp-1 was decreased in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells following 24 hr of activation in 1% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). This could underpin the observed increase in IL-2 production and PGC-1α expression in T cells activated in low oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>) given that Blimp-1 is a transcriptional repressor of IL-2 signalling and PGC-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scharping et al., 2021</xref>).

Accordingly, while we found that continuous T cell culture in low oxygen drives Blimp-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), the observed reduced expression following 24 hr of T cell activation in 1% O<sub>2</sub> might result from the concomitant decreased nuclear translocation of NFAT1 and NFkB.</p><p>Another aspect of T cell activation that has been linked with hypoxia is calcium signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neumann et al., 2005</xref>). We performed single-cell fluorescent microscopy using the ratiometric calcium dye Fura-2AM, and OT-I cells reactivated with cognate antigen SIINFEKL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Differentiation of OT-I cells in response to short 1% O<sub>2</sub> exposure during activation was similar to that of human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Activation of SOCE and the concomitant rise in cytosolic calcium is a key event in TCR signalling, leading to activation of calcineurin and translocation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Serfling et al., 1995</xref>); indeed, we do see an accompanying increase in NFAT1 nuclear translocation in hypoxia-conditioned group at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>These findings suggest that low oxygen levels at the time of activation specifically shape T cell differentiation.

These findings, which are summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, indicate that oxygen tensions during activation can act to permanently shift T cell function and that the hypoxic response can be harnessed to improve T cell-based immunotherapeutic strategies.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of manuscript findings.</title><p>Ex vivo culture of T cells in low oxygen continuously impairs T cell growth, increases expression of checkpoint receptor PD-1 and increased expression of IL-2 signalling repressor Blimp1.

These effects elicited by low oxygen condition include HIF-dependent and HIF-independent mechanisms such as altered NFAT and PGC-1α expression, respectively. T cells conditioned in low oxygen after early activation (day 3 onwards) are functionally similar to cells continuously grown in 21%.

Our data indicate that transitory hypoxia during antigen recognition can differentially prime T cells and give rise to enhanced antitumour activity.</p><p>In T cells, cognate antigen stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) triggers an acute HIF-1α upregulation (even at the high oxygen tensions present in tissue culture), which drives a transcriptional program that supports both effector differentiation and aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>). In CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, HIF-1β and HIF-1α (but not HIF-2 α) deletion resulted in incomplete effector differentiation and reduced expression of glycolytic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doedens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liikanen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veliça et al., 2021</xref>). Deletion of various negative HIF regulators, the HIF inhibitor (FIH/HIF1AN) or the von Hippel–Lindau disease tumour suppressor (VHL) protein, or the prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHD), or overexpression of modified, negative regulator-insensitive HIF-ɑ proteins, exacerbates the terminal effector program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clever et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doedens et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finlay et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liikanen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veliça et al., 2021</xref>). In adoptive cell transfer experiments, there are clearly complexities found in the role of HIF in overall T cell function: HIF-1α deletion and overexpression of VHL- and FIH-insensitive HIF-ɑ impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell antitumour function, while VHL deletion and overexpression of VHL-insensitive and FIH-sensitive HIF-2α improved CD8<sup>+</sup> T cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liikanen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Veliça et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activation mediated an increase in HIF signalling that we found to be amplified by lower oxygen tensions. Ex vivo low oxygen conditioning of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells caused an increase in the production of effector molecules and cytotoxic function, but also severely impaired cell proliferation and increased cell death. This coupling of increased HIF-1α, increased cytotoxic function, and decreased cell growth is a finding which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gropper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ross et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Having previously shown that HIF-α deletion impairs CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palazon et al., 2017</xref>), here we describe that HIF-1α accumulation, achieved through pharmacological PHD inhibition via FG-4592 or silencing of VHL, can boost antitumour CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function. Pharmacological inhibition of PHDs ex vivo has been shown to improve function in DMOG-treated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clever et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show that similar to conditioning CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to low oxygen tensions before ACT, a transient boost in HIF signalling through ex vivo treatment with the PHD inhibitor FG-4592 improved the expansion and cytotoxicity of adoptively transferred tumour-specific mouse and human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. This argues that oxygen tensions and/or HIF levels during T cell priming can have long-lasting functional effects on CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells.</p><p>Perhaps most surprisingly, we show that while long periods of low oxygen conditioning strongly reduced T cell expansion, the observed oxygen-dependent increases in effector function occurred regardless of whether the cells were cultured for short (1 d) or long periods of hypoxia (7 d) as long as the hypoxic exposure was coincident with activation. This is best illustrated by the fact that a single day of low oxygen conditioning during T cell activation, followed by expansion in higher oxygen tensions, was sufficient to alter T cell differentiation and metabolism, and to improve T cell infiltration of tumours and immunotherapeutic efficacy following adoptive T cell transfer. A recent study suggests standard cell culture conditions can lead to local hypoxia through a combination of cellular respiration and poor oxygen diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Following 24 hr of 1% O<sub>2</sub> stimulation and 6 d of ambient oxygen T cell culture, we did not find considerable HIF-1α accumulation, and increasing media changes did not impact T cell differentiation. This suggests these cells under our conditions do not experience local hypoxia during ambient oxygen expansion, and that the only low oxygen experienced in our conditions occurs during T cell activation.</p><p>Although low oxygen conditioning, FG-4592 treatment, and VHL silencing enhanced T cell function and/or expansion in vivo, the distinct modes of inducing HIF signalling resulted in discrepancies in T cell differentiation. These can arise from additional prolyl hydroxylases apart from PHDs that can be inhibited by FG-4592 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maxwell and Eckardt, 2016</xref>) and by the fact that VHL silencing is only induced by transduction of shVHL vectors 24 hr after T cell activation, thus missing the early T cell activation phase we feel are crucial for hypoxia-related improved T cell function. Additionally, shVHL vectors elicited a modest 25% reduction in VHL expression which, despite being sufficient to stabilise HIF-1α, could explain some of the discrepancies. Perhaps more importantly, hypoxic responses can be orchestrated by HIF, but also include HIF-independent inductions of other transcription factors such as PGC-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arany et al., 2008</xref>) which have immunomodulatory roles. PGC-1α can be activated by the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which acts as a cellular energy sensor activated under conditions of metabolic stress, such as that caused by hypoxia, and can induce PGC-1α expression to promote mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zong et al., 2002</xref>). We have also found differences in survival of tumour-bearing animals receiving mouse and human T cells, and conditioned with low oxygen or FG treatment. These differences might be attributed to the duration of hypoxia and FG treatments, and to the different tumour models used. Despite these differences, we demonstrated that when compared to 21% O<sub>2</sub> cultured control cells, mouse and human CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells cultured in 1% O<sub>2</sub> during T cell activation respectively display reduced B16-OVA tumour burdens, and extend survival of SKOV3 tumour-bearing animals.</p><p>24 hr of TCR stimulation and co-stimulation in 1% O<sub>2</sub> profoundly altered T cell activation. This short period of hypoxia at the time of activation reduced nuclear levels of NFAT1, NFkB, and c-Myc; decreased mTOR signalling; increased expression of HIF-1α, GLUT1, LDHA, NFIL3, and PGC-1α; and upregulated IL-2 signalling by increasing IL-2 production, CD25 expression, and STAT5 phosphorylation while reducing Blimp1 protein levels. After 6 d of ambient oxygen culture, T cells that had been conditioned to low oxygen for the first 24 hr of activation showed increased mitochondria biomass, enhanced basal and maximal glycolytic and respiratory rates, increased levels of lipid metabolism intermediates and heightened SOCE following TCR restimulation. The underlying mechanisms for these changes may be attributed to the substantial alterations in the epigenetic histone signature elicited by brief hypoxic conditioning during T cell activation. While hypoxia-induced epigenetic modifications have been observed in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Batie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>), their relevance to T cell functions remains incompletely understood. The present findings provide evidence for a previously unrecognised role for oxygen in the process of T cell activation and in the sustained modification of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. Further investigation is clearly required to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which hypoxia regulates T cell function.</p><p>The microenvironment, and the amount of available oxygen, at the time of antigen recognition thus has a highly persistent and determinative effect on T cell function, and this likely represents a novel and important aspect of T cell programming that requires further study. Many of these changes are HIF-driven, but some may well be related to other immunometabolic determinants present in the microenvironment of antigen recognition and activation. The potential for utilising these findings for short and easily achievable alterations in how therapeutic T cells are cultured presents an important new opportunity for improving efficacy in immunotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human material</title><p>Human blood samples from healthy male or female donors were obtained with written informed consent from the Cambridge Bioscience National Health Service Blood and Transplant at Addenbrooke’s Hospital (Cambridge, UK) or from Karolinska University Hospital (Stockholm, Sweden); in both cases, informed consent and consent to publish forms part of the donation protocol.

Histones were extracted with Histone Extraction Kit (ab113476, Abcam). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were obtained with the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (78833, Thermo Fisher). The Revert 700 Total Protein Stain (LI-COR) was used for analysis of total protein stain. Proteins (15–30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes before being probed with primary antibodies at a 1:1000 dilution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Following the manufacturer’s instructions, protein signal was detected using infrared-labelled secondary antibodies in an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR) or using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (R&amp;D Systems) and ECL Prime (GE Healthcare) (imaged with an iBrightCL1000 (Thermo Fisher)).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vitro cytotoxicity assay</title><p>10,000 B16F10-OVA or SKOV3 cells were seeded per well in 96-well plates (flat bottom, Costar) and co-cultured for a minimum of 14 hr with varying ratios of mouse CD8<sup>+</sup> OT-I or human CD8<sup>+</sup>RQR8<sup>+</sup> HER2-CAR-T cells, respectively. Wells were washed twice with PBS to remove T cells, and the number of remaining target cells was determined by culturing with 10 µg/mL resazurin (Sigma) for 2 hr and measuring fluorescence signal in a plate reader. Cytotoxicity was calculated relative to wells with no T cells added (positive control) and to wells with no cancer cells added (negative control). 10,000 Raji cells were co-cultured with varying ratios of CD8<sup>+</sup>RQR8<sup>+</sup> CD19-CAR-T cells for a minimum of 14 hr, and cytotoxicity was assessed by flow cytometry. The ratio of Raji cells to CountBright Absolute counting beads (Thermo Fisher) was used to calculate cytotoxicity.

RQR8, used as the transduction marker, is a chimeric surface protein composed with domains from CD34 (for detection and purification with clone QBEND/10), CD8 (for anchoring at the cell surface), and CD20 (for depletion in vivo with anti-CD20 mAb rituximab) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Philip et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The generation of vectors coexpressing CAR molecules and an shRNA was possible due to the use of a microRNA scaffold. For expression of shRNAs, the commonly used RNA polymerase III promoters (e.g., U6), which can drive expression of small RNAs, often result in abundant production of small RNAs with heterogeneous 5′ ends; these can cause a deleterious increase of off-target effects. High levels of small RNA molecules can also become toxic to cells by saturating factors required for generating endogenous non-coding RNAs. To avoid these issues, shRNA-hairpins can be flanked with an optimised sequence of miR-30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fellmann et al., 2013</xref>) and can be expressed under the control of an RNA II polymerase promoter (e.g., EF1α). This promoter enables the coexpression of protein and shRNA, which are processed like endogenous miRNAs. MicroRNA-embedded shRNAs were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bofill-De Ros and Gu, 2016</xref>). Briefly, 97-mer oligonucleotides (IDT Ultramers) coding for the respective shRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moffat et al., 2006</xref>) were PCR amplified using 10 µmol/mL of the primers miRE-XhoI-fw (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">TGAACTCGAGAAGGTATATTG</named-content> <named-content content-type="sequence">CTGTTGACAGTGAGCG</named-content>-3′) and miRE-EcoRI-rev (5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">TCTCGAATTCTAGCCCCTTGAAGT</named-content> <named-content content-type="sequence">CCGAGGCAGTAGGC</named-content>-3′), 0.5 ng oligonucleotide template, and the Q5 High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB), and cloned HER2 CAR vectors containing the miRE scaffold sequence.

Before extraction, all samples were added with 10 µL of the internal standard solution, consisting of 200 µg/mL d4-succinic acid. Metabolites were subsequently extracted by addition of 1000 μL ice-cold LC-MS grade methanol to the cell pellets, followed by 30 min sonication. Sonication was carried out by adding ice to the ultrasound bath to maintain the temperature below 20°C. Following sonication, samples were centrifuged (12,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 20 min, 6°C) and 200 µL of the supernatant were transferred to LC-MS vials for the subsequent analysis. A targeted selected reaction monitoring (SRM) LC-MS/MS-based platform was used for metabolite relative quantification. Targeted analyses were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system coupled to a Xevo-TQ-S mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA). An Acquity Premier BEH Amide Vanguard FIT column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 μm), equipped with an integrated guard column, was used for the separation, with aqueous mobile phase consisting of 20 mmol/mL ammonium formate + 0.1% formic acid in double-deionised water and organic mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Column oven was set at 30<sup>o</sup>C, the injection volume was set to 2 µL, and the gradient was carried out at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Oxygen levels at the time of activation determine T cell persistence and immunotherapeutic efficacy&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by me as the Reviewing Editor and W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Martin Böttcher (Reviewer #1); Helga Simon-Molas (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have extensively studied your manuscript and all agree, that the topic you address is important to the field, that the findings might have broad implications, and the methods and data analysis are solid. You can find the detailed comments below, but all three reviewers independently addressed the discrepancies in the effects of genetic vs pharmacological modulation of HIF signalling (also in the murine vs human system) on T cell cytotoxicity and (anti-tumor) function. The current theoretical explanations of these discrepancies seem to be insufficient and will require additional experimental revisions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Congratulations on this nice manuscript with important data to improve current therapeutic possibilities.</p><p>Although the data presented is in its entirety convincing there are some minor points I would like to be addressed:</p><p>1) Figure 4: It is important to clearly highlight/point out the time of analysis of the different shown panels. In its current form, it remains somewhat confusing and might lead to false conclusions by the reader.</p><p>2) Figure 4D/E: It seems that there occurred a problem with the Oligomycin used. While ECAR should increase (or at least remain stable) after Oligomycin treatment as compensation for lack of ATP by OxPhos, OCR after Oligomycin treatment should be reduced since the ATPase is inhibited and oxygen is not consumed anymore as the mitochondrial membrane potential/proton gradient is not released. Please carefully review the raw data and the used protocol for the Seahorse analysis and explain this logical error. Also, please provide a section of this analysis in Materials and methods.</p><p>3) Figure 4J: I would recommend showing also phospho-mTOR itself and not only a downstream protein.</p><p>4) Figure 5 B/C: Why were there different ways of depiction chosen? I would harmonize the data for both types of CART-cells, i.e. EC50 and IFN-γ, and also the depiction.</p><p>5) Figure 5E: The frequency of CART-cells seems rather low. Is there a logical explanation for this?</p><p>6) Figure 5D-E: It is very unfortunate that only the HER2-CART-cells were chosen in an in vivo model although also the CD19-CART-cells show better cytotoxicity/IFN-γ secretion after the pre-conditioning. If possible, a repetition using e.g. a lymphoma model would be favorable. However, I would also appreciate a discussion in case these additional experiments are not possible in the time frame of the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While the data provided is consistent and analyzed in a high level of detail, some questions emerge from the data presented that could be further discussed. This is mostly related to the differences between the effects of low oxygen conditions and FG-4592 in vitro for T cell expansion (Figure 1) and for tumour volume and animal survival (Figure 2). Besides, CARs treated with FG or shVHL also have different outcomes in terms of cytotoxicity (Figure 3). Could the authors discuss this better?</p><p>Other important aspects to address:</p><p>– Figure 3D, E: the effects of FG and shVHL in cytotoxicity assays were performed at 1% oxygen. Is this because at 21% O2 there´s no HIF1a present and therefore the treatments have no effect? Did the authors perform the same experiments at 21% O2 pressure? In that case, it would be informative to include the data in the supplementary.</p><p>– Figure 4 D and E: D shows ECAR data and shows OCR data for a different Seahorse test. As it´s expected to be available from the assays, the corresponding data for OCR (D) and ECAR (E) should be shown in Supplementary. This would help understand better the effects of Oligomycin in these cells, which seem to not increase ECAR as would be expected, and also the effects of 2-DG on OCR, to see if the main source of TCA fuelling in these cells is glucose. Can the authors include these data?</p><p>– Similar to the assessment of memory effector cells in Figure 5F, did the authors explore that in ex vivo experiments? What´s the phenotype of T cells treated under low oxygen conditions during T cell stimulation, after the activation peak? Are there also more memory effector cells?</p><p>– The authors monitor the % of CAR-T cells in blood. Did they measure the % of TILs inside the subcutaneous tumor mass?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I see the importance and novelty of this work but due to the listed weaknesses in the public review, I would recommend the authors assess the O2 concentration experienced by T cells during their culturing protocols. Alternatively (or in addition), using the strategy of the above-cited study, lower cell medium volumes to improve O2 diffusion could be evaluated. Despite the fact that T cells are suspension cells they will descend to the bottom of the well and so could experience local hypoxia. More comprehensive metabolic characterisation comparing CAR-T cells following short hypoxic conditioning compared to no conditioning would add value. Discussion of potential HIF-independent mechanisms should also be discussed but important to assess them in follow-up work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84280.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Congratulations on this nice manuscript with important data to improve current therapeutic possibilities.</p><p>Although the data presented is in its entirety convincing there are some minor points I would like to be addressed:</p><p>1) Figure 4: It is important to clearly highlight/point out the time of analysis of the different shown panels.

Upon repeating the assay with 12 human donors and a new stock of oligomycin, we could confirm inhibition of ATP synthase does increases ECAR and reduce OCR in human CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells expanded for 7 days (Figure 4D-E and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1I-J).

As expected by the decreased phosphorylation of S6, we were able to confirm that activation 1% O2 also decreases mTOR phosphorylation (Figure 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5 B/C: Why were there different ways of depiction chosen?

Is there a logical explanation for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Transduction efficiency for CAR experiments was 10% on average (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1B) which explains that the majority of the CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in circulation are RQR8-. However, the transduction efficiency was similar between 21% controls and 1% 1day cells; following ACT and IL-2 administration in vivo, it is still clear that 1% 1day treated HER-2 CAR-T cells expanded to a greater extent in the blood (Figure 6E); and displayed an increase in effector memory cells (Figure 6F) when compared to 21% control treated HER-2 CAR-T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5D-E: It is very unfortunate that only the HER2-CART-cells were chosen in an in vivo model although also the CD19-CART-cells show better cytotoxicity/IFN-γ secretion after the pre-conditioning.

However, I would also appreciate a discussion in case these additional experiments are not possible in the time frame of the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst we show that the low oxygen conditioning protocol improves the function of different CAR-T cells (CD19- and HER-2 CAR-T cells) in vitro, we selected the latter for adoptive cell transfer experiments, as the target cells (SKOV3) for that CAR-T allow for the use of a preclinical solid tumour model; we felt such a model might be more relevant, given the greater difficulties inherent to targeting solid tumours with immunotherapy. Additionally, CD19 CAR-T cell therapy is currently established in the clinic against B cell malignancies, whereas we feel that improving the success of CAR-T cells targeted to solid tumours more strongly warrants innovative approaches and analysis. However, we have no reason to feel that the improvements shown here would not also be seen in lymphoma models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>While the data provided is consistent and analyzed in a high level of detail, some questions emerge from the data presented that could be further discussed.

Besides, CARs treated with FG or shVHL also have different outcomes in terms of cytotoxicity (Figure 3). Could the authors discuss this better?</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst VHL silencing alterations to T cell function closely resemble those obtained with low oxygen conditioning (i.e., increased expression of effector molecules, and enhanced antitumour function in vitro and in vivo (Figure 3)), the same cannot be said for FG-4592 treatment. The in vitro effects of FG-4592 suggest this inhibitor might be immunosuppressive (since it reduces cell expansion (Figure 1F)) and may hinder CAR-T cell cytotoxicity (Figure 3D). However, FG-treated cells revealed enhanced adoptive cell transfer functions in vivo, indicating that the net long term effects of FG-4592 might potentiate T cell function. Relative to control T cells, FG-treated OT-I cells reduced tumour burdens and extended animal survival, and FG-treated CAR-T cells showed enhanced expansion in the blood following ACT and delayed tumour growth in 50% of the animals compared to 9% of the animals in the control T cell group. Nevertheless, finding different effects from VHL silencing vs FG-4592 reflects the complexity of the HIF pathway and its regulation. These points are now added to the 5<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other important aspects to address:</p><p>– Figure 3D, E: the effects of FG and shVHL in cytotoxicity assays were performed at 1% oxygen.

As shown in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1E, the cytotoxicity of low oxygen conditioned and FG-treated T cells was similar, regardless of the oxygen tension at which the co-culture cytotoxicity assay was performed. We now show cytotoxicity assays for FG-treated and VHL silenced CAR-T cells in 21%O<sub>2</sub> (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figure 4 D and E: D shows ECAR data and shows OCR data for a different Seahorse test. As it´s expected to be available from the assays, the corresponding data for OCR (D) and ECAR (E) should be shown in Supplementary. This would help understand better the effects of Oligomycin in these cells, which seem to not increase ECAR as would be expected, and also the effects of 2-DG on OCR, to see if the main source of TCA fuelling in these cells is glucose. Can the authors include these data?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided new data generated with additional human donor T cells and obtained an overall canonical cellular response to ATP synthase inhibition with oligomycin (increased ECAR and decreased OCR). We also now provide more detailed analyses of these live metabolic assays (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1I-J) and show that 2-DG does not significantly impact OCR. This could indicate that additional carbon sources such glutamine or lipids might be fuelling the TCA cycle when glucose levels drop. Mass spectrometry analyses performed for this revision showed that acylcarnitines accumulate in 1% 1day cells (Figure 5G), which could indicate fatty acid oxidation might preferentially fuel the OCR. In future work we will perform Flex test assays to better understand the substrate dependency of low oxygen conditioned human T cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Similar to the assessment of memory effector cells in Figure 5F, did the authors explore that in ex vivo experiments? What´s the phenotype of T cells treated under low oxygen conditions during T cell stimulation, after the activation peak? Are there also more memory effector cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have confirmed low oxygen conditioning drives effector memory differentiation in a 7-day expansion protocol (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors monitor the % of CAR-T cells in blood. Did they measure the % of TILs inside the subcutaneous tumor mass?</p></disp-quote><p>Given that the HER-2 CAR-T Act tumour model takes approximately 3 months to set up, and thus did not fit in the time frame of these revisions, we carried out an alternative analysis of the percentage of TILs found inside subcutaneous tumour masses, using the OT-I and B16-OVA model system. For this, we first confirmed that OT-I cells expanded for 7 days ex vivo phenotypically and functionally resemble human CAR-T cells when conditioned to low oxygen tensions (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1L). Longer exposure to 1%O<sub>2</sub> drives stronger effector differentiation but also hinders antitumor T cell function. Following transfer of ACTs into tumour bearing hosts, we found a striking increase of OT-I infiltration in the 1% 1day group relative to the 21% controls: this indicates that low oxygen conditioning ex vivo can improve antitumour function in vivo, and correlates with an increased level of T cell infiltration and increased T cell expansion (Figure 6 I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I see the importance and novelty of this work but due to the listed weaknesses in the public review, I would recommend the authors assess the O2 concentration experienced by T cells during their culturing protocols. Alternatively (or in addition), using the strategy of the above-cited study, lower cell medium volumes to improve O2 diffusion could be evaluated. Despite the fact that T cells are suspension cells they will descend to the bottom of the well and so could experience local hypoxia. More comprehensive metabolic characterisation comparing CAR-T cells following short hypoxic conditioning compared to no conditioning would add value. Discussion of potential HIF-independent mechanisms should also be discussed but important to assess them in follow-up work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added discussion of this issue to the 4<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section. We also provide a more detailed metabolic analysis of low oxygen stimulated T cells with a mass spectrometry analysis of carbon sources utilized by T cells (Figure 4G and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1L). We found that 1% 1day T cells accumulate acylcarnitines, which could explain the observed increase in basal and maximum oxygen consumption rates resulting from short hypoxia stimulation during T cell activation (Figure 4E). Additionally, we now discuss additional HIF-independent mechanisms driven by hypoxic responses in the 5<sup>th</sup> paragraph of the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
