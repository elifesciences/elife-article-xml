Clinically, metformin is used to treat PCOS, but it is unclear whether metformin exerts its therapeutic effect by regulating B cells. Here, we showed that the expression level of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peripheral blood B cells from PCOS patients was increased. Metformin used in vitro and in vivo was able to reduce the production of TNF-α in B cells from PCOS patients. Administration of metformin improved mouse PCOS phenotypes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and also inhibited TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. Furthermore, metformin induced metabolic reprogramming of B cells in PCOS patients, including the alteration in mitochondrial morphology, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and glucose uptake. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells. Moreover, the inhibition of TNF-α expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were associated with decreased mTOR phosphorylation. Together, TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, thereby inhibiting TNF-α expression in B cells, which may be a new mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>polycystic ovary syndrome</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>B lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>metabolic reprogramming</kwd><kwd>mechanistic target of rapamycin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Lamei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002858</institution-id><institution>China Postdoctoral Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020M672494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021JJ40184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Na</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pathological TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathological process of polycystic ovary syndrome, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation, affects metabolic reprogramming, and further inhibits TNF-α expression in pathological B cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine-reproductive-metabolic disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, polycystic ovaries, and chronic oligo-/anovulation, which can lead to infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rotterdam ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS consensus workshop group, 2004</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicates that PCOS occurs under chronic inflammation, leading to ovarian dysfunction and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Such inflammation is characterized by elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-α], interleukin-6 [IL-6], interferon-γ [IFN-γ]) in the serum, follicular fluid, and ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xiong et al., 2011</xref>). Published results have reported that CD3<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells of follicular fluid produce high levels of IFN-γ and IL-2 in women with PCOS and splenic macrophages release more TNF-α in rats with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Figueroa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). In chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pathologic cytokine-producing B cells have been verified to play important roles in these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkatkar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jagannathan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2015</xref>). In a mouse model of SLE, IL-6 production by B cells drives autoimmune germinal center formation and accelerates disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkatkar et al., 2017</xref>). B cells expressing IFN-γ inhibit Treg cell differentiation and exacerbate autoimmune experimental arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olalekan et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that the peripheral proportion and activity of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells were increased in women with PCOS and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced morphological changes to mouse ovaries were prevented by CD19<sup>+</sup> B cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), demonstrating that CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of PCOS. However, the pathogenic role of B cells in PCOS remains unclear and little is currently known about the inflammatory cytokines expression by B cells from PCOS.</p><p>Metformin is a widely used oral medication to treat type 2 diabetes (T2D) and also involved in other pharmacological actions, including antitumor effect, antiaging effect, and neuroprotective effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai and Chen, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>). Published results have suggested that metformin not only reduces chronic inflammation through reducing hyperglycemia and increasing insulin sensitivity, but it also has direct anti-inflammatory effects. For example, it has been shown that metformin reduces Th17 cytokine production in older subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>), decreases the proinflammatory late/exhausted memory B cell subset, and B cell TNF-α mRNA expression in obesity and T2D patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diaz et al., 2017</xref>). The effects of metformin are thought to be mediated primarily through regulation of the activity of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which are major regulators of metabolic stress responses. Metformin suppresses systemic autoimmunity in Roquin<sup>san/san</sup> mice through inhibiting B cell differentiation via regulation of AMPK/mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Metformin inhibits the proliferation of rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast-like synoviocytes via inhibiting mTOR phosphorylation through PI3K/AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Meanwhile, metformin exerts inflammation-inhibitory effects by altering intracellular metabolic processes. Recent evidence has suggested that metformin alleviates the aging-associated Th17 inflammation by improving mitochondrial bioenergetics, and reducing oxidative stress via lowering ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bharath et al., 2020</xref>). At present, metformin is also widely used among women with PCOS and reduces insulin resistance, increases ovulation and improves clinical pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morley et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesize that pathological B cells may exist in PCOS patients, and metformin may alleviate PCOS symptoms by regulating the activity of pathological B cells.</p><p>Here, we showed for the first time that the increase of pathological B cells producing TNF-α was associated with PCOS. Peripheral blood (PB) B cells from women with PCOS produced higher levels of TNF-α, and the percentage of TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells in B cells was positively associated with serum AMH levels. However, the expression of TNF-α in B cells was reduced after oral administration of metformin in women with PCOS, and metformin had a similar inhibitory effect on TNF-α expression in B cells in vitro. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin improved PCOS phenotypes, accompanied with inhibition of TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. We further demonstrated that metformin induced mitochondrial remodeling, reduced glucose uptake in B cells from women with PCOS, and altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells from DHEA-induced PCOS mice. The inhibition of TNF-α expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were related to the decrease of mTOR phosphorylation. Together, these results identify a new mechanism that TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathological process of PCOS, and metformin may inhibit TNF-α expression of pathological B cells via mTOR-dependent metabolic reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TNF-α production by pathological B cells in women with PCOS</title><p>Inflammation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. To define PCOS-associated cytokine profiles, we first quantified the levels of serum inflammatory cytokines in 25 women with PCOS and 13 age-matched control subjects. Results showed that the level of TNF-α was higher in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our previous report demonstrated the proportion and activity of CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells were significantly increased in women with PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Xiao et al., 2019</xref>), thus we questioned whether the abnormal B cells are responsible for the increase of serum TNF-α in women with PCOS. The results showed that B cells isolated from PB of women with PCOS expressed higher amounts of TNF-α protein than those from the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We also quantified TNF-α expression in B cells after stimulation with B cell-targeted activator (CpG, CD40L plus anti-IgM/IgA/IgG) by flow cytometry and found that the percentage of TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells was notably higher in women with PCOS than that in control subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). More TNF-α was secreted into the culture supernatants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) is solely secreted by granulosa cells (GCs) of the pre-antral and small antral ovarian follicles, and could be an effective indicator for the diagnosis of PCOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Teede et al., 2019</xref>). We analyzed the relationship between the percentage of TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells in B cells and the level of serum AMH by Pearson’s correlation analysis, and the results showed that the percentage of TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells was positively associated with serum AMH levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further investigate the possible role of TNF-α in GCs, luteinized GCs from healthy individuals were isolated, and cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 10% FBS with or without TNF-α.

Augmented tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS activation in stimulated B cells suggests a coordinated change in mitochondrial dynamics and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Waters et al., 2018</xref>). To evaluate the effects of metformin on mitochondria morphology and functions of B cells from women with PCOS, we first examined mitochondrial morphology by transmission electron microscopy.

B cells play a role in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases by secreting proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Shen and Fillatreau, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we found that peripheral blood B cells from women with PCOS and B cells from DHEA-induced PCOS mice both produced higher levels of TNF-α, and the percentage of TNF-α<sup>+</sup> cells in human peripheral CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells was positively associated with the serum AMH levels.

In a mouse model of SLE, metformin suppresses systemic autoimmunity through inhibiting B cell differentiation into autoreactive plasma cells, as well as germinal center formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Metformin attenuates bleomycin-induced scleroderma by reducing splenic germinal center formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Our studies showed that metformin was able to reduce the expression of TNF-α in B cells from women with PCOS in vitro and in vivo. Administration of metformin improved DHEA-induced PCOS phenotypes and also inhibited TNF-α expression in splenic B cells. Thus, we speculate that the therapeutic effect of metformin on PCOS may be related to the inhibition of TNF-α production in pathological B cells.</p><p>Mitochondria is the main subcellular target of metformin, which inhibits mitochondrial respiratory chain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rena et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, metformin induced mitochondrial remodeling in B cells from women with PCOS. The destruction of mitochondrial inner membrane and the decrease of MMP and ROS production were related to the inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity by metformin. Reduced ROS levels -are associated with increased aerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beltran et al., 2020</xref>). Metformin has been reported to induce glycolysis in rat brain astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Westhaus et al., 2017</xref>). We also found that metformin increased glycolytic lactate production in splenic B cells from DHEA-induced PCOS mice. Simultaneously, metformin also increased TCA cycle intermediates accumulation in splenic B cells. In addition, we found that metformin reduced glucose uptake in pathological B cells from women with PCOS through inhibiting the expression of Glut 1 and Glut 4, and the upstream transcription factors HIF1α and c-Myc. These results were consistent with the effect of metformin on T cells. Metformin-treated antigen receptor activated T cells showed reduced glucose uptake compared to control antigen-activated cells, and metformin treatment blocked T cell antigen receptor-induced expression of c-Myc, HIF-1α, and Glut 1 in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zarrouk et al., 2014</xref>). We also found that OXPHOS inhibitor oligomycin A inhibited TNF-α production in B cells, indicating that intracellular metabolism affects the production of TNF-α in B cells. These findings suggest that metformin inhibits the production of TNF-α in pathological B cells, which is related to the regulation of metformin on B cell energy metabolism. mTOR activity plays a critical role in B cell function. Conditional deletion of the mTOR in B cells impairs germinal center differentiation and high-affinity antibody responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Suppressing mTOR activity by rapamycin markedly inhibits B cell activation and antibody secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sintes et al., 2017</xref>). Our results showed that the phosphorylation level of mTOR in CD19<sup>+</sup> B cells from women with PCOS was significantly higher compared with control subjects; and rapamycin markedly inhibited TNF-α expression in B cells from women with PCOS. These results suggest that mTOR phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of TNF-α expression in pathological B cells. The mTOR is the cellular target of metformin. Inhibition of B cell differentiation and germinal center formation in a mouse model of SLE by metformin is characterized by decreased mTOR phosphorylation in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Metformin exerts the inhibitory effects on human soluble B-cell activating factor-induced B-cell proliferation/viability through hampering the mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2021b</xref>). In our study, the mTOR phosphorylation in B cells was significantly reduced after oral administration of metformin in PCOS patients and mouse model. In in vitro experiments, metformin showed a similar inhibitory effect on mTOR phosphorylation in B cells. The inhibitory effect of metformin on mTOR phosphorylation may be contributed to its suppression on TNF-α expression in pathological B cells. In addition, the mTOR pathway regulates various aspects of metabolism including mitochondrial function and glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bjedov and Rallis, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>). Rapamycin reduces mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial oxygen consumption, and intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production in human mesenchymal stem cells during adipocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tormos et al., 2011</xref>). Rapamycin reduces glucose uptake and the expression of glycolytic enzymes in T cells during Treg polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2021a</xref>). Our results showed that rapamycin decreased the MMP, ROS levels, and glucose uptake in pathological B cells from women with PCOS. These data suggest that metformin induces metabolic reprogramming of pathological B cells through mTOR pathway. We will further investigate the regulation mechanism of metformin on mTOR signaling in TNF-α-producing pathological B cells.</p><p>In summary, we found that pathological TNF-α-producing B cells are involved in the pathological process of PCOS. Metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, and then inhibits TNF-α expression in pathological B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). These data presented here may provide new insights into the mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS and specific targeting TNF-α-producing B cells may be a potential therapy.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the effect of metformin on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-producing B cells in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).</title><p>In peripheral blood B cells from women with PCOS, metformin inhibits mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation; reduces glucose uptake by downregulation of Glut 1 and Glut 4 expression, and the upstream transcription factors HIF1α and c-Myc; alters the mitochondrial morphology; decreases the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ROS levels. In splenic B cells from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-induced PCOS mice, metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation; stimulates glycolytic lactate and TCA cycle intermediates accumulation. These alterations ultimately result in the decrease of TNF-α production by pathological B cells in PCOS.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74713-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the ethic review committee of Central South University (NO.2019-S111).

Briefly, female prepuberal (21-day-old) C57BL/6 mice received daily subcutaneous injections of DHEA (6 mg/100 g body weight, dissolved in 0.1 ml sesame oil [Acros]) for 21 days. After PCOS is established, PCOS mice were randomly divided into two groups. PCOS mice continued to be injected with DHEA and were treated with or without metformin in drinking water (200 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> per day) for another 8 days. The control group received corresponding daily injections of 0.1 ml sesame oil. Estrous cycle stages were determined by light microscope analysis of vaginal epithelial cell smears. After 29 days of treatments, all mice were anesthetized and killed, and their blood, spleens and ovaries were harvested. The spleens of mice were mechanically disrupted and filtered through 70 µm cell strainers to obtain single-cell suspensions.

Metformin can activate mTOR through AMPK signaling pathway and also PI3K signaling pathway. Several studies have shown that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I and thereby oxidative phosphorylation leading to an increased AMP:ATP ratio, causing a direct activation of AMPK. Activation of AMPK leads to further inhibition of mTOR (<italic>Kulkarni et al.</italic>, <italic>2020; Singh et al.</italic>, <italic>2021</italic>). Metformin induces the M2 macrophage polarization to accelerate the wound healing via regulating AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway (<italic>Qing et al.</italic>, <italic>2019</italic>). Furthermore, metformin exerts anti-aging effects by downregulating insulin /IGF1 signaling, leading to PI3K/mTOR inhibition independently of AMPK (<italic>Kulkarni et al., 2020</italic>).</p><p>Metformin also exerts anti-cancer properties by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (<italic>Singh et al.</italic>, <italic>2021</italic>).</p><p>b) Thanks for reviewer’s suggestion. In our study, metformin significantly increased the phosphorylation level of AMPK in pathological B cells from PCOS patients and mouse model. To further determine whether metformin inhibited TNF-α production in pathological B cells via regulating AMPK pathway, we studied the effect of dorsomorphin (compound C), an AMPK inhibitor, on TNF-α expression in pathological B cells in vitro. B cells isolated from peripheral blood of women with PCOS were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing B cell-targeted activator and metformin, with different concentrations of dorsomorphin (1μm, 2μm, 5μm) for 48hr. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, dorsomorphin did not reverse the inhibitory effect of metformin on TNF-α production in pathological B cells. These results suggest that metformin's effect on B cells is accompanied by changes in AMPK phosphorylation levels, but AMPK is not required for metformin to inhibit TNF-α production in pathological B cells in our experiments. Similar to our findings, metformin-treated antigen receptor activated T cells show reduced glucose uptake compared to control antigen-activated cells, and metformin treatment blocks T cell antigen receptor-induced expression of c-Myc, HIF-1α and Glut1 in T cells. However, these inhibitory effects of metformin on T cells are independent of AMPK expression in T cells (<italic>Zarrouk et al., 2014</italic>). Next, we will further investigate the regulation mechanism of metformin on mTOR signaling in TNF-α-producing pathological B cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin did not reverse the inhibitory effect of metformin on TNF-α production in pathological B cells from women with PCOS.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74713-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Did authors looked at the transcription factors induced by metformin at enhancer/promoter region in B cell, which id driving force for transactivating gene for higher production of TNF-α?</p></disp-quote><p>TNF-α is often described in the literature as one of the NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory cytokines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays revealed that metformin reversed the LPS-induced binding ability of NF-κB to both TNF-α and IL1β promoter in bovine mammary epithelial cells (<italic>Xu et al.</italic>, <italic>2021</italic>). In murine macrophages (RAW264.7 cells), ATF-3 binding to the promoters of TNF-α and IL-6 is enriched in the presence of metformin as compared with LPS alone, whereas LPS-induced NF-κB-binding to TNF-α and IL-6 promoter is reduced by metformin, suggesting that metformin-induced ATF-3 appears to suppress proinflammatory cytokine production via competition with NF-κB for binding to TNF-α and IL-6 promoters (Kim et al., 2014). These results suggest that NF-κB inactivation is associated with the inhibition of proinflammatory genes transcription by metformin. NF-κB plays critical roles in B cell development, activation and function (Sasaki et al., 2016). Upon TLR2 activation, the purified splenic B220<sup>+</sup> B cells activate NF-κB to induce TNF-α mRNA expression (<italic>Huang et al.</italic>, <italic>2012</italic>). Therefore, we speculate that metformin may reduce TNF-α expression in B cells by reducing the binding ability of NF-κB to the TNF-α promoter region.</p><p>References</p><p>Huang, Z. M., Kang, J.
