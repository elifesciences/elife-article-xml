In addition to transcription factors from coding genes, non-coding RNAs may also play essential roles in shaping and directing the fate of germ cells. The presence of many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) which are specifically expressed in the germ cells during human gonadal development were reported and one divergent lncRNA, <italic>LNC1845</italic>, was functionally characterized. Comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of these lncRNAs indicates that divergent lncRNAs occupied the majority of female and male germ cells. Integrating lncRNA expression into the bioinformatic analysis also enhances the cell-type classification of female germ cells. Functional dissection using in vitro differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to germ cells revealed the regulatory role of <italic>LNC1845</italic> on a transcription factor essential for ovarian follicle development, <italic>LHX8</italic>, by modulating the levels of histone modifications, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac. Hence, bioinformatical analysis and experimental verification provide a comprehensive analysis of lncRNAs in developing germ cells and elucidate how an lncRNA function as a <italic>cis</italic> regulator during human germ cell development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LncRNA</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd><kwd>LHX8</kwd><kwd>reproductive biology</kwd><kwd>human gonadal development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0719301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>Kehkooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82071597</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>Kehkooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0107703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kee</surname><given-names>Kehkooi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lncRNA landscapes in human germ cells are comprehensively profiled and the functional role of an lncRNA LNC1845 in regulating gene expression of a neighboring coding gene LHX8 is elucidated.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Germ cells undergo many unique cellular and epigenetic processes during gametogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Irie et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that some transcriptional factors such as PRDM1 are essential for early primordial germ cell (PGC) specification, while a group of germ cell-specific RNA-binding proteins, including VASA and DAZL, play important roles at later stages of germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kurimoto and Saitou, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Besides coding genes, non-coding RNAs may also directly participate in the developmental process of germ cells. For instance, Piwi-interacting RNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs specifically expressed in germ cells and are required for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aravin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Girard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grivna et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>There is growing evidence that diverse classes of RNAs, ranging from short RNAs to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), have emerged as key regulators of gene expression and genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krol et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perry and Ulitsky, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tam et al., 2008</xref>). The development of next-generation sequencing and algorithmic analysis reveals that more than 100,000 lncRNAs exist in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Volders et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, over 67% of these lncRNAs are unannotated and not included in the Gencode database, although some might be included in the NONCODE database. Among these lncRNAs, only a small portion of lncRNAs have been functionally characterized, especially in the context of human germ cell (hGC) development. Recently, several reports have shown that lncRNAs play critical roles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse spermatogenesis and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wichman et al., 2017</xref>). However, the expression profiles of lncRNAs and their potential function in hGCs remain to be elucidated. To gain a comprehensive picture of lncRNA functionality in hGC development, it is necessary to identify germline-specific lncRNAs and construct the global lncRNA expression landscape during hGC development.</p><p>A published analysis of single-cell transcriptome data of hGCs and gonadal somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>) was utilized to identify a dynamic expression pattern of lncRNAs during hGC and gonadal somatic cell development. Computational and experimental verification further examined the molecular function of a newly characterized lncRNA, <italic>LNC1845</italic>, and its neighboring gene, <italic>LHX8. LHX8</italic> encodes an LIM homeodomain transcriptional regulator that is preferentially expressed in germ cells and is critical for mammalian oogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>LNC1845</italic> was found to regulate <italic>LHX8</italic> expression in <italic>cis</italic> by modulating histone modifications in the regions near the <italic>LHX8</italic> transcription start site. Moreover, FOXP3, one of forkhead factors which plays important roles during regulatory T cells differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weigel et al., 1989</xref>), is identified as a major transcriptional activator of lncRNAs in hGCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Numerous lncRNAs are differentially expressed during hGC development</title><p>The expression of lncRNAs during human gonadal development was analyzed using recently reported single-cell transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>). There were 1825 single cells involving 1369 PGCs and 456 gonadal somatic cells analyzed from the polyA + transcriptome dataset. The lncRNAs and protein-coding genes were included if a transcript was detected more than 1 transcripts per million reads (TPM) and mapped in at least two samples. The analysis showed that the total number of expressed lncRNAs and the ratio of lncRNAs versus coding genes in germ cells are higher than that in somatic cells of the same gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In female and male germ cells (fGCs and mGCs), there were 10,624 and 11,977 expressed lncRNAs, respectively, compared with 4295 and 3186 expressed lncRNAs in female and male gonadal somatic cells (fSOMAs and mSOMAs), respectively. Notably, over 67% of these lncRNAs are unannotated in both Refseq (NCBI) and GENCODE, indicating that only a small proportion of lncRNAs expressed in human gonads have been identified or fully annotated in previous studies. Among these unannotated lncRNAs, some neighboring protein-coding genes are related to spermatogenesis (SPATC1) and the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway (SMAD1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The average number of expressed lncRNAs in each germ cell is higher than that in somatic cells from 5 to 26 weeks of gestation (WG) in female gonads and 4–25 WG in male gonads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, the average number of expressed lncRNAs in each fGC increases to the highest level at around 23 WG, and in each mGC at around 19 WG. In contrast, the average number of lncRNAs in each somatic cell remains at the same level throughout similar periods of gonadal development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Figure numerous.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are differentially expressed during human germ cell (hGC) development.

Each germ cell was assigned into its corresponding developmental stage (fGCs into mitotic, RA responsive, meiotic, and oogenesis; and mGCs into migrating, mitotic, and mitotic arrest) according to the transcriptomes of the coding genes and analyzed the dynamics of lncRNA expression as in a previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>). The number of expressed lncRNAs increases from the mitotic to oogenesis stage in fGCs and from migrating to the mitotic arrest stage in mGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). There is strong heterogeneity in lncRNA number when female hGCs enter meiosis and male hGCs enter mitotic arrest. LncRNA showed dynamic expression pattern although the number of expressed lncRNAs is generally less in gonadal somatic cells. In fSOMA, the lncRNA number increases when cells developed from early granulosa to mural granulosa cells and then decreases in late granulosa cells. In mSOMA, the lncRNA number is higher in differentiated Leydig cells than that in Leydig precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The trend of expressed protein-coding gene number is similar to lncRNA number, but exhibits more subtle differences. For example, the lncRNA number increases from RA responsive to meiosis stage in fGC, but the protein-coding gene number decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the specificity of lncRNA expression during human gonadal development, a systematically bioinformatical analysis reveals the expression pattern of lncRNAs in specific cell types and developmental stages. A lncRNA is expressed specifically in one cell type or developmental stage with TPM equal or more than one in at least two cells, and the same lncRNA is not expressed in all other cell type with TPM equal or more than one. According to the above criterion, 5024 fGC-, 558 fSOMA-, 6097 mGC-, and 455 mSOMA-specific lncRNAs were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). After clustering the cells into different developmental stages and analyzing the lncRNAs specific to each stage, 1218 and 2942 stage-specific lncRNAs in female and male hGCs were identified, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integrating lncRNA expression enhances cell-type classifications of human fGCs</title><p>Previous analysis showed that human female gonadal germ cell could be clustered into four developmental stage according to protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We tested whether combining lncRNA expression with coding gene expression could better define the classification of cell types. As there are many stage-specific lncRNAs expressed, a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis identified cell types of female gonadal germ cells and somatic cells by integrating lncRNAs with protein-coding genes. t-SNE analysis using lncRNAs and coding genes identified an additional cell population clustered close to the mitotic population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As this population clustered closely with three other cell populations which belong to mitotic stage and separate from other cell types, we named this population mitotic-4.

If lncRNA dataset was integrated into the analysis, four mitotic populations can be distinguished along the pseudotime trajectory, whereas only three populations of mitotic cells are distributed according to protein-coding genes. Interestingly, many mitotic-4 cells are located next to the RA-responsive cells and away from the starting point of the trajectory, suggesting that the developmental stage of this population is later than the other three mitotic populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>Usually, protein-coding genes specifically expressed in certain cell type have been selected as gene markers for cellular and molecular studies. Computational analysis shows that lncRNAs might also be used as markers for specific cell types in female gonadal cells. The top 5 expressed lncRNAs and protein-coding genes of each tSNE cluster were shown in a heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Both protein-coding genes and lncRNAs were selected as specific marker using Seurat FindAllMarker function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Thus, lncRNA markers can be used alone or together with the protein-coding markers in the corresponding cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D</xref>). Several lncRNAs are more specifically expressed in the newly identified mitotic-4 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which suggests that cell-type-specific expression of lncRNAs contributes to the new cell-type classification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Genomic distributions and biotypes of the lncRNAs expressed during human gonadal development</title><p>Genomic distributions of lncRNAs may determine their molecular and cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subhash et al., 2018</xref>).

Second, we also tested the <italic>trans</italic>-activating effect by overexpressing <italic>LNC1845</italic> using a lentiviral system in both WT and <italic>LNC1845</italic> KO PGCLCs with various level of lentiviral concentrations. The levels of <italic>LNC1845</italic> are ~500- to ~40,000-fold higher in <italic>LNC1845</italic> KO and WT cells, respectively, than the control groups<italic>,</italic> but <italic>LHX8</italic> expression shows no obvious change in KO cells and decreased in WT cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, both approaches suggested that <italic>LNC1845</italic> might not have a <italic>trans</italic>-activating effect or that the effect was not significant. To examine the subcellular localizations of LNC1845, cellular fractionation assay was conducted. qPCR results showed that the majority of LNC1845 was detected in nucleus, similar to other lncRNAs such as MALAT1 and NEAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In contrast, mRNA of GAPDH was mostly detected in cytoplasm of the same cells.</p><p>If <italic>LNC1845</italic> regulates <italic>LHX8</italic> expression through <italic>cis</italic>-activation, histone modifications may be modulated by <italic>LNC1845</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subhash et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we examined the levels of two important histone modifications of transcription activation, H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac, in the WT, <italic>LNC1845</italic> KO, and KO, and <italic>LNC1845</italic> + EF1α PGCLCs by the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay ULI-NChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brind’Amour et al., 2015</xref>).

This locus contains an E-box sequence previously reported to be the promoter region of <italic>Lhx8</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, H3K27Ac levels are increased in <italic>LNC1845</italic> OE cells, although the level of H3K27Ac was very low in WT cells. Taken together, the results indicated that the expression level of <italic>LNC1845</italic> modulates the level of these two histone modifications at the <italic>LHX8</italic> promoter.</p><p>The latest discovery of many lncRNAs in association with specific chromatin modification complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidovich and Cech, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guttman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>) suggests that <italic>LNC1845</italic> may manage this gene-specific H3K4me3 modification. WDR5 is a highly conserved WD40 repeat protein, and it is the common component of MLL1, MLL2, and hSet1 methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wysocka et al., 2005</xref>). Previous studies have reported the interactions of WDR5 with lncRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subhash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014</xref>), and the interaction between WDR5 and lncRNAs can guide the methyltransferase to specific locus to establish H3K4me3 status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subhash et al., 2018</xref>). Single-cell expression analysis showed WDR5 expresses in both germ cells and somatic cells of human fetal ovaries, but germ cells tend to have higher mRNA expression of WDR5, and the proteins tends to colocalize in hPGCs with high DAZL expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). In PGCLCs, WDR5 knockdown led to reductions of both <italic>LNC1845</italic> and <italic>LHX8</italic> in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, WDR5 appears to be critical for <italic>LNC1845</italic> and <italic>LHX8</italic> expressions. Next, we tested whether <italic>LNC1845</italic> RNA may physically interact with WDR5 by performing RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) in PGCLCs. The results showed that <italic>LNC1845</italic> transcripts were enriched in WDR5 IP sample, similar to the known interacting partner of WDR5, <italic>NR2F2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Subhash et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Moreover, we performed chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) assay using antisense oligos along the entire LNC1845 transcript sequence. ChIRP results confirmed that WDR5 protein were enriched when anti-LNC1845 oligo probes were used to isolate the complex but not the controls without the probes or without overexpression of LNC1845 transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Taken together, the findings of both approaches support the model that <italic>LNC1845</italic> directly interacts with WDR5 to modulate the H3K4me3 modification for <italic>LHX8</italic> transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>FOXP3 upregulates expression of <italic>LNC1845</italic> and other lncRNAs</title><p>As there are numerous lncRNAs upregulated during fetal germ cell development, we postulated that the transcription expression of these lncRNAs, including <italic>LNC1845</italic>, may be regulated by one or more common transcriptional factors during each developmental stage. To discern the transcription factor(s) that activate lncRNAs, we first formulated a multistep computational prediction method to identify which transcription factor is most likely to bind to the promoter sequences of the lncRNAs during the meiotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To look for potential transcription factors, we first used the PROMO program to analyze the promoter sequences of expressed lncRNAs and matched them to the known preferred binding sequences of transcription factors in the database. Next, we selected the candidate genes that were expressed in fGCs for further study. Interestingly, we found the preferred binding motifs of CEBPA, HNF1A, GATA1, TFAP2A, FOXA1, PAX5, STAT4, and FOXP3 are identified in 21–89% of the promoter sequences of lncRNAs expressed in the meiosis stage (385 total meiotic specific lncRNAs). Among them, TFAP2A and FOXP3 are specifically expressed in the in vivo PGCs and in the in vitro PGCLCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). Promoter of <italic>LNC1845</italic> contains both FOXP3- and TFAP2A-binding sites, so we tested whether overexpression of these transcription factors could upregulate the transcription of <italic>LNC1845</italic>.

The coding sequence of FOXP3 was inserted into a lentiviral vector with E1Fα promoter (more details in Method) and transduced into 293 FT cells. qPCR analysis showed that overexpression of FOXP3 alone upregulates <italic>LNC1845</italic> and <italic>LHX8</italic> expression, but TFAP2A alone did not show the upregulating effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Second, a modified overexpression vector was conducted in which FOXP3 was cloned and linked with P2A-mCherry in order to collect the overexpressed FOXP3 hPGCLCs by flow cytometry sorting for mCherry-positive cells.

After obtaining two shRNAs that efficiently knocked down FOXP3 in the late PGCLCs, we found that both <italic>LNC1845</italic> and <italic>LHX8</italic> are simultaneously reduced in the same cells compared with that in the control cells infected with sh<italic>LACZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>To further test whether FOXP3 regulates lncRNAs by directly binding to the promoter regions, we examined FOXP3-binding activity by measuring luciferase transcription of <italic>LNC1845</italic> promoter. Overexpressing FOXP3 obviously activated <italic>LNC1845</italic> promoter compared with overexpressing empty control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Taken together, FOXP3 was found to specifically express in germ cells rather than gonadal somatic cells in human fetal gonads, and overexpressing FOXP3 alone upregulates expression of many meiotic specific lncRNAs by direct promoter binding.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent studies have identified the expression of lncRNAs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wichman et al., 2017</xref>), but the functions and regulation mechanisms of these lncRNAs are not clear. Furthermore, many lncRNAs expressed in model organisms are not conserved in humans. Another recent study reported differential expression profiles of human MII oocytes and cumulus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouckenheimer et al., 2018</xref>), but the lncRNA expression profiles in other developmental stages were not included. In contrast, cell-type-specific and developmental-stage-specific lncRNA expression profiles during human gonadal development from 4 WG to 26 WG in both sexes are elucidated.</p><p>During human gonadal development, 20,323 lncRNAs in germ and somatic cells, which have not been annotated in GENCODE and RefSeq (NCBI), were identified. Although an increasing number of human lncRNAs have been annotated in several annotation databases such as NONCODE, many novel lncRNAs have not been fully identified and systematically annotated due to the lack of examination in specific tissues or developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uszczynska-Ratajczak et al., 2018</xref>). Our study provides cell-type specific and developmental timing expression of lncRNAs for future studies of lncRNAs in human gonadal germ cells and somatic cells. Interestingly, the ratios of lncRNA versus protein-coding genes in fGCs and mGCs are higher than the ratios in the somatic cells, suggesting that lncRNAs may play more critical roles or have regulatory functions in germ cells than gonadal somatic cells during gonadal development. However, it is not clear whether all of these lncRNAs are essential for germ cell development. Further studies are needed to validate and elucidate the roles of these lncRNAs.</p><p>Cell-type classification is widely used in single-cell study to define and understand cellular state during dynamic developmental process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Current cell-type classification mostly relies on transcriptional expression profiles of coding genes. However, expression profiles of coding genes may not be different enough to distinguish two cell types which are closely similar. Integrating expression profiles of non-coding genes such as lncRNA will enable us to further dissect different cellular states in order to more accurately describe the changes happen during developmental programs such as germ cell development. A comprehensive analysis identifies a new population of cells after integrating lncRNA expression profile. The challenge is the sequencing depth of many single-cell study may not cover enough non-coding genes for this integration.</p><p>Another interesting feature of lncRNA profiles reveals that the majority of lncRNAs expressed in hGCs belong to divergent XH biotypes. Recent studies of divergent lncRNAs showed that many of them are involved in regulating the expression of neighboring genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canzio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kimura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yin et al., 2015</xref>). A previous report showed that many lncRNAs have local regulation of nearby protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engreitz et al., 2016</xref>), and divergent lncRNAs tend to co-express with developmental and transcription regulator genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). According to lncRNAs landscape, both fGCs and mGCs expressed more divergent lncRNAs than the other biotypes, suggesting that the divergent lncRNAs or the transcriptional activities of these lncRNA may affect the transcriptional expression of the neighboring coding genes. More examples of divergent lncRNAs serving as regulatory lncRNAs during hGC development are expected to be discovered in the future.</p><p>Focusing on one divergent lncRNA expressed in both in vivo and in vitro differentiated germ cells, the mechanism of how <italic>LNC1845</italic> regulates <italic>LHX8</italic> through <italic>cis</italic>-activation is elucidated. Our experimental results utilizing multiple approaches all suggest that <italic>LNC1845</italic> RNA regulates LHX8 expression through <italic>cis</italic> activation. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Lhx8</italic>-deficient mice exhibit a lack of transition from primordial to growing follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pangas et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Lhx8</italic>-null mouse ovaries misexpress many oocyte-specific genes, such as growth differentiation factor-9 (<italic>Gdf9</italic>), POU class 5 homeobox (<italic>Pou5f1</italic>), and newborn ovary homeobox (<italic>Nobox</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2008</xref>). Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in <italic>LHX8</italic> associated with primary ovarian insufficiency patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouilly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qin et al., 2008</xref>). One of the reported missense mutations (A325V) in <italic>LHX8</italic> caused lower transcriptional expression of LIN28A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouilly et al., 2016</xref>). A new regulatory lncRNA at the 5′UTR of <italic>LHX8</italic> acting through the <italic>cis</italic>-activation of <italic>LHX8</italic> transcription was identified. Based on this model, a loss-of-function mutation occurring in <italic>LNC1845</italic> might lower the expression of <italic>LHX8</italic> during human folliculogenesis and might lead to premature ovarian insufficiency.</p><p>The high number of lncRNA expression suggests that there may be a common regulator of transcription factors during hGC development, especially in late PGCs and after cell entering meiosis. Using PROMO prediction and in vitro validation, we confirmed that FOXP3 alone is able to transcriptionally activate many lncRNAs expressed in hGCs. FOXP3 was reported to play important roles during regulatory T-cell development in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weigel et al., 1989</xref>), and FOXP3 polymorphisms are associated with human female endometriosis and male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunkow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piccirillo, 2020</xref>). In our study, FOXP3 specifically expresses in germ cells rather than in gonadal somatic cells in human gonads. Moreover, overexpression FOXP3 alone upregulates expression of many meiotic specific lncRNAs. Although no study has reported a regulatory function of FOXP3 on human fGC development, previous studies reported knockout mice died 6–8 weeks after birth. It is possible that the effect on reproduction and germ cell development has not been carefully examined. Conditional Foxp3 knockout mice may be needed to further dissect its function in lncRNA regulation.</p><p>In summary, an unbiased bioinformatic analysis provides a new and comprehensive profiling of lncRNAs expressed during human gonadal development. Using in vitro differentiated germ cells, the regulatory role of <italic>LNC1845</italic> expressed in hGCs and its relationship with its neighboring gene, <italic>LHX8</italic>, were elucidated. The production of <italic>LNC1845</italic> changes the histone modification level of H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac and may prepare a more open chromatic structure for the transcriptional activation of the neighboring gene, <italic>LHX8</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>-activating lncRNAs have been discovered in some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gil and Ulitsky, 2020</xref>), but this is the first example in hGCs.</p><p>The functional roles of lncRNAs in germ cell development and fertility have gained more attentions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tzur, 2022</xref>). However, lncRNA is not the only non-coding RNAs important for germ cell developments, miRNAs have recently been elucidated to regulate proliferation of hPGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yan et al., 2022</xref>). The regulation of transcriptional level is not always the most important for gene expression in germ cells, recent studies also underlying the importance of translational regulation in oocyte maturation and spermiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2022</xref>).

Briefly, after polyA selection the RNA went through reverse transcription and the first-strand cDNA synthesis. Then the cDNA is amplified using a limited number of PCR cycles and Tn5 tagmentation is used to construct sequencing libraries. After PCR amplification the libraries were size-selected and sequenced using 150-bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.</p><p>Raw sequencing reads were cleaned after removing low-quality reads and trimmed adaptors. The quality of cleaned reads was assessed using FastQC and MultiQC. Next, clean reads were mapped to the Gencode.v29 of the human reference genome using Hisat2 with the GTF file contains both the annotations of protein-coding genes from Gencode.v29 and lncRNA genes from NONCODEv5. Read counts per gene were obtained from the aligned reads using htseq-count of HTSeq package. DESeq2 was used for normalization and differential gene expression analysis.</p><p>We normalized read counts into FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase per Million) for the hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes and heatmaps were generated using pheatmap package with row <italic>z</italic>-score normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-3"><title>Nonlinear dimensional reduction (t-SNE)</title><p>The R package called Seurat was applied to perform nonlinear dimensional reduction(t-SNE) on the coding transcriptome only and combined transcriptome data, respectively, using normalized TPM expression values. Top 2000 high variable genes/lncRNAs were used for the principle component analysis. Jackstraw with 500 replicates analysis was used to select principal components (PCs) to separate the cells. We select PCs 1–10 to perform the RunTSNE function and the FindClusters function (resolution = 0.6), obtaining clusters 0–7 and 0–8, respectively. Seurat FindAllMarkers function based on normalized TPM expression values was used to identify unique cluster-specific marker genes and lncRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-4"><title>Pseudotime analysis</title><p>For germ cells, pseudotime was generated by Monocle package (v2.10.1) based on top 2000 high variable genes/lncRNAs identified by Seurat following the default settings. Single-cell pseudotime trajectories were constructed with the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle-release/docs_mobile/">Monocle2 package (v2.10.1)</ext-link> according to the operation manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, the UMI count matrices of the germ cells were input as the expr_matrix, and meta_data was input as the sample sheet. Then, highly variable protein-coding genes and lncRNAs identified by Seurat were chosen to define a cell’s progress. In this step, ordering genes that were expressed in less than 5 cells and had a p value bigger than 0.001 were excluded. DDRTree was used to reduce the space down to one with two dimensions, and all cells were ordered with the orderCells function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16-5"><title>GO analysis</title><p>GO analysis was

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claire Rougeulle (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The two reviewers appreciated that the manuscript provides a very useful resource of human germ cell-specific lncRNAs for the community, and commended the authors for the impressive set of orthogonal approaches (KO, interrupted transcription, overexpression) they relied on to address the functional interactions between LNC1845 and its nearby gene LHX8. However, clarifications are needed to better support the claims, notably regarding the bioinformatic methodologies and the experimental strategies used for the functional genetic part.</p><p>Three main points, outlined below, have been identified as requiring particular attention. Please address them in a revised version of your manuscript. In addition, answer the individual comments of the reviewers in a detailed rebuttal letter, and provide the text clarifications and additional figures they request to include in the manuscript.</p><p>1. More insights into the cellular/phenotypic consequences of altered LHX8 expression is requested by the two reviewers, regarding the mention that LHX8 has a crucial function in ovarian development. One suggestion was to exploit the RNA-seq data to infer differentiation states of lnc1845 KO late PGCLCs. It seems also reasonable to ask the reviewers to provide information regarding the comparative efficiency of late PGCLC differentiation in presence or upon LHX8 downregulation (LNC1845 KO). The authors are welcome to provide other experimental means by which they could address the question of the functional consequences of the loss of lnc1845 and LHX8 on female PGCLC differentiation.</p><p>2. More information should be given as to how the 5' end of LNC1845 and proximal regulatory regions were defined (TF binding sites? 5'RACE?). The experimental strategy for editing and for overexpression should also be better described. This information is critical to support the functional analyses by deletion and by CRISPR ON.</p><p>3. The description of the datasets (developmental stages), methods for annotation of unknown lncRNAs, for quantification and for statistical analyses needs improvement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My specific comments for each part of the study are summarized below:</p><p>1. Identification of lncRNAs expressed in human gonads</p><p>1.1 The first part of the manuscript annotating and cataloging lncRNAs in human germ cells requires some clarifications in respect of the number of identified lncRNAs. First, the authors should comment on the number of protein-coding genes in their data sets. Given that the human genome has in total 20.000-25.000 protein-coding genes, is it not surprising that about 14.000-16.000 protein-coding genes have been found to be expressed in gonads? Second, the same is valid for the number of lncRNAs that the authors identify to be expressed in these cells. Could it be that the high number of protein-coding and noncoding transcripts are due to a low expression threshold used for the analyses? The authors should elaborate on this point.</p><p>1.2 The authors should elaborate in the main text and also in the star methods on how they identified unannotated lncRNAs. What pipeline was used for their identification? Did the authors use coding potential algorithms to filter out potential peptide coding genes etc?</p><p>2. Identification of the molecular mechanism of action of lnc1845</p><p>2.1 The authors should mention if lnc1845 has been previously annotated or if it is a new lncRNA that is not present in Genocode or NONCODE databases (this is how the authors defined annotated lncRNAs in their study; see star methods). Given that the authors have RNA-seq data, it will be important to show RNA-seq genome browser tracks for lnc1845 right at the beginning when describing the locus. In general, one has to be particularly cautious with unspliced lncRNA transcripts such as lncRNA1845 as they often tend to be mis-mapping artefacts or pseudogenes. Showing RNA-seq genome tracks will also visualize the organization of the locus and demonstrate how are the levels of lnc1845 comparable to the expression levels of its protein-coding neighbor LHX8.

More insights into the cellular/phenotypic consequences of altered LHX8 expression is requested by the two reviewers, regarding the mention that LHX8 has a crucial function in ovarian development. One suggestion was to exploit the RNA-seq data to infer differentiation states of lnc1845 KO late PGCLCs. It seems also reasonable to ask the reviewers to provide information regarding the comparative efficiency of late PGCLC differentiation in presence or upon LHX8 downregulation (LNC1845 KO). The authors are welcome to provide other experimental means by which they could address the question of the functional consequences of the loss of lnc1845 and LHX8 on female PGCLC differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestions to further exploit the RNA-seq data to infer differentiation states of lnc1845 KO late PGCLCs. First, we have analyzed differentially expressed genes and GO terms in lnc1845 KO PGCLCS vs WT PGCLCS, and the results showed Figure 5D demonstrated that expression of many genes were also affected by LNC1845 deletion, especially many meiotic and oogenesis related genes are among them (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). We also compared RNA-seq data of lnc1845 KO PGCLCs, WT late PGCLCs and in vivo hPGCs by Principal Component Analysis, and the results showed late PGCLCs differentiated from WT showed higher similarity to in vivo hPGCs than cells differentiated from lnc1845 KO cells (Figure 5F, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Identification of lncRNAs expressed in human gonads</p><p>1.1 The first part of the manuscript annotating and cataloging lncRNAs in human germ cells requires some clarifications in respect of the number of identified lncRNAs. First, the authors should comment on the number of protein-coding genes in their data sets. Given that the human genome has in total 20.000-25.000 protein-coding genes, is it not surprising that about 14.000-16.000 protein-coding genes have been found to be expressed in gonads? Second, the same is valid for the number of lncRNAs that the authors identify to be expressed in these cells. Could it be that the high number of protein-coding and noncoding transcripts are due to a low expression threshold used for the analyses? The authors should elaborate on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>It may not be surprising to identify thousands of coding and noncoding genes in developing gonads given that the human genome has more than 20,000 coding genes. The main goal of showing the total number of expressed genes was to compare the expression level in germ cells versus somatic cells in the same developing gonads. The total number of coding and noncoding genes expressed in germ cells are more than that in somatic cells (Figure 1 A). Moreover, we compared these expressed genes in both male and female cells at each stage, so we delineated the expression levels of coding and noncoding genes in germ cell versus somatic cells of the same gonads throughout the developing stages (Figure 1C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B). The lncRNAs and protein coding genes were considered as expressed gene if a transcript was detected more than 1 transcripts per million reads (TPM) and mapped in at least two samples (we defined this in the first paragraph of the result section). Thus, there may be relatively low and high expressed genes in the datasets. To cover as many expressed genes as possible in the overall analysis and to provide the most complete datasets for other researchers, we did not further delete the relatively low expressed genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.2 The authors should elaborate in the main text and also in the star methods on how they identified unannotated lncRNAs. What pipeline was used for their identification? Did the authors use coding potential algorithms to filter out potential peptide coding genes etc?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate Reviewer #1 suggestion to elaborate on how we identified unannotated lncRNAs. The classification of annotated and unannotated lncRNA genes are performed by comparing the lncRNA genes’ genomic location between the NONCODEv5_hg38.lncAndGene.be (from NONCODE database) and gencode.v29.long_noncoding_RNAs.gtf (from Gencode database). A lncRNA is defined as annotated if it is included in these two databases, and as unannotated if it is only recorded in NONCODE database. GENCODE is the reference human genome annotation for The ENCODE Project and is widely used and contains more comprehensive annotation of lncRNA loci than UCSC and RefSeq. LncRNAs protein-coding potential was excluded through CNIT (Coding- NonCoding Identifying Tool), as all lncRNAs recorded in NONCODE database.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Identification of the molecular mechanism of action of lnc1845</p><p>2.1 The authors should mention if lnc1845 has been previously annotated or if it is a new lncRNA that is not present in Genocode or NONCODE databases (this is how the authors defined annotated lncRNAs in their study; see star methods). Given that the authors have RNA-seq data, it will be important to show RNA-seq genome browser tracks for lnc1845 right at the beginning when describing the locus. In general, one has to be particularly cautious with unspliced lncRNA transcripts such as lncRNA1845 as they often tend to be mis-mapping artefacts or pseudogenes. Showing RNA-seq genome tracks will also visualize the organization of the locus and demonstrate how are the levels of lnc1845 comparable to the expression levels of its protein-coding neighbor LHX8. Furthermore, the authors should include chromatin marks associated with the active enhancers around the lnc1845/LHX8 locus in the same figure. From Figure 6A it appears that the full deletion affects cis-regulatory elements – the authors should elaborate on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Lnc1845 is an annotated lncRNA since we found the same location of it both in NONCODEv5 and GENCODEv29. Lnc1845 is known as NONHSAG001845.2 in NONCODE, and is named as AC099786.3 (ENSG00000261213.1) in GENCODE.</p><p>To show RNA-seq genome browser tracks for lnc1845 right at the beginning, we added the RNA- seq tracks to figure 5A with the deletion strategy.</p><p>To show the chromatin marks associated with the active enhancers around the lnc1845/LHX8 locus, we presented H3K4me3, H3K27ac ChIP-seq tracks along with RNA-seq tracks in Figure 6F. LNC1845 full deletion showed in figure 5A only removed the sequences of LNC1845, but not affected sequences of cis-regulatory elements of LHX8, which showed in the pink box in figure 6F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2 The authors have presented RNA seq data analyses comparing a full deletion of the lncRNA locus to wild-type cells. In addition, to the full-deletion allele, the authors have introduced a premature transcriptional termination cassette which leads to efficient depletion of lnc1845. It will be important to compare RNA-seq data from full deletion, polyA knock-in, and wild-type alleles.</p></disp-quote><p>The main goal of the polyA knock-in is to validate that the expression of LHX8 is also downregulated using an independent method to inhibit the transcription of lnc1845, so we have not carried out the polyA knock-in RNA-seq due to limited funding for this project. We showed that the expression of LHX8 indeed significantly downregulated (Figure 5H), similar to the effect of full deletion in Figure 5B. Although we did not compare the RNA-seq of full deletion and polyA knockin to analyze the potential downstream effector genes and cellular pathway, we compared the RNA-seq of full deletion vs wild type, and LHX8 OE vs control. The comparison yielded many overlapped effector genes and GO term related to germ cell development and oogenesis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3 The authors mention that LHX8, the protein-coding gene regulated by lnc1845, has a crucial function in ovarian follicle development.

The authors should provide a sufficient description of their editing strategy in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate Reviewer #1 suggestion to provide a sufficient description of the editing strategy, and we have added more detailed information for editing in main text and method section. In the method section under ‘CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knock-out and knock-in at LNC1845’, we have added ‘We analyzed the predicted LNC1845 sequences from NONCODE and GENCODE database (chr1:75,122,517-75,123,927), and our RNA-seq mapping track showed the mapping sequences covered chr1:75,122,766-75,123,909 (18bp less than the database).</p><p>Combining the database sequences and our RNA-seq results, we marked the 75,123,927 at chromosome 1 as the 5' end of LNC1845. Plasmids expressing Cas9/sgRNAs and donor sequences were cotransfected into H9 by lipofectamine 3000. The ratio of Cas9/sgRNAs versus donor is 1:4. For LNC1845 knockout, we designed a donor plasmid including two homology arms and two loxp locus flanking the sequence encoding puromycin drug resistance, replacing LNC1845 transcript but keeping the 5’ upstream and 3’ downstream of LNC1845 (Figure 5A).’ In the main text, we have added ‘First, we used a pair of gRNAs targeting near 5’ of LNC1845 locus and inserted drug selection sequences through homologous recombination. After drug selection for single colonies, we used Cre system to remove drug selection sequences.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.5 The experimental strategy for lnc1845 overexpression should be elaborated in the main text. Furthermore, the authors should demonstrate the correct subcellular localization of lnc1845 upon overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more descriptions in addition to the illustration of strategy for lnc1845 overexpression in main text and main figures (Figure 6A, 6D). For cis overexpression, we used constitutive promoter insertion and co-expression of three different sgRNAs targeting the LNC1845 promoter region with a dCas9-VP64 activator. For trans overexpression, we used two different approaches, first by transfection of in vitro transcripts into PGCLCs and second by lentiviral transduction of PGCLCs. The LNC1845 sequences were inserted into the lentiviral vector p2k7 as reported in our previous study (Liang et al., 2019), and after the lentiviral packaging, the lentivirus was diluted from 5 folds to 100 folds for different concentration lentiviral infection.</p><p>Regarding the subcellular localization of LNC1845, we have added new experimental results using cellular fractionation assay and showed that the majority of LNC1845 was detected in nucleus, similar to other lncRNAs such as MALAT1 and NEAT1. In contrast, mRNA of GAPDH was mostly detected in cytoplasm of the same cells. (Related to Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.6 Because the authors identify WDR5 as lnc1845 interactor rather by educated guess than taking an unbiased approach, more controls are needed to demonstrate lnc1845-WDR5 interaction by RIP experiments (i.e. cytoplasmic lncRNAs). Also, what happens to the WDR5 protein in the lncRNA deletion/premature transcription termination alleles? Do the levels of WDR5 change? Does it act together with lnc1845 only at the local locus and if yes, how?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included GAPDH as the cytoplasmic mRNA and negative control because of the abundancy of the mRNA (Figure 6—figure supplement 2D). Most of the cis lncRNAs were not cytoplasmic and relatively low abundance compared to GAPDH, so the no detection of the cytoplasmic lncRNAs might not be feasible to be used as negative controls in the RIP experiments. In our RNA-seq data, the expression of WDR5 didn’t show significantly changes after lncRNA deletion (data not show). With our current datasets and the known functional roles of WDR5 in other studies with lncRNAs (Subhash et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2014), we proposed that LNC1845 directly interacts with WDR5 to modulate the H3K4me3 modification for LHX8 transcriptional activation. More experiments would be needed to validate all detailed mechanisms of this regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Identification of the FOXP3 transcription factor as a key regulator of gonad-specific lncRNAs including lnc1845</p><p>3.1 The authors should elaborate in the main text on how the overexpression of FOXP3 was achieved.</p></disp-quote><p>We added more details in the main text as follow: First, we tested the effect of overexpressing FOXP3 in 293FT cells. The coding sequence of FOXP3 was inserted into a lentiviral vector with E1Fα promoter (more details in method) and transduced into 293FT cells. qPCR analysis showed that overexpression of FOXP3 alone upregulates LNC1845 and LHX8 expression, but TFAP2A alone did not show the upregulating effect (Figure 7—figure supplement 1E). Second, a modified overexpression vector was conducted in which FOXP3 was cloned and linked with P2A-mCherry in order to collect the overexpressed FOXP3 hPGCLCs by flow cytometry sorting for mCherry positive cells. FOXP3 overexpressed cells (FOXP3-P) showed higher expression of LNC1845 and LHX8 compared with the control FOXP3-N cells (Figure 7A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2 The authors should indicate the location of the FOXP3 binding sites within the lnc1845 locus.

Then, highly variable protein coding genes and lncRNAs identified by Seurat were chosen to define a cell’s progress. In this step, ordering genes that were expressed in less than 5 cells and had a P-value bigger than 0.001 were excluded. DDRTree was used to reduce the space down to one with two dimensions, and all cells were ordered with the orderCells function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How were ChIP-seq data normalized?
