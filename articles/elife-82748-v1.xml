In addition to its secretory role in ensuring functional maturation and survival of spermatozoa, the epididymis has a complex immune function. Indeed, it must manage both peripheral tolerance to sperm antigens foreign to the immune system and the protection of spermatozoa as well as the organ itself against pathogens ascending the epididymal tubule. Although our knowledge of the immunobiology of this organ is beginning to accumulate at the molecular and cellular levels, the organization of blood and lymphatic networks of this tissue, important players in the immune response, remains largely unknown. In the present report, we have taken advantage of a VEGFR3:YFP transgenic mouse model. Using high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging and organ clearing coupled with multiplex immunodetections of lymphatic (LYVE1, PDPN, PROX1) and/or blood (PLVAP/Meca32) markers, we provide a simultaneous deep 3D view of the lymphatic and blood epididymal vasculature in the mature adult mouse as well as during postnatal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epididymis</kwd><kwd>lymphatics</kwd><kwd>spermatozoa</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lymphatic and blood network of the mouse epididymis in adulthood and during postnatal ontogeny has been analyzed in detail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies regarding the etiology of male infertility have revealed that at least 15% of cases have a clear immunological origin, a share that is most likely underestimated if idiopathic infertilities were to be included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dohle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jungwirth et al., 2012</xref>). In the male, they may be the result of chronic inflammatory situations, acute bacterial and/or viral infections, or autoimmune processes along the genital tract leading to the production of anti-sperm antibodies (for a recent review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shibahara et al., 2021</xref>). These situations are difficult to diagnose and treat, in part because our knowledge of immune/inflammatory responses in male accessory organs is limited. Among the accessory organs, the epididymis plays an essential role in the maturation, storage, and protection of spermatozoa. A particularity of the mammalian epididymis is its highly segmented anatomical organization with three macroscopic territories (caput, corpus, and cauda as depicted in Figure 2), themselves sectorized into segments (10 for the mouse model, see Figure 2), some of which have distinct functional roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnston et al., 2005</xref>). Unlike the testis, where mammalian evolution has chosen to tightly seal the germline from the immune system—conferring immune privilege to this tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Meinhardt and Hedger, 2011</xref>)—the epididymis tubule faces multiple immune challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guiton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hedger, 2011</xref>). On the one hand, the epididymis tubule is the testis gatekeeper, preventing ascending pathogens from reaching the immune-privileged seminiferous tubules. To do so, it should be endowed with all the power of a full and efficient immune response toward exogeneous antigens. On the other hand, the epididymis must maintain self-tolerance toward spermatic antigens that are unique to this cell lineage and appear at puberty long after the establishment of the self-immune repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodnow, 1996</xref>). Understanding how this dual action of peripheral tolerance toward sperm antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mueller, 2010</xref>) versus efficient immune survey toward non-self-antigens is performed is of particular interest for infertility issues, but also more largely in other settings where this situation occurs. This has prompted recent research aiming at identifying immune cells and molecules that could participate in the finely orchestrated epididymal immune physiology. This research has led to the characterization of a dense network of peritubular antigen-presenting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Da Silva et al., 2011</xref>), interstitial and intra-epithelial lymphocytes of distinct sub-families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voisin et al., 2018</xref>), as well as of immunosuppressive players such as transforming growth factor beta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pierucci-Alves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Voisin et al., 2020</xref>) and indoleamine/tryptophane dioxygenase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Britan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jrad-Lamine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jrad-Lamine et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because the immune picture of the mammalian epididymis would not be complete without a clear view of the blood and lymphatic circulating networks—which are crucial in managing immune responses—we choose to explore these in the mouse. Reports describing mammalian epididymal blood and lymphatic vessels are rare and rather old (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pérez-Clavier et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McDonald and Scothorne, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Itoh et al., 1998</xref>). The technology used was not very efficient and consisted mainly of ink or contrast agent injection. It concerned only the peripheral epididymal lymphatic network with the organization of the collectors connecting the PP. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hirai et al., 2010</xref>, performed the first histological study of mouse epididymal blood and lymphatic vasculature using the markers CD31/PECAM1 and LYVE1, respectively. Although PECAM1 is used to visualize blood vessels, it is not an exclusive blood marker because it is also found expressed at button-like junctions of endothelial cells in the initial lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Privratsky and Newman, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, to characterize lymphatics, the use of LYVE1 alone limits the power of the analysis because this marker recognizes only a subpopulation of all lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kato et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, conventional two-dimensional (2D) light microscopy combined with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) reporter on paraffin-embedded tissue sections did not allow for a high level of accuracy in providing a holistic view of a structured network.</p><p>Characterization of the lymphatic vasculature in mammals is tricky because on the one hand, it shares common embryonic origins with the blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baluk and McDonald, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Srinivasan et al., 2007</xref>) and on the second hand, it concerns various different structures. There are blunted-end highly permeable initial lymphatics connected to pre-collector lymphatics and then to collector lymphatics linking to a lymph node (LN), each with specific characteristics (for a very recent review, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lampejo et al., 2023</xref>). A step forward was made with the identification of lymphangiogenic factors (vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and their receptor (VEGFR3), which are now considered the major markers of lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaipainen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mäkinen et al., 2001</xref>). To ensure confidence in the identification of lymphatic structures, one should use a combination of markers, including VEGFR3, the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1 (LYVE1), the prospero-related homeobox 1 (PROX1) transcription factor, and podoplanin (PDPN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerji et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breiteneder-Geleff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamrah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kivelä et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mouta Carreira et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Partanen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wigle and Oliver, 1999</xref>). We have followed this rationale in the present study, using three lymphatic markers together with plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP/MECA32) to specifically identify fenestrated blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stan et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, we have taken advantage of a transgenic mouse model that expresses the fluorescent reporter YFP under the control of the VEGFR3 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calvo et al., 2011</xref>). Using the power of three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of high-resolution imaging with light-sheet microscopy after epididymis 3DISCO clearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ertürk et al., 2012</xref>), we present here an in-depth analysis of both the blood and lymphatic networks of the epididymis in the adult mouse as well as during postnatal ontogenesis. We hope the data we bring will provide a better view of the systemic compartment that irrigates and drains this segmented organ, a prerequisite for a more precise understanding of its pathophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An abundant lymphatic network drains the epididymis</title><p>To gain insight into the lymphatic network of the mouse epididymis, we used the VEGFR3:YFP mouse model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows representative in toto views of the lymphatic vascularization of the testis and epididymis of an adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and 10 days postnatal (DPN) mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). There is intense vascularization at the epididymis–testis interface regardless of the level of the epididymis (<italic>caput</italic>, <italic>corpus</italic>, or <italic>cauda</italic>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows that the lymphatic drainage joins the main testicular lymphatic trunk at the <italic>pampiniform plexus</italic> (PP) and follows it to a highly fluorescent structure that corresponds to the most proximal LN.

A higher magnification micrograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> ①) shows the particularly prominent lymphatic vasculature of the efferent duct and its interconnection with that of the epididymal <italic>caput</italic>. It also points out the departure of the u-ELC to the PP surrounding the upper epididymal artery. It can be noted that the lymphatic collectors coincide well with the segmentation of the organ. A <italic>corpus</italic> lymphatic collector (<italic>Co</italic>-LC) follows the body of the epididymis on the side adjacent to the testis connecting the <italic>caput</italic> with the <italic>cauda</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Also noticeable in the enlargements provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is the presence of fluorescence under the capsule, faint in the <italic>caput</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) but clearly more visible in the most distal segment (S10) of the <italic>cauda</italic> epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> presents a global complex organization of the <italic>cauda</italic> lymphatic collectors. Overall, our observations revealed a very dense lymphatic network in the mouse epididymis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Macroscopic view of the lymphatic vasculature of the epididymis and testis in the VEGFR3:YFP model.</title><p>Representative image of the lymphatic vasculature of the adult epididymis and testis observed with a Leica binocular loupe (<bold>A</bold>).

The superior and lateral epididymal lymphatic collectors (upperELC and medianELC, respectively) drain lymph from the caput and corpus, respectively, before joining the main testicular lymphatic collector at the PP. The latter is connected to a main collector that surrounds the testis (arrowhead) and branches into a rich network (<bold>A–C</bold>). There are numerous lymphatic connections between the lymphatics of the epididymis and the main lymphatic collector of the testis, notably through a lymphatic network at the level of the efferent ducts (φ in D), corpus (κ in E), and cauda (λ in F). Through the capsule covering the epididymal duct, there is also fluorescence that outlines the tubules, weakly in the caput (<bold>D</bold>) and more intense in the cauda (<bold>F and G</bold>).

As the 3DISCO organ clearing procedures resulted in a loss of the endogenous transgene (VEGFR3:YFP) fluorescence, anti-GFP was used to strengthen the signal.

The epididymis used for PLVAP detection is the contralateral organ of the one used for lymphatic markers. The white-squared regions in each photograph (left in caput and cauda) are enlarged in the right photographs. PLVAP+ micro-vascularization (red) is visible at the peritubular epithelium level of the initial segment (IS)/S1 and its expression markedly decreases in the other segments. At higher magnification, a network of blood capillaries surrounds each tubule mainly at the level of the IS/S1 while intertubular vessels can be observed in segment 3 (S3). In the cauda (S10), PLVAP<sup>pos</sup> vasculature is less dense and is mostly located in the intertubular space. The VEGFR3:YFP transgene (green), revealed by an anti-GFP antibody, is abundant in the caput and in particular in the IS/S1. Enlargements show punctiform labeling at the peritubular level and in the intertubular zone. On can note the presence of very large lymphatics at the intertubular level (white star). In the cauda (S10), reactivity is mainly interstitial, stringy, and compatible with flattened lymphatic vessels trapped in the extracellular matrix. We also noted at the S9/S10 boundaries (delimited by the dotted line) the presence of large lymphatic vessels (white asterisk), suggesting that important drainage takes place at this location. The lymphatic marker LYVE1 in the caput is mainly interstitial and clearly stronger in the IS/S1. We also noticed that the lymphatics detected with the transgene (VEGFR3:YFP) and with LYVE1 present differences (white arrows), in agreement with previous studies reporting heterogeneity for these markers at the level of the lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pawlak and Caron, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ulvmar and Mäkinen, 2016</xref>). In the cauda, LYVE1 appears less present compared with VEGFR3:YFP. We also noticed differences in localization and intensity between these two lymphatic markers (white arrows). PROX1 (magenta) shows a profile comparable to those obtained for the transgene product and/or LYVE1 in both the caput and cauda. The labeling is punctiform (compatible with a nuclear localization) and filamentous at the level of the IS/S1. The stringy appearance can be explained by the use of a PROX1-biotinylated antibody that generates a fuzzier/coarser signal. PDPN (white) appears abundant in the caput and cauda at the peritubular level of the epididymal epithelium and in the interstitial space. Stereocilia in the initial segment but not in other segments of the caput also show some reactivity with PDPN. Because of the fuzzy PDPN pattern, it is difficult at this resolution to assert that PDPN strictly co-localizes with VEGFR3:YFP, LYVE1, and PROX1. Panel B shows light-sheet confocal (12×) resolution of the caput/IS-S2 region of a VEGFR3:YFP transgenic epididymis (green) or after PLVAP immunodetection (red). The superposition of the two channels (merge) suggests both co-localization but also specific territories. The far right picture shows the superposition of the surface rendering of the two markers, which allows distinguishing the lymphatic vasculature that expresses only the transgene (in dark green) from the PLVAP+/VEGFR3:YFP+ vessels (in light green).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82748-fig2-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82748-fig2-video1.mp4" id="fig2video1"><label>Figure 2—video 1.</label><caption><title>Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of multiplex labeling of blood and lymphatic networks in the adult mouse <italic>caput</italic> epididymis.</title><p>The video shows the overlay of the PLVAP<italic><sup>pos</sup></italic> blood networks (red) and those obtained for the lymphatic markers VEGFR3:YFP (green), LYVE1 (cyan), and PDPN (white). 3D reconstruction from the light-sheet ultramicroscopy and video data were performed with IMARIS software.</p></caption></media><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-82748-fig2-video2.mp4" id="fig2video2"><label>Figure 2—video 2.</label><caption><title>Three-dimensional (3D) imaging of multiplex labeling of blood and lymphatic networks in the adult mouse <italic>corpus</italic> epididymis.</title><p>The video shows the 3D reconstruction, using light-sheet ultramicroscopy data, of the PLVAP<italic><sup>pos</sup></italic> blood vessel network and VEGFR3:YFP<sup>+</sup> lymphatic vasculature in the <italic>corpus</italic> epididymis of the adult mouse.

However, outside the IS, lymphatic reactivity appears more extensive than that of the blood vessel marker (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

This is particularly true in the IS because the size of this territory is increased approximately four times between the 10 and 40 DPN stages.</p><p>Because blood and lymphatic vascular density data suggest neovascularization during postnatal epididymal development, we performed localization and quantification of angiogenic (VEGF-A) and lymphangiogenic (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) factors, whose receptors are VEGFR2 (also known as KDR and FLK1) and VEGFR3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Quantification of the VEGFR ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D) was performed by western blotting as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.

For the lymphangiogenic ligands (VEGF-C and VEGF-D), we observed a linear increase from 30 DPN for both ligands, consistent with the accumulation of their corresponding receptor VEGFR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). An analysis of covariance of the different ligand isoforms of VEGF (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) with respect to the VEGFR3 receptor (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) shows strong statistical significance for the active ligand isoforms (i.e., the 21 kDa form for VEGF-C and the 24 kDa form for VEGF-D). In addition, the tissue localization of VEGFR2 is very similar to that of VEGFR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), being present mainly in a peritubular position at the level of the IS whereas in the more distal part of the organ it seems to be restricted to some interstitial vessels (used with permission from Dr. A.

With the combination of lymphatic markers used in this work, we have shown that a dense network of conventional lymphatics can be observed in the epididymis, with initial lymphatics present in the interstitial compartment and collecting lymphatics present at the septa. We have shown that the lymphatic network is denser on the anterior face of the epididymis (face adjacent to the testis) and progresses in the organ toward the posterior face. We found that the collecting lymphatics are mainly observed on the anterior surface and radiate inward toward the posterior surface following the septa. The initial lymphatics drain the interstitial compartment and join the collectors at the septa, resulting in an asymmetric distribution (anterior/posterior) of lymphatic vascularization. This centrifuge development of the lymphatic network is easily visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). This tree structure is logical if we consider that lymphatic vascularization progresses during mouse development following the PP before reaching the <italic>rete testis</italic> and sprouting laterally, as had been suggested earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Svingen et al., 2012</xref>). Each epididymal septum has lymphatic drainage, but three septa appear to be more involved, including the S1/S2–S3, S6/S7, and S8–9/S10 junctions, with the latter having the largest lymphatic collector. We expected this finding because it corresponds to the position of the arteries and veins that irrigate the epididymis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzuki, 1982</xref>), and it is known that the large lymphatic collectors usually follow the path of the arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gruffaz, 1984</xref>). Previous researchers have hypothesized that this strict epididymal segmentation is involved in the control of ascending pathogens, although they have not provided clues as to how this might be accomplished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stammler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner et al., 2003</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis is the observation that large lymphatic collectors that are in direct and rapid connection with LNs and the blood supply that allows for the arrival of leukocytes are present at these sites. These three septa could then be considered important checkpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This view corroborates recent data showing that immune responses in autoimmune epididymitis are concentrated in the epididymal <italic>cauda</italic> and <italic>corpus</italic>, where we do see the major lymphatic collectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wijayarathna et al., 2020</xref>). Although we have arbitrarily chosen to focus our discussion on the specific involvement of the epididymal vascular compartment in inflammation and immune responses, it should be mentioned that it could also serve other processes such as tissue metabolism and the stem/progenitor cell niche microenvironment associated with different regions of this organ.</p><p>Looking at the postnatal development of the epididymal lymphatic network, our data show a progressive increase that follows the postnatal growth of the organ between 10 and 40 DPN. Beyond this time point, the lymphatic network progresses more in the S1/IS and S10 compartments. This argues for active lymphangiogenesis or/and lymphangio-vasculogenesis, the two modalities by which lymphatics develop, in the <italic>caput</italic> and <italic>cauda</italic> territories. Lymphangiogenesis corresponds to the extension of existing vessels, also known as ‘sprouting,’ while lymphangio-vasculogenesis involves the participation of precursor cells that create clusters later integrating already formed lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gutierrez-Miranda and Yaniv, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jafree et al., 2021</xref>). Lymphangio-vasculogenesis has been reported in the development of the mesenteric lymphatic vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stanczuk et al., 2015</xref>) and for the heart and kidney lymphatic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jafree et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lioux et al., 2020</xref>), two organs with a septal organization. The lymphatic neovascularization we observed during postnatal epididymal development is supported by the observation that lymphangiogenic ligands (VEGF-C and VEGF-D) and their corresponding receptor (VEGFR3) are concordantly present in the developing tissue. Active lymphangio-vasculogenesis is also supported by our observation that foci expressing LYVE1 can be detected between 10 and 20 DPN, and eventually extend and join the initial lymphatics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzuki, 1982</xref>, reported that a testis-like blood network is present in most of the epididymis (segments 2–9) with intertubular vessels connected by perpendicular micro-vessels in a rope ladder organization. Distinctly, in the most proximal (IS/S1) and distal (S10) segments of the epididymis, we found micro-vessels encircling each tubule in a spider web organization with capillaries that penetrate the epithelial sublayer. Because the IS and S10 compartments of the epididymis have distinct embryonic origins and are functionally different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2007</xref>), it is difficult to explain this common vascular organization. We hypothesize that the common set-up of these two territories where capillaries penetrate the sub-epithelial layer could be associated with their immune function. The S10 compartment must monitor ascending pathogens and maintain self-tolerance to sperm antigens that accumulate in this storage part of the organ. Similarly, the S1 compartment is the final gatekeeper preventing ascending pathogens from reaching the immune-privileged seminiferous tubules, while at the same time it must be tolerant to sperm-specific antigens entering the epididymal tubule and considered non-self. Therefore, in both compartments, a spider web blood network can be expected to allow immune cells easy access to the epididymal tubule. This should be particularly true for the S1 segment because, independently of infectious situations, it is constantly solicited in the adult animal by the arrival of sperm antigens and by its function of reabsorption of Sertolian fluid requiring very permeable vessels. This hypervascularization of the S1 epididymal compartment is further supported by the fact that it has been shown to be PLVAP<italic><sup>pos</sup></italic>, a marker of fenestrated vessels allowing high trans-endothelial transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2016</xref>). In other contexts, PLVAP has been shown to be required for fenestron biogenesis and organization, controlling fenestron permeability, angiogenesis, as well as leukocyte, antigen migration, and immomodulatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rantakari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amersfoort et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the presence of VEGFR2, VEGFR3, and VEGF-A in the microvascularization of the epididymis S1 compartment argues for active angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bussolati et al., 2003</xref>). This has been corroborated by the recent single-cell data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rinaldi et al., 2020</xref>) showing that expression of angiogenic markers such as those mentioned above occurs in endothelial cells of the caput mouse epididymis. While active angiogenesis during postnatal epididymal development makes sense because it accompanies postnatal growth of the organ, it is more surprising that angiogenesis is still active in the adult IS epididymal compartment. In adult tissues, angiogenesis is most commonly associated with vascular remodeling in tissue repair processes and tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Komi et al., 2020</xref>). To date, self-renewal of the epididymal epithelium is collectively assumed to be rather slow, a situation that should not be associated with high angiogenic activity. However, very recent data could modify this general assumption because it has been reported that the basal cells of the epididymis share common properties with adult stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufresne et al., 2022</xref>). This could support the idea that the epithelium of the adult epididymis may be in a perpetual process of self-renewal that could be promoted by the quasi-inflammatory situation inherent to immune stimulation mediated by sperm antigens.</p><p>It is interesting to note that during postnatal ontogeny of the epididymis, PLVAP expression increases in the S1 territory but decreases in the other regions of the organ as early as 15 DPN. Whether this is due to blood vessels loss or to PLVAP<italic><sup>pos</sup></italic> permeable fenestrons becoming PLVAP<italic><sup>neg</sup></italic>, less permeable vessels will require further study. In the mouse model, it has been shown that the development of the S1 territory occurs between 15 and 20 DPN concomitantly with the arrival of testicular fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jegou et al., 1982</xref>), which has been shown to stimulate the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway known to be activated by VEGFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible to consider that VEGF-A could be one of the lumicrine factors triggering angiogenesis and differentiation of S1/IS. In agreement with this, it has been reported that mice overexpressing VEGF-A showed dilation of the <italic>caput</italic> and <italic>corpus</italic> epididymis, with enlarged and more permeable blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Korpelainen et al., 1998</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pawlak and Caron, 2020</xref>, in their review have suggested that such vessels could be hybrid lymphatics also recently called ‘mosaic vessels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lampejo et al., 2023</xref>) expressing both blood and lymphatic markers. Such hybrid vessels have been found in distinct vascular beds, including high endothelial venules in secondary lymphoid organs, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, Schlemm’s canal endothelial cells of the eye, the ascending <italic>vasa recta</italic> (AVR) of the kidney inner medulla region, and the remodeled spiral arteries of the placenta decidua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gola et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kenig-Kozlovsky et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pawlak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Russell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stamataki and Swadling, 2020</xref>) where they perform specialized exchange functions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, these structures share many markers, including those tested in the present work, suggesting that some of the assumed blood vessels found in the S1 epididymal territory might be hybrid vessels. Given the close mesonephric origin and similar fluid reabsorption function of the IS/S1 epididymal territory and the AVR, it is possible that the two structures share such hybrid vessels. Tie2 expression, a marker of all currently described hybrid lymphatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kenig-Kozlovsky et al., 2018</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), supports this hypothesis as it localizes to the S1 peritubular microvascularization together with VEGFR3 and PVLAP (not shown).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Expression of hybrid lymphatic markers in the mouse epididymis.</title><p>This table compares markers associated with hybrid lymphatic vessels described in the literature (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pawlak and Caron, 2020</xref>) with (column 2) their expression at different segments of the epididymis (source: Mammalian Reproductive Genetic; https://www.mrgd.org).

On the one hand, there are peritubular PLVAP<italic><sup>pos</sup></italic> hybrid vessels, very permeable, particularly well represented in the S1 compartment that, according to our hypothesis, participate both in the reabsorption function and in the immune surveillance of this territory. On the other hand, we have more conventional lymphatics mainly in the interstitial compartment. The various segments of the epididymis are drained by initial and collecting lymphatic vessels, the latter being closely associated with the septa and then connecting via the PP to the most proximal LN. Three checkpoints are represented by the IS/S2–S3, S6/S7, and S8–9/S10 septa. It is not yet clear to us that the lymphatic drainage of the S8–9/S10 compartment goes to the PP because it could also be drained by the lymphatic circuit monitoring the vas deferens. This detailed knowledge of the blood and lymphatic circuits of the epididymis highlights how open the epididymis is to the systemic compartment and how different its immune/inflammatory regulation is expected to be from that of the testis, where lymphatic collectors are restricted to the conjunctiva and never reach the interstitial compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hirai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Svingen et al., 2012</xref>).

The Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s posttest was used to compare more than two groups. A two-way analysis of variance test with a Bonferroni posttest was used to analyze the covariance of ligands (VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D) with the VEGFR3 receptor. The co-localization of the ligands VEGF-C and VEGF-D was evaluated by Pearson correlation and Mander’s overlap coefficient with IMARIS co-localization modules (Bitplane). The values for co-localization analysis represent the mean ± standard error of the mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Software, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The Auvergne Animal Experiment Ethics Committee (C2E2A) and the French Ministry approved all the following procedures for research (APAFIS authorization # 12376-2017112913113962 V3).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-82748-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Describes all the data source legends in (*.ims) (Imaris viewer) and (*.czi) (Zeiss AxioScan viewer) format that can be found in the BioImage Archive Biostudies EBI repository.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82748-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Is an Excel file listing all the data sources for the figures provided.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82748-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data sources are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD618">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/bioimages/studies/S-BIAD618</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise Figure 2, 3, 4, and 7. Reorganization of the panel, higher magnification inserts for clarity.</p><p>2) Introduction should include some basics about lymphatic and blood vessels in the context of the epididymis.</p><p>3) Examine fetal stages to confirm when exactly vasculature is established.</p><p>4) VEGF expression data as presented is not convincing. Revise these data.</p><p>5) Revise the Discussion with a focus on major findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I find it misleading that the authors frame this study as a way to understand the immune context of the spermatozoa in the epididymis since there is no data on immune cells or immune responses. I suggest reducing the emphasis on the immune context by revising the title, abstract, and introduction, to reflect the true goal and context of the study, which is to update our current understanding of the circulatory networks of the epididymis by providing a detailed 3D description of vasculature and lymphatics. The fact that this description is an important piece of the immune and inflammatory responses could be reserved for the second half of the introduction and/or the discussion.</p><p>Graphical abstract: the differences between the different vessels and between the different stages of development are difficult to appreciate. Maybe the authors could just represent 2-3 stages and have blow-ups of the important differences?</p><p>It would be helpful for non-expert readers if the manuscript had a short introduction to the architecture of the lymphatic system and of the epididymis. For example, if the authors could define differences between collectors, nodes, and vessels, and explain the segmentation of the epididymis and the notion of septa, the manuscript would be more accessible to a broader audience.</p><p>Figure 2A: the diagram should be in the same orientation as the microscopy images.</p><p>For figures 2B and C, the surface renderings are difficult to appreciate, it would be helpful to provide blowups on the S1 instead of coloring it white in the low mag image. This will allow the reader to see better details of the density and complexity of the networks.</p><p>The titles for Figures 2 and 3 are almost identical, what more information is presented in figure 3? This should be reflected in the figure title.</p><p>In Figures 2, 3, and 4 it would help to add merged images of all the stains with high mage insets to better appreciate the amount of overlap and comparison between the markers, similar to what is shown in figure 3D.</p><p>I was not able to interpret figure 7A. The slicers that are meant to represent the septa are barely visible, and should all be presented in the same orientation/position to better appreciate the differences between the stages. The mix of native data and surface renderings makes it really difficult to view the vessels in these images. The diagram in 7A (second row) does not look enough like the images to help make sense of what is shown and what the authors hypothesize. Vessel types should be colored differently, as it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between LYVE1+ LECP and VEGFR3+ LEC</p><p>The discussion should recapitulate the major findings of the study and would benefit from being much more concise.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82748.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Revise Figure 2, 3, 4, and 7. Reorganization of the panel, higher magnification inserts for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we have rearranged most of the figures, with higher magnification where possible, for better clarity. In addition, because the figures in the revised manuscript are now presented individually without their legends, another magnification step took place accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction should include some basics about lymphatic and blood vessels in the context of the epididymis.</p></disp-quote><p>At the request of the editors/reviewers, we now provide more information on epididymal blood and lymphatic vessels in the Introduction section (pages 3 and 4, lines 98 to 111). These statements were already in the original manuscript but were instead presented in the Discussion section. We have therefore brought them forward, which will also serve one of the editorial comments which was to shorten the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examine fetal stages to confirm when exactly vasculature is established.</p></disp-quote><p>This point raised by Reviewer 2 (item 3) will be discussed below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) VEGF expression data as presented is not convincing.

For the remainder of our Discussion, we do not feel that it needs to be greatly modified because we have tried to relate our data to the existing literature, as the situation of the epididymis having to deal with effective immune surveillance associated with strong immune tolerance is not limited to this territory. We have been very careful not to be too speculative and not to overuse our data. The discussion may seem a bit long, at least to one of the two reviewers, but the points that have been made cover the most recent bibliography, which we think should be the case in any discussion worthy of the name. In a final paragraph, we open the discussion to the hot topic of &quot;hybrid lymphatic vessels&quot; and develop the arguments that support the parallel we are making.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I find it misleading that the authors frame this study as a way to understand the immune context of the spermatozoa in the epididymis since there is no data on immune cells or immune responses.

The fact that this description is an important piece of the immune and inflammatory responses could be reserved for the second half of the introduction and/or the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect, we do not fully agree with the reviewer's comment. We believe that to understand the reasoning behind this particular study, one must fully embrace the systemic context of the male reproductive system and the outstanding issues. It is this overall picture that we believe should allow the reader to see how the work we present can help understand larger questions that remain not totally clear to date. Having done this in the first introductory paragraph, we then focus on the specific topic of the study being conducted. Therefore, if the editor does not object to this choice, we prefer that the abstract and the first paragraph of the introduction section remain unchanged. In partial response to the reviewer's request, and because it is true that we do not strictly present data on immune cells/molecules/responses (which we have done previously: Voisin et al., 2018; Voisin et al., 2020) in this manuscript, we have restricted the title of the manuscript to the epididymal vascular network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Graphical abstract: the differences between the different vessels and between the different stages of development are difficult to appreciate. Maybe the authors could just represent 2-3 stages and have blow-ups of the important differences?</p></disp-quote><p>By taking advantage of the increased format available for the graphical abstract when submitting revised documents, we have made better use of space without removing some of the developmental steps where we think something clearly changes. We also now provide enlarged inserts for each step that we hope will improve the perception of this graphical abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful for non-expert readers if the manuscript had a short introduction to the architecture of the lymphatic system and of the epididymis. For example, if the authors could define differences between collectors, nodes, and vessels, and explain the segmentation of the epididymis and the notion of septa, the manuscript would be more accessible to a broader audience.</p></disp-quote><p>As already mentioned above in response to the reviewer's recommendations, we now provide in the Introduction section more information on epididymal blood and lymphatic vessels (pages 3 and 4, lines 98-111). Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have also provided more information regarding the variety of existing lymphatic structures (pages 4, lines 115-117) and referring to a very recent and detailed review on this topic (Lampejo et al., 2023). In addition, similarly following the reviewer's suggestion, we also briefly but hopefully more clearly describe the segmented histology of the epididymis (page 3, lines 72 to 77), again referring the reader to the literature if more detail is needed (Tuner et al., 2003; Johnston et al., 2005).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2A: the diagram should be in the same orientation as the microscopy images.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected as suggested by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For figures 2B and C, the surface renderings are difficult to appreciate, it would be helpful to provide blowups on the S1 instead of coloring it white in the low mag image. This will allow the reader to see better details of the density and complexity of the networks.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer's recommendation, we have enlarged Figures 2B and 2C by isolating them in a separate figure (new Figure 3 in the revised version). In addition, the corresponding surface rendering graphs have been merged, hopefully making them more readable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The titles for Figures 2 and 3 are almost identical, what more information is presented in figure 3? This should be reflected in the figure title.</p></disp-quote><p>The new design of figures 2 and 3 eliminated the old redundancy. The titles of the figures have been modified accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2, 3, and 4 it would help to add merged images of all the stains with high mage insets to better appreciate the amount of overlap and comparison between the markers, similar to what is shown in figure 3D.</p></disp-quote><p>In our opinion, the videos we provide as supplementary data meet this demand better than any non-dynamic image, allowing an accurate overlay of the different networks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was not able to interpret figure 7A. The slicers that are meant to represent the septa are barely visible, and should all be presented in the same orientation/position to better appreciate the differences between the stages. The mix of native data and surface renderings makes it really difficult to view the vessels in these images. The diagram in 7A (second row) does not look enough like the images to help make sense of what is shown and what the authors hypothesize. Vessel types should be colored differently, as it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between LYVE1+ LECP and VEGFR3+ LEC</p></disp-quote><p>The changes we have made to the figure should clarify this point. However, it is difficult to orient all slicers in the same way because we will lose information for some stages. With the higher magnification now proposed, the figure should be more readable. Similarly, the schematic has been modified to enlarge the LECPs allowing better distinction from each other. The color choices reproduce the 3D staining, with VEGFR3 in green and Lyve1 in cyan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion should recapitulate the major findings of the study and would benefit from being much more concise.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have tried to make the discussion more concise and better present our results at the beginning of this section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
