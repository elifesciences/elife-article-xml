(Ppant) prosthetic group provide a soluble scaffold for acyl chain synthesis and biochemically couple FASII activity to mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) assembly and Fe-S cluster biogenesis. In contrast, the mitochondrion of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria parasites lacks FASII enzymes yet curiously retains a divergent mACP lacking a Ppant group. We report that ligand-dependent knockdown of mACP is lethal to parasites, indicating an essential FASII-independent function. Decyl-ubiquinone rescues parasites temporarily from death, suggesting a dominant dysfunction of the mitochondrial ETC. Biochemical studies reveal that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> mACP binds and stabilizes the Isd11-Nfs1 complex required for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, despite lacking the Ppant group required for this association in other eukaryotes, and knockdown of parasite mACP causes loss of Nfs1 and the Rieske Fe-S protein in ETC complex III. This work reveals that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites have evolved to decouple mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis from FASII activity, and this adaptation is a shared metabolic feature of other apicomplexan pathogens, including <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Babesia</italic>. This discovery unveils an evolutionary driving force to retain interaction of mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis with ACP independent of its eponymous function in FASII.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>organelle adaptation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>acyl carrier protein</kwd><kwd>Fe-S cluster synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM089778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wohlschlegel</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54DK110858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1011969</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32099</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM122740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sepulveda</surname><given-names>Jaime</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD018210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sigala</surname><given-names>Paul A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Malaria parasites have simplified and adapted their mitochondrial metabolism to lack fatty acid synthesis but retain an unusual acyl carrier protein required for stability of the core iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria is an ancient scourge of humanity and remains a pressing global health challenge, especially in tropical Africa where hundreds of thousands of people die from malaria each year. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria parasites are single-celled eukaryotes that evolved under unique selective pressures with unusual metabolic adaptations compared to human cells and well-studied model organisms such as yeast. Understanding the unique biochemical pathways that specialize parasites for growth within human red blood cells will shed light on their evolutionary divergence from other eukaryotes and unveil new parasite-specific targets for development of novel antimalarial therapies.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> retains an essential mitochondrion required for biosynthesis of pyrimidines, acetyl-CoA, and Fe-S clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Painter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jhun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Dooren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oppenheim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gisselberg et al., 2013</xref>). Although the parasite mitochondrion also contains enzymes involved in the citric acid cycle and biosynthesis of ATP and heme, these pathways are dispensable for blood-stage parasites, which can scavenge host heme and obtain sufficient ATP from cytoplasmic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nagaraj et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sturm et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacRae et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to these pathways, most eukaryotes, including mammals and yeast, also contain a mitochondrial type II fatty acid biosynthesis (FASII) pathway that generates the octanoate precursor of the lipoic acid cofactor used by several mitochondrial dehydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hiltunen et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to human and yeast cells, FASII enzymes in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> have been lost by the mitochondrion and are retained instead by the apicoplast organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shears et al., 2015</xref>). Although critical lipoate-dependent enzymes are present in the parasite mitochondrion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jhun et al., 2018</xref>), prior work has shown that these enzymes utilize scavenged lipoate obtained from the red blood cell rather than de novo synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allary et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The acyl carrier protein (ACP) is a key component of FASII and contains a strictly conserved Ser residue modified by a 4-phosphopantetheine (Ppant) group whose terminal thiol tethers the nascent acyl chain during fatty acid initiation, modification, and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chan and Vogel, 2010</xref>). Consistent with FASII targeting to the apicoplast in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, this organelle features a well-studied ACP homolog (PF3D7_0208500, aACP) that retains canonical ACP features, including the conserved Ser modified by a 4-Ppant group required for FASII function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shears et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gallagher and Prigge, 2010</xref>).

We noted that recent genome-wide knock-out studies in <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic> both reported that this gene was refractory to disruption, suggesting an essential, FASII-independent function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gomes et al., 2015</xref>). We became interested to unravel what this essential function might be. Recent studies in yeast and human cells have identified an expanding network of mitochondrial ACP interactions beyond FASII that includes roles in respiratory chain assembly, Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and mitochondrial ribosomal translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van Vranken et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Van Vranken et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nowinski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Majmudar et al., 2019</xref>). However, in all cases these critical interactions in yeast and/or humans are linked to mitochondrial FASII function and the Ppant group of ACP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cory et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angerer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boniecki et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We localized mACP to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mitochondrion and set out to understand its FASII-independent function in this organelle. Using conditional knockdown and immunoprecipitation (IP) studies, we discovered that mACP is essential for parasite viability and plays a critical role in binding and stabilizing the Isd11-Nfs1 cysteine desulfurase complex required for mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Unlike mACP interactions in yeast and humans, <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mACP binds to Isd11 via a divergent molecular interface that does not involve a 4-Ppant group. This work unveils a new molecular paradigm for essential mACP function without a Ppant group, underscores the critical and conserved role of mACP in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis, and highlights a <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-specific adaptation suitable for exploration as a metabolic vulnerability for parasite-directed antimalarial therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondrial ACP is essential for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> despite loss of FASII in this organelle</title><p>The <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome encodes two ACP homologs that include the well-studied protein targeted to the apicoplast (aACP, PF3D7_0208500) and a second homolog annotated as a mitochondrial ACP (mACP, PF3D7_1208300).

On the basis of this colocalization, we conclude that mACP is indeed targeted to the parasite mitochondrion, as predicted. Full-length mACP-HA<sub>2</sub> has a predicted molecular mass ~21 kDa, but SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blot (WB) analysis of immunoprecipitated mACP-HA<sub>2</sub> indicated that this protein migrated with an apparent molecular mass ~15 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This lower size suggested that mACP was likely to be post-translationally processed upon mitochondrial import, which would be consistent with known processing of mitochondrial ACP in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">VÃ¶gtle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vaca Jacome et al., 2015</xref>).

Inhibition of ETC function kills parasites due to defective ubiquinone recycling but does not substantially depolarize mitochondria due to activity by this second, proguanil-sensitive pathway. However, ETC dysfunction plus proguanil treatment blocks both pathways for proton pumping and causes mitochondrial depolarization, which can be visualized by a failure to concentrate charged dyes like MitoTracker within the mitochondrion that leads to dispersed dye accumulation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Painter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ke et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>If mACP knockdown and subsequent loss of Rieske caused general ETC failure, we predicted that parasite treatment with sublethal proguanil would negate the ability of dQ to rescue parasite growth from mACP knockdown in the third cycle and would cause mitochondrial depolarization.

Cytoplasmic Fe-S cluster metabolism in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is sparsely studied, and its functional dependence on mitochondrial ISC proteins remains a key frontier to further test and understand.</p><p>In human cells, recent work has identified an LYR-motif protein (L0R8F8/MIEF1) that mediates interaction between mACP and mitochondrial ribosomes, suggesting a role for mACP in regulating mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rathore et al., 2018</xref>). Malaria parasites lack a homolog of L0R8F8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and multiple experimental observations strongly suggest that <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mACP does not regulate mitochondrial translation. Prior work in yeast reported that loss of mitochondrial genome expression strongly reduces the stability of cyt <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>, due to loss of mitochondria-encoded cyt <italic>b</italic> and destabilization of ETC complex III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zara et al., 2004</xref>). Parasite cyt <italic>b</italic> is also encoded on the mitochondrial genome. However, we observed that loss of mACP does not diminish the stability of parasite cyt <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). It was also recently shown that mitoribosome dysfunction in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> results in mitochondrial depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ke et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to this phenotype, we observed that parasites retained their mitochondrial transmembrane potential upon mACP knockdown in -aTc conditions alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that mACP function does not regulate mitochondrial translation in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Nevertheless, mACP may have additional functional interactions beyond the Isd11-Nfs1 complex that also contribute to its essentiality in parasites. Such interactions, however, will diverge from known interactions in yeast and humans that involve conserved LYR-motif proteins, and we have on-going studies to fully understand the functional interactome of mACP in the parasite mitochondrion.</p><p>The mitochondrial ETC is essential for malaria parasite viability in all lifecycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delves et al., 2012</xref>). The unique molecular features of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mACP and its interaction with Isd11 that underpin essential functions of the ETC and broader Fe-S cluster utilization suggest the possibility of targeting this complex for antimalarial therapy. We have ongoing structural and biochemical studies to assess if parasite Isd11 retains a vestigial acyl-pantetheine binding pocket and to test if parasite-specific features of the mACP-Isd11 interaction can be selectively disrupted via small-molecule inhibitors that mimic the acyl-pantetheine group and/or broader hydrophobic features of this protein-protein interface that are distinct from the human complex. On the basis of molecular conservation in other apicomplexan parasites, such inhibitors would likely function against other human pathogens such as <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and <italic>Babesia</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dd2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1970614/">1970614</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BEI ResourcesMRA-156</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dd2 mACP-HA-FLAG 10X Aptamer/TetR-DOZI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Made for this study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Described in Materials and methods.

For SDS-PAGE analysis of whole parasite extracts, 1Ã sample buffer containing beta-mercaptoethanol was added to parasite samples before heating at 95Â°C for 10 min and centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Fractionated proteins were transferred from polyacrylamide gel to nitrocellulose membrane at 100 V for 1 hr using the Bio-Rad wet-transfer system. Membranes were blocked in 1% casein/PBS for 1 hr at room temperature and then probed with primary antibody overnight at 4Â°C and secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hr. Samples containing HA-tagged proteins were probed with a 1:1000 dilution of Roche rat anti-HA monoclonal 3F10 primary (Sigma 11867423001) and a 1:5000 dilution of donkey anti-rat DyLight800 (Invitrogen Life Technologies SA5-10032).

The relative signal intensities (protein of interest/loading control) from 2 to 3 replicate experiments were used to calculate a mean Â± SEM and normalized to +aTc conditions for each protein. Differences in normalized signal intensities Â±aTc were analyzed by two-tailed unpaired t-test in GraphPad Prism 9.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mass spectrometry of parasite IP samples</title><p>For identification of mACP-interacting proteins in IP experiments, protein samples were reduced and alkylated using 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine and 10 mM iodoacetamide, respectively, and then enzymatically digested by sequential addition of trypsin and lys-C proteases, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Florens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wohlschlegel, 2009</xref>). The digested peptides were desalted using Pierce C18 tips (Thermo Fisher Scientific), dried, and resuspended in 5% formic acid. Approximately 1 Î¼g of digested peptides was loaded onto a 25-cm-long, 75 Î¼m inner diameter fused silica capillary packed in-house with bulk C18 reversed phase resin (1.9 Î¼m, 100 A pores, Dr. Maisch GmbH). The 140 min water-acetonitrile gradient was delivered using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 ultra high-performance liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 200 nL/min (Buffer A: water with 3% DMSO and 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B: acetonitrile with 3% DMSO and 0.1% formic acid). Eluted peptides were ionized by the application of distal 2.2 kV and introduced into the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. Data was acquired using a Data-Dependent Acquisition method consisting of a full MS1 scan (resolution = 120,000) followed by sequential MS2 scans (resolution = 15,000) to utilize the remainder of the 3 s cycle time. Data analysis was accomplished using the Integrated Proteomics Pipeline 2 (Integrated Proteomics Applications, San Diego, CA). Data was searched against the protein database from <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 downloaded from UniprotKB (10,826 entries) in October 2013. Tandem MS spectra searched using the ProLuCID algorithm followed by filtering of peptide-to-spectrum matches by DTASelect using a decoy database-estimated false discovery rate of &lt;1%.</p><p>To analyze specific enrichment of Nfs1 in the mACP-HA<sub>2</sub> IP versus aACP-HA<sub>2</sub> IP for each matched experiment, the spectral counts observed for each protein in the mACP IP were divided by the spectral counts observed for the same protein in the aACP IP. For purposes of this analysis, all zero values for spectral counts were arbitrarily converted to a 1. The log<sub>2</sub> value of the mACP/aACP spectral count ratio for each protein was plotted for each of the three matched experiments.

Proteins were reduced with DTT for 45 min at 60Â°C and then alkylated with iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. Proteins were digested overnight at 38Â°C with Trypsin/LysC mixture using 1 Âµg of trypsin per sample and quenched by acidification with 1% formic acid to a pH of 2â3. Reversed-phase nano-LC/MS/MS was performed on an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Dionex) coupled to a ThermoScientific QExactive-HF mass spectrometer equipped with a nanoelectrospray source. Concentrated samples were diluted with a 1:1 ratio of sample:0.1% formic acid in water. 5 ÂµL of the samples were injected onto the liquid chromatograph. A gradient of reversed-phase buffers (Buffer A: 0.2% formic acid in water; Buffer B: 0.2% formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 150 ÂµL/min at 60Â°C was setup. The LC run lasted for 83 min with a starting concentration of 5% buffer B increasing to 55% over the initial 53 min and a further increase in concentration to 95% over 63 min. A 40-cm long/100 Âµm inner diameter nanocolumn was employed for chromatographic separation. The column is a reverse-phase BEH C18 3.0 Âµm nanocolumn. MS/MS data was acquired using an auto-MS/MS method selecting the most abundant precursor ions for fragmentation. The mass-to-charge range was set to 350â1800. Mascot generic format (MGF) files were generated from the raw MS/MS data. Mascot (version 2.6) uses the MGF file for database searching and protein identification. For these samples, the Custom database was searched with the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> taxonomy selected. The parameters used for the Mascot searches were trypsin digest; two missed cleavages; carbamidomethylation of cysteine set as fixed modification; oxidation of methionine and acetylation of the n-terminus were set as variable modifications; and the maximum allowed mass deviation was set at 11 ppm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Sequence homology searches</title><p>Sequence similarity searches of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genome for protein homologs of known LYR proteins from yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angerer, 2015</xref>) were performed by BLASTP analysis as implemented at the Plasmodium Genomics Resource webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.plasmodb.org">https://www.plasmodb.org</ext-link>, release 48).

The bacteria were grown at 37Â°C in 20 mL LB media in the presence of ampicillin (100 Âµg/mL) or kanamycin (50 Âµg/mL). Bacterial cultures were allowed to grow to an optical density (at 600 nm) of 0.4â0.6 before inducing protein expression with isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (Goldbio 367931) at a final concentration of 1 mM.

In contrast to the situation in other eukaryotes, mACP is not involved in fatty acid biosynthesis but is primarily involved in stabilizing proteins involved in mitochondrial Fe-S complex formation. The findings suggest that ACP acquired a role in Fe-S complex formation early in eukaryotic evolution and highlights additional components of the Plasmodium respiratory chain that are important for viability.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Divergent Acyl Carrier Protein Decouples Mitochondrial Fe-S Cluster Biogenesis from Fatty Acid Synthesis in Malaria Parasites&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Dr. Prigge sent us his expression plasmid, which we transfected into our mACP-HA<sub>2</sub> Dd2 line and used for co-IP experiments. We independently confirmed that Isd11-GFP co-localized with MitoTracker Red in the Dd2 line used for our co-IP experiments. We have added this colocalization data as Figure 2âfigure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The possibility that mACP may be involved in regulating Fe-S synthesis via other mechanisms (such as by regulating mitochondrial protein translation) should be considered and discussed in both the results and Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Results and Discussion sections to incorporate the perspectives below and acknowledge that mACP may have additional functions and interactions in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> mitochondrion beyond the Isd11-Nfs1 complex.</p><p>Extensive prior studies of mitochondrial ACP in yeast and human cells indicate that mACP function in these organisms (outside of FASII) is mediated by key interactions with LYR motif-containing proteins. Key mACP functions in other eukaryotes are therefore predicted to be mediated by conserved LYR-motif proteins. Our BLAST analysis of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> proteome identified Isdll as the only LYR-motif protein homolog retained by malaria parasites, strongly suggesting that mACP may have an unusually narrow interactome and thus function in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> relative to yeast and humans. Retention of a conserved interaction between mACP and the Isd11-Nfs1 complex in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is consistent with the ancient, essential role for Fe-S cluster biogenesis in mitochondria. Indeed, Fe-S cluster biogenesis is arguably the most fundamental function of mitochondria and is retained by eukaryotes that have lost most other mitochondrial functions but retain a vestigial mitosome to support Fe-S cluster synthesis. We fully discuss these concepts in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>Nevertheless, we acknowledge that mACP may have other functionally relevant interactions in the parasite mitochondrion beyond the Isd11-Nfs1 complex. Such interactions, however, will be divergent (relative to yeast/humans) as they will not involve conserved LYR-motif protein homologs (since Isd11 is the only such parasite homolog we were able to identify). This divergence will make such interactions more challenging to uncover. We have on-going studies to better understand possible roles for mACP in other essential mitochondrial functions (e.g., maturation of the Rieske protein) beyond interaction with Isd11-Nfs1. Nevertheless, we emphasize that the essential role for mACP in stabilizing the Isd11-Nfs1 complex identified in our study is sufficient to explain the observed phenotypes we report in our manuscript and thus account for retention of mACP despite loss of mitochondrial FASII.</p><p>With respect to mitochondrial translation, multiple observations strongly suggest that mACP knock-down in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> does not substantially impact translation of the mitochondrial genome:</p><p>1. In human cells, mACP was observed to bind a novel LYR-motif protein L0R8F8 that associates with mitochondrial ribosomes and has been proposed to mediate ribosome assembly (references 23 and 63). The functional consequence of this mACP-mito ribosome interaction and its dependence on mACP acylation remain incompletely understood. This interaction does not appear to be generally conserved in all eukaryotes, as yeast do not express a homolog of L0R8F8. We also failed to identify a L0R8F8 homolog in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, suggesting that parasites lack this interaction between mACP and mito ribosomes.</p><p>2. Mitochondrial translation remains poorly studied in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, due in part to a paucity of validated antibodies that can detect mitochondrial-encoded proteins. Nevertheless, recent work from Dr. Hangjun Keâs lab (which we cite in ref. 47) reported that knockdown of a mito ribosome protein in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (expected to lead to defective mitochondrial translation) resulted in mitochondrial depolarization. In contrast to Dr. Keâs observation, mACP knockdown alone in our study did not result mitochondrial depolarization (Figure 5). These contrasting phenotypes suggest that loss of mACP does not substantially impact mitochondrial translation in parasites.</p><p>3. Prior work in yeast (reference 64) has shown that loss of mitochondrial translation results in a substantial ~70% reduction in cyt c<sub>1</sub>, presumably due to loss of cyt <italic>b</italic> expression and destabilization of complex III, of which cyt c<sub>1</sub> is a core component. In our revised Figure 4, we now show that loss of mACP expression in parasites does not diminish cyt c<sub>1</sub> levels. These contrasting phenotypes strongly suggest that mACP knockdown in parasites does not impact mitochondrial translation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Key experiments to address the major weaknesses:</p><p>Firm-up the data about Nsf1 and Rieske instability with independent repetitions, statistical analysis of signal reduction and an appropriate control for other mitochondrial proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided biological replicates and signal quantitation and show that levels of mitochondrial Hsp60 and cyt c<sub>1</sub> are unaffected by mACP knockdown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further characterisation of the mutant to provide support for specificity of the defect â according to the hypothesis, functions of mitochondrial protein import, division and translation would presumably show defect after mETC defect is observed.</p></disp-quote><p>The data strongly supports our conclusion that mACP knockdown specifically destabilizes Nfs1 and Rieske but not other mitochondrial proteins such as Hsp60 or cyt <italic>c<sub>1</sub></italic>.

For the same reason, a negative control for the reciprocal co-IP with aACP (which provided nice support for the specific interaction with the other Fe-S synthesis component, NSf1) would provide further support for the existence of a mitochondrial specific complex between the three.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revision #2 above. Mitochondrial localization for Isd11-GFP has previously been published. Our IP-MS data in Figure 2 strongly address the second point and indicate that mACP but not aACP co-IPs with Nfs1. We have added bacterial co-IP data that also show that mACP (Figure 2) but not aACP (Figure 2âfigure supplement 5) co-IPs with Isd11 when these proteins are co-expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This specificity is consistent with our discussion of the adaptive sequence features of parasite Isd11 that loss of Arg6 favors association of Isd11 with the divergent mACP that lacks a Ppant and disfavors association with aACP that retains a Ppant. These features are discussed in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nsf1-mACP-Isd11 interaction and Rieske stability: A native gel and western might help in providing support for complex assembly between mACP-Nsf1-Isd11, and its dissociation in the mutant.

A full analysis of the IP/MS data for mACP and aACP is beyond the scope of the present manuscript and will be the subject of two separate manuscripts (currently in preparation) that broadly explore the interactomes of mACP and aACP. We plan to publish the full data sets with these manuscripts.</p><p>Figure 2E is the key data that establishes lack of interaction of parasite Isd11 with <italic>E. coli</italic> ACP. This figure is a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel of Ni-NTA pulldown of Isd11 from <italic>E. coli</italic> when co-expressed with parasite mACP. Bacterial ACP has a molecular weight of 9 kDa that is distinct from Isd11 and mACP. The lack of a band for <italic>E. coli</italic> ACP at 9 kDA argues against its association of Isd11. Lack of association of parasite Isd11 with bacterial ACP is consistent with sequence features that suggest that the R6I sequence change in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> Isd11 disfavors association with canonical ACP homologs like <italic>E. coli</italic> ACP that retain a Ppant group (discussed in the Results section). We also subjected the Ni-NTA eluates of Isd11 pulldown to tryptic digest and tandem mass spectrometry. As reported, we did not detect any peptides for bacterial ACP. We are unsure what additional controls the reviewer has in mind. We have further studies in progress to more deeply understand the molecular determinants of ACP-binding specificity by parasite Isd11.</p><p>We have added the additional details below to the methods and a supplementary figure to describe our BLAST analysis that only identified divergent mACP homologs in other <italic>Apicomplexa</italic> organisms and in <italic>Vitrella</italic>:</p><p>âTo identify divergent ACP homologs in other organisms that also lacked the conserved Ser, the amino acid sequence for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> mACP starting with Leu51 was submitted as query to NCBI BLASTP (e-value threshold of 0.05).

The table is included as a supplement to Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper uses three letter amino acid abbreviations in the text but single letter amino acid abbreviations in the figures. Consider a consistent system across both.</p></disp-quote><p>We use single amino acid abbreviations in figures to minimize use of space. In the text, we use three letter abbreviations when referring to a single amino acid (e.g. Ser) but use single letter abbreviations to refer to series of amino acids (e.g., LYR motif). In our view, this usage optimizes clarity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
