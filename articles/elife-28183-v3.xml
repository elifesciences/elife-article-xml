Other TGF-beta-related signals, such as Vg1/Dvr1/Gdf3, have also been implicated in this process but their roles have been unclear or controversial. Here we report that zebrafish embryos without maternally provided <italic>vg1</italic> fail to form endoderm and head and trunk mesoderm, and closely resemble <italic>nodal</italic> loss-of-function mutants. Although Nodal is processed and secreted without Vg1, it requires Vg1 for its endogenous activity. Conversely, Vg1 is unprocessed and resides in the endoplasmic reticulum without Nodal, and is only secreted, processed and active in the presence of Nodal. Co-expression of Nodal and Vg1 results in heterodimer formation and mesendoderm induction. Thus, mesendoderm induction relies on the combination of two TGF-beta-related signals: maternal and ubiquitous Vg1, and zygotic and localized Nodal. Modeling reveals that the pool of maternal Vg1 enables rapid signaling at low concentrations of zygotic Nodal.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28183.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>All animals begin life as just one cell – a fertilized egg. In order to make a recognizable adult, each embryo needs to make the three types of tissue that will eventually form all of the organs: endoderm, which will form the internal organs; mesoderm, which will form the muscle and bones; and ectoderm, which will generate the skin and nervous system.</p><p>All vertebrates – animals with backbones like fish and humans – use the so-called Nodal signaling pathway to make the endoderm and mesoderm. Nodal is a signaling molecule that binds to receptors on the surface of cells. If Nodal binds to a receptor on a cell, it instructs that cell to become endoderm or mesoderm. As such, Nodal is critical for vertebrate life. However, there has been a 30-year debate in the field of developmental biology about whether a protein called Vg1, which has a similar molecular structure as Nodal, plays a role in the early development of vertebrates.</p><p>Zebrafish are often used to study animal development, and Montague and Schier decided to test whether these fish need the gene for Vg1 (also known as Gdf3) by deleting it using a genome editing technique called CRISPR/Cas9. It turns out that female zebrafish can survive without this gene. Yet, when the offspring of these females do not inherit the instructions to make Vg1 from their mothers, they fail to form the endoderm and mesoderm. This means that the embryos do not have hearts, blood or other internal organs, and they die within three days. Two other groups of researchers have independently reported similar results.</p><p>The findings reveal that Vg1 is critical for the Nodal signaling pathway to work in zebrafish. Montague and Schier then showed that, in this pathway, Nodal does not activate its receptors on its own. Instead, Nodal must interact with Vg1, and it is this Nodal-Vg1 complex that activates receptors, and instructs cells to become endoderm and mesoderm.</p><p>Scientists currently use the Nodal signaling pathway to induce human embryonic stem cells growing in the laboratory to become mesoderm and endoderm. As such, these new findings could ultimately help researchers to grow tissues and organs for human patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TGF-beta</kwd><kwd>Nodal signaling</kwd><kwd>heterodimer</kwd><kwd>Vg1</kwd><kwd>Mesoderm</kwd><kwd>endoderm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM056211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schier</surname><given-names>Alexander F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000850</institution-id><institution>American Society for Engineering Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montague</surname><given-names>Tessa Grace</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Nodal is assumed to be the sole inducer of mesendoderm, but the related signal Vg1 is as essential as Nodal in this process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The induction of mesoderm and endoderm (mesendoderm) during embryogenesis and embryonic stem cell differentiation generates the precursors of the heart, liver, gut, pancreas, kidney and other internal organs.

Following its role in mesendoderm induction, Nodal activity also patterns the left-right axis.

Members of the Vg1/GDF1/GDF3 TGF-beta subfamily have been assigned various roles in these processes, although there are puzzling contradictions from the level of gene expression to the loss-of-function and gain-of-function phenotypes. The role of GDF1 in left-right patterning is well established. <italic>Gdf1</italic> mutant mice exhibit left-right asymmetry defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>) and morpholino studies indicate that zebrafish <italic>vg1</italic> (<italic>dvr1</italic>/<italic>gdf3</italic>) is required for left-right patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>). GDF1/Vg1 alone is unable to activate the Nodal signaling pathway, but it increases the activity and range of mouse and zebrafish Nodal ligands in <italic>Xenopus</italic> assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>) and the activity of mouse Nodal in tissue culture cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fuerer et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, Nodal and Vg1/GDF1 family members cooperate to pattern the left-right axis.</p><p>The role of the Vg1/GDF1/GDF3 TGF-beta subfamily in mesendoderm formation is less clear. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> – where Vg1 was first discovered – <italic>vg1</italic> mRNA is localized to a vegetal crescent in the oocyte and in the vegetal hemisphere of the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rebagliati et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Weeks and Melton, 1987</xref>). By contrast, zebrafish <italic>vg1</italic> mRNA is localized to the animal pole of late stage oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marlow and Mullins, 2008</xref>), and it is present ubiquitously in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dohrmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Helde and Grunwald, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>Gdf1</italic> and <italic>Gdf3</italic>, which are considered to be the mammalian Vg1 orthologs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wall et al., 2000</xref>), are expressed in the 16-cell morula (<italic>Gdf3</italic>) and epiblast prior to gastrulation (<italic>Gdf3 and Gdf1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wall et al., 2000</xref>). Some <italic>Gdf3</italic> mutants lack a subset of endodermal and mesodermal markers, while others grow to fertile adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>); conversely <italic>Gdf1</italic> mutants only exhibit left-right asymmetry defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>). Some <italic>Gdf1;Gdf3</italic> double mutants exhibit more severe defects in endoderm and mesoderm formation than <italic>Gdf3</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>), and <italic>Gdf1-/-;Nodal+/-</italic>mutants resemble hypomorphic <italic>nodal</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lowe et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting some synergy between GDF1 and Nodal functions. Experiments in the chick and mouse indicate that Vg1/GDF1/GDF3 may act upstream of Nodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rankin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shah et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Skromne and Stern, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, these analyses suggest that mouse Nodal, GDF1 and GDF3 may cooperate during early amniote development, but their regulatory and molecular relationships have remained unclear. Morphant studies in zebrafish suggest a function for Vg1 in left-right axis formation but not in mesendoderm induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>). Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of <italic>Xenopus vg1</italic> leads to defects in dorsal mesoderm induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birsoy et al., 2006</xref>), but most mesendodermal derivatives still form. Taken together, loss-of-function studies establish crucial roles for both Nodal and Vg1/GDF1 in left-right development and for Nodal in mesendoderm induction, but the roles of GDF1/GDF3/Vg1 in mesendoderm induction remain poorly understood.</p><p>Another puzzling aspect of Vg1’s function is its apparent inability to be processed and secreted. This is in stark contrast to other members of the TGF-beta superfamily, which are generated as pro-proteins that dimerize and are cleaved to generate a secreted, mature dimer that binds receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Constam, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dutko and Mullins, 2011</xref>). Neither cleavage nor secretion of Vg1 has been detected in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish, and correspondingly, overexpression does not yield a phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dale et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dale et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dohrmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Tannahill and Melton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen and Melton, 1993</xref>). Conflicting results have been reported for GDF1 processing in heterologous systems, ranging from cleavage but inactivity in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>) to no detectable cleavage in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wall et al., 2000</xref>). Mouse Nodal-GDF1 heterodimers, but not zebrafish Nodal-Vg1 heterodimers, have been detected in a heterologous <italic>Xenopus</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>). Upon fusion of the Vg1, GDF1 or GDF3 mature domain to the Activin or BMP prodomain, Vg1 is processed and induces mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dale et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dohrmann et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kessler and Melton, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Thomsen and Melton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wall et al., 2000</xref>). However, it is unclear if these constructs reveal the true nature of Vg1, or whether the fused prodomains generate ectopic functions. Thus, it remains to be resolved how Vg1 processing, secretion, dimerization and activity are regulated.</p><p>In this study we address the long-standing question of Vg1’s role in vertebrate mesendoderm induction and its relationship to Nodal, using zebrafish as a model system. Current models of zebrafish mesendoderm induction have focused entirely on the roles of the two zebrafish Nodal genes, <italic>cyclops</italic> (<italic>cyc</italic>) and <italic>squint</italic> (<italic>sqt</italic>), with no consideration of <italic>vg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodenstine et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cartwright et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chea et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Constam, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hirokawa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Juan and Hamada, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liang and Rubinstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Papanayotou and Collignon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pauklin and Vallier, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Quail et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Robertson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schier and Shen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Shen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Signore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Strizzi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tian and Meng, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang and Tsang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Whitman, 2001</xref>). <italic>cyc</italic> and <italic>sqt</italic> are zygotically-expressed at the embryonic margin and act as concentration-dependent inducers of mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Schier, 2009</xref>). <italic>cyc;sqt</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Feldman et al., 1998</xref>) and other zebrafish Nodal signaling mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dubrulle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gritsman et al., 1999</xref>) fail to form endoderm and head and trunk mesoderm.

Contrary to these models, we now report that <italic>vg1</italic> is absolutely essential for mesendoderm induction. Vg1 is only secreted, processed and active in the presence of Nodal, while Nodal requires Vg1 for activity.

We developed a basic kinetic model to test the rate of Nodal homodimer formation versus Nodal-Vg1 heterodimer formation in the presence of a maternal Vg1 pool. Simulating these two conditions revealed that the preloading of inactive Vg1 monomers in the cell allows Nodal to immediately form heterodimers whereas dimer formation is delayed when Nodal must form homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, Vg1-Nodal heterodimers can initiate signaling more quickly than Nodal homodimers, and already at low Nodal levels. Even if Nodal homodimers were as active as Vg1-Nodal heterodimers, Nodal target gene induction would still be slower in the absence of maternal Vg1, because the association of two Nodal monomers is less likely at low Nodal concentrations than Vg1-Nodal dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

A closer comparison to <italic>Nodal</italic> mutants might reveal functions of GDF1 and GDF3 that are equivalent to Vg1.

This idea is not only supported by the co-dependence of Nodal and Vg1 in zebrafish mesendoderm induction reported here, but also the observation that Nodal expression coincides with the expression of Vg1 family members in numerous contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agius et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Levin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Onai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Range and Lepage, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Range et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Seleiro et al., 1996</xref>).

Our study explains these conundrums by revealing that Vg1 is only processed, secreted and active in the presence of Nodal. Without Nodal, Vg1 is unprocessed and predominantly resides in the ER. Upon overexpression, Vg1 contributes to this inert pool, and only fusion to heterologous prodomains allows secretion, cleavage and activation in the absence of Nodal. Thus, the dependence of Vg1 processing, secretion and activity on Nodal accounts for many of the previously confusing observations. One conundrum remains: we and others have not been able to detect the processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) or secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) of Vg1 at endogenous levels of Nodal. We speculate that endogenous Nodal is expressed at very low levels and in few cells, resulting in cleavage and secretion of only a small (and undetectable) fraction of the total pool of Vg1. Only upon ectopic Nodal expression, sufficiently high levels of Vg1 are processed to become detectable. The development of more sensitive detection methods is needed to directly demonstrate the cleavage, processing and secretion of endogenous Vg1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Vg1 and Nodal form heterodimers</title><p>Our study reveals that Nodal and Vg1 form heterodimers, and that Vg1 exists in a monomeric state prior to heterodimerization with Nodal.

For example, it is unclear whether pre-existing Vg1 might associate with other ER-resident proteins to maintain or prepare it in a state that allows dimerization with newly synthesized Nodal.</p><p>Our results suggest that Nodal-Vg1 heterodimers are more potent than Nodal alone: in the case of Cyc, such heterodimers seem to be required for Cyc to activate signaling, whereas Sqt-Vg1 heterodimers appear to be more active than Sqt alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E and F</xref>). The molecular basis of the increased activity is unknown, but based on previous studies in the BMP system, heterodimers might be necessary to assemble heteromeric combinations of two types of class I or II receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Little and Mullins, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our results also extend and generalize the previous observation that mouse GDF1 and Nodal form heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fuerer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>), although those studies did not address the requirement, localization, or processing of Vg1/GDF1/GDF3 during mesendoderm formation, and instead proposed that heterodimer formation might increase the potency and/or range of Nodal. Our results uncover the alternative or additional mechanism that heterodimer formation triggers processing and secretion of Vg1 and allows Nodal to be active at physiological concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>vg1</italic> mRNA and protein do not need to be localized in the embryo</title><p>Our results demonstrate a novel mode to restrict TGF-beta-related protein activity through heterodimer formation. <italic>vg1</italic> mRNA and protein do not need to be localized in the embryo to restrict Vg1 activity: instead, it is the absence of Nodal that blocks Vg1 processing, secretion and activity. Indeed, zebrafish Vg1 is present ubiquitously in early embryos and <italic>vg1</italic> is expressed in broader domains than Nodal in all systems analyzed. The question therefore arises whether the exquisite vegetal localization of <italic>Xenopus vg1</italic> is important for development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Weeks and Melton, 1987</xref>). The localized activation of <italic>Xenopus</italic> Nodal genes might be sufficient to restrict mesendoderm formation to vegetal and marginal regions, but it is also possible that localized Vg1 provides an additional safeguard to spatially restrict pathway activation. Rescue experiments similar to those reported here could address this question.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Vg1 can enable rapid response to low concentrations of Nodal</title><p>Modeling of hetero- and homodimerization kinetics reveals that the maternal pool of Vg1 accelerates the onset of ligand dimerization relative to a system that relies on Nodal-Nodal dimerization alone. This could be advantageous in the embryo, where mesendoderm induction cannot initiate until after the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Although it may be counterintuitive for a spatially localized signal to rely on a ubiquitous signal for pathway activation, the preloading of Vg1 in the ER could be instrumental for ensuring Nodal signaling initiates in a rapid and temporally reliable manner. Thus, the requirement for Vg1 in the zebrafish embryo can ensure rapid and sensitive response to the low concentrations of Nodal that initiate mesendoderm induction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The finding that Vg1 – together with Nodal – is an endogenous mesoderm inducer resolves some of the historical controversies in the field. Vg1 was described in 1987 as a TGF-beta-related signal present at the right time and place to be a mesoderm inducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Weeks and Melton, 1987</xref>), but the lack of a functional requirement raised doubts about its importance.

Our study indicates instead that Nodal-Vg1 heterodimers are the essential endogenous inducers of mesendoderm, while Activin serves as a powerful reagent to induce mesendoderm from embryonic stem cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of <italic>vg1</italic></title><p>sgRNAs targeting the <italic>vg1/dvr1/gdf3</italic> gene were designed using CHOPCHOP (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/scicrunch/data/source/nlx_144509-1/search?q=SCR_015723">SCR_015723</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Labun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montague et al., 2014</xref>) and synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gagnon et al., 2014</xref>) (See also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>vg1</italic> sgRNAs were co-injected with ~0.5 nL of 50 μM Cas9 protein into TLAB wild-type embryos.

The concentration of dimer (either Vg1-Nodal heterodimer or Nodal-Nodal homodimer) was plotted.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Parameter</th><th valign="top">Description</th><th valign="top">Value</th><th valign="top">Units</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td><td valign="top">Nodal synthesis rate</td><td valign="top">0, t &lt; 4 hr, t &gt; 6 hr <break/>2 × 10<sup>−13</sup>, 4 hr &lt; t &lt; 6 hr <break/>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Müller et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top">M s<sup>−1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td><td valign="top">Nodal degradation rate</td><td valign="top">1.16 × 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Müller et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top">s<sup>−1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf10"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td><td valign="top">Vg1 degradation rate</td><td valign="top">1.16 × 10<sup>−4</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Müller et al., 2012</xref>)</td><td valign="top">s<sup>−1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td><td valign="top">Dimerization rate</td><td valign="top">1 × 10<sup>6</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gerstle and Fried, 1993</xref>; <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kohler and Schepartz, 2001</xref>; <break/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Northrup and Erickson, 1992</xref>)</td><td valign="top">M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><p><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>V</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula></p></td><td valign="top">Vg1 initial concentration</td><td valign="top">100</td><td valign="top">nM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Nate Lord, Jeff Farrell and Constance Richter for helpful comments on the manuscript, Nate Lord for modeling, Toby Montague for graphics advice, Fred Rubino for immunoblot advice and Andrea Pauli for mentorship.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Vg1-Nodal heterodimers are the endogenous inducers of mesendoderm&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lilianna Solnica-Krezel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) In revising the manuscript, further experiments are necessary to clarify some basic issues about the model. For example, why Vg1 remains as monomers and thus available to dimerize with Nodal. The suggested experiment is to perform additional WB under-non reducing conditions to test this. It would also be advisable to experimentally clarify where exactly in the cell heterodimerization is occurring. Additionally two of the reviewers raise the issue as to why heterodimers are required to mediate nodal signaling versus homodimers? It would be important to show a direct interaction between these heterodimers and the nodal receptor complexes. An alternative approach would be to over-express different relative amounts of Vg1 and Nodal in Vg1 mutants and use Phospho-Smad2 activity as a read-out (as suggested by reviewer 2).</p><p>2) Two of the reviewers raise concerns with the Vg1 mutant rescue by YSL injection of Vg1. In particular reviewer 3 requests that the experiment be repeated using lineage tracing to show that the injection is confined to the YSL, ideally with the inclusion of Smad2 staining as further verification.</p><p>Typically, when requesting revisions, <italic>eLife</italic> decision letters only include a summary of the major concerns discussed by the editors and the referees, but we considered that the authors would benefit from receiving the full reviews verbatim in this occasion so that they can attend to as many of the points raised as possible, and also see that the reviewers were uniformly very positive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a very important paper to the field showing that Vg1-Nodal heterodimers are essential to induce mesendoderm in zebrafish and likely more broadly in vertebrates. Vg1 has a long history in the field, but its endogenous function has been previously untested in a rigorous manner. This paper by Montague and Schier shows convincingly that Vg1 can only be processed and secreted when it heterodimerizes with Nodal, and that Nodal homodimers do not function in the absence of Vg1, unless highly overexpressed (Sqt only). Strong evidence has previously implicated Gdf-Nodal heterodimers in left-right patterning, so it is likely that Nodal-Vg1 heterodimers function exclusively in signaling. The results are all convincing but some points need addressing to improve the manuscript.</p><p>The kinetic model assumes that Vg1 would remain as monomers ready to heterodimerize with Nodal, which is a major assumption of the model and should be mentioned. Vg1 alone would be expected to homodimerize if Nodal is not present. Do the authors have evidence for Vg1 remaining as a monomer in the absence of Nodal? Non-reducing Western blot conditions could provide evidence for this.</p><p>The authors should also provide more information on where dimerization is known to occur (Golgi?) and how it is regulated to provide more plausibility to the model? The authors have stated that unprocessed Vg1 resides in the ER but haven't provided evidence to support this. They should either provide data to support this ER retention or soften their statements throughout.</p><p>The starting level of Vg1 in the model at 4 hpf is assumed to be 1000 nM, which is extremely high, especially considering that the mRNA is at very low levels at this point, although protein could be higher but are unknown. Provide modeling results when Vg1 monomers are at 500 nm or a more reasonable level of 50 or 100 nm.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could comment on why Vg1-Nodal heterodimers are required for signaling. Readers will want to know possible functions for a heterodimer that the Nodal homodimer cannot provide or at least comment that it is unclear at this point. Perhaps I missed this in the paper.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors commented further on the rescue of Mvg1 mutants by YSL injection of <italic>vg1</italic> mRNA at the 1000-cell stage, a stage after zygotic transcription has initiated. This suggests that a large maternal pool of unprocessed Vg1 is not essential for Nodal-Vg1 heterodimer formation and function in mesendoderm induction. Additionally comment on the sufficiency of Nodal-Vg1 production in the YSL, which may have been previously performed with Nodal. Is the zygotic marginal domain of <italic>sqt/cyc</italic> RNA expression not essential then in these conditions?</p><p>Additionally, Vg1 is localized during oogenesis both in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (vegetal pole) and at animal pole in zebrafish. Since the vegetal localization in <italic>Xenopus</italic> is mentioned and discussed multiple times, the animal localization of <italic>vg1</italic> RNA during oogenesis is worth noting to readers as well. Typically one reason these RNAs are localized during oogenesis is to translationally repress them, which is also worth mentioning, since the authors discuss reasons for localization in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Montague and Schier describe the role of Vg1 in mediating Nodal signaling during zebrafish gastrulation. They show that a Vg1 mutant phenocopies Nodal signaling defective mutants, such as the <italic>oep</italic> and the <italic>cyc/squint</italic> double mutants, pointing to the possibility that Vg1 is necessary for Nodal signaling during gastrulation. They also show that Vg1 is maternally provided in an inactive form that resides intracellularly and becomes active only when Nodal ligands are produced. They then show that Nodal ligands bind Vg1 and propose a mechanism by which Nodal/Vg1 heterodimers mediate effective nodal signaling.</p><p>The study is of wide interest as it provides new insight on the Nodal signaling pathway, a conserved pathway involved in embryonic patterning and organogenesis. The experimental data are solid and clearly presented, however a few points need to be clarified prior to publication.</p><p>1) The authors claim that Nodal/Vg1 heterodimers mediate Nodal signaling. This statement requires at least direct prove that such heterodimers bind to nodal receptors and, ideally, that they mediate receptor activation. This could be shown by IP experiments showing binding of both Cyc and Vg1 to phosphorylated Nodal receptors.</p><p>2) The authors show that Vg1 binds to Cyc and Sqt in vivo by colocalization of tagged versions of these ligands in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

However, the specific roles and underlying molecular mechanisms remain disputable. Taking a rigorous reverse genetic approach, and generating two different frame-shifting indel <italic>vg1</italic> zebrafish mutants, the authors demonstrate an essential role of maternal <italic>vg1</italic> in mesendoderm induction: whereas zygotic <italic>vg1</italic> mutants appear normal (but what about left-right asymmetry?), maternal mutant embryos phenocopy defects observed in the famous Nodal signaling deficient scenarios. The authors provide genetic, biochemical and cell biological evidence that Vg1 processing requires Nodal, and that Vg1 and Nodal (Cyc or Sqt) form heterodimers. Modeling is used to argue that the ubiquitously expressed <italic>vg1</italic> allows for faster Nodal signaling. The manuscript clarifies a large body of often incongruent data and models from various vertebrate model systems and advances our understanding of both Vg1 and Nodal signaling during development. Therefore, the manuscript should be of interest to the broad developmental biology community. The manuscript is in general logically presented but scarcity of experimental detail make it difficult to evaluate the presented results. Several conclusions need to be strengthened by additional experiments, and some experiments and their interpretation need clarification.</p><p>1) Do the indel <italic>vg1</italic> mutations lead to reduction of maternal <italic>vg1</italic> message?</p><p>2 Are zygotic <italic>vg1</italic> mutant truly aphenotypic?

Whereas it has been previously shown that Nodal expression in YSL is sufficient to induce mesoderm and endoderm in the overlying blastoderm, this experiment would indicate that Cyc-Vg1 and Sqt-Vg1 heterodimers secreted from YSL are sufficient to create Nodal activity gradient to not only induce but also pattern the blastoderm. However, this experiment raises many questions: has injection been truly confined to the YSL (there is no lineage tracing data presented and a sceptic could argue that the 13 embryos that were rescued express the ligands also in the blastoderm due to ineffective injection? The evidence that expression is confined to the YSL is essential. It would be also important to show that Smad2 activity in such embryos parallels WT pattern shown by the authors in their earlier publications. It would be also important to show that the ligands targeted by RNA injection to the YSL can be seen in extracellular spaces in the blastoderm.</p><p>10) How does the above result fit with the models of Nodal autoinduction and self-inhibition?

For example, why Vg1 remains as monomers and thus available to dimerize with Nodal. The suggested experiment is to perform additional WB under-non reducing conditions to test this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for asking us to clarify the monomeric state of Vg1. We present two forms of evidence that suggest Vg1 remains as monomers prior to heterodimerization with Nodal. First, non-reducing western blots with Vg1-Flag (and Bmp7a-Flag as a positive control) show that while Bmp7a forms homodimers under non-reducing conditions, Vg1 does not. Second, by co-IP we detect an interaction between Sqt-HA and Vg1-Flag, but not between Vg1-HA and Vg1-Flag, indicating that Vg1 does not homodimerize. In addition, a previous study found that Vg1 does not form homodimers, and predominantly exists in a monomeric state (Dale et al. EMBO J 1993). We have now referred to this study in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be advisable to experimentally clarify where exactly in the cell heterodimerization is occurring.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to visualize where in the cell heterodimerization is occurring. Unfortunately, it is currently not feasible to perform dynamic imaging of the two proteins at the high spatial resolution required to detect heterodimer formation. In the revised manuscript, we raise this question for future studies and discuss previous studies that indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum is a strong candidate for the site of heterodimerization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally two of the reviewers raise the issue as to why heterodimers are required to mediate nodal signaling versus homodimers?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. We have clarified in the text that heterodimers are most likely required to mediate Nodal signaling because they are more potent than homodimers. We have provided additional experimental evidence to support this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and our last response to point 1 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be important to show a direct interaction between these heterodimers and the nodal receptor complexes. An alternative approach would be to over-express different relative amounts of Vg1 and Nodal in Vg1 mutants and use Phospho-Smad2 activity as a read-out (as suggested by reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions. We have overexpressed <italic>cyc</italic> with different levels of <italic>vg1</italic> and performed qPCR to show that the extent of Nodal signaling (measured by <italic>lft1</italic> expression) increases with higher levels of co-expression of <italic>vg1</italic>. We found phospho-Smad2 to be insufficiently quantitative for this experiment. We agree that showing a direct interaction between the heterodimers and Nodal receptor complexes will be an important experiment. However, testing receptor-ligand interactions is currently technically very challenging because the full Nodal receptor complement has not yet been identified and, with the exception of the co-receptor Oep, the zebrafish Nodal receptors have not been defined genetically. We will try to address this point in a follow up study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Two of the reviewers raise concerns with the Vg1 mutant rescue by YSL injection of Vg1. In particular reviewer 3 requests that the experiment be repeated using lineage tracing to show that the injection is confined to the YSL, ideally with the inclusion of Smad2 staining as further verification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for drawing our attention to this point. In response to the reviewers’ suggestions we performed confocal imaging on embryos co-injected with <italic>vg1</italic> and a fluorescent dextran into the YSL at the 1000-cell stage. While the vast majority of fluorescence was localized to the YSL, we found that occasional cells at the margin contain some fluorescent signal. We have therefore revised the text to state that the mRNA was present primarily but not exclusively in the YSL. We have further verified the rescue of the M<italic>vg1</italic> phenotype with gene expression markers of endoderm and mesoderm. We find that while some embryos achieve almost complete rescue, the rescue is not fully penetrant. These results suggest that maternal <italic>vg1</italic> is more potent when available earlier and/or more broadly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typically, when requesting revisions, eLife decision letters only include a summary of the major concerns discussed by the editors and the referees, but we considered that the authors would benefit from receiving the full reviews verbatim in this occasion so that they can attend to as many of the points raised as possible, and also see that the reviewers were uniformly very positive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for sharing these comments. They helped us further improve the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The kinetic model assumes that Vg1 would remain as monomers ready to heterodimerize with Nodal, which is a major assumption of the model and should be mentioned. Vg1 alone would be expected to homodimerize if Nodal is not present. Do the authors have evidence for Vg1 remaining as a monomer in the absence of Nodal? Non-reducing Western blot conditions could provide evidence for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. As detailed in our first response to point 1 above, we now provide evidence that Vg1 does not form homodimers.</p><p>One potential criticism of this model is that Nodal might preferentially heterodimerize with Vg1 protein that is co-translated with Nodal rather than with Vg1 that has already been translated and is latent in the ER. To test this model we injected <italic>vg1-Dendra2</italic> mRNA at the 1-cell stage, and photoconverted the Vg1-Dendra2 protein at the 64-cell stage shortly after injecting <italic>cyc</italic> mRNA. This allowed us to distinguish the early Vg1 protein (red) from the protein co-translated with Cyc (green). Live imaging of these embryos revealed the presence of red puncta, indicating that the Vg1 protein translated prior to Nodal expression can heterodimerize with Nodal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also provide more information on where dimerization is known to occur (Golgi?) and how it is regulated to provide more plausibility to the model? The authors have stated that unprocessed Vg1 resides in the ER but haven't provided evidence to support this. They should either provide data to support this ER retention or soften their statements throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We now provide published examples of where in the cell proteins heterodimerize, and find this to predominantly occur in the ER (Hurtley and Helenius, Annu. Rev. Cell Biol.1989). For example, in the case of uroplakins, similarly to Vg1 and Nodal, 1 of the 4 uroplakin proteins is able to independently exit the ER, while the others can only exit upon heterodimerization (Tu et al. Mol. Biol. Cell 2002).</p><p>The localization pattern of Vg1 is highly indicative of ER retention (see references in the text and Tu et al. 2002). To further clarify this point we expressed an ER protein from yeast (Sec61beta-GFP) in zebrafish embryos. Unfortunately the protein only weakly expressed in zebrafish, and therefore did not provide the resolution required to clearly indicate its subcellular localization. To avoid overstating the data we have adjusted the text to state that Vg1 is “predominantly” localized in the ER.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The starting level of Vg1 in the model at 4 hpf is assumed to be 1000 nM, which is extremely high, especially considering that the mRNA is at very low levels at this point, although protein could be higher but are unknown. Provide modeling results when Vg1 monomers are at 500 nm or a more reasonable level of 50 or 100 nm.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to this. We have adjusted the starting concentration of <italic>vg1</italic> in the model to be 100 nM and obtained similar results as before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the authors could comment on why Vg1-Nodal heterodimers are required for signaling. Readers will want to know possible functions for a heterodimer that the Nodal homodimer cannot provide or at least comment that it is unclear at this point. Perhaps I missed this in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we should make this point more clearly. Our data indicates that heterodimers are more potent than homodimers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E and F</xref>); therefore the simple explanation is that the embryo uses heterodimers because they are more active. We have clarified this in the text and refer to the studies by Mullins and colleagues who show that Bmp2-Bmp7 heterodimers are more potent than a combination of Bmp2 homodimers and Bmp7 homodimers (Little and Mullins, Nat. Cell Biol. 2009).</p><p>An additional explanation is that maternal <italic>vg1</italic> allows embryos to signal at lower concentrations of Nodalbecause the embryo already has Vg1 protein when <italic>nodal</italic> is transcribed and translated. This point is addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> with a kinetic model of homodimer versus heterodimer formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the authors commented further on the rescue of Mvg1 mutants by YSL injection of vg1 mRNA at the 1000-cell stage, a stage after zygotic transcription has initiated.

Additionally comment on the sufficiency of Nodal-Vg1 production in the YSL, which may have been previously performed with Nodal.
