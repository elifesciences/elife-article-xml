new antimicrobials. Here, we report a previously unrecognized core component of the <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> divisome. Our results reveal that the protein, termed Aeg1 interacts with multiple cell division proteins, including FtsN, which is required for components of the divisome to localize to the midcell. We demonstrate that the FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> and FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> mutants effectively bypassed the need of Aeg1 by <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, as did the activation variants FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>. Our results suggest that Aeg1 is a cell division protein that arrives at the division site to initiate cell division by recruiting FtsN, which activates FtsQLB and FtsA to induce the septal peptidoglycan synthase FtsWI. The discovery of the new essential cell division protein has provided a new target for the development of antibacterial agents.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic></kwd><kwd>cell division</kwd><kwd>Gram-negative bacteria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007847</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Jilin Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>YDZJ202201ZYTS025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jilin Science and Technology Agency grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20200403117SF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Technology Development Project of Changchun City</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23YQ10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Bethune Project of Jilin University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2024B20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identifying gain-of-function division variants that suppress the elongated cell division defect phenotype caused by Aeg1 depletion.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes a wide variety of nosocomial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piperaki et al., 2019</xref>), including urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal and skin/wound infections, and secondary meningitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peleg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nasr, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doi et al., 2015</xref>). The challenge posed by this pathogen is compounded by the emergence of isolates that are resistant to almost all of the available antibiotics, including some of the last resort for treatment of infections caused by bacterial pathogens, including colistin, tigecycline, and carbapenems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piperaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karakonstantis, 2021</xref>). As a result, the World Health Organization (WHO) has classified <italic>A. baumannii</italic> as a pathogen for which new antibiotics are urgently needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whiteway et al., 2022</xref>). Meeting this challenge requires the discovery of antimicrobials of new mechanisms with action or other mitigation strategies that enable reduction of disease burden caused by this pathogen.</p><p>Historically, the discovery of antibiotics was largely based on the search for secondary metabolites produced by soil-dwelling microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clardy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright, 2017</xref>). The majority of clinically used antibiotic classes originate from soil bacteria, including lactams, aminoglycosides, polymyxins, and glycopeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hutchings et al., 2019</xref>). Unfortunately, natural products discovery is now plagued by problems of so-called ‘dereplication problem’, wherein rediscovery of molecules or their close relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, there has not been a novel antibiotic discovered in over 30 years using traditional methods of screening environmental samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lewis, 2020</xref>). The overuse of these merely variants of existing compounds has further accelerated the problem associated with antibiotic resistance. Thus, identification of novel therapeutic targets in the pathogen may serve as an effective alternative to the problem.</p><p>A better understanding of gene function associated with <italic>A. baumannii</italic> pathogenesis and biology will provide us strategies to develop antibiotics with potentially novel mechanisms of action. One extensively explored avenue in this regard is the identification of previously unrecognized essential genes by methods enabled by new DNA sequencing technologies, including insertion sequencing (INSeq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goodman et al., 2009</xref>), transposon sequencing (Tn-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Opijnen et al., 2009</xref>), transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Langridge et al., 2009</xref>), and high-throughput insertion tracking sequencing (HITS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gawronski et al., 2009</xref>). Application of these methods has identified genes believed to be required for bacterial viability under various conditions in such important pathogens as <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Opijnen et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallagher et al., 2011</xref>), <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dong et al., 2013</xref>), and <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Similar to candidate genes identified by other methods, putative essential genes obtained by In-seq were deduced from sequencing results of surviving mutants, some of which can be false positives or negatives due to unsaturated mutant libraries or polar effects on downstream genes of the insertion sites. Using In-seq Wang et al. identified 453 candidate essential genes for the growth of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strain ATCC 17978 on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Among these, genes annotated as hypotheticals with orthologs in other taxonomically distant microorganisms are of particular interest because their potential role in cellular processes that can be explored as targets for the development of novel antimicrobials. We thus set out to test a subgroup of the predicted essential genes by a conditional gene deletion strategy based on the arabinose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guzman et al., 1995</xref>). From 10 genes examined, three were found to be essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability on rich medium. Further study revealed that one of these genes codes for a novel bacterial cell division protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of genes required for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> viability</title><p>Analysis of strains of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>, including the model strain 17,978 by In-seq technologies have led to the identification of at least 453 genes potentially required for bacterial growth on rich medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Whereas many of these genes are involved in known cellular processes fundamental for cell viability such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, some code for proteins of unknown activity, are thus of great interest as potentially new antimicrobial targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gallagher et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the function of the candidate essential genes annotated as hypotheticals, we first confirmed their essentiality by a conditional gene deletion method. To this end, we employed a set of plasmids that allow inducible gene expression in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jie et al., 2021</xref>). Each gene of interest was expressed from the arabinose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guzman et al., 1995</xref>), and the corresponding gene was deleted from the chromosome by the standard allele exchange method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Merriam et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Chromosomal deletion mutants harboring the arabinose-inducible gene were tested for essentiality by spotting serially diluted cells onto solid medium with or without arabinose (ara) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If the gene of interest is essential, the bacterium should fail to grow on plates without ara.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of <italic>aeg1</italic> as an essential gene for <italic>A.</italic> <italic>baumannii</italic> viability on rich medium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A diagram depicting the method for conditional deletion of potential essential genes.

Importantly, gene <italic>A1S_3387</italic> is also essential for <italic>A. baumannii</italic> growth in the Vogel–Bonner minimal medium with succinate (VBS) as the sole carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vogel and Bonner, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These genes were thus designated as <italic><underline>A</underline>. baumannii</italic> <underline>e</underline>ssential <underline>g</underline>enes (Aeg) and Aeg1 (<italic>A1S_3387</italic>) was chosen for detailed study.</p><p>Sequence analysis revealed that Aeg1 has orthologs in a number of Gram-negative bacteria, including <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> members of the <italic>Moraxellaceae</italic> family and some strains of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, with sequence similarity ranging from 80% to identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Aeg1 is predicted to harbor a single transmembrane domain, however, the precise location of this transmembrane segment has been predicted differently across various analyses. SMART Web site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Käll et al., 2004</xref>) predicted the transmembrane region to be located at the N-terminus of Aeg1 (7–29 aa). In contrast, Phobius, based on HMM(HMMTOP (enzim.hu)) suggested the transmembrane segment is situated more centrally within the Aeg1 protein (134–151 aa), and further proposed that the N-terminus may correspond to a signal peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Käll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geisinger et al., 2020</xref>). Regardless of the specific transmembrane topology prediction, the N-terminal region of Aeg1 appears to be a critical domain. Therefore, to further elucidate the structural and functional importance of the Aeg1 close to its N-terminus end, we employed a dual inducible system with two compatible plasmids that use promoters that respond to ara and isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), respectively. Strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1, P<sub>TAC</sub>::Aeg1) was able to grow on medium containing 1% ara or 0.5 mM IPTG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) indicating that the chromosomal deletion can be complemented by either of the constructs when expression of Aeg1 was induced. Importantly, expression of the Aeg1 mutant lacking N-terminal region was unable to restore the growth of the strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), suggesting that N-terminal domain of Aeg1 is essential for its activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Depletion of Aeg1 caused cell filamentation in <italic>A. baumannii</italic></title><p>We next examined the morphology of <italic>A. baumannii</italic> lacking Aeg1 by optical and scanning electron microscopy. Cultures of strain Δ<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) were induced by ara for 14 hr, cells diluted into fresh LB with or without ara were allowed to grow for 18 hr. We found that cells of cultures grown in medium containing 1% ara exhibited a short rod cell shape similar to that of the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In medium without ara most cells of strain ∆<italic>aeg1</italic>(P<sub>BAD</sub>::Aeg1) displayed an elongated morphology which is in sharp contrast to those of wild-type cells grew under identical conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Because the predicted transmembrane topology of Aeg1 is not unequivocal, with one model suggesting an N-terminal transmembrane segment and another proposing a more centrally located membrane-spanning domain. To circumvent potential artifacts arising from the ambiguous topological models of Aeg1, we generated two distinct fusion constructs, tethering the T25 domain to either the N- or C-terminus of the Aeg1 protein.

Ten of these are normally essential for both cell division and survival, and they are now mainly suggested to be the core of the divisome in various bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haeusser and Margolin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lutkenhaus, 2017</xref>). These essential division proteins are mostly named Fts (filamentation temperature sensitive), which stems from the fact that inactivating one of these <italic>fts</italic> genes causes cells to become filamentous, which eventually failed to survive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haeusser and Margolin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carson et al., 1991</xref>). Among these, the FtsQLB complex not only serves as a scaffold for recruitment of subsequent divisome proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guzman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craven et al., 2024</xref>), but also plays an important role in regulating the activity of the divisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2020</xref>). The constriction control domain (CCD) of FtsL was previously defined as a critical component for switching the conformation of FtsLB from an off to an on state in order to activate FtsWI by enabling the interaction between FtsI<sup>peri</sup> and the AWI (activation of FtsWI) region of FtsL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sánchez et al., 1994</xref>). Division obstruction caused by Aeg1 depletion can be effectively circumvented by suppression mutations (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>) in its CCD domain and by activation mutations (M254I and S274G) of FtsW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that Aeg1 functions upstream of these proteins.</p><p>In addition to FtsQLB-mediated activation of FtsI in the periplasm, the constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acting on FtsW in the cytoplasm, these two events functions synergistically to activate FtsWI for sPG synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karimova et al., 1998</xref>). FtsA is a member of the actin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van den Ent and Löwe, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szwedziak et al., 2012</xref>), which interacts with FtsN via a unique IC domain positioned between the IA and IIA domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pichoff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goehring and Beckwith, 2005</xref>). Little is known about the function of the IA and IIA domains of FtsA. That the E202K mutation in the IIA domain bypasses the requirement of Aeg1 by <italic>A. baumannii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) suggests that Aeg1 and FtsA work together to activate FtsW.</p><p>The maturation of the core divisome is facilitated by the recruitment in a nearly sequential order of the late-division proteins FtsK, FtsQ, FtsL/FtsB, FtsW, FtsI, and FtsN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Du et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addinall et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyu et al., 2022</xref>). Once the latest division protein, FtsN, is recruited, division-specific peptidoglycan synthesis conferred by the FtsWI complex is activated to build the septum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lyu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Weiss, 2015</xref>). More recent studies suggest that by binding to FtsA, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the division site earlier than previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goehring and Beckwith, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Piehaud and Second, 1951</xref>) where it induces a conformational switch in both FtsA and the FtsQLB subcomplex on both sides of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, binding between FtsA and FtsN is regulated by ZipA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goehring and Beckwith, 2005</xref>). Our observation of strong binding of Aeg1 to ZipA and FtsN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>) prompted us to propose a model in which Aeg1 participates in cell division by anchoring to the division site together with ZipA where it recruits FtsN, which in turn signals to both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic branches of peptidoglycan synthesis involving FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Park et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The placement of Aeg1 as one of the early arrivals in the hierarchical sequential assembly of the divisome is consistent with the fact that the requirement of Aeg1 can be bypassed by constitutively active mutants of FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), FtsB (FtsB<sub>E65A</sub>), FtsL (FtsL<sub>Q70K</sub>), and of FtsW (FtsW<sub>M254I</sub> and FtsW<sub>S274G</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A model for the function of Aeg1 in cell division of <italic>A. baumannii</italic>.</title><p>In the early stages of Z-ring assembly, anchor proteins FtsA and ZipA tether FtsZ to the inner face of the plasma membrane. In the initial phase of cell division, a small amount of FtsN is recruited to the divisome in a FtsA-dependent manner (left, recruitment phase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wroblewska et al., 2007</xref>). The Aeg1–ZipA–FtsN complex acts as a dynamic scaffold for recruiting downstream of Fts proteins. Once more FtsN is recruited to the divisome, it will activate both FtsA and the FtsQLB complex, which in turn activates FtsI in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Note that constitutively active form of FtsA (FtsA*) acts on FtsW in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Karimova et al., 1998</xref>) so did the hyperactive mutants FtsA<sub>E202K</sub>. These mutants all bypassed the need of Aeg1 (right, activation phase). Constitutively active mutants were indicated by a star. The red arrows next to FtsA<sub>E202K</sub> or FtsB<sub>E65A</sub> indicate overexpression of these mutants.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87922-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It is worth noting that that although homologs of Aeg1 are present in many Gram-negative bacteria, including some recent isolate of <italic>E. coli</italic>, it appears to be absent in more extensively studied model strains such as K12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). It is possible that in strain K12, its activity is conferred by a yet unidentified protein that employs a conserved mechanism in cell division.

The strength of the work is that it discovered that the depletion of Aeg1 leads to cell filamentation and that activation mutations in various cell division genes can suppress the requirement for Aeg1. These results suggest that Aeg1 plays an important role in cell division. The work's weakness is that it lacks convincing evidence to define Aeg1's place or role in the divisome assembly pathway. It is unclear whether proteins are at the division site under the wildtype condition and when Aeg1 is depleted, and whether Aeg1 is indeed required for a set of division proteins to the division site.</p><p>Reviewer comments:</p><p>The revised manuscript partially addressed two of the three major concerns from the previous assessment: (1) the functionality test of fluorescent fusion proteins using a spotting assay, and (2) membrane protein topology in the bacterial two-hybrid assays by constructing a C-terminal T25 fusion.</p><p>(1) In the spotting assay, all fluorescent fusion proteins rescued the growth of the corresponding deletion strain, which suggests these fusion proteins are functional. However, fluorescent images of these fusion proteins were diffusive, and only a few cells showed the expected midcell/membrane localization pattern for cell division proteins. This observation raised the concern that these fusion proteins may be cleaved in the middle, leading to the separation of the untagged fusion partner and diffusive fluorescent protein in the cytoplasm, which would explain the positive spotting rescue results. This phenomenon is commonly observed in other bacterial species. A western blot using an antibody targeting either the fluorescent protein or the fusion partner is widely used to examine whether the fusion protein is expressed at its full length.</p><p>(2) The authors constructed a C-terminal fusion of Aeg1 and showed that it still interacted with ZipA and FtsN. This result supports the authors' suggestion that the N-terminus of Aeg1 may not be the predicated membrane-targeting domain. Along the same line, the membrane topology of ZipA should also be considered. ZipA's N terminus is in the membrane facing the periplasm, and its C terminal domain is in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the PUT18C fusion will place the T18 domain of ZipA in the periplasm. All other division proteins' N termini are in the cytoplasm.</p><p>(3) Colocalization images did not show significant midcell localizations for each fluorescent protein; most cells showed diffusive cytoplasmic fluorescence. In all other species, midcell localization of cell division proteins is prominent in dividing cells, especially for early division proteins such as ZipA (at least 40-50% of cells show midcell bands). In A. baumannii, divisome localization timing may differ from other species, but this possibility needs to be established before the colocalization pattern is examined. Compounding this issue is that in Aeg1 depletion strains, some cells expressing ZipA, FtsB, FtsL, and FtsN fusions showed roughly regularly spaced puncta in long filamentous cells. It is hard to explain why this was observed if, under the WT condition, these fusions do not localize to the midcell. These results again raised concerns that these fusion proteins may not be functional and the observations are protein aggregates.</p><p>Besides these major issues, experimental observations did not support some claims in the main text. For example: (1) In the two-hybrid assay, only ZipA and FtsN showed significant interactions with Aeg1, as judged by the darkness of the blue spots. FtsL and FtsB showed pale spots. The quantified values accompanying this figure did not appear to agree with the image. (2) The spotting rescue assay showed that only FtsB-E56A and FtsA-E202K was able to bypass Aeg1 depletion (full dilution set comparable to that of Aeg1 complementation), but the main text claimed that FtsA-D124A and V144L, and FtsW-M254I and S274G also rescued the growth. These claims could be misleading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87922.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Xiao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Lidong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Yiheng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Zhengshan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Guan</surname><given-names>Qingtian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>Zhaoqing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>First Hospital of Jilin University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Changchun</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The reviewers asked to clarify the BTH assay: The fused T25 and T18 domains must be in the cytoplasmic to complement successfully. The authors stated that the N terminus of Aeg1 transverses the membrane once, which means that the T25-Aeg1 will have T25 in the periplasm. However, T18C vector fusion with other division proteins will have T18C of ZipA in the periplasm (ZipA's N terminus is on the periplasmic side of the inner membrane) while that of FtsN in the cytoplasm (FtsN's N terminus is in the cytoplasm). As such, it isn't easy to understand why T25-Aeg1 showed positive results for both ZipA and FtsN. Note that FtsL, FtsB, and FtsI all have the same topology as FtsN but showed negative results. It is possible that these fusion proteins do not fold correctly, and hence, the results cannot be interpreted directly. The authors did not address this concern but only cited that BTH is a commonly used assay for protein-protein interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the editor's comments and the concerns raised by the reviewer, we have performed two sets of Aeg1-T25 fusion experiments to determine whether the Aeg1 topology impacts protein interactions measured by bacterial two-hybrid (BTH) assays. In the first set of experiments, we fused the T25 domain to the N-terminus of Aeg1 and still observed strong binding of Aeg1 to ZipA and FtsN, respectively. Similar results were obtained from the second set of experiments in which the T25 domain was fused to the C-terminus of Aeg1.</p><p>These results indicate that the precise topology of Aeg1 does not significantly impact its ability to engage these binding partners. Aeg1 is predicted to harbor a single transmembrane domain, however, the precise location of this transmembrane segment differs in predictions made by different algorithms. The SMART Web site (1) predicted the transmembrane region to be located at the N-terminus of Aeg1 (7-29 aa). In contrast, Phobius, based on HMM （2， 3）suggested the transmembrane segment is situated more centrally within the Aeg1 protein (134-151 aa), and further proposed that the N-terminus may function as a signal peptide. This latter prediction also provides a potential explanation for the larger-than-expected molecular weight of the Aeg1 truncation mutant observed in the Western blot shown in Fig 1C. The removal of the putative signal peptide may have altered the protein structure, affecting its electrophoretic mobility. As a result, we are more inclined to favor the topology model for Aeg1 predicted by Phobius.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is still difficult to identify the midcell localization patterns of Aeg1 and other division proteins from microscopy images (Fig. 4C and Fig. 5A). In Fig 4C, only ZipA and Aeg1 formed clear, regular band-like colocalization patterns. Others formed irregular co-localized puncta along the cell length, different from the expected midcell localization patterns. Cells also appeared to be much longer than WT cells, suggesting cell division defects. The most likely reason for these aberrant localization patterns and filamentous cells is that GFP/mCherry-fusions of these division proteins are not functional and become dominant negative, interfering with proper cell division. The authors need to test the functionality of these fusion proteins before they can be used for imaging. (The authors also mislabeled Hoechst and the division protein GFP panels labels in this figure.)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. To examine the functionality of the fluorescence protein fusion constructs, we have painstakingly performed conditional knockout of the genes of interest (<italic>zipA</italic>, <italic>ftsB</italic>, <italic>ftsL</italic>, and <italic>ftsN</italic>) in <italic>A. baumannii</italic> strains inducibly expressing the corresponding fusion protein. We found that these fluorescence protein fusions were able to fully rescue the growth of the mutant lacking the corresponding <italic>fts</italic> gene (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). Concurrently, we have also successfully knocked out the <italic>aeg1</italic> gene under conditions <italic>in trans</italic> expression of an mCherry-Aeg1 fusion protein, which was able to effectively rescue the growth defects of the Δa_eg1_ mutant (Figure 4-figure supplement 1). We then introduced the functional fluorescence protein fusions into wild-type cells and observed the co-localization of Aeg1 with the relevant Fts proteins. The results showed that Aeg1 indeed co-localized with ZipA, FtsB, FtsL, and FtsN (Fig.4E, red arrows), but occasional non-co-localization was also observed (Fig.4E, white arrows).</p><p>We have utilized the functional fluorescence protein fusion constructs to analyze the localization of relevant Aeg1-interacting proteins in the Δ<italic>aeg1</italic> strain upon Aeg1 depletion. Our results showed that the depletion of Aeg1 indeed impacted the midcell localization of the several Aeg1-interacting Fts proteins.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Letunic I, Khedkar S, Bork P.
