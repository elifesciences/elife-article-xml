conserved architecture formed by three linked, ‘triplet’, microtubules arranged in ninefold symmetry. The mechanisms by which these triplet microtubules are formed remain unclear but likely involve the noncanonical tubulins delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin. Previously, we found that human cells lacking delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin form abnormal centrioles, characterized by an absence of triplet microtubules, lack of central core protein POC5, and a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration (Wang et al., 2017). Here, we show that human cells lacking either TEDC1 or TEDC2 have similar abnormalities. Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we observed that mutant centrioles elongate to the same length as control centrioles in G2 phase and fail to recruit central core scaffold proteins. Remarkably, mutant centrioles also have an expanded proximal region. During mitosis, these mutant centrioles further elongate before fragmenting and disintegrating. All four proteins physically interact and TEDC1 and TEDC2 can form a subcomplex in the absence of the tubulins, supporting an AlphaFold Multimer model of the tetramer. TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize to centrosomes and are mutually dependent on each other and on delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin for localization. Our results demonstrate that delta-tubulin, epsilon-tubulin, TEDC1, and TEDC2 function together to promote robust centriole architecture, laying the foundation for future studies on the mechanisms underlying the assembly of triplet microtubules and their interactions with centriole structure.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>microtubules</kwd><kwd>triplet microtubules</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>microtubule organizing center</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00GM131024</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jennifer T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM130286</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stearns</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Centriolar triplet microtubules are required for the formation and positioning of centriole substructures.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major microtubule organizing center of mammalian cells, the centrosome, is composed of two barrel-shaped centrioles surrounded by layers of pericentriolar material (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Breslow and Holland, 2019</xref>). The unique architecture of the centriole is highly conserved: the centriole barrel walls of approximately 250 nm in diameter by 500 nm in length are formed of compound microtubules linked to each other through shared protofilament walls, arranged in ninefold symmetry (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Stearns, 2017</xref>). Centrioles exhibit proximal-distal polarity comprised of three subdomains: the proximal end with triplet microtubules, the distal end with doublet microtubules, and the central core spanning the two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeGuennec et al., 2021</xref>). The triplet microtubules are named the A-, B-, and C-tubules. The A-tubule is a complete microtubule formed of 13 protofilaments, and the B- and C-tubules are partial tubules and share protofilament walls with adjacent tubules. The A- and B-tubules extend beyond the C-tubule to form the doublet microtubules of the centriole distal end. During ciliogenesis, the A- and B-tubules elongate further to form the ciliary axoneme (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang and Stearns, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Compound microtubules are unique to centrioles and ciliary axonemes and are conserved in almost all organisms with these organelles. Little is known about the mechanisms by which they form, or the functional roles they play within centrioles and cilia. Two non-canonical members of the tubulin superfamily, delta-tubulin (TUBD1) and epsilon-tubulin (TUBE1), are required for compound microtubule formation or stability in multiple organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Loubresse et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dupuis-Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dutcher and Trabuco, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutcher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gadelha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goodenough and StClair, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ross et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Previously, we showed that human cells lacking these tubulins make aberrant centrioles that only have singlet microtubules and disintegrate in mitosis, resulting in a futile cycle of centriole formation and loss every cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These mutant centrioles fail to recruit the distal end protein POC5, indicating that compound microtubules may be required for centriole composition. We concluded that either the compound microtubules themselves, or the proteins that they associate with, are required for centriole stability through the cell cycle. Together, these results suggest that the compound microtubules may form a unique scaffold for the protein-protein interactions that define centrosomes and cilia.</p><p>The compound microtubules are directly linked to many of the substructures at the proximal, central, and distal regions within centrioles. At the proximal end, the cartwheel, a ninefold symmetric hub and spokes made from SASS6 and associated proteins, is connected to the A-tubule through the pinhead, which has been proposed to be formed of CEP135 and CPAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hatzopoulos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kraatz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lin et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>). Multiple cartwheels are stacked within the centriole lumen to a height of approximately one-third of the entire centriole length (~170 nm in human centrioles; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klena et al., 2020</xref>). The A-tubule of one triplet is connected to the C-tubule of the adjacent triplet through a structure known as the A-C linker. Recently CCDC77, WDR67, and MIIP were identified to be components of the A-C linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bournonville et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>). Within the central core, a helical inner scaffold imparts structural integrity upon the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steib et al., 2020</xref>), and recruits proteins, including gamma-tubulin, to the lumen of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schweizer et al., 2021</xref>). This scaffold is formed in G2-phase of the first cell cycle after centriole birth, is composed of POC5, POC1B, FAM161A, WDR90, and CCDC15 and contacts all three (A-, B-, and C-) tubules of the triplet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arslanhan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steib et al., 2020</xref>). The distal region of centrioles also has a unique protein composition, including the proteins centrin, CP110, SFI1, CEP97, CEP90, OFD1, and MNR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kleylein-Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laporte et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Borgne et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spektor et al., 2007</xref>). The connections between the compound microtubules and these distal end proteins are not well-understood.</p><p>Canonically, centriole formation in cycling cells is ‘templated’, in which one newly formed procentriole is created at the proximal end of each pre-existing parental centriole in S-phase, resulting in four centrioles within the cell. During the first cycle after their formation, procentrioles acquire post-translational modifications, elongate, recruit the inner scaffold, lose the cartwheel, and undergo centriole-to-centrosome conversion. Additional changes occur during the second cell cycle, including acquisition of the distal and subdistal appendages that are important for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullenberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tischer et al., 2021</xref>). Under experimental manipulations in which the parental centrioles are ablated, centrioles can also form <italic>de novo</italic> in S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>De novo</italic> centriole formation can result in more than five centrioles per cell and has been shown to be error-prone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), perhaps indicating differences in centriole structure or regulation. The composition and architecture of centrioles made in this manner has not been systematically characterized.</p><p>Here, we extend our original work by defining the roles of two additional proteins, TEDC1 and TEDC2, that regulate triplet microtubule formation and stability. These proteins physically interact with TUBD1 and TUBE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of <italic>Tedc1</italic> or <italic>Tedc2</italic> in 3T3 cells results in a variable distribution of centriole numbers through the cell cycle, and tagged TEDC1 localizes to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>).

All four proteins interact in a complex. We find that the compound microtubules are required for recruiting the helical inner scaffold and correctly positioning the proximal end. As part of our analysis, we also determine the composition and architecture of centrioles formed <italic>de novo</italic> and find that these are very similar to those of procentrioles formed by templated centriole duplication. Together, these results indicate that compound microtubules are required for scaffolding substructures within centrioles and maintaining centriole stability through the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of TEDC1 or TEDC2 phenocopies loss of TUBD1 or TUBE1</title><p>TEDC1 and TEDC2 have been reported to physically interact with delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, and loss of either <italic>Tedc1</italic> or <italic>Tedc2</italic> in 3T3 cells results in cells with a variable number of centrioles through the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>).

In our expansion gels of cells enriched in late S and G2 phases, we used PCNA to mark S-phase cells and co-stained with acetylated tubulin to mark centrioles. Similar to a recently published report, we also found a range of centriole lengths in S- and G2-phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>). In S-phase, centrioles were short in all conditions. In G2-phase, centrioles elongated in all conditions, and mutant centrioles reached approximately similar lengths as control centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). By contrast, mutant centriole widths did not increase and centrioles remained narrow, as we previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that centrioles with singlet microtubules can elongate to the same overall length as control centrioles in G2 phase. Consistent with this hypothesis, CEP120, a protein involved in regulating centriole length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Comartin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mahjoub et al., 2010</xref>), was present and properly localized within mutant centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The compound microtubules of centrioles are heavily post-translationally modified, and recent studies have indicated that each tubule may acquire different modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guichard et al., 2023</xref>). We checked glutamylation, a post-translational modification thought to be restricted to the outer surface of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guichard et al., 2023</xref>). Within <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> centrioles, glutamylation is differentially distributed between each tubule: on the C-tubule at the distal end, on all three tubules in the central core, and on the A-tubule at the proximal end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamel et al., 2017</xref>). In human centrioles, polyglutamylation is enriched in the proximal and central regions, and is absent in the distal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gambarotto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahecic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullenberger et al., 2020</xref>). We used two antibodies to detect glutamylation: the GT335 antibody, which recognizes the glutamylation branch and thus detects all polyglutamylation, and the polyE antibody, which recognizes long polyglutamate side chains with at least 2 or 3 glutamate residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Dijk et al., 2007</xref>). We found that mutant and control centrioles could be stained by GT335 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), indicating that mutant centrioles are at least mono-glutamylated. However, the polyE antibody did not label control procentrioles or <italic>de novo</italic> centrioles in the first cell cycle after their formation, making this antibody uninformative for our mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results show that centrioles with just singlet microtubules (A-tubules) can be mono-glutamylated. Moreover, similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullenberger et al., 2020</xref>), our results suggest that centriole glutamylation is a multi-step process, in which long glutamate side chains are added later during centriole maturation.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that <italic>TUBD1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant centrioles fail to recruit the distal centriole protein POC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Using expansion microscopy, we found that <italic>TEDC1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>TEDC2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant centrioles also failed to recruit POC5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ei</xref>). Since our original work was published, POC5 was shown to be a component of the helical inner scaffold within the central core. These results indicate that the helical inner scaffold is not properly formed in centrioles with singlet microtubules. To test the mechanisms underlying loss of POC5, we next tested whether mutant centrioles recruit WDR90, which has been proposed to localize to the inner junction between the A- and B-tubules and function in recruiting the inner scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steib et al., 2020</xref>). We found that WDR90 was not recruited to mutant centrioles, in contrast to control centrioles, in which it is recruited in G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Eii</xref>). From these results, it is likely that mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules fail to build or stabilize the inner junction between the A- and B-tubules. In the absence of the inner junction and junctional protein WDR90, centrioles with singlet microtubules cannot form the inner scaffold. As also previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>), we failed to detect gamma-tubulin within the lumen of control or <italic>de novo</italic>-formed centrioles in S or G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and thus were unable to test whether gamma-tubulin, which is recruited to the lumen of centrioles by the inner scaffold, was mislocalized in mutant centrioles.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the centriole proximal end might be properly formed in mutant centrioles. We found that the centriolar cartwheel protein, SASS6, was present within the lumen of control and mutant centrioles in S-phase. In control centrioles in G2-phase, SASS6 was restricted to just the proximal end. Surprisingly, SASS6 was elongated in all G2-phase mutant centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4F</xref>). We observed a similar phenotype with multiple other proximal-end proteins: CEP135, STIL, CPAP, and CEP44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the entire proximal end is elongated in mutant centrioles. The extended localization of proximal end proteins was not due to increased protein expression in mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that loss of TEDC1, TEDC2, TUBD1, or TUBE1 results in elongated proximal end domains within mutant centrioles.</p><p>Elongation of the proximal end of centrioles may also indicate an overall defect in centriole polarity. To test this hypothesis, we next determined whether these mutant centrioles might properly recruit proteins to their distal ends. We found that CETN2 and CP110, two proteins of the distal centriole, were localized to mutant centrioles and clearly marked one end of the centriole barrel in both S-phase and G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). We conclude that proximal-to-distal centriole polarity was unaffected in mutant centrioles, and proximal end elongation did not affect the recruitment of proteins to the centriole distal end. Together, these results indicate that centrioles lacking compound microtubules are unable to properly regulate the length of the proximal end.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mutant centrioles elongate further in mitosis before fragmenting</title><p>Centrioles lacking triplet microtubules undergo a futile cycle of formation and disassembly, but the mechanisms underlying disassembly are not well-understood. We first tested whether centriole loss in mutant centrioles may be due to loss of CEP295. CEP295 promotes centriole-to-centrosome conversion, a process in which pericentriolar material is recruited to newly-formed procentrioles. Cells lacking CEP295 form centrioles that disintegrate during the cell cycle due to a failure to undergo centriole-to-centrosome conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Using U-ExM, we found that CEP295 was present and normally localized within mutant centrioles in both S- and G2-phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We conclude that centriole loss in our mutants is unlikely to be due to loss of CEP295 localization, and therefore that TEDC1, TEDC2, TUBD1, and TUBE1 are likely part of a different pathway required for centriole stability through the cell cycle.</p><p>Next, we used U-ExM to visualize centriole loss during mitosis. We stained for the centriole wall (GT335), the centriole proximal end (SASS6) and the centriole distal end (CP110). In control cells, in which centrioles formed <italic>de novo</italic> after centrinone washout, multiple centrioles could be seen throughout mitosis, and SASS6 was lost from centrioles in anaphase-stage cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). By contrast, in prometaphase stage <italic>TUBD1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> or <italic>TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cells, we found that centrioles had a unique appearance: they were longer than normal, with an elongated proximal end marked by SASS6, and a CP110-positive cap. These two ends were connected by weak monoE staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). This phenotype is identical to our observations of centrioles in a prometaphase <italic>TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cell by TEM in our previous publication (Figure 2B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). After metaphase, centrioles in mutant cells were either completely absent, or had a fragmented appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>), with aggregates of staining that did not resemble true centrioles. We conclude that in our mutant cells, centrioles elongate in early mitosis to form an aberrant intermediate structure, followed by fragmentation in late mitosis.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutant centrioles elongate further in mitosis before fragmenting.</title><p>U-ExM of centrioles stained for monoE (GT335, cyan), CP110 (yellow) and SASS6 (magenta).

Previously, we showed that loss of either of these proteins from mammalian cultured cell lines results in the same phenotype: loss of the triplet microtubules and a futile cycle of centriole formation and disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we add two new proteins to this pathway: TEDC1 and TEDC2, which were originally identified by their association with TUBD1 and TUBE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>). Loss of TEDC1 or TEDC2 phenocopies the loss of TUBD1 or TUBE1: aberrant centrioles are formed that lack triplet microtubules and disintegrate during passage through mitosis. TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize to centrioles, indicating that they have a direct role in forming or maintaining centriole structure, and their localization depends on each of the other three proteins within the complex. All four proteins physically interact with each other. Using our mutant cell lines, we interrogated whether any of these proteins can form subcomplexes within cells. We found that TEDC1 and TEDC2 can interact with each other independently of the tubulins, supporting a predicted AlphaFold-Multimer model. Together, these results indicate that these four proteins act together in a complex at centrosomes to form or stabilize the compound microtubules.</p><p>While the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of this complex are unknown, an attractive model is that the tetrameric complex forms a structural component of centrioles. Our AlphaFold models indicate that such a structure would be approximately 13 nm in length and 6 nm in width. Within procentrioles and the proximal region of the parental centriole, it is possible that these four proteins help form the A-C linker, the pinhead, or the triplet base. Recently, components of the A-C linker have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bournonville et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laporte et al., 2024</xref>), and three of the proteins in our complex (TEDC2, TUBD1, and TUBE1) had shared co-dependencies with A-C linker components using DepMap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bournonville et al., 2024</xref>). The A-C linker is lost from our mutant centrioles, but it is not clear whether this is because these proteins have a direct role in forming A-C linkers or whether this reflects an indirect role of the triplet microtubules in stabilizing A-C linkers. We note that it is also possible that only some proteins of the complex, such as delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin, form structural components of centrioles, or that the complex may interact transiently with centrioles. Future experiments will reveal the mechanisms by which these proteins act.</p><p>Using ultrastructure expansion microscopy, we find that mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules exhibit additional major architectural defects, including absence of the inner scaffold and elongation of the proximal end. We propose that the absence of the inner scaffold arises from the loss of the B- and C-tubules within centrioles, which may serve to anchor WDR90 and/or other proteins of the inner scaffold. WDR90 has been proposed to localize to the inner junction between the A- and B-tubules and is required for recruiting other inner scaffold components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Le Guennec et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steib et al., 2020</xref>). We find that mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules fail to localize WDR90, and thus speculate that the B-tubule is required to recruit or stabilize WDR90 at the inner junction. In addition, by cryo-electron tomography, the inner scaffold makes connections to all three (A-, B-, and C-) tubules. Although the identities of all the proteins that form these connections have not been determined, it is possible that mutant centrioles with only A-tubules also fail to provide anchoring sites for the other proteins within the inner scaffold. Together, these results demonstrate that the compound microtubules of centrioles are required for proper formation of the inner helical scaffold of the central core.</p><p>Mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules have an elongated proximal end that extends the entire length of the centriole, as marked by multiple proximal end markers (SASS6, CEP135, STIL, CPAP, CEP44). These results are also supported by our previous observations that by TEM, the lumen of <italic>TUBD1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>TUBE1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant centrioles are filled with electron-dense material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate proximal end length, though centrioles from the symbiotic flagellate <italic>Trichonympha</italic> bear an elongated proximal region with extended cartwheel, and the doublet and singlet-bearing centrioles from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> have cartwheels that extend the entire length of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guichard and Gönczy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guichard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Woglar et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that the triplet microtubules, the inner scaffold, and/or the TUBD1/TUBE1/TEDC1/TEDC2 protein complex might act to limit the length of the proximal end. Recently, loss of the inner scaffold protein POC1A has been shown to result in centrioles with extended regions of some proximal proteins, including CEP44, CEP135, and CEP295, indicating that the inner scaffold regulates the extent of these proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sala et al., 2024</xref>). Interestingly, unlike our mutant centrioles which have singlet microtubules, <italic>POC1A<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant centrioles can form triplet microtubules and do not have extended SASS6 staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sala et al., 2024</xref>). This suggests that the height of the cartwheel may be regulated by the triplet microtubules. The cartwheel and centriolar microtubules have been proposed to assemble interdependently to impart ninefold symmetry upon the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hilbert et al., 2016</xref>), and it is possible that interdependent assembly also regulates the height of the cartwheel.</p><p>Many aspects of centriole architecture, including formation of the distal tip, centriole length regulation prior to mitosis, acquisition of post-translational modifications, establishment of proximal-distal polarity, and recruitment of proteins required for centriole-to-centrosome conversion, are unaffected in mutant centrioles. These results indicate that the proteins that regulate these processes can act upon the A-tubule independently of the B- and C-tubules.</p><p>Here, we also extend our previous observations of centriole loss in mutant centrioles. In most cell types, centrioles are inherited by daughter cells during each mitosis. Centriole loss is not unique to centrioles lacking compound microtubules: mammalian cells engineered to lack CEP295 also form centrioles that are lost through the cell cycle, due to an inability to undergo centriole to centrosome conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izquierdo et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, down-regulation of Polo kinase and pericentriolar material triggers centriole elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pimenta-Marques et al., 2016</xref>). We find that CEP295 is properly localized in mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules, indicating that centriole loss in this context may be independent of centriole to centrosome conversion and pericentriolar material recruitment. Using expansion microscopy, we find that centriole loss is correlated with loss of the SASS6 cartwheel in mitosis. In this regard, mutant centrioles with singlet microtubules resemble centriole loss within <italic>C. elegans</italic> oocytes, in which an analogous structure to the cartwheel named the central tube is lost prior to centriole widening and subsequent loss of the centriolar microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pierron et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, centriole loss in our mutant cells occurs through a stereotyped progression of architectural changes in mitosis, starting with centriole over elongation in prometaphase and culminating with centriole fragmentation and loss. Prolonged mitotic arrest has been reported to result in centriole over elongation through Plk1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kong et al., 2020</xref>), and it is possible that a lengthened mitosis, as observed in these mutant cells and cells lacking centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farrell et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), may also result in over elongation of mutant centrioles with just A-tubules. In addition, we note that CPAP has an expanded domain in mutant centrioles compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vásquez-Limeta et al., 2022</xref>). CPAP is involved in slow processive microtubule growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sharma et al., 2016</xref>) and its loss results in centriole fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vásquez-Limeta et al., 2022</xref>), and it is possible that CPAP mislocalization may also contribute to over elongation of these mutant centrioles. Future work will determine the molecular mechanisms by which mutant centrioles lacking triplet microtubules are disassembled through the cell cycle.</p><p>Finally, we note that mutant human centrioles lacking compound microtubules bear similarities to the centrioles of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, which have evolved to lack triplet microtubules and have cartwheels extending the entire length of the centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pelletier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Woglar et al., 2022</xref>). Embryonic centrioles in both species are shorter than that of other organisms, and helical inner scaffolds have not been reported. In both species, these diminished centrioles participate in mitosis, can duplicate their centrioles, and serve as basal bodies for sensory cilia. We speculate that centrioles with triplet microtubules and the proteins they anchor, including the inner scaffold, may be required for centriole function in organisms with motile cilia, perhaps to help stabilize the basal body against ciliary movement. Such activity has been described for <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> basal bodies, and mutating an inner scaffold protein, Poc1, results in abnormal bending within basal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Junker et al., 2022</xref>). Further supporting this hypothesis, <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatocytes, one of the few cells within this species with motile cilia, have basal bodies with triplet microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">González et al., 1998</xref>). We note that these spermatocytes likely form triplet microtubules in an alternative manner, as <italic>Drosophila</italic> lacks delta-tubulin or epsilon-tubulin.</p><p>In conclusion, this work, along with our previously published study, identifies proteins required for the formation or maintenance of the centriolar triplet microtubules and maps the requirements of these proteins and the triplets in centriole architecture. Together, these results pave the way for deeper molecular understanding of the mechanisms by which the triplet microtubules are formed and maintained reproducibly within cells to form robust centrioles and cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

First, we used an alternative super-resolution approach, a Yokogawa CSU-W1 SoRA confocal scanner (resolution = 120 nm) and imaged cells grown on coverslips (not expanded). We found that TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize to procentrioles and the proximal end of parental centrioles (Fig 2 – Supplementary Figure 1a, b). Second, we used a recently described expansion gel chemistry (Kong et al., Methods Mol Biol 2024) combined with Abberior Star red and orange secondary antibodies. This technique resulted in robust signal at centrosomes and in the cytoplasm and indicated that TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize near the centriole walls of procentrioles and the proximal region of parental centrioles, near CEP44 (Fig 2 – Supplementary Figure 1c, d). These results complement and support our initial observations (Fig 2C, D) and we have edited the text to reflect this (lines 157-163). We also note that these Flag tag and V5 tag primary antibodies are specific and have little background signal in all applications (Fig 2 – Supplementary Fig 1E-J), while other commercially available antibodies against these tags did exhibit non-specific signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The cell cycle classifications of centrioles would strongly benefit, apart from a better description, from adding quantifications of average centriole length at a given stage based on tubulin staining (not acTub).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these recommendations. We have added an improved description of our cell cycle analyses (lines 234-237). We have also added new analyses for centriole length as measured by staining with alpha-tubulin (Fig 4 – Supp 3 and Fig 4 – Supp 4). We find that in all mutants, acetylated tubulin elongates along with alpha-tubulin in a similar way as control centrioles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific points:</p><p>(1) The introduction is a bit oddly structured. About halfway through it summarizes what is going to be presented in the study, giving the impression that it is about to conclude, but then continues with additional, detailed introduction paragraphs. Overall, the authors may also want to consider making it more concise.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and have shortened and restructured the introduction for clarity and conciseness.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The text should explain to the non-expert reader why endogenous proteins are not detected and why exogenously expressed, tagged versions are used. Related to this, the authors state overexpression, but what is this assessment based on? Does expression at the endogenous level also rescue? At least by western blot, these questions should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the text, we have added clarification about why endogenous proteins were not detected for immunofluorescence (lines 149-151). To quantify the overexpression, we have added Western blots of TEDC1 and TEDC2 to Fig 1 – Supplementary Figure 1E,F. We note that endogenous levels of both proteins are very low, and the rescue constructs are overexpressed 20 to 70 fold above endogenous levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The figures should clearly indicate when tagged proteins are used and detected.</p><p>Currently, this info is only found in the legends but should be in the figure panels as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these changes to the figure panels in Fig 2, Fig 2 – Supp 1, and Fig 3.</p><p>(4) I could not find a description and reference to Figure 2 Supplement 2 and 3.</p><p>We have replaced these supplements with new supplementary figures for TEDC1 and TEDC2 localization (Fig 2 – Supp 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The multiple bands including unspecific (?) bands should be labeled to guide the reader in the western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>We have labeled nonspecific bands in our Western blots with asterisks (Fig 1 – Supp 1, Fig 3)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The alphafold prediction suggests that TUBD1 can bind to the TED complex in the absence of TUBE1 can this be shown? This would be a nice validation of the predicted architecture of the complex. I also missed a bit of a discussion of the predicted architecture. How could it be linked to triplet microtubule formation? Is the latest alphafold version 3 adding anything to this analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>In our pulldown experiments, we found that TUBD1 cannot bind to TEDC1 or TEDC2 in the absence of TUBE1 (Fig 3C, D, IB: TUBD1). We performed this experiment with three biological replicates and found the same result. It is possible that TUBD1 and TUBE1 form an intact heterodimer, similar to alpha-tubulin and beta-tubulin, and this will be an exciting area of future research.</p><p>We have added new analysis from AlphaFold3 (Fig 3 – Supp 1B). AlphaFold3 predicts a similar structure as AlphaFold Multimer.</p><p>We have also added additional discussion about the AlphaFold prediction to the text (lines 220-222, 365-367). Thanks to the reviewer for pointing out this oversight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) I suggest briefly explaining in the text how cells and centrioles at different cell cycle stages were identified. I found some info in the legend of Figure 1, but no info for other figures or in the text. Related to this, how are procentrioles defined in de novo formation? There is no parental centriole to serve as a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a brief explanation of the synchronization and identification in lines 234-237. We have also clarified the text regarding <italic>de novo</italic> centrioles, and now term these “de novo centrioles in the first cell cycle after their formation” (lines 271-272).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Related to point 7: using acetylated tubulin as a universal length and width marker seems unreliable since it is a PTM. The authors should use general tubulin staining to estimate centriole dimensions, or at least establish that acetylated tubulin correlates well with the overall tubulin signal in all mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two supplementary data figures (Fig 4 – supp 3 and Fig 4 – supp 4) in which we co-stain control and mutant centrioles with alpha-tubulin. We found that acetylated tubulin marked mutant centrioles well and as alpha-tubulin length increased, acetylated tubulin length also increased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Presence and absence of various centriolar proteins. These analyses lack a clear reference for the precise centriole elongation stage. This is particularly problematic for proteins that are recruited at specific later stages (such as inner scaffold proteins). The staining should be correlated with centriole length measurements, ideally using general tubulin staining.</p></disp-quote><p>As described for point 8, we have added two supplementary data figures in which we costain control and mutant centrioles with alpha-tubulin and found that acetylated tubulin also increases as overall tubulin length increases in all mutants. We note that inner scaffold proteins are absent in all our mutant centrioles at all stages of the cell and centriole cycle, as also previously reported for POC5 in Wang et al., 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Here's a list of points I think could be improved:</p><p>- As the authors previously published, the centriole appears to have a smaller internal diameter than mature centrioles. Could the authors measure to see if the phenotype is identical? Is the centriole blocked in the bloom phase (Laporte et al. 2024)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional supplementary figure (Fig 4 – supp 5) to show that mutant centrioles have smaller diameters than mature centrioles, as we previously reported for the delta-tubulin and epsilon-tubulin mutant centrioles by EM. We thank the reviewers for the additional question of the bloom phase. Given the comparatively smaller number of centrioles we analyzed in this paper compared to Laporte et al (50 to 80 centrioles per condition here, versus 800 centrioles in Laporte et al), it is difficult to definitively conclude whether there is a block in bloom phase. This would be an interesting area for future research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The images of the centrioles in EM are beautiful. Would it be possible to apply a symmetrisation on it to better see the centriolar structures? For example, is the A-C linker present?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. Using centrioleJ, we find that the A-C linker is absent from mutant centrioles. The symmetrized images have been added to Fig 1 – Supplementary Fig 2, and additional discussion has been added to the text (line 143-144, line 368-374).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- How many EM images were taken? Did the centrioles have 100% A-microtubule only or sometimes with B-MT?</p></disp-quote><p>For TEM, we focused on centrioles that were positioned to give perfect cross-section images of the centriolar microtubules, and thus did not take images of off-angle or rotated centrioles. Given the difficulty of this experiment (centrioles are small structures within the cell, centrosomes are single-copy organelles, and off-angle centrioles were not imaged), we were lucky to image 3 centrioles that were in perfect cross-section – 2 for <italic>Tedc1-/-</italic> and 1 for <italic>Tedc2-/-</italic>. Our images indicate that these centrioles only have A-tubules (Fig 1 – Supp Fig2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 2 - it would be preferable to write TEDC2-flag or TEDC1-flag and not TEDC2/1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It seems that Figures 2C and D aren't cited, and some of the data in the supplemental data are not described in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced these supplements with new supplementary figures for TEDC1 and TEDC2 localization (Fig 2 – Supp 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The signal in U-ExM with the anti-Flag antibody is heterogeneous. Did the authors test several anti-FLAG antibodies in U-ExM?</p></disp-quote><p>We tested several anti-Flag and anti-V5 antibodies for our analyses, and chose these because they have little background signal in all applications (Fig 2 – Supplementary Fig 1E-J). Other commercially available antibodies against these tags did exhibit non-specific signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The AlphaFold prediction is difficult to interpret, the authors should provide more views and the PDB file.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added 2 additional views of the AlphaFold prediction in Fig 3 – Supp 1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In general, but particularly for Figure 4: the length doesn't seem to be divided by the expansion factor, it is therefore difficult to compare with known EM dimensions. Can the authors correct the scale bars?</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected the scale bars for all figures to account for the expansion factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Concerning Gamma-tubulin that is &quot;recruited to the lumen of centrioles by the inner scaffold, had localization defects in mutant centrioles. However, we were unable to reliably detect gamma-tubulin within the lumen of control or de novo-formed centrioles in S or G2-phase (Figure 4 - Supplement 1E), and thus were unable to test this hypothesis&quot;. In Laporte et al 2024, Gamma-tubulin arrives later than the inner scaffold and only on mature centrioles, so this result appears to be in line with previous observation. However, the authors should be able to detect a proximal signal under the microtubules of the procentriole, is this the case?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an exciting question. However, in our expansion microscopy staining, we frequently observe that gamma-tubulin surrounds centrioles, corresponding to its role in the pericentriolar material (PCM). In our hands, we find it difficult to distinguish between centriolar gamma-tubulin at the base of the A-tubule from gamma-tubulin within the PCM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In the signal elongation of SAS-6, STIL, CEP135, CPAP, and CEP44, would it be possible to quantify the length of these signals (with dimensions divided by the expansion factor for comparison with known TEM distances)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have quantified the lengths of SAS-6 and CEP135 in new Fig 4 – Supp 3 and Fig 4 – Supp 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors observe that centrin is present, but only as a SFI1 dot-like localization (which is another protein that would be interesting to look at), and not an inner scaffold localization. Can the authors elaborate? These results suggest that the distal part is correctly formed with only a microtubule singlet.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s interpretation that the centriole distal tip is likely correctly formed with only singlet microtubules, as both distal centrin and CP110 are present. We have added this point to the discussion (line 415).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The authors observe that CPAP is elongated, but CPAP has two locations, proximal and distal. Is it distal or proximal elongation? Is the proximal signal of CPAP longer than that of CEP44 in the mutants? The authors discuss that the elongation could come from overexpression of CPAP, but here it seems that the centriole is not overlong, just the structures around the cartwheel.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. It is difficult for us to conclude whether the proximal or distal region is extended in the mutants, as our mutant centrioles lacks a visible separation between these two regions. It would be interesting to probe this question in the future by testing whether subdomains of CPAP may be differentially regulated in our mutants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It isn't apparent to me what was counted in Figure 1C. Were all centrioles (mother centrioles and procentrioles) counted? Where is the 40% in control cells coming from? Can this set of data be presented differently?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. In this figure, all centrioles were counted. We have updated the figure legend for clarity. We performed this analysis in a similar way as in Wang et al., 2017 to better compare phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2C. and the text lines 182-187: The ultrastructural characterization of TEDC1 and TEDC2 suffers from the low quality of the TEDC1 and TEDC2 signals obtained postexpansion. In comparison with robust low-resolution immunosignal, it appears that most of the signal cannot be recovered after expansion. Another sub-resolution imaging method to re-analyze TEDC1 and TEDC22 localization would be essential. The same concern applies to Figures 2 - Supplement 2 and 3. Also, Figure 2 - Supplement 2 and Supplement 3 do not seem to be cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these recommendations. As also mentioned above, we used an alternative super-resolution approach, a Yokogawa CSU-W1 SoRA confocal scanner (resolution = 120 nm), and found that TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize to procentrioles and the proximal end of parental centrioles (Fig 2 – Supplementary Figure 1a, b). Second, we used a recently described expansion gel chemistry (Kong et al., Methods Mol Biol 2024) combined with Abberior Star red and orange secondary antibodies. This technique resulted in robust signal at centrosomes and in the cytoplasm and indicated that TEDC1 and TEDC2 localize near the centriole walls of procentrioles and the proximal region of parental centrioles, near CEP44 (Fig 2 – Supplementary Figure 1c, d). These stainings complement and support our initial observations (Fig 2C, D) and we have edited the text to reflect this (lines 157-163). We have also removed the supplementary figures that were uncited in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>TUBD1 and TUBE1 form a dimer and TEDC2 and TEDC1 can interact. Any speculation as to why TEDC2 does not pull down both TUBE1 and TUBD1?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. TEDC2 does pull down both TUBE1 and TUBD1 (Fig 3D, pull-down, second column, Tedc2-V5-APEX2 rescuing the <italic>Tedc2-/-</italic> cells pulls down TUBD1, TUBE1, and TEDC1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4A and B. The authors use acetylated tubulin to determine the length of procentrioles in the S and G2 phases. However, procentrioles are not acetylated on their distal ends in these cell phase phases (as the authors also mention further in the text). Why has alpha tubulin not been used since it works well in U-ExM? The average size of the control, G2 procentrioles, seems too small in Figure 4A and not consistent with other imaging data (for instance, in Figure 4 - Supplement 1 C, Cp110, and CPAP staining). There is no statistical analysis in F4A.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two supplementary data figures (Fig 4 – supp 3 and Fig 4 – supp 4) in which we co-stain control and mutant centrioles with alpha-tubulin. We found that acetylated tubulin correlates well with overall tubulin signal in all mutants. We have added statistical analysis to the figure legend of Fig 4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 260 - 262: &quot;These results indicate that centrioles with singlet microtubules can elongate to the same length as controls, and therefore that triplet microtubules are not essential for regulating centriole length.&quot; It is hard to agree with this statement. Mutant procentrioles show aberrantly elongated proximal signals of several tested proteins. In addition, in lines 326 - 328, the authors state that &quot;Together, these results indicate that centrioles lacking compound microtubules are unable to properly regulate the length of the proximal end.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer and have clarified the statement to state that these results indicate that centrioles with singlet microtubules can elongate to the same overall length as control centrioles in G2 phase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 353: The authors suggest that elongated procentriole structure in mitosis may represent intermediates in centriole disassembly. Another interpretation, more in line with the EM data from Wang et al., 2017, would be that these mutant procentrioles first additionally elongate before they disassemble in late mitosis. The aberrant intermediate structure concept would need further exploration. For instance, anti-alpha/beta-tubulin antibodies could be used to investigate centriole microtubules.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion and have edited this section for clarity (lines 341-343): “We conclude that in our mutant cells, centrioles elongate in early mitosis to form an aberrant intermediate structure, followed by fragmentation in late mitosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>References need to be included in lines 122, 277, 279.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these references</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 281: Add references PMID: 30559430 and PMID: 32526902.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added these references (lines 265-266).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 289: &quot;Moreover, our results suggest that centriole glutamylation is a multistep process, in which long glutamate side chains are added later during centriole maturation.&quot; This does not seem like an original observation.
