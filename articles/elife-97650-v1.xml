Various theories have been proposed but their experimental test has been hampered by the unpredictable and improbable malignant transformation of single cells. Here, using an optogenetic approach we permanently turn on an oncogene (KRASG12V) in a single cell of a zebrafish brain that, only in synergy with the transient co-activation of a reprogramming factor (VENTX/NANOG/OCT4), undergoes a deterministic malignant transition and robustly and reproducibly develops within 6 days into a full-blown tumor.

Notably, mutant KRAS is the most frequent driver of several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">COSMIC, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Punekar et al., 2022</xref>): about 27% of all human cancers, 45% of colorectal, and 90% of pancreatic cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that genes involved in embryonic development, pluri/multipotency, and cell reprogramming such as VENTX/NANOG and POU5/OCT4 are abnormally reactivated in late cancer stages, where acting as Epigenetic Drivers (Epi-Drivers) they empower cancer cells with cancer stem cell (CSCs) features, resistance to anticancer therapies, and potential for cancer recurrence/relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogelstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hepburn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Villodre et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ducos et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rawat et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laise, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2021</xref>). Although it is evident that such Epi-Drivers confer a selective advantage to CSCs in a full-blown cancer, whether they play a role during the early phases of malignant transformation is still unknown.</p><p>Current approaches to the study of cancer use constitutive or conditional expression of Mut-driver (or Epi-driver genes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shibata et al., 2018</xref>) in specific tissues, i.e., in many cells, even though only a small subset of these cells eventually leads to the growth of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adashek et al., 2020</xref>), often observed when the tumor already consists of many thousands of heterogeneous abnormal cells. Hence, carcinogenetic processes observed among sibling organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baggiolini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablain et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>) occur with variable latency period from the onset of induction, at different locations and develop asynchronously. As a result, the initial stages of tumorigenesis are difficult to study, the state of the cell(s) of origin difficult to assess and control while its cellular environment is perturbed by the induced expression of the Mut- or Epi-driver genes. Due to the rarity of the event in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>)<italic>,</italic> a statistically relevant single-cell tracking and characterization of the early stages of tumorigenesis has therefore never been done. This emphasizes the need to predict or control the cell undergoing malignant transformation in vivo in order to pave the way for a study of the cellular and molecular events involved in the initial stages of tumorigenesis.</p><p>To address these issues, we have developed an optogenetic approach to control the expression of an oncogene in a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feng et al., 2017</xref>), with the goals of: (1) measuring the probability of the malignant transformation of a single cell in a live organism in various backgrounds and (2) tracking and characterizing the development of a tumor from the original cell. In the following we show the synergy between only two factors: the oncogene kRasG12V and a reprogramming factor (Ventx, Nanog, or Oct4) increases the probability of carcinogenesis from a single cell by many orders of magnitude when compared to the expression of either of these genes (or none).</p><p>Optogenetics approaches allow for the photocontrol and monitoring of the activity of biomolecules in vivo. The approach we developed uses a photoactivable analog of tamoxifen (caged cyclofen [cCYC]) to control the activity of proteins fused to the ERT-receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) (a modified estrogen binding domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). These protein constructs are sequestered by cytoplasmic chaperones. Once cCYC is uncaged by light (with one-photon illumination at ~375 nm or two-photon at ~750 nm), cyclofen (CYC) is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sinha et al., 2010</xref>). It binds to the ERT-receptor and releases the fused protein (e.g. a Cre-ERT recombinase) from its complex with cytoplasmic chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic setup for single-cell induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photocontrol of a protein fused to an estrogen receptor (ERT) is achieved by releasing the protein from its complex with cytoplasmic chaperones (CC), upon uncaging of caged cyclofen (cCYC).

Notice that metastatic cells must be the progeny of the initial (blue fluorescent) cell as the larvae are incubated in embryo medium with no cCYC.

Despite the frequency of mutational insults, which are often caused by external cues (chemical carcinogens, UV, etc.) or senescence/aging, it is known that surveillance mechanisms like cell competition between wild-type and mutated cells safeguard tissue homeostasis and results in active elimination of mutant cells from the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Porazinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Neerven and Vermeulen, 2023</xref>). Our data imply that the aberrant reactivation of Epi-Driver genes involved in reprogramming/pluripotency may promote the irreversible and deterministic malignant transformation in the cell of origin of cancer leading to carcinogenesis.</p><p>Our hypothesis is further strengthened by the observation that the variation in cancer risk among tissues can be related to the number of stem cell divisions and tissue renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tomasetti and Vogelstein, 2015</xref>). The aberrant reactivation (or maintenance) of Epi-Driver genes in these regenerative events, in cooperation with incident mutations, might be the key deterministic factor in the switching of a normal/healthy cell into the first cell of origin of cancer.</p><p>Furthermore, the results reported here are compatible with the recently proposed ‘ground state theory of cancer initiation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jassim et al., 2023</xref>). According to that theory a malignant transformation may occur in a cell harboring an oncogenic mutation upon a change of its functional state (its ‘ground state’). Here, the transient activation of a reprogramming factor (i.e. Ventx, Nanog, or Oct4) possibly synergizes with the oncogene to alter the epigenetic and functional state of the cell allowing its transformation into a tumorigenic cell.</p><p>This may also explain the apparent discrepancy between the present deterministic and rapid tumor development upon activation in a single cell of both kRasG12V and a reprogramming factor and the reports of stochastic and random tumor development over weeks following activation of kRasG12V in a whole tissue (brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ju et al., 2015</xref>], pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oh and Park, 2019</xref>], or intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lu et al., 2018</xref>]). In the latter case, transformed cells may have been triggered to undergo a malignant transformation by the stochastic activation of a reprogramming factor/Epi-Driver, which is consistent with the recent finding that cancer initiation might occur by transient perturbations of epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Parreno et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our observation that the progeny of the cell(s) of origin of cancer display a short-range dispersal within the tissue during the earliest phases of tumorigenesis and prior to the effective appearance of tumor mass corroborates a recent theoretical model predicting such an early dispersal during carcinogenesis to explain heterogeneity, therapeutic resistance, and tumor relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Waclaw et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Being the first experiments to predictably and noninvasively control the malignant transformation of a single cell in an unaltered microenvironment, our approach opens a new vista on the study of ‘the cell of origin of cancer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain, 2013</xref>), an acknowledged enigma of cancer research. As such our results raise many questions: what mechanisms are at work in the transition from the preprocancer state to a tumorigenic state? Is the aberrant reactivation of reprogramming factors a key step in the initiation of carcinogenesis, independent of age, tissue, or oncogenic mutation? Do drugs against reprogramming factors reduce the probability of carcinogenesis? Conversely, do some carcinogens (e.g. environmental pollutants, pesticides, endocrine disruptors, etc.) act by reactivating those factors?</p><p>By allowing for specific and reproducible single-cell malignant transformation in vivo, our optogenetic approach opens the way for a quantitative study of the initial stages of cancer at the single-cell level (e.g. tracking and characterization), that will allow one to address many of these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish lines and maintenance</title><p>Zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were raised and maintained in an approved Fish Facility (C75-05-32 at IBENS) on a 14–10 hr light-dark diurnal cycle with standard culture methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westerfield, 2000</xref>).

Using genetically defined zebrafish models, the authors can inducibly express the KRASG12V oncogene using a combination of Cre/Lox transgenes further controlled by optogenetically inducible Cre-activated (CreER fusion that becomes active with light-induced uncaging of a tamoxifen-analogue in a targeted region of the zebrafish embryo). They further show that transient expression and activation of a pluripotency factor (e.g. Ventx fused to a GR receptor that is activated with addition of dexamethasone) must occur in the model in order for overgrowth of cells to occur. This paper describes a genetically tractable and modifiable system for studying the requirements for inducing cellular hyperplasia in a whole organism by combining overexpression of canonical genetic drivers of cancer (like Ras) with epigenetic modifiers (like specific transcription factors), which could be used to study an array of combinations and temporal relationships of these cancer drivers/modifiers.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The combination of Cre/lox inducible gene expression with potentially localized optogenetic induction (CreER and uncaging of tamoxifen analogues) of recombination as well as inducible activation of a transcription factor expressed via mRNA injection (GR-fusion to the TF and dex induction) offers a flexible system for manipulating cell growth, identity, and transcriptional programs. With this system, the authors establish that Ras activation and at least transient Ventx overexpression are together required to induce a hyperproliferative phenotype in zebrafish tissues.</p><p>The ability to live image embryos over the course of days with inducible fluorophores indicating recombination events and transgene overexpression offers a tractable in vivo system for studying hyperplastic cells in the context of a whole organism.</p><p>The transplant experiments demonstrate the ability of the induced hyperplastic cells to grow upon transfer to new host.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is minimal quantitation of key aspects of the system, most critically in the efficiency of activation of the Ras-TFP fusion (Fig 1) in, purportedly, a single cell. The authors note &quot;On average the oncogene is then activated in a single cell, identified within ~1h by the blue fluorescence of its nuclear marker but no additional quantitative information is provided. For a system that is aimed at &quot;a statistically relevant single-cell</p><p>tracking and characterization of the early stages of tumorigenesis&quot;, such information seems essential.</p><p>The authors indicate that a single cell is &quot;initiated&quot; (Fig 2) using the laser optogenetic technique, but without definitive genetic lineage tracing, it is not possible to conclude that cells expressing TFP distant from the target site near the ear are daughter cells of the claimed single &quot;initiated&quot; cell. A plausible alternative explanation is (1) that the optogenetic targeting is more diffuse (i.e. some of the light of the appropriate wavelength hits other cells nearby due to reflection/diffraction), so these adjacent cells are additional independent &quot;initiated&quot; cells or (2) that the uncaged tamoxifen analogue can diffuse to nearby cells and allow for CreER activation and recombination. In Fig 2B, the claim is made that &quot;the activated cell has divided, giving rise to two cells&quot; - unless continuously imaged or genetically traced, this is unproven. In addition, it appears that Figures S3 and S4 are showing that hyperplasica can arise in many different tissues (including intestine, pancreas, and liver, S4C) with broad Ras + Ventx activation (while unclear from the text, it appears these embryos were broadly activated and were not &quot;single cell activated using the set-up in Fig 1E? This should be clarified in the manuscript). In Fig S7 where single cell activation and potential metastasis is discussed, similar gut tissues have TFP+ cells that are called metastatic, but this seems consistent with the possibility that multiple independent sites of initiation are occurring even when focal activation is attempted.</p><p>Although the hyperplastic cells are transplantable (Fig 4), the use of the term &quot;cells of origin of cancer&quot; or metastatic cells should be viewed with care in the experiments showing TFP+ cells (Fig 1, 2, 3) in embryos with targeted activation for the reasons noted above.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have clarified and strengthened a number of important conclusions/claims.</p><p>In Figure 4, the requirement for both kRas and VentX activation for successful transplant and survival of transplanted activated cells does indeed support the need for both MAPK activation and the reprogramming factor. A limitation remains that, as in a tail vein injection in a mouse model, this may be a better measure of the ability of disbursed cells to survive in the embryo, and not &quot;native&quot; metastatic behavior as cells may just lodge in ectopic sites, and survive, but not exhibit complete metastatic potential. Still, these are interesting and important results about the combination effects of an oncogene and a reprogramming factor.</p><p>Further, the addition of Fig 2A and additional explanation in the text on the specificity of the light-induced activation of the Ras and/or VentX supports that transgene induction is indeed limited to one or a few cells. We agree that visual tracking of daughter cells over days is technically challenging and will be a revealing and exciting potential addition in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97650.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employs an optogenetics approach aimed at activating oncogene (KRASG12V) expression in a single somatic cell, with a focus on following the progression of activated cell to examine tumourigenesis probabilities under altered tissue environments. The research explores the role of stemness factors (VENTX/NANOG/OCT4) in facilitating oncogenic RAS (KRASG12V)-driven malignant transformations. Although the evidence provided is incomplete, the authors propose an important mechanism whereby reactivation of re-programming factors correlates with the increased likelihood of a mutant cell undergoing malignant transformation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>· Innovative Use of Optogenetics: The application of optogenetics for precise activation of KRAS in a single cell is valuable to the field of cancer biology, offering an opportunity to uncover insight into cellular responses to oncogenic mutations.</p><p>· Important Observations: The findings concerning stemness factors' role in promoting oncogenic transformation are important, contributing data to the field of cancer biology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Lack of Methodological Clarity: The manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of methodologies, making it difficult to fully evaluate the experimental design and reproducibility, rendering incomplete evidence to support the conclusion. Improving methodological transparency and data presentation will crucially strengthen the paper's contributions to understanding the complex processes of tumorigenesis.</p><p>Sub-optimal Data Presentation and Quality:</p><p>The resolution of images through-out the manuscript are too low. Images presented in Figure 2 and Figure 4 are of very low resolution. It is very hard to distinguish individual cells and in which tissue they might reside.</p><p>Lack of quantitative data and control condition data obtained from images of higher magnification limits the ability to robustly support the conclusions.</p><p>Here are some details:</p><p>· Tissue specificity of the cells express KRASG12V oncogene: In this study, the ubiquitin promoter was used to drive oncogenic KRASG12V expression. Despite this, the authors claim to activate KRAS in a single brain cell based on their localized photo-activation strategy. However, upon reviewing the methods section, the description was provided that 'Localized uncaging was performed by illumination for 7 minutes on a Nikon Ti microscope equipped with a light source peaking at 405 nm, Figure 1. The size of the uncaging region was controlled by an iris that defines a circular illumination with a diameter of approximately 80 μm.' It is surprising that an epi-fluorescent microscope with an illumination diameter of around 80μm can induce activation in a single brain cell beneath skin tissue. Additionally, given that the half-life for mTFP maturation is around 60 minutes, it is likely that more cells from a variety of different lineages could be activated, but the fluorescence would not be visible until more than 1-hour post-illumination. Authors might want to provide more evidence to support their claim on the single cell KRAS activation.</p><p>· Stability of cCYC: The manuscript does not provide information on the half-life and stability of cCYC. Understanding these properties is crucial for evaluating the system's reliability and the likelihood of leakiness, which could significantly influence the study's outcomes.</p><p>· Metastatic Dissemination claim: Typically, metastatic cancer cells migrate to and proliferate within specific niches that are conducive to outgrowth, such as the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) or liver. In Figure 3 A, an image showing the presence of mTFP expressing cells in both the head and tail regions of the larva, with additional positive dots located at the fin fold. This is interpreted as &quot;metastasis&quot; by the authors. However, the absence of supportive cellular compartment within the fin-fold tissue makes the presence of mTFP-positive metastatic cells there particularly puzzling. This distribution raises concerns about the spatial specificity of the optogenetic activation protocol.</p><p>The unexpected locations of these signals suggest potential ectopic activation of the KRAS oncogene, which could be occurring alongside or instead of targeted activation. This issue is critical as it could affect the interpretation of whether the observed mTFP signal expansion over time is due to actual cell proliferation and infiltration, or merely a result of ectopic RAS transgene activation.</p><p>· Image Resolution Concerns: The cells depicted in Figure 3C β, which appear to be near the surface of the yolk sac and not within the digestive system as suggested in the MS, underscore the necessity for higher-resolution imaging. Without clearer images, it is challenging to ascertain the exact locations and states of these cells, thus complicating the assessment of experimental results.</p><p>· The cell transplantation experiment is lacking protocol details: The manuscript does not adequately describe the experimental protocols used for cell transplantation, particularly concerning the origin and selection of cells used for injection into individual larvae. This omission makes it difficult to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the results. Such as the source of transplanted cells:</p><p>• If the cells are derived from hyperplastic growths in larvae where RAS and VX (presumably VENTX) were locally activated, the manuscript fails to mention any use of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to enrich mTFP-positive cells. Such a method would be crucial for ensuring the specificity of the cells being studied and the validity of the results.</p><p>• If the cells are obtained from whole larvae with induced RAS + VX expression, it is notable and somewhat surprising that the larvae survived up to six days post-induction (6dpi) before cells were harvested for transplantation. This survival rate and the subsequent ability to obtain single cell suspensions raise questions about the heterogeneity of the RAS + VX expressing cells that transplanted.</p><p>· Unclear Experimental Conditions in Figure S3B: The images in Figure S3B lack crucial details about the experimental conditions. It is not specified whether the activation of KRAS was targeted to specific cells or involved whole-body exposure. This information is essential for interpreting the scope and implications of the results accurately.</p><p>· Contrasting Data in Figure S3C compared to literatures: The graph in Figure S3C indicates that KRAS or KRAS + DEX induction did not result in any form of hyperplastic growth. This observation starkly contrasts with previous literature where oncogenic KRAS expression in zebrafish led to significant hyper-proliferation and abnormal growth, as evidenced by studies such as those published in and Neoplasia (2018), DOI: 10.1016/j.neo.2018.10.002; Molecular Cancer (2015), DOI: 10.1186/s12943-015-0288-2; Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms (2014) DOI: 10.1242/dmm.007831. The lack of expected hyperplasia raises questions about the experimental setup or the specific conditions under which KRAS was expressed. The authors should provide detailed descriptions of the conditions under which the experiments were conducted in Figure S3B and clarifying the reasons for the discrepancies observed in Figure S3C are crucial. The authors should discuss potential reasons for the deviation from previous reports.</p><p>Further comments:</p><p>Throughout the study, KRAS-activated cell expansion and metastasis are two key phenotypes discussed that Ventx is promoting. However, the authors did not perform any experiments to directly show that KRAS+ cells proliferate only in Ventx-activated conditions. The authors also did not show any morphological features or time-lapse videos demonstrating that KRAS+ cells are motile, even though zebrafish is an excellent model for in vivo live imaging. This seems to be a missed opportunity for providing convincing evidence to support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>There were minimal experimental details provided for the qPCR data presented in the supplementary figures S5 and S6, therefore, it is hard to evaluate results obtained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97650.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Scerbo</surname><given-names>Pierluigi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tisserand</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Delagrange</surname><given-names>Marine</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Debare</surname><given-names>Héloise</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bensimon</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ducos</surname><given-names>Bertrand</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>First, we thank the reviewers for a thorough reading of our paper and some useful comments. A recurrent remark of the reviewers concerns the appearance of kRas-expressing cells (labelled by a nuclear blue fluorescent marker) which we attribute to the progeny of the initially induced cell. The reviewers suggest that these cells may have been obtained through activation of the Cre-recombinase in other cells by cyclofen released from light scattering, via diffusion, leakiness, etc. These remarks are perfectly reasonable from people not familiar with the cyclofen uncaging approach that we are using, but are unwarranted as we shall show below.</p><p>We have been using cyclofen uncaging with subsequent activation of a Cre-recombinase (or some other proteins) since 2010 see ref.34, Sinha et al., Zebrafish 7, 199-204 (2010) and our 2018 review (ref.35, Zhang et al., ChemBioChem 19,1-8 (2018)). In our experiments, the embryos are incubated in the dark in 6µM caged cyclofen (cCyc) and washed in E3 medium (and transferred to a new medium with no cCyc). In these conditions, over many years we never observed activation of the recombinase, i.e. the appearance of the associated fluorescent label in cells of embryos grown in E3 medium. Hence leakiness can be ruled out (in presence of cCyc or in its absence).</p><p>Following transfer of the embryos to new E3 medium we illuminate the embryos locally with light at 405nm. In these conditions, cCyc is only partially uncaged and results in activation of Cre-recombinase in only a few cells (1,2, 3, …) within the illuminated region only, namely in the appearance of the kRas-associated nuclear blue fluorescent label in usually one cell (and sometimes in a few more). Data and statistics are now incorporated in the revised manuscript, see Fig.2A and S7. In absence of activation of a reprogramming factor these fluorescently labelled cells disappear within a few days (either via shut-down of their promotor, apoptosis or some other mechanism). The crucial point here is that we see less and not more kRas expressing cells (i.e. with nuclear blue fluorescence) in absence of VentX activation. This observation rules out activation of Cre-recombinase in other cells days after illumination due to leakiness, cyclofen released by light or diffusing from the illumination spot.</p><p>To observe many more fluorescent cells days after activation of the initial cell, one needs to transiently activate VentX-GR by overnight incubation in dexamethasone (DEX). Injecting the embryos at 1-cell stage with VentX-GR only or incubating them in DEX (without injection of VentX-GR) does not result in the appearance of more blue fluorescent cells. Following activation of VentX-GR, the fluorescent cells observed a couple of days after initiation are visualized in E3 medium (i.e. in absence of cyclofen) and are localized to the vicinity of the otic vesicle (the region where the initial cell was activated). In the revised manuscript we show images of these fluorescent cells taken a few days apart in the same embryo in which a single cell was initially activated (Fig.S8). Hence, we attribute these cells to the progeny of the activated cell. Obviously, single cell tracking via time-lapse microscopy would definitely nail down this issue and provide fascinating insight into the initial stages of tumor growth. Unfortunately, immobilization of embryos in the usual medium (e.g. MS222, tricaine) over 5-6 days to track the division and motion of single cells is not possible. We are considering some other possibilities (immobilization in bungarotoxin or via photo-activation of anionic channels), but these challenging experiments are for a future paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors then performed allotransplantations of allegedly single fluorescent TICs in recipient larvae and found a large number of fluorescent cells in distant locations, claiming that these cells have all originated from the single transplanted TIC and migrated away. The number of fluorescent cells showed in the recipient larve just after two days is not compatible with a normal cell cycle length and more likely represents the progeny of more than one transplanted cell.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the manuscript, we measure the density of cells/nl and inject in the yolk of 2dpf Nacre embryos a volume equivalent to about 1 cell, following published protocols (S.Nicoli and M.Presta, Nat.Prot. 2,2918 (2007)). We further image the injected cell(s) by fluorescence microscopy immediately following injection, as shown in Fig.4A and Fig.S8B. We might miss a few cells but not many. With a typical cell cycle of ~10h the images of tumors in larvae at 3dpt (and not 2dpt) correspond to ~100 cells. In any case the purpose of this experiment was to show that the progeny of the initial induced cell is capable of developing into a tumor in a naïve fish, which is the operational definition of cancer that we adopted here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ability to migrate from the injection site should be documented by time-lapse microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above our purpose here is not to study tumor formation from transplanted cell(s) but to use that assay as an operational test of cancer. Besides as mentioned earlier single cell tracking in larvea over 3-4dpt is not a trivial task.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then, the authors conclude that &quot;By allowing for specific and reproducible single cell malignant transformation in vivo, their optogenetic approach opens the way for a quantitative study of the initial stages of cancer at the single cell level&quot;. However, the evidence for these claims are weak and further characterization should be performed to:</p><p>(1) Show that they are actually activating the oncogene in a single cell (the magnification is too low and it is difficult to distinguish a single nucleus, labelling of the cell membrane may help to demonstrate that they are effectively activating the oncogene in, or transplanting, a single cell)</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript we provide larger magnification of the initial induced cell and show examples of oncogene activation in more than one cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The expression of the genes used as markers of tumorigenesis is performed in whole larvae, with only a few transformed cells in them. Changes should be confirmed in FACS sorted fluorescent cells</p></disp-quote><p>When the oncogene is activated in a whole larvae all cells are fluorescent and thus FACS is of no use for cell sorting. Sorting could be done in larvae where single cells are activated , but then the efficiency of FACS is not good enough to isolate the few fluorescent cells among the many more non-fluorescent ones. We agree that the expression change of the genes used as markers of tumorigenesis is an underestimate of their true change, but our goal at this time is not to precisely measure the change in expression level, but to show that the pattern of change was different from the controls and corresponded to what is expected in tumorigenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The histology of the so called &quot;tumor masses&quot; is not showing malignant transformation, but at the most just hyperplasia.</p></disp-quote><p>The histology of the hyperplasic tissues show cellular proliferation with a higher density of nuclear material which is characteristic of tumors, Fig.S4C. Besides the increased expression of pERK in these tissues, Fig.S4A,B is also a hallmark of cancer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the brain, the sections are not perfectly symmetrical and the increase of cellularity on one side of the optic tectum is compatible with this asymmetry.</p></disp-quote><p>The expected T-shape formed by the sections of the tegmentum and hypothalamus are compatible with the symmetric sections shown in Fg.2D. The asymmetry in the optic tectum is a result of the hyperplasic growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The number of fluorescent cells found dispersed in the larvae transplanted with one single TIC after 48 hours will require a very fast cell cycle to generate over 50 cells. Do we have an idea of the cell cycle features of the transplanted TICs?</p></disp-quote><p>As answered above, the transplanted larvae are shown at 3dpt. With a cell cycle of about 10h, a single cell can give rise to about 100 cells in that time lapse.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a genetically tractable and modifiable system …which could be used to study an array of combinations and temporal relationships of these cancer drivers/modifiers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this referee for its positive comments. We would also like to point out that our approach provides for the first quantitative means to estimate the probability of tumorigenesis from a single cell, an estimate which is crucial in any assessment of cancer malignancy and the effectiveness of prophylactics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There is minimal quantitation of … the efficiency of activation of the Ras-TFP fusion (Fig 1) in, purportedly, a single cell. …, such information seems essential.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more images of induction of a single (or a few cells) and a plot where the probability of RAS activation in one or a few cells is specified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors indicate that a single cell is &quot;initiated&quot; (Fig 2) using the laser optogenetic technique, but without definitive genetic lineage tracing, it is not possible to conclude that cells expressing TFP distant from the target site near the ear are daughter cells of the claimed single &quot;initiated&quot; cell.

The possibilities mentioned by this reviewer would result in cells expressing TFP in absence of VentX activation, which is NOT the case. Cells expressing TFP away from the initial site are observed DAYS after activation of the oncogene (and TFP) in a single cell and ONLY upon activation of VentX.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Fig 2B, the claim is made that &quot;the activated cell has divided, giving rise to two cells&quot; - unless continuously imaged or genetically traced, this is unproven.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this remark previously. Tracking of larvae over many days is not possible with the usual protocol using tricaine to immobilize the larvae. Nonetheless, in the revised version we present images of an embryo imaged at various times post activation (1hpi, 3dpi, 7dpi) where proliferation and metastasis of the cells can be observed. We are pursuing other alternatives for time-lapse microscopy over many days, since besides convincing the sceptics, a single cell tracking experiment (possibly coupled with in-situ spatial transcriptomics) will shed a new and fascinating light on the initial stages of tumor growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it appears that Figures S3 and S4 are showing that hyperplasia can arise in many different tissues (including intestine, pancreas, and liver, S4C with broad Ras + Ventx activation ….

This - to the best of our knowledge - is the operational definition of a malignant tumor. Notice also that transplantation of kRAS only activated cells (i.e. without subsequent activation of VentX) does NOT yield tumors, rather the transplanted cell disappears after a few days, see Fig.S10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study employs an optogenetics approach … to examine tumorigenesis probabilities under altered tissue environments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this remark, since we believe that the probability to assess the probability of tumorigenesis from a single cell is probably the most significant contribution of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Lack of Methodological Clarity: The manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of methodologies,</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional detail of our methodology and statistical analyses in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sub-optimal Data Presentation and Quality:</p><p>Lack of quantitative data and control condition data obtained from images of higher magnification limits the ability to robustly support the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included more images at higher magnification and quantitative data to support the main report of targeted single cell induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here are some details:</p><p>Authors might want to provide more evidence to support their claim on the single cell KRAS activation.</p></disp-quote><p>More images and a data on activation of single or few cells in the illumination field are provided as well as statistical analysis of cell induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Stability of cCYC: The manuscript does not provide information on the half-life and stability of cCYC.

Assessing the leakiness of the system is easy as expression of a fluorescent marker is permanently turned on.

The analysis on whole larvae provides an underestimate of the changes in gene expression following activation of kRAS and VentX. We are looking for spatial transcriptomics as a better approach of the changes in gene expression induced in single TICs and their progeny, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nuclear staining is necessary to make sure that only 1 cell was transplanted.

Thus we can see how many cells are transplanted. With a cell-cycle of about 10h in 3dpt, a single cell will have generated as many as 100 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor grammatical change - hyperplasic more commonly called hyperplastic.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Provide Detailed Methodologies: Clearly describe all experimental protocols used, particularly those for cell transplantation and photo-activation techniques.
