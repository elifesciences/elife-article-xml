For example, the <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> genome encodes a total of 40 proteins for cyclic di-GMP synthesis and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ryan et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> encodes 22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Levi et al., 2011</xref>), and <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> encodes at least 11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). Genes encoding proteins of similar function are commonly acquired either through gene duplication events or horizontal gene transfer and may have been selected for to provide fail safes to vital processes. While these redundancies generally provide benefits to the organism, they are obstacles toward gaining a fundamental understanding of biological processes. In these scenarios, the disruption of a single gene does not produce a detectable growth defect, hindering further biochemical and molecular analyses.</p><p>To dissect biological processes with intrinsic redundancy, genetic approaches must be multiplexed, allowing more than one gene to be disrupted at a time. In less tractable organisms, performing traditional deletion of individual genes, let alone combinations of genes, is laborious and time consuming. Newer genetic technologies, such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas technologies allow for fast, targeted, and multiplexed gene silencing or disruption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarty et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adiego-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>). Developed from naturally occurring bacterial adaptive immune systems, CRISPR-Cas technologies are generally composed of a protein or group of proteins with enzymatic activity, usually nuclease activity, and CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) yielding target gene specificity via homologous base pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gasiunas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hille et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 is the most commonly used nuclease enzyme that, when guided by a crRNA to a complementary target DNA location, introduces a double-strand break (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adli, 2018</xref>). A catalytically inactive version of Cas9, dCas9, still localizes to complementary target genes upon crRNA direction, but instead of inducing a double-strand break, precludes RNA polymerase activity, effectively silencing gene expression. This gene silencing approach, referred to as CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), is most effective upon binding the 5’ region of the gene and is often used when a biological system lacks the machinery to repair double-strand breaks produced by the original Cas9 – as is true for most bacterial organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Qi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vigouroux and Bikard, 2020</xref>).</p><p>While silencing individual genes by CRISPRi has been achieved in various bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peters et al., 2019</xref>), suppressing two or more genes simultaneously by CRISPRi has remained a major challenge as it requires the expression of multiple gene-specific crRNAs. In nature, crRNAs are encoded by spacers separated by identical repeats in long stretches of DNA known as CRISPR arrays. Customizing CRISPR arrays in the laboratory has been a daunting task as repeat-containing DNA elements are often refractory to in vitro synthesis and cloning. Recently, we succeeded in building a multiplex CRISPRi platform in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> that uses synthetic arrays capable of silencing up to ten bacterial genes at a time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2021</xref>). Despite much progress, a major shortcoming of this and other existing multiplex CRISPRi approaches is their dependency on synthesis pipelines creating arrays of a defined set of crRNA-encoding spacers that target a predetermined set of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cress et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hawkins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vad-Nielsen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deaner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zuckermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McCarty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shaw et al., 2022</xref>). In cases where predictions about the number and function of genes involved in a biological process are absent or incomplete, simultaneous gene silencing by CRISPRi will fail to detect synthetic lethal combinations of genes as the redundant genes not targeted by the array remain functional. This emphasizes the need for a protocol for randomized assembly of crRNA-encoding spacers into expansive libraries of diverse CRISPR arrays for unbiased probing of varied combinations of genes. Here, we develop a <underline>mu</underline>ltiplex, <underline>r</underline>andomized <underline>C</underline>RISPR <underline>i</underline>nterference <underline>s</underline>equencing (MuRCiS) approach that, when used in a proof-of-concept experiment, discovered synthetic lethal combinations of genes from the virulence factor arsenal of <italic>L. pneumophila,</italic> the causative agent of Legionnaires’ pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McDade et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fraser et al., 1977</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Predetermined CRISPR arrays fail to detect virulence-critical gene combinations</title><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is a Gram-negative bacterium that encodes over 300 predicted virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez-Valero et al., 2019</xref>), known as effectors. The effectors are translocated via the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system into either the natural host, free-living amoeba, or the disease host, human alveolar macrophages, to manipulate cellular processes and establish an intracellular replication compartment known as the <italic>Legionella</italic>-containing vacuole (LCV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ensminger and Isberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mondino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chauhan and Shames, 2021</xref>). The study of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> pathogenesis has been hindered by both the sheer number of effectors amassed by this pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez-Valero et al., 2019</xref>) and the apparent redundancy among them, as illustrated in the lack of detectable growth defects upon disruption of individual or even entire chromosome islands of effector-encoding genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O’Connor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shames et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since our earlier studies had shown that silencing of up to ten genes by multiplex CRISPRi is achievable in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2021</xref>), we built a library of 10-plex CRISPRi constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, MC, <underline>m</underline>ultiplex <underline>C</underline>RISPRi) capable of silencing more than 150 effector-encoding genes in groups of ten. The grouping of crRNA-encoding spacers into synthetic CRISPR arrays occurred based on two criteria: predicted protein function (groups 1–13, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>) and evolutionary conservation (groups A–D, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). While evolutionary conservation was determined based on genome sequencing data from more than 38 <italic>Legionella</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>), protein functions were determined based on in silico predictions using hidden Markov model (HMM)-HMM comparisons (HHPred; MPI Bioinformatics Toolkit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zimmermann et al., 2018</xref>) and transmembrane predictors (TMHMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>). The rational was that the more conserved a gene is, the more important its biological role will be and the higher the likelihood that its silencing, either alone or in combination, will attenuate intracellular growth. Likewise, proteins of similar function, such as two effectors with kinase activity, are likely to be redundant due to a partial overlap in their range of host targets. To confirm the efficacy of multiplex gene silencing of these groups of genes, we used quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to assess knockdown efficiency of gene expression by six of the 17 MC constructs in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> bearing a chromosomal insertion of <italic>S. pyogenes dcas9</italic> at the <italic>thyA</italic> locus (Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellis et al., 2021</xref>). We found that 10-plex gene silencing was reproducible for each construct and nearly all genes were knocked down at least twofold, with an average fold repression of one order of magnitude or more (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Intracellular growth of Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) upon CRISPRi gene silencing with predetermined 10-plex arrays.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gene silencing efficiency assay.

Colony forming units (CFUs) of samples taken 2 hr post infection (hpi) and either 72 (U937 macrophages) or 48 (<italic>A. castellanii</italic>) hpi were determined, and fold growth of Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) bearing the indicated MC arrays relative to that of Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) bearing the empty vector was plotted.

In U937 macrophages, the strains containing the MC-A array caused a growth defect, which was expected since it encoded crRNAs against <italic>lpg2815</italic> (MavN) and <italic>lpg2300</italic>, core effectors known to be vital for intracellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burstein et al., 2016</xref>). MC-10 improved growth of Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) in U937 cells, likely due to the silencing of several glucosyltransferase effectors, <italic>lpg1368</italic> (Lgt1), <italic>lpg2862</italic> (Lgt2), and <italic>lpg1488</italic> (Lgt3), previously shown to act in a redundant fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belyi et al., 2008</xref>). MC-B caused a detectable growth defect of Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) in U937 macrophages, suggesting it had silenced one or more virulence-critical effectors that had not been described before. Surprisingly, growth of the Lp02(<italic>dcas9</italic>) MC strain library in <italic>A. castellanii</italic> yielded no notable phenotypes. Thus, the hypothesis that <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> pathogenesis would be disrupted upon silencing groups of genes encoding similar or highly conserved proteins was an oversimplification, and that redundancy reached beyond the boundary of conservation or like-function. In total, these results show that silencing a predetermined set of even ten effector-encoding genes does not guarantee detection of synthetic lethal combinations of effectors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Self-assembly of a randomized multiplex CRISPR array library</title><p>To screen for synthetic lethality more comprehensively, we developed a protocol where CRISPR arrays were assembled de novo from oligonucleotide pairs containing crRNA-encoding spacers. Since each spacer is flanked by 36 base pair (bp) repeats of identical sequence in a canonical CRISPR array, we rationalized that these repeat sequences could be split and then re-linked during CRISPR array assembly. As such, we designed complementary DNA oligonucleotides, which we call R-S-Rs (<underline>r</underline>epeat-<underline>s</underline>pacer-<underline>r</underline>epeat), composed of a 24 bp spacer flanked by the terminal 12 bps of the upstream repeat and the starting 20 bps of the downstream repeat, each with 4 bp ‘sticky’ overhangs (TGAA = a common Golden Gate cloning overhang, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The coming together of different R-S-R building blocks would recreate complete repeats without spurious nucleotides (12+20+4=classic 36 bp repeat). Since the spacer sequence was buried within the repeat sequences, competitive advantage of one R-S-R over another for integration into an array should be negligible. Furthermore, since the 4 bp overhangs are identical for each R-S-R, spacers can recombine into arrays of any length and any order. Precursor-crRNA cleavage sites were not necessary to be incorporated into the R-S-R building blocks as the precursor-crRNA would be processed into individual crRNAs by RNases endogenous to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cloning strategy for de novo self-assembly of CRISPR array libraries.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nucleotide sequence of R-S-R building blocks.

Such TMEs, when absent due to gene silencing, are unlikely to be replaced by cytosolic effectors, suggesting that redundancy is more likely to be detectable within this group of TMEs. And since transmembrane regions can be predicted with high confidence, we decided to probe this group of genes for synthetic lethality with the randomized CRISPRi approach as proof-of-concept.</p><p>Assembly of CRISPR arrays followed simple, canonical cloning procedures. CRISPR arrays were allowed to self-assemble after brief heat denaturation and slow cooling of 44 complementary R-S-R oligonucleotide pairs with an aliquot of the ‘dead end’ oligonucleotide pairs, attB4r-R and R-attB3r (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), to cap arrays on either end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Size selection proved challenging (Appendix 1) but was ultimately accomplished through restriction enzyme-based excision of the arrays from the interim plasmid and DNA gel purification of arrays of a desired size. To select for intermediate (2–4 spacers) and long (4+ spacers) arrays, gel fragments corresponding to 550–650 bps and 650–800 bps were purified, respectively. Purified arrays were then ligated back into the interim Invitrogen Gateway cloning plasmid.</p><p>Last, we used an Invitrogen Multisite Gateway Pro cloning strategy to create a final vector containing the tracrRNA-encoding sequence, and the pooled, size-selected randomized CRISPR array library flanked by a promoter (P<italic><sub>tet</sub></italic>) and terminator (<italic>rrnB</italic> T1) sequence. Keeping the tracrRNA separate from crRNAs, unlike in single guide RNAs, kept the R-S-R building blocks at a manageable length.

Importantly, given the repetitive nature of the CRISPR arrays, canonical short-read sequencing technologies (such as Illumina or 454 sequencing) would not have been adequate as they would not have provided enough unique sequence overlap outside of the repeat sequence to map the reads back to a specific array within the mixed vector population. Instead, we made use of a high-throughput, low error rate long-read sequencing technology (PacBio Sequel). The average length of reads containing R-S-R elements was ~10,400 bp, correlating to the size of the vector backbone plus a multiplex array (sequencing metrics reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>).</p><p>We harvested vectors four times from each Library 1 and Library 2 stock to assess array diversity and library reproducibility.

Taking a most stringent approach, only reads that were an exact match to the repeat sequence were analyzed. Spacers within an array were identified by searching each read for exact matches to all possible forward and reverse combinations of spacer sequences and the repeat sequence. The number of arrays with the same spacer composition were counted and an arbitrary cut-off of five raw counts in the input pool was required for further analysis of that unique spacer combination. The remaining unique array counts were normalized for run-to-run sequence depth variation, and the proportion of each unique array compared to the total number of sequenced reads containing a repeat sequence was determined for each sample. For each experiment, the proportion of normalized counts for each unique spacer composition in the input sample was compared to the normalized counts for the same spacer composition in the output sample to determine a fold reduction. The larger the reduction, the more disadvantageous silencing of the targeted genes was for intracellular <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> replication.

Some phenotypes required 4- or 5-plex gene silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>), showing that although only a minor fraction of all possible combination of three or more spacers were represented in our array library, the approach was capable of identifying these synthetic lethal gene silencing combinations as well.</p><p>Examining the PacBio DNA sequencing data, we found that the number of unique arrays identified in a given sample increased as the read number increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). For this proof-of-concept experiment we chose to limit the initial pool of arrays for analysis to those with a minimum of five raw input counts. Maintaining this same cut-off with increased sequence depth undoubtedly would increase the input-to-input array overlay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the comprehensiveness of surveying pairwise silencing of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). We anticipated the gains of increased sequencing depth by recalculating the coverage of the correlation plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref> such that the observed coverage of 710/946 (75%) or 672/946 (71%) pairs with the requirement of five raw input counts increased to 789/946 (83%) or 782/946 (83%) pairs when the requirement was lowered to just one raw input count, respectively. Hence, the ability to make comprehensive libraries was even better than first reported.</p><p>Array length poses the biggest bottleneck to performing MuRCiS on larger groups of genes. Here, each of the libraries individually probed an average of ~1000 different spacer combinations (independent of order). If all spacer combinations were represented by 2-plex arrays, theoretically one could investigate pairwise combinations of ~45 genes using just 990 arrays. But as reported, the assembly protocol produced longer arrays of up to 11 spacers, averaging 3.3 spacers. Each time the average length of arrays is increased by one spacer, the number of pairwise combinations able to be probed dramatically increases. If all arrays were 3-plex, 3000 pairwise combinations would be possible within just 1000 arrays allowing comprehensive interrogation of a group of ~75 genes for synthetic lethality, and if all arrays were 4-plex, 6000 pairwise combinations would be possible within just 1000 arrays allowing comprehensive interrogation of a group of ~110 genes for synthetic lethality. As it stands, the theoretical upper limit of MuRCiS seems between 75 and 100 genes, but with the construction of more than one library, deeper sequencing, and lowered input count requirements this number could easily be expanded.</p><p>Excitingly, the combinatorial effector gene deletions that were assayed in our experiments produce some of the largest phenotypes yet identified pertaining to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This is especially true of the simultaneous deletion of <italic>lpg2888</italic> and <italic>lpg3000</italic> producing a truly synthetic lethal phenotype during U937 macrophage infection. The only other pair of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> genes known to have such a large combinatorial impact on <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> intracellular replication are <italic>icmW</italic> and <italic>icmR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coers et al., 2000</xref>), genes that encode components of the Dot/Icm Type IV secretion system itself; hence their deletion has a global effect limiting translocation of many effector proteins into the host. HHpred analysis of <italic>lpg2888</italic> revealed numerous high confidence hits to tripartite pore-forming toxin components, while <italic>lpg3000</italic> showed high confidence hits to ABC transporter proteins. Additional studies are ongoing to uncover why deletion of their encoding genes caused synthetic lethality. From an evolutionary standpoint, it was interesting that synergy of these genes was only seen during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection of U937 macrophages. During <italic>A. castellanii</italic> infections, deletion of just <italic>lpg3000</italic> was already lethal, whereas deletion of <italic>lpg2888</italic> alone caused only a minor growth defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These data are in agreement with data from a transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq)-based screen that identified a growth defect upon disruption of <italic>lpg3000</italic> in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> during infection of <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and another protist, <italic>Hartmannella vermiformis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2020</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the biological process promoted by <italic>lpg3000</italic> is evolutionarily essential for growth in the natural amoeban host. Clearly, MuRCiS identified exciting biology pertaining to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> pathogenesis; and if applied to other groups of genes, other selective pressures, or other microorganisms, it undoubtedly has the potential to do the same.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and cell lines</title><p>All <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref> and were derived from the parent strain <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> Philadelphia-1 Lp02 (<italic>thyA hsdR rpsL</italic>).

For each gene, the reverse complement of the 24 nucleotides downstream of the first PAM sequence (NGG) after the transcription start site was identified and would become the spacer sequence.

The Illumina Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit (#FC-131-1096) was used to prepare libraries for sequencing on an Illumina MiSeq System by the NIH NICHD Molecular Genomics Core. Nucleotide variants were called using HaplotypeCaller (version GATK3, Broad Institute). Integrative Genomics Viewer (version 2.4.14, Broad Institute) was used to visually confirm chromosome deletions. Final deletion strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Deletion strain intracellular growth assays</title><p>Intracellular growth assays with deletion strains were performed exactly as for the 10-plex CRISPRi intracellular growth assays except that U937 monocytes were allowed to differentiate for 3 days prior to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> challenge and <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> cultures were simply grown overnight without the inducer aTC. To overcome the thymidine auxotrophy of Lp02 strains<italic>,</italic> thymidine at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL was added directly to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> cultures and to the DMEM+10% FBS+glutamine media to promote growth in U937 macrophages with CFU plating on CYET plates, whereas pMME2400 (<italic>+thyA</italic>) was added to <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strains by electroporation before growth in <italic>A. castellanii</italic> with selection on CYE plates. For U937 macrophage experiments the control strain was Lp02. For <italic>A. castellanii</italic> experiments that control strain was MML854 (Lp02+pMME2400, G-&gt;A mutation at chromosome position 2134550).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Supervision, Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Writing - review and editing, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables for construct design and gene combinations discovered by CRISPRi.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 10-plex construct descriptions and list of spacer sequences used in this study.

The goal was to maintain the most ligated material and give preference to longer arrays that are outcompeted by smaller arrays during vector incorporation. While these approaches were able to size-select for longer arrays, the highest yield of size-selected arrays occurred when the ligated arrays were first introduced into an interim plasmid, then excised via restriction enzyme digest, size-ordered by gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel, and then ligated back into the donor plasmid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Addition of promoter and terminator:</title><p>Attempts to add dead ends bearing the promoter and terminator sequences to the original R-S-R assembly mix led to muddled array assembly which we believed to be the result of the promoter and terminator fragments being much longer (~200 bps) than the R-S-R building blocks (60 bps) Therefore, addition of the promoter and terminator to the final plasmid was accomplished by Invitrogen Multisite Gateway Pro cloning as described.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Barcoding of arrays:</title><p>Barcodes are often used to distinguish between different constructs in library-based experiments.

The authors used a L. pneumophila strain carrying dCas9 on the chromosome that they had constructed for a CRISPRi screen they had published recently and here combined it with self-assembly randomized multiplex CRISPR arrays that they developed. The strains carrying the dCas9 and the different CRISPRi arrays were used to infect U937 or Acanthamoeba castellanii cells and the intracellular growth phenotypes were recorded as readout.

L. pneumophila employs the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system to translocate more than 300 different &quot;effector proteins&quot; into host cells. Many effector proteins appear to have redundant functions, and therefore, depleting several of them is required to observe a strong intracellular replication phenotype. In the current study, Ellis et al. develop a &quot;multiplex, randomized CRISPRi sequencing&quot; (MuRCiS) approach to silence several effector genes simultaneously and randomly, thereby possibly causing synthetic lethality for L. pneumophila upon infection of host cells.</p><p>The MuRCiS approach comprises the ligation of different CRISPR spacers flanked by repeats in presence of &quot;dead end&quot; oligonucleotide pairs capping a random array of building blocks to be inserted into a library vector. Thus, spacer arrays with an average of 3.3 spacers per array were obtained. As a proof-of-concept, spacer arrays targeting 44 transmembrane effector-encoding L. pneumophila genes were employed to screen for intracellular growth defects in macrophages and amoeba. Consequently, novel pairs of synergistically functioning effector genes were identified by comparative next-generation sequencing of the input and output pools of spacer arrays.</p><p>A major strength of this well-written and straightforward study is the construction and use of random and multiplexed CRISPRi arrays, allowing an unbiased and comprehensive screen for multiple genes affecting the intracellular growth of L. pneumophila. The ingenious approach established by Ellis et al. will be useful for further genetic analysis of L. pneumophila infection and might also be adopted for other pathogens employing a large set of (functionally redundant) virulence factors.</p><p>The reviewer's suggestion to test the single and double L. pneumophila effector mutant strains for growth in protozoa other than A. castellanii was considered beyond the scope of the current manuscript describing the optimization of the MuRCiS platform. The authors have satisfactorily addressed the minor points raised previously.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86903.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ellis</surname><given-names>Nicole A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>Kevin S</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tung</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Davidson Ward</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Johnston</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bonnington</surname><given-names>Katherine E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Donohue</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Machner</surname><given-names>Matthias P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for recognizing the importance of our work and for their insightfulsuggestions.

Have the authors optimized the expression level of dCas9? I cannot find this information in this paper or in their 2021 paper. It is important to avoid the toxicity phenomenon that occurs when using guide RNAs that share specific five base seed sequences (referred to as 'bad seeds').</p><p>Cui L., Vigouroux A., Rousset F., Varet H., Khanna V., Bikard D. A CRISPRi screen in <italic>E. coli</italic> reveals sequence-specific toxicity of dCas9. Nat. Commun. 2018; 9:1912.</p><p>Rostain W., Grebert T., Vyhovskyi D., Thiel Pizarro P., Tshinsele-Van Bellingen G., Cui1 L., Bikard D. Cas9 off-target binding to the promoter of bacterial genes leads to silencing and toxicity. Nucleic Acids Research, 2023, gkad170.</p><p>2. One guide per gene is highly unusual given that different guides block the RNA polymerase with different efficiency. This was even shown by the Machner lab in the Legionella context in Figure 1c of Ellis et al. 2021 for sidM and vipD. Typically, genes need three guides minimum to ensure that the gene of interest is knocked down fully unless it is not possible as the gene is too small and/or it is difficult to find an NGG sequence. The authors have used one guide per effector, how can they be sure that each gene is knocked down? The Machner lab themselves in Figure 3c of Ellis et al. 2021 shows not all genes targeted using multiplex CRISPRi are equally efficiently knocked down. Please justify why only one guide per gene was chosen and add controls to validate the results. The authors themselves state that the strategy of one guide may be problematic. Lines 315-316 it reads... A possible explanation was the incomplete knockdown of a seemingly important process.</p><p>3. Given what the Machner lab observed about spacer location in Ellis et al. 2021 would it not make more sense to take one set of redundant effectors and make multiplex randomized CRISPRi with them in different locations? For Figure 1 at least.</p><p>4. Following infection, it seems that the bacteria were not plated onto antibiotic media, so it is not known how well the plasmid harboring guides is kept through infection.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>A) The first results paragraph describes the set-up of 10-plex synthesized CRISPR arrays, where 10 effector encoding genes of specific gene families are selected. The rationale of the choice of these genes is not given. Please explain.</p><p>B) Please also add some biological data on what these genes code for, and what is their known or predicted function. It is not very informative and exciting to have tables of lpg numbers without any knowledge of what these genes code for and why they were selected, at least some.</p><p>C) Figure 1 A Why are only some of the MC arrays shown? Please, at least include in supplementary the others. Again one array in detail would be more informative, showing true knockdown of all genes by qPCR and ideally by western blot.</p><p>D) I am not convinced that the gene silencing efficiency qPCR comparison is done in the correct way. In my opinion, each of the genes to be knocked down should be tested against the expression of a control gene e.g. rpoS and then these results should be compared and not the results of empty plasmid or CRISPR array containing plasmid directly. L. pneumophila are very sensitive to growth conditions and inoculum, thus the two strains might not be completely at the same growth stage when being compared which can impact the results.</p><p>E) Figure 1 B As stated in general comment number 4, the authors do not appear to plate onto antibiotic so we don't know how well the plasmid harboring the guides is kept through infection. The sustained presence of the guide is particularly important for CRISPRi.</p><p>F) The authors found only a few growth phenotypes and mainly this was due to single genes and not combinations of genes. This might again be due to the fact that only one guide per gene was used. How do the authors know that all genes targeted were indeed knocked down?</p><p>G) Line 119 Alternatively, the genes were not 100% all knocked down, escaping the knockdown effect expected. Could authors take three genes with three guides each and look at impact instead of only one?</p><p>H) The authors then develop the randomized multiplexed arrays and chose to test 44 TME encoding genes. Line 141 Justify why these effectors were chosen in the text.</p><p>I) Unfortunately, the method is not clearly described, and many parts are complicated and the text needs to be re-read several times to be understood (lines 150 - 166). Please re-write to better explain to the reader. In line 156 the authors point to a supplementary note 1. This information should be in the main text.</p><p>J) What is the copy number of the CRISPR plasmid? Please add in the Material and Method section also the origin of this plasmid.</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>K) In the paper (line 154-160) and the extra notes, it states that authors attempt to size select CRISPR arrays. However, this is not apparent in Figure 2 schematic. Or are the authors stating that plasmids only containing one guide were selected out? However, line 312 would suggest not. Please clarify</p><p>L) A limiting factor in making multiplex guide CRISPR, as the authors are trying to establish in this study, is cloning of multiple guides. In the pre-determined CRISPR arrays in this study, the guides were synthesized. For the randomized multiplex CRISPR in this study, the authors adapt a Golden Gate cloning method to generate multiple sgRNAs in the Cas9 vector. A similar protocol was established in the below paper. Please add this reference.</p><p>Zuckermann, M.; Hlevnjak, M.; Yazdanparast, H.; Zapatka, M.; Jones, D.T.W.; Lichter, P.; Gronych, J. A novel cloning strategy for one-step assembly of multiplex CRISPR vectors. Sci. Rep. 2018</p><p>M) As the authors note, Zuckermann et al. similarly note that plex of 3 or 4 is most common and above 5 is rare. This thus appears to still be the limiting step of multiplex CRISPR technology. Please discuss</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>N) The idea of multiplexed CRISPRi seq to address the biological phenomenon of redundancy is an interesting one, however, I am missing the in-depth functional characterization and discussion of at least one of the redundant functions discovered. Please add.</p><p>Figure5/6</p><p>O) As noted above, the strength of the experiments is undermined by how CRISPRi is set up. Having an average multiplex of 2 or three and again only using one guide per gene weakens the study and the results obtained. Furthermore, as stated in general comment number 4, the authors do not appear to plate onto antibiotic so again, we don't know how well the plasmid harboring the guides is kept through infection. The sustained presence of the guide is particularly important for CRISPRi. Please add a validation that the guides are all present.</p></disp-quote><p>Response to Reviewer #1</p><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for their insightful comments and suggestions on how to further improve the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the issue of ‘bad seed sequences’ (comment #1), we had previously evaluated the expression level of dcas9 (plotted in Figure 1b of the 2021 Communications Biol paper) and tuned our induction conditions accordingly (40 ng/mL as described in the Methods). Since all strains used in this study express dcas9 from the chromosome, not a plasmid, this eliminates the possibility of fluctuations in expression levels due to variabilities in plasmid copy numbers.</p><p>In the rare event that toxicity by any given guide occurs, we would expect that guide to already be underrepresented or missing in the input pool following 24+ hours of CRISPRi induction during axenic growth. Our data, now discussed in the manuscript (Lines 211-216 and Figure S2), revealed that this was not the case and that all guide-encoding spacers were present in roughly equal amounts (median of &gt;5000 occurrences). As with any knockdown study, the creation of true chromosome deletions was performed throughout as to alleviate the issue of false positives.</p><p>Regarding comments #2, #3, and specific comments made under point F, G, and O, on the topic of using single vs. multiple guides, we agree that there are circumstances under which using more than one guide per target may be advantageous, for example when attempting to delete a gene from mammalian cells using conventional CRISPR engineering. In the study described here, this is not the case. In fact, we did create a second array library with alternative guides targeting the same group of genes at locations other than the “optimal location” identified in our 2021 paper and found that these “sub-optimal” guides were inefficient for identifying critical effectors as described in Supplemental Note S1 under the heading “Sub-optimal annealing sites” (Lines 919+). These data suggest that adding sub-optimal guides to the arrays of optimal guides might ‘poison’ the arrays and limit rather than enhance their ability to identify gene combinations.</p><p>Regarding comment #2, #3, and specific comments made under point C, F, and G, on the topic of confirming efficient gene knockdown for the identification of critical genes, we remind Reviewer 1 that we did confirm knockdown of 60 of the target genes of the 10-plex screen to be at least 2-fold, with an average fold repression of one order of magnitude or more (Figure 1A). While knockdown of every gene in every 10-plex construct would be an unprecedented ask of any published CRISPR screen, we believe that these 60 genes provide a large enough sampling of all guides to elucidate the range of knockdown to be expected by our CRISPRi platform. As with other knockdown technologies, such as RNAi, there is no expectation of accomplishing complete knockdown for any given target. Hence, the data in Figure 1A suggest that the lack of identifying critical genes using pre-determined 10-plex arrays was not due to a lack of knockdown efficiency, but rather the difficulty to accurately predict redundancy within a cohort of uncharacterized genes, accentuating the need for array randomization with MuRCiS.</p><p>On the topic of antibiotic use for plasmid selection (comments #4, E and O), we would like to clarify that the CRISPR plasmids were selected by thymidine prototrophy, not antibiotic resistance, and we apologize for not making this clearer. The laboratory strain Lp02 is a thymidine auxotroph (thyA-) L. pneumophila variant, and plasmid retention is routinely achieved by including the thymidine biosynthesis gene (thyA) on the plasmid backbone. Only with a plasmid bearing the thyA gene can L. pneumophila grow on CYE (thymidine-) plates. Our use of vectors bearing thyA and plating on CYE plates is described in the Methods section. Further, in Figure 7 of our 2021 paper, we show that CRISPR plasmids are efficiently retained by Lp02 for the duration of a 48-hour infection, resulting in efficient multi-gene knockdown even at the end of the intracellular growth experiment.</p><p>Regarding comments A and B, on publishing the biological data used to classify genes in gene families for 10-plex silencing, we do not consider it critical to provide additional information beyond the broad classification (e.g. kinases, phosphatases, etc) described in Table S1. Structural predictions constantly change due to continuously evolving databases. Our initial analyses were made in 2015 using HHPRED Hidden-Markov models and, in all likelihood, those predictions have been refined since then. Moreover, with the recent advent of Alphafold, anyone interested in learning more about select effectors from our list is advised to simply access the most recent functional predictions directly on the Alphafold webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/">https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/</ext-link>). We clarify how predictions were made on Lines 97-101.</p><p>Regarding specific comment D, on our method for qPCR normalization and comparison, we point Reviewer 1 to the Methods section (Lines 460+) where we describe that data obtained from each CRISPRi strain were in fact normalized to the levels of rpsL prior to comparing them to the normalized data from the strain with the empty control plasmid. This normalization to rpsL, a gene encoding a ribosomal protein, also corrects for growth differences between samples.</p><p>Regarding specific comment H, the justification for studying 44 transmembrane effector-encoding genes was driven by the fact that activities mediated by transmembrane proteins are difficult (though not impossible) to be replaced by cytosolic proteins, for example the transport of metabolites across the LCV membrane. And since transmembrane regions can be predicted with high confidence, we decided to probe this group of TMEs for synthetic lethality with the randomized CRISPRi approach as proof-of-concept. To make this clearer, we have added more detail to the text (Lines 151-155).</p><p>Regarding specific comment I, we have further simplified the description of the cloning technique to increase clarity (Lines 156+). The information listed under Supplemental Note S1, though informative, is not critical for the overall understanding of this highly technical section, and since the reviewer already considered this section to be difficult to follow, we would prefer to not further complicate the text by including these non-essential details.</p><p>Regarding the origin of the CRISPRi plasmid (specific comment J), we point Reviewer 1 to the reference (Hammer BK and Swanson MS (Mol Microbiol 1999)) listed in Table S10: Strains and Plasmids Used in this Study.</p><p>Regarding specific comment K and O, on the clarity of depicting the CRISPR array size selection process, we have updated the Figure 2 schematic. Reviewer 1 is correct in that despite our best efforts to exclude short CRISPR arrays, inevitably some 1-plex arrays remained in our input vector pool. Still, the average length of all arrays used in our pilot study exceeded three crRNA-encoding spacers. Further, having a population of 1- or 2-plex arrays in our libraries did allow us to pin-point the most critical effectors of a larger arrays within the same MuRCiS experiment (Table S5 and Table S7), a strength of MuRCiS as described in the discussion (Lines 378+).</p><p>Regarding specific comment L, we appreciate Reviewer 1’s suggestion of an additional reference and we have added it to the manuscript as reference #23 (Line 71). While this reference does use a Golden Gate strategy to build a multiplex array, that array was not randomized but had a predefined order. Hence, our assembly method is unique due to its randomization.</p><p>Regarding specific comment M, on array length cloning limitations, we agree with the conclusion of Zuckermann in Figure 1d of their article that longer inserts are generally harder to get into vector backbones. The challenge of cloning longer inserts is a common phenomenon of general biology and is not unique to cloning CRISPR arrays. We have altered the wording in our manuscript to better describe the intrinsic competition between short and long inserts during cloning (Lines 162-164).</p><p>Regarding specific comment N, we second Reviewer 1’s desire to learn more about the critical effector pairs discovered here. With that said, the goal of this manuscript is to report the development of a novel MuRCiS pipeline to identify these critical pairs. Biochemical and molecular investigations of the encoded protein pairs are on-going and will be the topic of a future manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Specific points</p><p>1. The effector repertoire of L. pneumophila seems to have evolved in response to the plethora of potential protozoan hosts (PMID: 31988381). To further assess evolutionary aspects of the vast L. pneumophila effector arsenal, it would be interesting to test the single and double effector mutant strains (Fig. 5FG, Fig. 6EF) for growth in protozoa other than A. castellanii.</p><p>1. Most CRISPR arrays comprising genes encoding functionally similar proteins or encoding evolutionarily conserved proteins did not substantially affect intracellular growth of L. pneumophila (Fig. 1B). This rather surprising result should be further discussed.</p><p>1. l. 118/119: &quot;Similar results ..., where none of the MC arrays ...&quot; This statement should be phrased more precisely, since some CRISPR arrays did indeed have an effect on intracellular growth of L. pneumophila in U937 macrophages, while none affected intracellular growth in A. castellanii (Fig. 1B).</p><p>1.

Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV).</p><p>l. 895: ... and so we would recommend ...</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding point 1, we thank Reviewer 2 for the suggestion of testing effector mutants in different hosts. While the primary purpose of the current manuscript was to optimize the MuRCiS platform, future studies using this technology to investigate specific biological questions related to Legionella infection would certainly benefit from including more than one amoebaean species.</p><p>Regarding point 2, we agree that the lack of substantial growth defects seems surprising. Yet only two of the seven core effectors (found in all Legionella sp.), lpg2300 and mavN, individually attenuated Legionella intracellular growth when deleted (Burstein 2016 Nat Genetics; Isaac et al., 2015 PNAS). Thus, we hypothesize that the functions many effectors fulfil are of such importance for intracellular survival that that redundancy reaches beyond the boundary of conservation or like-function. We have added a statement emphasizing this at the end of the Figure 1 results section (Line 122-125).</p><p>Regarding points 3 and 4, we thank Reviewer 2 for catching these errors and have corrected where needed in the text.</p><p>-l. 852 (now Line 874): … (arbitrarily set to -100,000) is correct for Figure 6E.</p></body></sub-article></article>
