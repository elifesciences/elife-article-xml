Sensory cilia of the olfactory and the photoreceptors neurons concentrate the signaling components required to sense and respond to chemicals or photons, respectively. Entry and retrieval of signaling components from cilia is mediated by large intra-flagellar transport (IFT) trains moving membrane proteins bidirectionally along the ciliary microtubules. IFT operates together with cargo adapters such as the IFT-A/B and the BBSome complexes, respectively, involved in entry and removal of transmembrane proteins from cilia. Defects in cilia trafficking can alter ciliogenesis, cilia structure, and composition and ultimately cilia signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>). <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> proved to be an excellent experimental system to identify and analyze the genes required for cilia function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scholey et al., 2004</xref>). Sensory cilia integrity can be evaluated by sensory responses of the animals or by neuronal uptake of lipophilic dye (DiI) via its exposed ciliated ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Starich et al., 1995</xref>). Mutations reducing cilia length cause dye filling defective phenotypes (Dyf) together with sensory defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Sensory organs combining glial-like cells and ciliated sensory neurons are observed across metazoans, ranging from the invertebrate sensilla to the mammalian olfactory epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wright, 1992</xref>). In these sensory organs, glia contributes to sensory function by releasing trophic factors, recycling neurotransmitters, controlling ion balance, and pruning synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fredieu and Mahowald, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oikonomou and Shaham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vecino et al., 2016</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, all neuroepithelial glial cells associate with the ciliated end of sensory neurons and together form sensilla. These include the deirids, outer labial, inner labial, cephalic, phasmid, and amphid sensilla. The amphid sensilla is the primary sensory organ of <italic>C. elegans</italic> allowing to sense external cues. The amphids are bilateral sensory organs, each formed by 12 ciliated neurons and 2 glial cells creating an epiderm-like continuum with the hypoderm. Two glial cells, called AMphid sheath (AMsh) and AMphid socket (AMso), delimit together a matrix-filled pore opened to the external environment that houses the nerve receptive endings (NREs) of 8 of the 12 amphid neurons. The NREs of the other four amphid neurons (AWA, AWB, AWC, AFD) are fully embedded within AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ciliated amphid neurons transfer DiI-stained membrane to the ensheathing glia in an ATP-dependent manner within minutes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anatomical organization of the amphid sensilla in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (top).

EVs hold exciting significance for biology, pathology, diagnostics, and therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). EVs are heterogeneous vesicles, including the &lt;150 nm diameter exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the usually larger (100 nm to 1 μm) ectosomes formed via outward budding of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">van Niel et al., 2018</xref>). The capability for cilia to release ectosomes into the extracellular space has been described in a variety of organisms including <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLean and Brown, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergman et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wood et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nager et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis of mammalian and nematode EVs content has detected several proteins that were originally enriched in the cilia, in particular polycystic kidney disease (PKD) protein polycystin-2/PKD2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the polycystin-2 ortholog PKD-2 localizes to the cilia of a subset of male ciliated sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barr et al., 2001</xref>). In overexpression strains, PKD-2-GFP containing EVs are released from male ciliated neurons into the external environment and EVs purified from male contribute to inter-individual communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Electron microscopy of the male cephalic sensilla revealed EVs accumulating in the lumen surroundings the periciliary membrane compartment (PCMC) of male cephalic neurons (CEM neurons), hinting for a physiological release from CEM PCMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple evidence suggests that ciliary EVs correspond to ectosomes shed from the plasma membrane of the males ciliated neurons rather than exosomes derived from MVBs. First, the production of ciliary EVs was not affected by mutants disrupting MVBs maturation, including mutants disturbing the ESCRT complex <italic>stam-1</italic>, <italic>mvb-12,</italic> and <italic>alx-1</italic>. Second, MVBs were not observed in cilia or in the distal dendrite. Finally, some omega-shaped structures were observed at the PCMC of CEM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several questions remain unanswered: where and how EVs bud from cilia in physiological or pathological conditions, how cargoes enter ciliary EVs, and what is the physiological function of these ciliary EVs. Here, we show that most ciliated sensory neurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic> can pack and export ciliary membrane proteins in two types of ciliary ectosomes. Ectosomes formed at the tip of the cilia, which are released to the environment, and ectosomes formed at the base of the cilia (PCMC), which are readily phagocytosed by the surrounding glial cells. Defects in cilia entry of the salt-sensing guanylate cyclase GCY-22 in mutants for an anterograde motor kinesin (<italic>osm-3</italic>) give rise to basal ectosomes budding from the PCMC. Conversely, mutations in the BBsome (Bardet–Biedl syndrome) protein BBS-8 results in defective receptor retrieval and an enhanced budding from cilia tip. Mutants for the clathrin adaptor AP-1 complex subunit mu-1 (<italic>unc-101</italic>) reduce sorting of GCY-22 receptor to cilia and abolish ciliary ectosome production. Therefore, trafficking bias facilitates cargo entry into apical or basal ectosomes, according to cargo accumulation in cilia or PCMC, respectively. In addition, cargoes might contribute themselves to membrane bending or to their sorting to bending membranes. We suggest that ectocytosis might contribute to reduce pathological accumulations of ciliary proteins. Although ectocytosis is maintained in the absence of glia, we observe that basal ectosome biogenesis is coupled to ectosome removal by phagocytic glia. This neuron-glia coupling maintains the cilia structure and sensory function of a subset of ciliated neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ciliated neurons transfer DiI-stained membrane to its neighboring glia in an ATP-dependent manner</title><p>We used the amphid sensilla as a model of anatomically connected neurons and glia. When animals are soaked in the lipophilic dye DiI, a subset of environmentally exposed amphid sensory neurons (and non-exposed AWB neuron) uptake DiI from their sensory cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inglis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Although not being environmentally exposed, the AMsh glial cells embed the PCMC of the DiI-stained neuronal subset. Interestingly, when staining the animals with DiI, AMsh glia shows a puncta-like staining pattern, in contrast to the strong homogenous staining observed in neurons. Interestingly, this staining of the AMsh glia only occurs if the neurons themselves are priorly stained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ohkura and Bürglin, 2011</xref>). Together, these observations imply that DiI is first incorporated in membranes of the amphid neurons and secondarily these DiI-stained neuronal membranes are exported to AMsh.</p><p>Whether, where, and how ciliated neurons export DiI-stained membrane to the glial cell remains unanswered. To address these questions, we analyzed the DiI filling dynamics in the amphid sensilla. DiI accumulation in neurons and in glia was rapid: soaking the animals in DiI for 20 min was enough to stain amphid and phasmid neurons as well as the amphid and phasmid sheath glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). High-resolution images of the nose tip revealed DiI-stained vesicles within AMsh cytoplasm, either next to the dye-filled cilia or further away, accumulating in a region of AMsh that we hereafter named as the AMsh ‘pocket’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, time-lapse imaging showed that these DiI-stained vesicles were produced where neuron ciliated endings are located. Once released, the flow of these vesicles was directed towards AMsh ‘pocket’ or towards AMsh cell body (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Finally, DiI-containing vesicles were seen to accumulate in the soma of AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-67670-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released from the DiI-uptaking amphid neurons and are captured by the surrounding glia.</title><p>An animal expressing AMsh cytoplasmic CFP and stained with DiI was immobilized with 10 mM tetramisole and recorded during approximately 8 min.

ATP-dependent membrane trafficking events are required for the fast DiI staining of the neurons. When worms are treated with 25 mM sodium azide 15 min prior and during DiI staining, the neuron and glia staining entirely disappeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, when the animals are directly soaked for 20 min in a solution of DiI supplemented with 25 mM sodium azide, we observe a faint staining of the neurons while AMsh glia remained unstained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, t = 0 hr; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> for experimental scheme). This observation suggests that amphid neurons captured DiI but did not transfer it to AMsh in the absence of ATP. After 1 hr recovery in the absence of sodium azide (washout condition), the staining of AMsh was retrieved, suggesting that the ATP-dependent transfer of DiI restarted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, t = 1 hr). When normalizing the AMsh staining to the neuronal fluorescence, DiI transfer from neurons to glia was re-established after washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The tetraspanins TSP-6 and TSP-7 enter ciliary EVs captured by the surrounding glial cells</title><p>We hypothesized that ciliary EVs released from the amphid neurons mediate the DiI export to AMsh.

Each neuron or group of neurons was chosen for the positioning of its NREs with respect to their supporting glia. In each of the neurons we examined – including the ASER, AFD, ASH, ASI, ADL, ADF, AWA, and IL2 neurons – TSP-6-wrmScarlet and/or TSP-7-wrmScarlet appeared enriched at the apical NREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). The canonical sensory cilium is subdivided in various sub-ciliary domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Quantification showed that TSP-6-wrmScarlet was enriched at the ASER cilium and PCMC compared to the distal dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C′ and C′′</xref>). Similarly, using the dynein light intermediate chain XBX-1 marker to label the axoneme and PCMC, we saw that XBX-1-mEGFP largely overlapped with TSP-7-wrmScarlet location in ASH, ADL, ADF cilia, further supporting its enrichment in cilia and PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Second, if TSP-6-wrmScarlet was loaded in EVs released by amphid neuron cilia, we should observe TSP-6-wrmScarlet in EVs located either in the amphid pore or exported to/captured by AMsh, as we observed for DiI. Indeed, when overexpressed from a subset of amphid neurons, these markers were exported from their cilia to EVs observed in the amphid pore and/or in AMsh cytoplasm. Within AMsh, TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet were always observed as intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B', C'</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, because these vesicles originate from the neurons, we will call them EVs, something that is justified later. When expressed in the right ASE neuron (ASER), TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet were exported to fluorescent EVs located only in the right AMsh cell (AMshR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We did not observe EVs in AMso glial cells nor in the contralateral AMshL, suggesting that EV export occurs from the ASER PCMC, the only place where ASER directly contacts AMshR. Accordingly, we observed TSP-6-wrmScarlet-carrying EVs in close proximity to the ASER PCMC as well as in the AMsh ‘pocket’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, insets, magenta arrowheads). We also observed fluorescent EVs in the amphid pore, suggesting that these can also be apically released from ASER cilium into the amphid pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, insets, green arrowheads). Similarly, we observed export of TSP-6-wrmScarlet-carrying EVs from the bilateral ASH and ASI neurons to the amphid pore and to both AMsh cells (and rarely in AMso glia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We observed export of TSP-7-wrmScarlet-carrying EVs from the bilateral ASH, ADL, ADF, AWA neurons to both AMsh cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, we assayed the AFD neurons as their NREs consist of many microvilli and a single cilium all embedded within AMsh cytoplasm. When expressed in AFD neurons, TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet were observed at the surface of microvilli and AFD base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). High-resolution imaging allowed us to see TSP-7-wrmScarlet in a vesicular compartment within AFD base, possibly corresponding to a recycling or trafficking compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similar export properties were observed for AFD neurons: EVs carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet or TSP-7-wrmScarlet were exported from bilateral AFD neurons to both AMsh glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Fluorescent EVs were observed within the cytoplasm of AMsh glia, around the microvilli of AFD and also in the AMsh ‘pocket’ area. TSP-positive EVs were also observed in AMsh cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Export of EVs carrying TSP-7-wrmScarlet from AFD neurons to AMsh was observed across all larval stages from L1 stage to adult. As the animals aged, we observed a progressive build-up of TSP-7-wrmScarlet EVs in AMsh glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), suggesting that this export of TSP-7-wrmScarlet EVs occurs continuously from AFD neurons to AMsh and starts at early larval stages. Therefore, we show that TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet label ciliary membrane compartments. These markers can be loaded into EVs that are released from amphid neurons to amphid pore and/or to AMsh.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ectosome biogenesis from two ciliary locations produces divergent EVs’ fates</title><p>The cilia of male IL2 neurons were previously described to produce and release EVs to the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, we could also observe EV release occurring from the hermaphrodite IL2 cilia expressing different markers: TSP-6-wrmScarlet co-expressed with cytoplasmic mEGFP, TSP-7-wrmScarlet co-expressed with cytoplasmic mEGFP or cytoplasmic mCherry alone. Expression of TSP-7-wrmScarlet and TSP-6-wrmScarlet appeared enriched at PCMC of IL2s compared cilia proper, while cytoplasmic mEGFP or mCherry were homogenously distributed in IL2s cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The EVs released outside the animals were always carrying cytoplasmic mEGFP or mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>) but were only occasionally carrying TSP-7-wrmScarlet and TSP-6-wrmScarlet. In contrast, EVs exported from IL2 neurons to their supporting glia were always carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C'</xref>). The stained glia presumably corresponded to the inner labial sheath (ILsh) and socket (ILso) glial cells, based on their location. Therefore, IL2 neurons likely release two types of EVs, EVs transferred to the glia carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet and TSP-7-wrmScarlet, and EV released outside the animals that often lack the tetraspanin markers.</p><p>To analyze the dynamic of biogenesis, release and transfer of ciliary EV, we performed live imaging of animals co-expressing the cytoplasmic mEGFP along with TSP-7-wrmScarlet/TSP-6-wrmScarlet in IL2 neurons. These animals were immobilized with 10 mM tetramisole, an agonist of cholinergic receptors that force muscular paralysis but do not interrupt ATP-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reilly et al., 2017</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reilly et al., 2017</xref>). In these conditions, we observed outward budding of the plasma membrane typical of ectosomes in IL2 neurons. The events occurred from two ciliary locations: first, ectosomes varying from below 250 nm to ∼2 μm diameter are formed and released from the IL2 cilia tip by a constant flow of membrane towards a cilia protrusion at IL2 cilia tip. Scission of the ectosomes from the cilia tip seemed to occur randomly, releasing ectosomes of variable size in these preparations. These distal ectosomes did not always carry the TSP-7-wrmScarlet or TSP-6-wrmScarlet markers (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). TSP-7-wrmScarlet appeared sorted or not into the IL2 apical ectosomes according to its presence or absence at the cilia tip at the time of ectosome budding. An ∼2 μm diameter distal ectosome was formed and released in ∼150 s, suggesting a fast directional membrane flow towards the cilia tip of IL2 neurons (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). Second, IL2 neurons also released ectosomes carrying TSP-7-wrmScarlet from their PCMC. These were observed as translocating from IL2 PCMC towards ILsh or ILso cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). We also performed in vivo live recordings from animals expressing TSP-6-wrmScarlet in ASER neurons. We observed a similar flow of barely detectable basal ectosomes released from ASER PCMC, suggesting local production of ectosomes (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>).</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-67670-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Apical ectosomes are released from the cilia tip of IL2.</title><p>An animal expressing cytoplasmic mEGFP and TSP-7-wrmScarlet in IL2 neurons was immobilized with 10 mM tetramisole and recorded during approximately 3 min.

Ectosome biogenesis up to scission is fast but variable ranging from few seconds to few minutes, leading to variable ectosome size. These ciliary ectosomes can bud from the NRE of multiple ciliated neurons, either from the PCMC and/or from cilia tip. Markers enriched at PCMC are also more likely to enter in basal ectosomes than markers enriched in distal cilia. When budding from PCMC, ectosomes are subsequently captured by the contacting glial cells. When ectosomes are budding from ciliary tip, these are not captured by the adjacent glial cells but instead they are environmentally released.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ciliary receptors can be sorted to ectosomes and exported to AMsh</title><p>Previous work showed that only a subset of overexpressed ciliary proteins enters <italic>C. elegans</italic> male EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maguire et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). To explore which cilia proteins can enter basal ectosomes, we overexpressed fluorescently tagged ciliary membrane proteins known to localize to the cilia of AFD, ASER, and ASK neurons. The transmembrane guanylyl cyclase receptor GCY-8 is localized to AFD receptive endings where it contributes to the thermotaxis behavior of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Inada et al., 2006</xref>). Overexpression of the fusion protein GCY-8-wrmScarlet in AFD showed enrichment in all the distal AFD NREs, including microvilli and PCMC. GCY-8-wrmScarlet was exported from AFD to AMsh, producing fluorescent EVs that surrounded AFD microvilli and that were ultimately trafficked to AMsh cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also tagged a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) endogenously localized in AFD microvilli, the SRTX-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>). When overexpressed in AFD neurons, SRTX-1-wrmScarlet was also exported from AFD terminals to EVs in AMsh glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We next tagged the SRBC-64 GPCR involved in pheromone sensing and known to localize to the cilia and PCMC of the ASK neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim, 2009</xref>). Overexpression of SRBC-64-wrmScarlet in ASK neurons localized to the cilia and PCMC but was not exported to AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, we tagged the transmembrane receptor guanylyl cyclase GCY-22, a specific ASER cilium-located receptor involved in salt sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ortiz et al., 2009</xref>). The overexpressed GCY-22-wrmScarlet fusion protein localized in a bi-partite distribution at the cilium tip and PCMC of ASER, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Burght et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed that GCY-22-wrmScarlet was also exported from the PCMC of ASER to AMsh, producing fewer but noticeably larger (∼1 μm) fluorescent EVs in AMsh cell body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, GCY-22-wrmScarlet was observed enriched at the membrane of large protrusions budding from ASER PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, orange arrowhead). Because of their large size, budding of GCY-22-wrmScarlet-carrying EVs could be resolved, and their budding dynamics recorded in vivo. Multiple recorded videos revealed the buddings of ∼1 µm diameter ectosomes, starting with the elongation of a protrusion from ASER PCMC followed by the narrowing of the tubule connecting the protrusion to the PCMC up to the scission event (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). All budding events took place within 6–25 min of recording (N = 3). The entire budding, neck elongation, and scission of basal ectosomes containing GCY-22 happened in close contact with AMsh, hinting to a phagocytic process. As soon as scission occurred, the large vesicles moved retrogradely towards AMsh cell body. Therefore, most of the ciliary membrane proteins we assessed can be loaded into ciliary EVs when overexpressed. However, there are exceptions exemplified by SRBC-64-wrmScarlet, suggesting that some ciliary membrane proteins do not enter EVs or their levels are below the limits of detection in the used setup.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Endogenous ciliary membrane proteins are sorted to ectosomes and exported to AMsh.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GCY-8-wrmScarlet was cell-specifically expressed in AFD (driven by <italic>gcy-8</italic> promoter).

Assuming that the number of GCY-22-wrmScarlet vesicles in AMsh cell body reflects the strength of the GCY-22-wrmScarlet export by ectocytosis, these transgenic animals were used as a tool to quantify EV biogenesis from ASER. GCY-22-wrmScarlet transgenics were crossed into mutants modulating the amount of GCY-22-wrmScarlet at cilia. We first asked if ectocytosis required a functional cilium to occur or can occur simply by virtue of GCY-22-wrmScarlet accumulation at distal dendrite. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, most genes involved in ciliogenesis are under the transcriptional control of the RFX-type transcription factor DAF-19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swoboda et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>daf-19(m86</italic>) mutant worms are completely void of ciliated structures. Instead amphid dendrites terminate in club-shaped ectopic membrane and form junctions with AMsh. Importantly, traffic to the distal dendrite of several cilia proteins is maintained in <italic>daf-19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dwyer et al., 2001</xref>). In <italic>daf-19(m86</italic>) mutants, GCY-22-wrmScarlet accumulated in an elongated ectopic membrane compartment protruding from the distal dendrite in close contact with AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The export of GCY-22-wrmScarlet from ASER to AMsh still occurred from this ectopic compartment and the number of GCY-22-wrmScarlet vesicles in AMsh was increased respective to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the cilia structure itself is not necessary for ectocytosis to AMsh to occur. We next asked whether a strong traffic of GCY-22-wrmScarlet towards the cilia is required for its ectocytosis. The AP-1 μ1 clathrin adaptor UNC-101 is not required for cilia formation but acts in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network and endosomes to mediate ciliary protein sorting and trafficking towards the cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dwyer et al., 2001</xref>).

Although not frequently, EVs containing GCY-22-GFP were observed in the cilia pore, as previously observed with GCY-22-wrmScarlet overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and F</xref>). However, ectocytosis of GCY-22-GFP towards AMsh was not observed in wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and G</xref>). Cilia trafficking mutants can cause pathological cargo accumulation at the cilia tip or in the PCMC according to mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Burght et al., 2020</xref>). In trafficking mutants, we asked whether GCY-22-GFP accumulation at the cilia tip or in the PCMC could induce GCY-22-GFP apical or basal ectocytosis, respectively. GCY-22 receptors rely on the OSM-3 kinesin for their entry and anterograde transport within ASER cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">van der Burght et al., 2020</xref>). Ciliogenesis occurs in <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) mutants, but the distal segment of the cilia is missing. Accordingly, we observed shorter cilia and enlarged PCMC in <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). The accumulation of GCY-22-GFP at the cilia tip observed in controls was not observed in <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Instead, GCY-22-GFP accumulated at PCMC of <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) mutants. As predicted, <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) promoted ectocytosis of GCY-22-GFP towards AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). CHE-3 is a dynein heavy chain involved in cilia retrograde traffic. <italic>che-3(cas511</italic>) mutants display severely truncated cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Signor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen et al., 2018</xref>). In <italic>che-3(cas511</italic>) mutants, GCY-22-GFP accumulated in a strongly misshaped ASER cilium, including shorter cilia and enlarged PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D and E</xref>). Ectocytosis of GCY-22-GFP towards AMsh was increased, suggesting again that GCY-22-GFP accumulation at PCMC promotes its ectocytosis towards AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). The BBSome subunit BBS-8 is dispensable for cilia assembly per se, but is required for cilia function by regulating protein trafficking, including receptor retrieval from cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blacque, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wei et al., 2012</xref>).

As predicted, <italic>bbs-8(nx77</italic>) increased GCY-22-GFP ectocytosis from ASER cilium towards the amphid pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). GCY-22::GFP accumulation in ASER cilium was reduced in <italic>bbs-8(nx77),</italic> suggesting that GCY-22::GFP escapes cilium by apical ectocytosis in the absence of BBSome retrieval, likely through ectocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I and J</xref>). Indeed, apical ectosomes were observed still attached or already separated from ASER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, bottom).

EVs carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet were also observed within AMsh cytoplasm, suggesting that ectocytosis of TSP-6-wrmScarlet towards AMsh occurs physiologically from TSP-6-expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

We observed a poor overlap of the two membrane proteins within ASER cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

However, budding from PCMC is coupled to AMsh phagocytosis. What is the contribution of AMsh glia in budding? In several animal models, glial cells actively prune excess synapses, axonal projections, dendritic spines, and sensory endings of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilton et al., 2019</xref>). Using TSP-7-wrmScarlet export from AFD, we explored the role of AMsh in EV capture. Time-lapse recordings from animals expressing TSP-6-wrmScarlet in AFD neurons showed that many of the TSP-6-wrmScarlet EVs seemed to originate from AFD microvilli endings. Additionally, we could observe elongation and retraction of microvilli (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>). This pruning of AFD microvilli was recently observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raiders et al., 2021</xref>. We first asked whether pruning of AFD microvilli was strictly necessary to observe export of TSP-7-wrmScarlet from AFD to EVs in AMsh. To this end, we used a mutant for TTX-1, a transcription factor required for correct morphogenesis of AFD terminals. <italic>ttx-1(p767</italic>) mutants are defective for AFD microvilli formation but maintain their cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Satterlee et al., 2001</xref>).

TSP-7-wrmScarlet was still exported to AMsh in the <italic>ttx-1(p767</italic>), although the number of TSP-7-wrmScarlet EV and their fluorescence was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Therefore, the AFD microvilli are important but not absolutely required for TSP-7-wrmScarlet export from AFD to EVs in AMsh.

Instead, the export of TSP-7-wrmScarlet simply requires the EVs produced by AFD to be captured by any competent neighboring cell type. Among the local cells undergoing constitutive endocytic activity and located in the proximity of AFD NREs are all the ciliated amphid neurons. Interestingly, in the absence of AMsh, a fraction of TSP-7-wrmScarlet is exported from AFD to EVs located in the cytoplasm of a subset of ciliated amphid neurons also expressing the osm-3p::mEGFP transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, amphid neurons can also take up TSP-7-wrmScarlet at their receptive endings in the absence of AMsh. Altogether, these observations suggest that EVs produced intrinsically by AFD are physiologically taken up by the scavenging activity of AMsh as long as AFD receptive ends are embedded within AMsh. In the absence of AMsh, any local endocytic activity can take up these EVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Phagocytic activity in AMsh is required to maintain sensory cilia shape and function</title><p>Our previous results highlight the active role of neurons for basal ectosome production. However, ectosomes do not accumulate in the amphid sensilla of hermaphrodites, highlighting their efficient clearance by AMsh. This clearance could occur passively by phagocytosis of passing-by EVs; in this case, an AMsh endocytic defect would lead to EV accumulation in the lumen of the amphid sensilla, between amphid cilia and AMsh. Alternatively, as PCMC and AMsh plasma membranes are closely associated, PCMC ectocytosis might occur simultaneously to glial phagocytosis. Such mechanism would facilitate ectosome clearance and limit the risk of ectosomes accumulating between cilia and glia. In this case, an AMsh endocytic defect would lead to abnormal cilia shape caused by unsolved ectosome uptake. To test these two models, we reduced AMsh endocytic activity by overexpressing cell-specifically a dominant negative construct for DYN-1. In human macrophages, Dynamin 2 is recruited early during phagosome formation and contributes to phagosome scission from plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marie-Anais et al., 2016</xref>).

As expected, if ASER PCMC ectocytosis was coordinated with AMsh phagocytosis, we observed abnormal filopodia-like protrusions still attached to the ASER PCMC when DYN-1(K46A) was overexpressed in AMsh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We never observed EVs accumulating between ASER and AMsh. Instead, many tiny vesicles were observed in the vicinity of ASER cilium, sometimes generating string of pearls within AMsh cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A′</xref>). To assess this non-cell-autonomous effect of AMsh::DYN-1(K46A) on other amphid neurons, we examined the morphology of ASH, AFD, and AWC NREs. In agreement with ASER results, we saw expression of DYN-1(K46A) in AMsh induced abnormal filopodia-like protrusions still attached to ASH PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Expression of DYN-1(K46A) in AMsh induced abnormal AWC cilia where the wing-like sheets are replaced by branches; filopodia-like protrusions still attached to AWC PCMC were observed in 11 of the 14 AWC cilia imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Expression of DYN-1(K46A) in AMsh induced abnormal AFD microvilli architecture as well as abnormal filopodia-like protrusions attached to AFD PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We never observed EVs accumulating between ASH, AFD, AWC, AFD NREs, and AMsh, suggesting that the EVs produced are not accumulating outside the glia. Instead, we observed filopodia-like protrusion remaining attached to the PCMC. Expression of DYN-1(K46A) disturbs a whole set of AMsh functions, including phagocytosis. Therefore, filopodia-like protrusion originating from PCMC might correspond to ectosomes not readily pinched. We observed that DYN-1(K46A) affected AMsh position and shape, suggesting that it modifies AMsh cell biology.

Our results confirm and extend these conclusions: many – potentially all – hermaphrodite ciliated neurons can produce ciliary ectosomes from their cilia when ciliary membrane proteins are overexpressed. Using in vivo recordings and volumetric confocal acquisitions, we could identify the location for the biogenesis and excision of ciliary ectosomes. The fate of these ectosomes varies according to the location of their biogenesis: basal ectosomes budding from the PCMC is simultaneously captured by the contacting glial cells, while apical ectosomes shed from the cilia tip were environmentally released, exiting through the pore of the sensilla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Basal ectosomes phagocytosed by glial cells are likely directed to the endolysosomal pathway.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Mechanisms underlying ectocytosis from ciliated neurons.</title><p>Ectocytosis occurs from two different ciliary locations: the cilia tip and the periciliary membrane compartment (PCMC). When ectosomes are shed from the cilia tip, they are environmentally released. Sheath glia (light blue) embeds the ciliary base of ciliated neurons, when ectosomes bud from the base they are concomitantly phagocytosed by their associated sheath glia. Overexpression of ciliary membrane proteins or mutations in genes involved in cilia trafficking, like <italic>osm-3, bbs-8,</italic> and <italic>che-3</italic>, fail to balance import and removal of ciliary membrane proteins, leading to local accumulation of cargo in cilia proper and/or to PCMC.

On the contrary, reduced cilia import of ciliary membrane protein in <italic>unc-101</italic> – involved in sorting cilia cargo from Trans Golgi Network – reduced ectocytosis. Besides its crucial role in secretion of extracellular matrix content, we suggest that glia also plays an important function to maintain cilia structure and composition and to recycle ectocytosed material. Cell-specific manipulations of AMsh glia phagocytic activity by expression of DYN-1 dominant negative transgene suggest that a tight regulation of sheath glia phagocytosis contributes to shape the nerve receptive endings.

Physiological production of ciliary ectosome by neurons is documented in human photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Salinas et al., 2017</xref>). Using knock-in strains, we show that ectosomes carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet or GCY-22-GFP bud from cilia tip in the absence of overexpression artifacts. These observations suggest physiological production of EVs by several, if not all, ciliated neurons of hermaphrodite and male. We demonstrate that lipophilic DiI is captured by ciliated amphid neurons and exported from them to AMsh. Importantly, this assay shows that ciliary membrane is exported to AMsh in physiological conditions, arguing for a physiological export of ciliary material by ectocytosis to the supporting glia. In addition, we observe filopodia-like protrusion originating from PCMC in AMsh::DYN-1(DN), suggesting that basal ectocytosis occurs in the absence of pathological cargo accumulation in PCMC. However, overexpression of male ciliary cargoes leads to massive apical ectocytosis by <italic>C. elegans</italic> male ciliated neurons without observed basal release to the supporting glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). In physiological conditions, EVs carrying TSP-6-wrmScarlet or GCY-22-GFP are weakly or not exported to AMsh, respectively. Therefore, export of ciliary material from ciliated neurons to the supporting glia in physiological conditions might differ accordingly to cargo and/or neuron properties (see more detail in <italic>Author response to reviewers</italic>).</p><p>What is the purpose of ciliary ectocytosis? Cilia size, composition, and signaling are tightly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter and Blacque, 2019</xref>). For example, tuning of the Hedgehog signaling is achieved by controlling cilia entry, removal and disposal of Hedgehog effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rohatgi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bangs and Anderson, 2017</xref>). The best-known mechanisms for entry and removal of proteins from cilia are mediated by the IFT cargo adapters IFT-A and BBSome, respectively. Several other mechanisms are described to remove proteins from cilia including endocytosis at PCMC and ciliary ectocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nager et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that ciliary ectocytosis is a by-product of the strong polarized traffic of GCY-22-wrmScarlet towards the distal dendrite and cilia. Polarized traffic of GCY-22-wrmScarlet to the distal dendrite is maintained in <italic>daf-19</italic> mutants together with its export to AMsh despite the absence of ciliary structure. Polarized traffic of GCY-22-wrmScarlet to the cilia is lost in <italic>unc-101(m1</italic>) together with its export to AMsh despite the cilia maintenance in <italic>unc-101(m1</italic>). As previously suggested, we hypothesize that ciliary ectocytosis represents one mechanism to balance out the continuous import of membrane and membrane proteins to cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carter and Blacque, 2019</xref>). Our results suggest that trafficking imbalance within a cilia subcompartment can be reduced by local ectocytosis of cargoes. In <italic>bbs-8</italic> mutants where cargo retrieval is reduced, GCY- 22-GFP or TSP-6-wrmScarlet cargoes should accumulate in cilia. Instead, we observe more EVs are released from cilia such that GCY-22-GFP fluorescence is reduced in the ASER cilium of <italic>bbs-8</italic> mutants. Accordingly, more EVs were shown to accumulate in the amphid sensilla lumen of <italic>bbs-8(nx77</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, ectocytosis likely contributes to reduce cargo accumulation in cilia of <italic>bbs-8(nx77</italic>) mutants. Similarly, in IMCD3 kidney cell line, cilia defective for BBSome retrieval increased receptor removal by ectocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nager et al., 2017</xref>). In <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) mutants, where entry and anterograde transport of cargoes in cilia are reduced, GCY-22-GFP or TSP-6-wrmScarlet cargoes accumulate in PCMC. Concomitantly, fourfold more EVs are released from <italic>osm-3</italic> PCMC to the supporting glia than in controls. Therefore, we suggest that both apical and basal ectocytosis provide a safeguard measure to maintain appropriate cilia composition.</p><p>Does ciliary ectocytosis occur in pathological conditions? Conditions leading to transient accumulation of cargo in one cilium subcompartment promote local ectocytosis from this subcompartment. Therefore, cargo ectocytosis might protect from cargo accumulation in ciliopathies, reducing the load in cilia and/or PCMC. One possibility to explain PCMC accumulation of cargoes and increased basal ectocytosis in overexpression strains would be a saturation of the IFT retrieval machinery by overexpression of ciliary membrane proteins. Interestingly, PCMC expansion and basal ectocytosis observed in <italic>osm-3(p802</italic>) and <italic>che-3(cas511</italic>) in knocked in GCY-22-GFP are reminiscent of PCMC expansion and basal ectocytosis observed in strains overexpressing GCY-22-wrmScarlet. This observation highlights the risk of artifactual localization of cargoes and artifactual EV release in cilia overexpressing cargo proteins.</p><p>How does cargo enter ectosomes? Ciliary ectosome release was shown to involve ciliary accumulation of PI(4,5)P2 and subsequent actin polymerization in cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phua et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nager et al., 2017</xref>). However, how EV cargoes are sorted remain poorly understood. Interestingly, all overexpressed ciliary membrane proteins tested apart SRBC-64 can enter EV when overexpressed. Although ciliary ectosomes derive from cilia membrane, their protein composition is different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, some bias for EV entry must exist. We show that sorting of the same cargo (GCY-22-GFP or TSP-6-wrmScarlet) to basal or distal ectosomes is affected by cilia trafficking biases in <italic>bbs-8</italic> and <italic>osm-3</italic> mutants. Therefore, cargo entry in basal and/or distal ectosomes does not only result from a selective sorting but rather results from their enrichment in PCMC or cilia tip when ectosome budding occurs. This model is supported by ectosome biogenesis time lapses. Sensory cilia of <italic>C. elegans</italic> vary in terms of axonemal structure, microtubule arrangements, post-translational modifications of tubulin, as well as IFT motors composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O’Hagan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doroquez, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akella and Barr, 2021</xref>). These cilia specificities contribute to determine whether cargoes are enriched in distal or basal cilia in a given cell type. This can explain the high propensity of male ciliated neurons to produce apical ectosomes carrying PKD-2 released outside, rather than basal ectosome exporting PKD-2 to the associated glia. In addition to cargo trafficking bias, cargo accumulation can play an active role in EV biogenesis by their bending properties, their interactions with bending proteins, and/or their preferential sorting to bending membranes. For example, clustering of membrane proteins with intrinsic conical shape creates microdomains, which can bend their associated membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aimon et al., 2014</xref>). Tetraspanins were previously suggested to contribute to EVs biogenesis and cargo sorting to the EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andreu and Yanez-Mo, 2014</xref>). TSP-6 overexpression might therefore facilitate EV biogenesis by its effect on protein clustering, membrane curvature, and/or its sorting to high curvature regions of the plasma membrane as suggested for its mammalian ortholog, the tetraspanin CD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Umeda et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement to an active role for cargo in shaping plasma membrane, we show that EV composition correlates with changes in EV diameter. This observation suggests that cargoes interact within the plasma membrane to define the EVs size. For example, GCY-22 overexpression might neutralize the bending effects of TSP-6, leading to larger EVs. Once membranes start bending, curvature-dependent sorting was recently observed to sort activated GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosholm et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Does glia capture of EV contribute to maintain cilia shape and function? We show that EVs remain produced by AFD receptive endings in the absence of AMsh glia; these EVs were alternatively taken up by hypodermal and neuronal cells. Therefore, glial phagocytic activity is secondary to the inherent formation of EVs by NREs, rather than an active pruning process. Because the sheath glia embeds partially or totally the NREs, glial phagocytosis was expected to go hand in hand with ectocytosis events. When AMsh phagocytic activity is disturbed by <italic>dyn-1</italic> dominant negative, the NRE morphology of ASH, ASER, AWC, and AFD receptive endings was altered, including formation of filopodial-like protrusions originating from PCMC. Not surprisingly, disrupted cilia morphology correlates with abnormal ASER and ASH sensory responses. We suggest that neurons and glia would therefore cooperate to readily remove basal ectosomes from PCMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Interestingly, AWC wing cilia and AFD NRE do not collapse in animals expressing <italic>dyn-1</italic> dominant negative in AMsh. Also, AWC and AFD-associated sensory responses remain normal. These observations suggest that the microenvironment of embedded NREs is maintained, contrasting with mutants and transgenics altering AMsh secretome or reducing AMsh exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bacaj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Singhvi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot exclude <italic>dyn-1</italic> dominant negative could alter PCMC shape by mechanisms unrelated to EV endocytosis. Raiders et al. showed that CED-10 activity in AMsh dictates AFD microvilli engulfment rate and AFD microvilli shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Raiders et al., 2021</xref>). Instead, we could not observe an effect of CED-10 activity on cilia cargo engulfment (see more details in <italic>Author response to reviewers</italic>).</p><p>Besides its crucial role in secretion of extracellular matrix to the sensory pores, we suggest that <italic>C. elegans</italic> sheath glia also plays an important function to maintain cilia structure and composition by capture and recycling of ectosome discarded by associated neurons. Similarly, large EVs called exophers are extruded by touch neurons and phagocytosed by the associated hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). In mammals, photoreceptor neurons coexist with closely apposed retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), which phagocytoses a packet of ∼100 discs shed daily from the cilia tip of each photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nachury and Mick, 2019</xref>). Mutations in MERKT, a transmembrane protein involved in recognition and phagocytosis of the photoreceptor outer segments by RPE, lead to accumulation of debris and result in loss of vision and photoreceptor degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D’Cruz et al., 2000</xref>). While the export of ciliary cargoes to the outside or to sheath glia suggests ciliary EVs represent a form of cellular disposal, several examples of bioactive ciliary EVs carrying information across cells are reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wood and Rosenbaum, 2015</xref>). It is possible that ciliary ectosomes have additional significance in cell-to-cell communication between cilia and glia. The export of ciliary ectosome from neurons to glia in pathological conditions contributes to reduce proteostatic stress in cilia and might signal this stress to the supporting glia. Interestingly, the cilia-defective mutants <italic>daf-19</italic> and <italic>bbs-8</italic> also show defective sheath lumen morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perens and Shaham, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2020</xref>). This suggests an interesting possibility where neuronal ectosomes could signal the cilia state to AMsh, while the latter responds by secreting factors in the vicinity of neuronal receptive endings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akella et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We show that ectocytosis is constitutive of most – potentially all – <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory cilia and contributes to grant appropriate cilia composition, structure, and function. Cilia trafficking works as the main mechanism to traffic proteins in an out of the cilia. Ectocytosis might act as a safeguard alternative to reroute accumulated material when cilia trafficking is disrupted. Many questions remain, such as the cargo sorting machinery or the potential function of ectosome export to glia. Here, we establish an in vivo model to address questions relative to ciliary ectosomes production and their potential role in a neuron-glia ensemble.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strain and genetics</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> were cultured on NGM agar plates provided with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 bacteria and grown under standard conditions unless otherwise indicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wood, 1988</xref>).

Synchronized animals were mounted on 2% agarose pads and anesthetized with 25 mM NaN<sub>3</sub> dissolved in M9 solution. Images were acquired in the following 10–60 min after animals were anesthetized. Images were acquired at the Light Microscopy Facility LiMiF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://limif.ulb.ac.be">http://limif.ulb.ac.be</ext-link>) at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, Faculté de Médecine, Campus Erasme, on a LSM780NLO confocal system fitted on an Observer Z1 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Images in which the full animal’s head is displayed were acquired using a LD C-Apochromat 40×/1.1 W Korr M27 objective. The settings for these images were as follows: frame size was set at 1024 × 1024 pixels with a pixel size of 0.13 μm × 0.13 μm, pinhole size was set to 1 Airy Unit, Z-step optical sections varied across images (from 0.3 to 0.64 μm/step size) depending on the desired ROI volume (ranging from 10 to 35 μm in the Z axis), pixel dwell was set to 0.79 μs, and averaging was set to 4. High-resolution details (inset images) were acquired using an alpha Plan Apochromat 63×/1.46 Oil Korr M27 objective. The settings for these images were as follows: frame size was set to 412 × 412 pixels with a pixel size of 0.08 μm × 0.08 μm, pinhole size was set to 1 Airy Unit, Z-step optical sections varied across images (from 0.2 to 0.3 μm/step size) depending on the desired ROI volume (ranging from 10 to 20 μm in the Z axis), pixel dwell was set to 1.95 μs, and averaging was set to 4. Images with a single channel were acquired using GaAsP detector. Images with multiple channels were acquired simultaneously using PMT detector for the following fluorophores: CFP or mEGFP, and the GaAsP detector for wrmScarlet and mCherry signals. For individual channel acquisitions, the Main Beam Splitter matched the excitation wavelength of each used fluorophore. For simultaneous CFP/wrmScarlet or mKate images, a 458/543 Main Beam Splitter was used. For simultaneous mEGFP/wrmScarlet or mCherry, a 488/543 Main Beam Splitter was used. The following fluorophores excitation (Ex) and detection wavelengths (DW) were used: CFP (Ex: 458 nm – DW: 463–558 nm), mEGFP (Ex: 488 nm – DW: 493–569 nm), wrmScarlet/mKate/DiI (Ex: 543 nm – DW: 570–695 nm), and mCherry (Ex: 543 nm – DW: 588–695 nm). Fluorophore excitation and detection wavelength ranges were set according to the information available FPbase database for each fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lambert, 2019</xref>).

Several animals were placed in the drop for 10–15 min prior to imaging until anesthetized. Immobilized worms were then covered with a layer of 4% agarose and maintained in anesthetic solution throughout the acquisition duration.

The FIJI plugin StackReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thevenaz et al., 1998</xref>) was used to correct for slight XY animal movements occurring during acquisition (using rigid body as correction option).

ASER and ASH morphological classification is based on the number of tubulated (diameter &lt;1 μm) and non-tubulated diverticula (not showing any sign of pinch) and originating from a constant 4 μm<sup>2</sup> PCMC. AWC morphological classification is based on the presence or absence of wing membranous expansions and the presence of ectopic cilia branching. AFD morphological classification is based on the number and length of AFD microvilli (length of microvilli in N2 animals was considered to be the baseline) and on the shape of AFD PCMC (protruding base bulges, extensions, and branching).</p><p>Vesicle size was calculated using Zen software line measurement tool, a line was traced from side to side at the midline of each vesicle, obtaining an approximate value of each vesicle’s diameter. To analyze the vesicle content in the animals co-expressing of TSP-6-wrmScarlet and GCY-22-mEGFP in ASER neuron, maximum intensity projections of images of a predetermined size were analyzed to determine the number of vesicles containing TSP-6-wrmScarlet alone, GCY-22-mEGFP alone, and vesicles containing both TSP-6/GCY-22; percentages were determined by dividing the number of vesicles of each group to the total number of vesicles.</p><p>To analyze co-localization of animals co-expressing TSP-6-wrmScarlet and GCY-22-mEGFP in ASER neuron, we used Imaris software version 9 (Oxford Instruments, Zurich, Switzerland).

authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Here, Razzauti and Laurent show that membrane proteins in the cilia of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons can be released in extracellular vesicles (EVs) produced by two distinct regions of the cilium. EVs released from one of these sites can be taken up by an adjacent glial cell, though the functional significance of this remains speculative. Importantly, the authors find that EV release is dramatically enhanced when ciliary membrane proteins are overexpressed, suggesting that this process acts as a safety valve that protects cilium integrity.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Ectosome uptake by glia sculpts <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> sensory cilia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Doug Portman as the Reviewing Editor and Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Maxence V Nachury (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers and editors have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We feel that your paper reports a number of interesting findings that advance our understanding of the biology of cilia and glia in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, there are two areas in which additional experiments would be necessary in a revised submission. In addition, each reviewer has provided additional comments and suggestions that we ask you to consider as you prepare a resubmission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Concerns about overexpression artifacts. Aside from the DiI experiments, all evidence for EV release and glial uptake relies on the overexpression of cilium proteins. This leads to questions about the extent to which your findings reflect typical neuronal/glial functions, or, rather, are observed only when cilia are disrupted by protein overexpression. The best way to address this would be to carry out additional experiments using an endogenously-tagged cargo protein. As pointed out by Reviewer #1 below, such a reagent has been published (GCY-22), so you would not necessarily need to generate any new transgenes.</p><p>(2) Concerns about interpretation of the experiments in which AMsh function is disrupted. As reviewer #2 notes, expression of dyn-1(dn) in AMsh, or loss of ced-10, might compromise AMsh function in ways that affect additional functions besides its ability to take up ciliary EVs. For this reason, it cannot be definitively concluded that the changes you see in NRE morphology and behavior in AMsh::dyn-1(dn) or ced-10 mutants are specific consequences of problems with EV uptake. Further, your experiments do not definitively show that EV uptake relies on the cell-autonomous function of ced-10 in AMsh, so these phenotypes could be indirect. These issues can be addressed with the following experiments.</p><p>(a) examine AMsh morphology in AMsh::dyn-10(dn) and/or ced-10 and AMsh::ced-10 animals. If AMsh morphology is grossly disrupted, this would indicate that its function may be more generally disrupted.</p><p>(b) similarly, examine AWC NRE morphology in these animals. Even if AMsh morphology is intact, its function can be generally compromised. In these cases, the AWC cilium typically collapses.</p><p>(c) carry out ced-10; AMsh::ced-10 rescue experiments, examining EV uptake, ASER NRE morphology, and salt chemotaxis. This would provide a second line of evidence that links EV uptake by AMsh to maintenance of cilium morphology and neuronal function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Are the EVs that end up in glial cells ectosomes? Do they originate from the cilium proper or from the plasma membrane or are they exosomes? The intro (line 63-67) quotes Barr lab papers showing that mutation of MVB biogenesis genes STAM (ESCRT-0), MVB12 (ESCRT-I) or ALIX does not affect production of PKD2 EV by CEM neurons. Are ILVs absent from the MVB in these mutants? The point being raised is whether the hypothesis of MVB origin has been satisfactorily rejected. The question becomes relevant when one considers that the tetraspanins chosen by the authors are known markers of exosomes. In particular CD63 is a marker of exosomes but not of ectosomes as CD63 is enriched in ILVs of late endosomes but not present at the plasma membrane. Leaving open the possibility that the material is transferred via exosomes would be wise.</p><p>The most direct evidence for ectosomes budding from a ciliated neuron and engulfed by a support cell is presented in Video 6. In this video, where is the cilium and where are the microvilli? Can one determine the origin of the EV?</p><p>The use of overexpression system for the ciliary signaling receptors results in their localization to both cilia and PCMC and the dilation of the PCMC. It is therefore conceivable that the observed transfer of material from ciliated neuron to support cell is caused by receptor overexpression. The strong signal at the PCMC for all membrane proteins tested (except SRBC-64) leads one to wonder whether excess signaling receptors may accumulate at the PCMC and become shed. Figure 3C shows that SRBC-64 is present at similar levels in cilia and at the PCMC, unlike the other markers used in the study that are more highly enriched in the PCMC than in cilia. The fact that SRBC-64 is the only receptor that does not end in vesicles inside the support cell casts doubt on the ciliary origin of the EVs. The fluorescent signals also appear to be the weakest for this protein, suggesting that SRBC64 is the least overexpressed of all proteins tested. The result that EV transfer from ciliated neuron to support cell is increased when cilia are absent strengthen the interpretation that the material that is transferred is not of ciliary origin.</p><p>The expression of dominant negative dynamin in AMsh is interesting. Filopodial-looking extensions originating from the ASER are now detected more frequently. This suggests that these filopodial extensions from the ciliated neuron are phagocytosed by the AMsh. The images shown suggest that the filopodial extension do not originate from the cilium itself but rather from the PCMC or the distal dendrite. The strong reduction in TSP7 transfer from AFD to AMsh in mutant that lacks actin-base protrusion suggests that actin-based protrusion are the relevant entities for material sending by the donor cell.</p><p>It would be good to discuss the model that actin protrusions emanating from the PCMC are responsible for the material transfer from neurons to glial cells. Given the strong supportive evidence for actin protrusions playing a role in the process under study, these protrusions could be included in the model in Figure 8. The model should also show PCMC and cilia proper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Release of EVs from sensory neurons and their uptake by surrounding cells has been previously described and should be cited (Melentijevic et al., Nature 2017).</p><p>2. The statement that &quot;DiI passively diffuses in lipid membranes it contacts&quot; is misleading. Several externally exposed neurons do not stain with DiI.</p><p>3. The statement that &quot;most of the glial cells (46 out of 50) associate with groups of ciliated neurons to form sensory organs named sensilla&quot; is confusing. All 50 glia do this.</p><p>4. The statement that the authors observed &quot;barely detectable basal ectosomes… suggesting [their] size [is] close to the light diffraction limit of conventional confocal microscopes&quot; is confusing. The light diffraction limit is related to resolution, that is, the ability to distinguish two objects as being distinct from each other. The authors seem to be referring to brightness which is not necessarily related to size.</p><p>5. The word &quot;length&quot; is misspelled in all figures where it appears.</p><p>Only as a note to the authors: I find the pseudo-typeset formatting to be very difficult to review. I would greatly prefer a simple text document with full-page figures and legends at the end. I understand that others may feel differently.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67670.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) Concerns about overexpression artifacts.

To address it, we carried out new experiments using 2 endogenously tagged EV cargos: GCY-22-GFP and TSP-6-wrmScarlet, both generated by CRISPR-Cas9 knock-in (GCY-22-GFP made by van der Burght et al., 2020 and TSP-6-wrmScarlet by us). In short, our results support these two cargo are released from cilia by EVs in absence of overexpression. However, this export is strongly reduced in knocked in strains compared to overexpression strains. Overexpression strains induce PCMC accumulation of cargo and EV export to the supporting glia. Similarly, <italic>osm-3</italic> and <italic>che-3</italic> cilia trafficking mutants induce PCMC accumulation of cargo and EV export to the supporting glia. Therefore, we suggest PCMC accumulation of cargo in overexpression strain leads to strong export of cargo to the supporting glia. PCMC accumulation of cargo might be explained by saturation of the ciliary trafficking machinery (Figures 4 and 5). We highlight the risk of artefacts when overexpressing cilia cargo in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Concerns about interpretation of the experiments in which AMsh function is disrupted.

We tried to address them as much as possible. In short: both <italic>ced10(n3246),</italic> and AMsh::DYN-1(K46A) affect AMsh shape and position suggesting both manipulation alter AMsh cell biology. In addition, the position and shape of some neurons -likely ASI and ASJ- were also altered in <italic>ced-10(n3246)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) .

(2) In AMsh::DYN-1(K46A), ciliated ends of ASH, ASER, AWC and the microvilli of AFD are abnormally shaped. Interestingly it includes the production of filopodia-like protrusions originating from their PCMC. (3) ~10% of AFD and none of the AWC neurons receptive endings are truncated by expression of AMsh::DYN-1(K46A). (4) Sensory responses mediated by ASER and ASH are strongly reduced while sensory responses mediated by AFD and AWC are unaltered (Figures 7 and 8).</p><p>The absence of sensory defect in AWC and AFD-associated sensory response suggest the microenvironment of these two embedded NREs is maintained. This observation and absence of collapsed NRE strongly contrasts with the effects of AMsh ablation, AMsh exocytosis defect (by RAB-1(S25N) expression) or AMsh secretome defect (in <italic>pros-1</italic> mutants) on AWC and AFD (Bacaj et al., 2008; Singhvi et al., 2016; Wallace et al., 2016).</p><p>Altogether, we conclude that expression of dynamin dominant negative in AMsh alter cilia shape of all amphid neurons tested leading to sensory dysfunction in ASER and ASH. This effect can be explained by deficient EV uptake or by an indirect effect of dynamin dysfunction on AMsh function. We agree we cannot exclude DYN-1 dominant negative would compromise AMsh function in ways that affect additional functions besides its ability to take up ciliary EVs. We modified our discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Are the EVs that end up in glial cells ectosomes?

Entry of plasma membrane cargo into ILV/exosomes require the ESCRT function (Hessvik and Llorente, 2018). Mutants for key ESCRT genes <italic>stam-1</italic> (ESCRT-0), <italic>mvb-12</italic> (ESCRT-I) and <italic>alx-1</italic> (ALIX) did not affect release of apical EVs carrying PKD-2-GFP (Wang et al., 2014).</p><p>In Video 6, we show GCY-22-wrmScarlet ectosomes budding from ASER PCMC to be captured by AMsh. We tested the effect of <italic>alx-1</italic> mutation on GCY-22-wrmScarlet export to AMsh and did not observe significant effects on its export to AMsh, suggesting basal release do not require MVB maturation (See first Figure in this Letter). Despite the described absence of MVB from cilia, we observed overexpressed TSP-7-wrmScarlet to be enriched in cilia of several <italic>C. elegans</italic> sensory neurons (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). Finally, Videos 2 and 3 show the biogenesis of TSP-7wrmScarlet ectosomes budding from the cilia tip, not MVB fusion. Therefore, we believe TSP-7 behave as other ciliary membrane proteins.</p><p>We agree that CD63 is usually used as a marker of exosomes. However, CD63 also marks other EVs (Kowal et al., 2016) is present at plasma membrane (Pols and Klumperman, 2009). Mutations in the lysosome targeting motif of CD63 makes it to behave like CD9 (enrichement in large Ectosomes/EVs ;(Mathieu et al., 2020)) and this lysosome targeting motif is not present in TSP-7. Nevertheless, to avoid confusion, we did all new experiments with TSP-6 – the ortholog of CD9 – a marker of microvesicle/ectosomes. We leave open the possibility other cargos might be exported to AMsh through exosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most direct evidence for ectosomes budding from a ciliated neuron and engulfed by a support cell is presented in Video 6.

We improved the labelling and legends of Video 6 and Video 9 to avoid confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of overexpression system for the ciliary signaling receptors results in their localization to both cilia and PCMC and the dilation of the PCMC.

In animals expressing DYN-1(DN) in AMsh, and mKate in neurons, filopodial-looking extensions are observed originating from the PCMC of ASH, ASER, AWC and AFD. We suggest that filopodial-looking extensions attached to PCMC might reflect ectosome undergoing abnormal phagocytosis from PCMC.

The light diffraction limit is related to resolution, that is, the ability to distinguish two objects as being distinct from each other. The authors seem to be referring to brightness which is not necessarily related to size.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #2 is correct, we apologize for this misunderstanding and removed this sentence in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
