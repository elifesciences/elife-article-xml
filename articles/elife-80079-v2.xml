understanding of the developmental relationships between these subsets, and a determination of how their transcriptional landscape compares to their acute infection counterparts remains unclear. Additionally, whether cell-intrinsic factors such as TCR usage influence CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate commitment during persistent infection has not previously been studied. Herein, we perform single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with single-cell T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) on virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from mice infected with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. We identify several transcriptionally distinct states among the Th1, Tfh, and memory-like T cell subsets that form at the peak of infection, including the presence of a previously unrecognized Slamf7<sup>+</sup> subset with cytolytic features. We further show that the relative distribution of these populations differs substantially between acute and persistent LCMV infection. Moreover, while the progeny of most T cell clones displays membership within each of these transcriptionally unique populations, overall supporting a one cell-multiple fate model, a small fraction of clones display a biased cell fate decision, suggesting that TCR usage may impact CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell development during chronic infection. Importantly, comparative analyses further reveal both subset-specific and core gene expression programs that are differentially regulated between CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute and chronic LCMV infection. Together, these data may serve as a useful framework and allow for a detailed interrogation into the clonal distribution and transcriptional circuits underlying CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation during chronic viral infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CD4+ T cell differentiation</kwd><kwd>chronic viral infection</kwd><kwd>scRNAseq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI125741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Weiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99/R00 AI153537</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zander</surname><given-names>Ryan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI148403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Weiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH NIAID</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK127526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kasmani</surname><given-names>Moujtaba Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cui</surname><given-names>Weiguo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIGMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM080202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kasmani</surname><given-names>Moujtaba Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CD4+ T cells responding to chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection display transcriptional heterogeneity that is marked by both lineage-specific gene expression profiles and core gene expression programs that are upregulated and conserved across multiple distinct populations of T helper cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells play an essential role in coordinating innate and adaptive immunity against multiple pathogens. Upon antigen encounter and exposure to inflammatory cytokines, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells display an inherent capacity to adapt diverse functional fates and facilitate immunity through their secretion of soluble meditators and direct cell interactions with other immune cell populations. In response to either an acute or persistent viral infection, naïve antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells clonally expand and primarily differentiate into either T helper type 1 (Th1) or T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which support cellular or humoral responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheikh and Groom, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies have provided insight into how the fate commitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is established early after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell priming. Notably, the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) and IL-2R signaling strongly influences this bifurcation decision, with increased TCR and IL-2R signaling generally favoring Th1 lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Snook et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanistically, activation of the TCR and IL-2R signaling pathways results in the induction of Blimp-1, a transcription factor (TF) that is critical for Th1 differentiation and that also potently antagonizes Bcl-6, a transcriptional repressor that is required for Tfh differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnston et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, early exposure of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to IL-12 and type I IFN signaling can promote Th1 cell differentiation by inducing expression of T-bet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hsieh et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manetti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ray et al., 2014</xref>), which is the lineage-defining TF that is required for Th1 development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Szabo et al., 2000</xref>). Th1 cells can then travel to sites of infection where they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IFN-γ, and TNF-α, which contribute to the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sheikh and Groom, 2021</xref>). Thus, Th1 cells play a critical role in orchestrating immunity against intracellular pathogens. Conversely, dendritic cell presentation of antigen and secretion of IL-6 facilitates early Tfh differentiation by inducing Bcl-6 expression and the subsequent upregulation of CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crotty, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Eto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2013</xref>). Pre-Tfh cells then migrate from the T cell zone to the T cell-B cell border where they can interact with antigen-presenting B cells via ICOS-ICOSL and CD40-CD40L pathways, which are required for fully instilling the Tfh program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crotty, 2011</xref>). Mature Tfh cells then provide essential help signals to pathogen-specific B cells to facilitate germinal center (GC) reactions, B cell secretion of high-affinity antibodies, and the generation of memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crotty, 2011</xref>).</p><p>After the initial T cell expansion phase, the pool of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells begins to decline in both self-resolving and chronic infections, although the nature of the infection plays a major role in shaping the overall magnitude, subset distribution, and functional capacity of responding CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. In acute settings, following pathogen clearance, distinct populations of memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells develop that are well equipped to confer long-lasting protection against re-infection. These memory cells include Th1- and Tfh-like subsets (which may represent T effector memory cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hale et al., 2013</xref>), tissue resident memory cells that provide rapid protection at frontline sites of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iijima and Iwasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schreiner and King, 2018</xref>), and a less differentiated T central memory (Tcm) cell population that displays an increased capacity to proliferate and produce IL-2 upon secondary challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pepper and Jenkins, 2011</xref>). While several studies have provided evidence that differentiated effector Th1 and Tfh cells can give rise to long-lived memory cells, previous work further indicates that a memory precursor population develops among early responding CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and that this precursor population also significantly contributes to the establishment of durable and effective CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell memory following resolution of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, similar to that of Tcm cells, this precursor subset displays high expression of CCR7, TCF-1, and Bcl2, and as such was referred to as Tcm precursor (Tcmp) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, these Tcmp cells display an augmented capacity to survive the contraction phase of acute infection and generate diverse effector cell populations during a secondary response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>). The development and functional fitness of Tcmp cells have recently been identified to be dependent on the TF Thpok (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>), although previous work also indicates that Bcl-6, in addition to its well-established role in facilitating Tfh differentiation, is also important for the generation of Tcmp cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation during acute viral infection is a well-synchronized process that results in appropriately balanced Th1, Tfh, and Tcmp cell formation at the peak of infection, and these subsets can then give rise to highly functional memory populations.</p><p>In contrast to acute settings, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to persistent infection or cancer often acquire dysfunctional features, including a diminished capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that coincides with the upregulation of co-inhibitory receptors such as PD-1, Tim-3, and CTLA-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, several studies have identified that Th1 formation and function is drastically reduced during chronic viral infection, and this decline in Th1 formation is accompanied by a relative increase in Tfh cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>). This shift in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation is thought to be important to limit Th1-mediated immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2015</xref>), while at the same time promote Tfh-mediated antibody responses that are required for viral clearance from the periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cook et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greczmiel et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, recent work in the field has further demonstrated that in addition to the anticipated Th1 and Tfh populations that form during chronic viral infection, a previously unrecognized memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset also develops, and this subset bears a transcriptional program similar to that of Tcmp cells from acute infection, as evident by its high expression of <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Ccr7</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic>, and <italic>Bcl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Snell et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreatta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were found to display an augmented capacity to accumulate during persistent infection, and they also exhibited the propensity to give rise to either Th1 or Tfh cells, indicating that this subset displays some developmental plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic viral infection are also capable of exhibiting memory-like properties, even in the presence of ongoing viral replication. However, despite these recent advances, our understanding of how CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells adapt under settings of persistent antigen exposure and inflammation remains incompletely understood. Moreover, although recent reports have demonstrated that several transcriptionally distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets develop during acute viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>), whether analogous or additional heterogeneous populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells emerge during chronic viral infection, and how these subsets compare to those from acute infection have remained significant knowledge gaps in the field. Additionally, questions remain about how chronic viral infection perturbs the functional and transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, and whether these alterations in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment are due to global differences in gene expression programs or stem from differences in the distribution pattern of T helper cell subsets that develop under these contexts.</p><p>While previous studies have demonstrated that most antigen-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones can give rise to multiple lineages following acute bacterial or viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>), recent evidence indicates that some clones may also display a biased cell fate decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, cell-intrinsic factors, such as TCR signal strength, TCR affinity for cognate peptide, and TCR chain usage have all recently been implicated in contributing to shaping CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate decision during viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tubo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Künzli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, TCR signal strength was found to exert opposite effects on the balance of Th1 to Tfh cells depending on whether the infection was acutely resolving or persistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Künzli et al., 2020</xref>). However, we currently do not fully understand the extent by which TCR repertoire impacts cell fate decisions during chronic viral infection. Additionally, whether naïve T cells with particular TCR chains display the propensity to give rise to multiple independent lineages during chronic viral infection, or whether some clones preferentially acquire a particular differentiation program that may skew the T helper cell response in the setting of chronic infection, remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) coupled with single-cell TCR sequencing (scTCR-seq) to investigate the transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection. Notably, we uncovered previously unappreciated transcriptional heterogeneity among the virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell pool, including the identification of several transcriptionally distinct states within the Th1, Tfh, and T memory-like cell populations. Moreover, we found that, similar to findings from acute viral infection, the majority of CD4 T cell clones responding to chronic viral infection displayed remarkable developmental plasticity as evidenced by their membership across multiple distinct subsets, although a small fraction of clonotypes did appear to exhibit a preferred lineage choice. Lastly, using an integrated analysis to compare the transcriptional program and subset distribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to either acute or chronic LCMV infection, we identified that persistent infection is not only associated with altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset formation and gene expression profiles, but also changes in core gene expression modules that span multiple distinct T helper cell populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic LCMV infection are transcriptionally diverse and are dominated by a few large clones</title><p>To better understand the transcriptional heterogeneity and clonal diversity among CD4 T cells responding to chronic viral infection, we performed paired scRNA-seq and scTCR-seq on splenic GP<sub>66-77</sub> (GP<sub>66</sub>)-specific CD4 T cells that were isolated from two individual mice on day 10 post-LCMV Clone 13 (Cl13) infection, a timepoint in which the endogenous GP<sub>66</sub>-specific T cell response is approximately at its peak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>). We defined a clone as a group of T cells sharing the same nucleotide sequence from the CDR3 regions of both the α and β chains of the TCR. In order to safeguard against potential errors produced during fluorescence-activated cell sorting or sequencing misreads, we restricted our analysis to clones with at least two cells sharing the same TCR α and β chain CDR3 sequences. This resulted in a total of 168 clones for mouse 1 (M1) and 159 clones for mouse 2 (M2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), consisting of 5185 total cells between our two samples (2836 cells for M1 and 2349 cells for M2). These findings are in line with the expected range of TCR clonotypes reported in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kotturi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>) and suggest that our scRNA-seq approach likely recovered the majority of the constituents from the GP<sub>66</sub>-specific clonal repertoire. Interestingly, and similar to our analysis on the T cell repertoire for GP<sub>66</sub>-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during acute LCMV Armstrong infection, we did not observe any clonal overlap between M1 and M2 when α and β chain CDR3 sequences were paired on a per cell basis, although a few instances of TCR CDR3 overlap were observed when considering either α and β chain CDR3 sequences individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results highlight a tremendous amount of diversity within the TCR repertoire, even among genetically identical hosts. We next assessed patterns of clonal distribution and dominance. Notably, the top five clones for each mouse (which ranged from comprising 3.7 to 9.8% of the GP<sub>66</sub>-specific pool) accounted for ~40–45% of all cells in the dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), demonstrating that the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell response during LCMV Cl13 infection is dominated by a few large clones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clonal distribution and transcriptional landscape of GP66-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection.</title><p>(<bold>A–I</bold>) GP66-specific splenic CD4 T cells were isolated and sort-purified from two individual LCMV Clone 13 (Cl13)-infected mice on day 10 post-infection, and the 10× Genomics pipeline was used to generate a combined single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) + T cell receptor (TCR) seq library.

Using Seurat’s module score feature to more accurately quantify the gene expression patterns of these clusters in comparison to published gene sets further supported that clusters 2 and 5 are composed of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).

Consistent with our scRNA-seq analyses, a subset of cells displayed low expression of Ly108 and high expression of CXCR6, indicating that these cells are likely of the Th1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Additionally, one small population (which only comprised ~2–6% of the CD4 T cell pool) displayed uniformly and exclusively high expression of Slamf7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), indicating that these cells likely correspond with the <italic>Slamf7</italic>-hi cells from cluster 6 in our scRNA-seq analysis. Another subset displayed increased expression amounts of CXCR5 and PD-1 relative to the other cells, suggesting that this population is likely composed of cells found within the GC Tfh2 subset. Interestingly, some cells that clustered together exhibited intermediate expression amounts of CXCR5 and high expression of IL-1R2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a marker that was increased in both the pre-Tfh and Tfh1 subsets, possibly indicating that IL-1R2 expression can be used to distinguish these populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. A large proportion (~36%) of cells expressed high amounts of Ly108 and IL-7Ra, suggesting that this population of cells likely corresponds with the <italic>Slamf6</italic>-hi cells from cluster 0. Of note, cells did not appear to cluster together based off of Mx1-GFP expression; rather, Mx1, an IFN-stimulated gene, was detected via GFP expression across all t-SNE clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Our Monocle analysis formed a tree structure containing three major branches, with cells from the Ly6c-hi Th1 and Lag3-hi Th1 clusters residing on the far-right branch, cells from the GC Tfh2, Tfh1, and Slamf7 clusters dwelling on the far-left branch (as well as on one minor branch stemming off of this major branch), and cells from the Slamf6-hi subset localizing more on the central branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, cells from both the Slamf6-hi and pre-Tfh clusters could readily be detected along all three branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), possibly indicating that these subsets may retain a higher degree of developmental plasticity. Conversely, the position of Th1 cells and Tfh cells at the far ends of the branches may insinuate that these subsets have reached a more terminal stage of differentiation.

Accordingly, we recently reported that a sizeable fraction (~28%) of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones display a preferred lineage choice toward either Th1 or Tfh cells during acute LCMV Armstrong infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, TCR structure, and in particular the CDR3 motif of the TCR α chain, was determined to be a driving influencer of this biased cell fate decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). However, given that TCR signaling strength may exert opposite effects on the balance of Th1 to Tfh cells depending on the nature of the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Künzli et al., 2020</xref>), whether CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic viral infection also display similar patterns of differentiation at the clonal level remains unclear. Merging our single-cell clonal and transcriptomic datasets together allowed us to track the lineage commitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones from the GP<sub>66</sub>-specific repertoire during chronic LCMV Cl13 infection. Notably, a high degree of clonal overlap was observed amongst all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets identified in our scRNA-seq analysis, with most subsets displaying &gt;30% overlap with any given subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In line with this finding, upon examination of the top five clones (which contained 193–230 cells per clone), we identified that each clone displayed membership in every cluster from our scRNA-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that similar to acute infection, one naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell displays the capacity to give rise to multiple T helper cell lineages during persistent infection. Intriguingly, when assessing the cellular distribution of all clones with at least 2 cells per clone (168 clones for M1 and 159 clones for M2), we identified that while the majority of clones (~75%) had some membership in at least two or more lineages (Th1, Slamf6-hi, or Tfh as defined by Monocle branch), a small fraction of clonotypes exhibited a preferred lineage choice, with ~15% of clones displaying select membership in only the Th1 lineage and &lt;10% of clones displaying exclusive membership in either the Slamf6-hi or Tfh lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To more formally test whether some CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones display a biased cell fate decision during chronic LCMV infection, we performed a more stringent analysis in which we restricted our dataset to clones that have at least four cells (176 clones between two mice), and Th1 or Tfh-biased clones were then identified by assessing the lineage membership of each clone (based on their Monocle state) using a threshold cut-off of 65% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>).

Notably, all of the clusters initially identified in our LCMV Cl13-restricted dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) were also detected in this integrated dataset, although clear differences in the relative proportion of each cluster were observed when grouped by infection status (acute vs chronic; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In particular, the proportion of Ly6c2-hi Th1 and Lag3-hi Th1 cell subsets were dramatically reduced (by ~50%) during LCMV Cl13 as compared to LCMV Armstrong infection; this reduction in Th1 cell formation was accompanied by increased frequencies of Slamf6-hi, pre-Tfh, ISG, and Slamf7-hi clusters, whereas GC Tfh2 and Tfh1 clusters remained similar between infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CD4 T cells responding to chronic viral infection display altered subset distribution patterns and core gene expression modules compared to their acute infection counterparts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was performed on single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) libraries obtained from GP66-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Clone 13 (Cl13) infection (this study) and acute LCMV Armstrong infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>) that were integrated together using the integration function in Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>).

In addition, our finding that the ISG cluster is overrepresented during LCMV Cl13 infection is consistent with previous reports showing that type I IFN-stimulated genes remain elevated during chronic viral infection compared to acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teijaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, although Eomes was previously identified to be overexpressed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crawford et al., 2014</xref>), in this study, we identified that this is likely due to a preferential expansion of the Slamf7<sup>+</sup> subset, of which displays uniquely high expression of Eomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Consistent with this observation, we found that the proportion of Slamf7<sup>+</sup> Eomes<sup>+</sup> virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was increased by ~10-fold during chronic LCMV Cl13 infection compared to acute LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate that the nature of the infection (i.e. resolution vs chronicity) may impact the relative distribution of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets that develop with persistent infection resulting in a notable attenuation in Th1 responses and an accompanying increase in the formation of memory-like, pre-Tfh, ISG, and Slamf7<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations.</p><p>To assess potential shifts in gene expression profiles that varied by infection and that spanned across all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, we performed module score analyses to compare Th1, Tfh, memory T cell, TCR signaling, and T cell dysfunction gene signatures across all of the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters. Notably, module score analysis demonstrated that most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters from chronic LCMV infection exhibited decreased expression of the Th1-associated program, possibly suggesting that an attenuation in Th1-like activity is a broad feature of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic viral infection and not only a result of a decrease in the Th1 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Conversely, Tfh module scores were generally similar between acute and chronic LCMV CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters, although the Ly6c2-hi Th1 and Lag3-hi Th1 cell subsets from chronic LCMV infection did display a relatively increased Tfh signature compared to their acute infection counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Intriguingly, although the relative score varied by cluster, both memory T cell and Tcmp gene signatures, as well as progenitor CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell genes, were enriched across all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters stemming from chronic LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>, 1 F), possibly suggesting that persistent infection promotes a core quiescence- or memory-associated transcriptional program in responding CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which may be important to limit Th1-mediated immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2015</xref>). This observation is in line with our previous finding that CXCR6<sup>+</sup> Th1, CXCR5<sup>+</sup> Tfh, and memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets all display equivalent accessibility at key memory-associated gene loci, such as <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Slamf6</italic>, and <italic>Ccr7</italic>, indicating that multiple distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineages may remain poised to upregulate a memory-associated program during chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, and similar to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wherry et al., 2007</xref>), most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters from LCMV Cl13 infection uniformly displayed increased TCR signaling, T cell dysfunction, and T cell exhaustion gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>), once again suggesting that persistent exposure to antigen and inflammation may result in the upregulation of some conserved (and dysregulated) gene expression programs that span multiple phenotypically distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets. In line with this, all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters from LCMV Cl13 infection displayed notable increases in their expression of certain intracellular signaling phosphatases and kinases, such as <italic>Dusp1</italic>, <italic>Dups2</italic>, and <italic>Pim1</italic>, as well in their expression of several genes encoding various TFs, including <italic>Jund</italic>, <italic>JunB</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Klf2</italic>, and <italic>Bhlhe40</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Additionally, genes known to be downstream of TCR signaling such as <italic>Cd69</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, and <italic>Tox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khan et al., 2019</xref>), IFN-stimulated genes such as <italic>Isg15</italic> and <italic>Irf7</italic>, and genes encoding the inhibitory receptors Lag3, Tigit, and CTLA4 were all overexpressed across all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clusters from chronic infection compared to acute LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Together these data indicate that certain core transcriptional programs are upregulated across virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets independent of phenotype in response to sustained exposure to persistent viral infection. Conversely, some TFs with increased expression during chronic infection are more uniquely expressed by particular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, such as <italic>Zbtb32</italic> in the Slamf6-hi cluster, <italic>Eomes</italic> in the Slamf7-hi cluster, and <italic>Prdm1</italic> (encodes Blimp1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) in the Th1 clusters from chronic infection, indicating that some gene expression programs are specific to a particular lineage. Of note, several genes or gene expression programs were also found to be downregulated in particular CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets during chronic infection, such as <italic>Id2</italic>, <italic>Cxcr6</italic>, and effector CD8 T cell signature genes in Th1 cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) as well as <italic>Cxcr5</italic> and <italic>Icos</italic> in the GC Tfh2 cluster, whereas Id3 appeared to be downregulated in most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets from chronic LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that chronic viral infection results in both altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset distribution as well as distinct gene expression programs, with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets displaying not only lineage-specific gene expression profiles but also core gene expression programs that are conserved across multiple distinct populations of T helper cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we demonstrate that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic LCMV infection are more heterogeneous than previously appreciated, with several transcriptionally distinct subsets being detected within Th1, Tfh, and T memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell populations. We further demonstrate that while the progeny of most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones displayed immense developmental plasticity, suggesting a one cell-multiple fate model, a small fraction of clones appeared to exhibit a biased cell fate-decision, indicating that TCR usage may have an impact on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. Additionally, we highlight some potential flow cytometric gating strategies that can be used to further interrogate these respective subsets and also provide evidence that the relative distribution of these populations differed substantially between acute and chronic viral infection. Lastly, our integrated analyses revealed that chronic viral infection results in vastly altered gene expression programs in responding CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, with evidence for not only lineage-specific gene expression profiles but also core gene expression programs that are upregulated and conserved across multiple distinct populations of T helper cells. Collectively, these data may serve as a useful resource to assess and compare the transcriptional landscape and differentiation trajectory of virus-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones during acute and chronic viral infection.</p><p>Several recent studies have identified that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to acute viral infection are composed of multiple transcriptionally distinct CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets, including Th1, Tfh, and Tcmp cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). While the differentiation and helper functions of Th1 and Tfh subsets in these acute settings are fairly well established, recent work has also yielded important insight into the transcriptional profile and developmental biology of Tcmp cells. Notably, Tcmp cells display high expression of memory cell markers CCR7, TCF-1, and Bcl-2 and have an intrinsic capacity to survive the contraction phase of acute infection and generate diverse effector cell populations during a secondary response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marshall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pepper and Jenkins, 2011</xref>). The development of Tcmp cells has been demonstrated to be dependent on both Thpok and Bcl6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pepper and Jenkins, 2011</xref>). Thus, our understanding of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation during acute infection is becoming increasingly more well defined. By comparison, our knowledge of how CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells adapt in the face of persistent antigen exposure and inflammation remains incompletely understood. Moreover, whether diverse populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells also emerge during chronic infection or whether they can display memory-like properties have remained significant knowledge gaps in the field. Notably, recent studies have identified that a memory-like CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population develops alongside Th1 and Tfh cell subsets during chronic viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>) and that this memory-like subset bears a strikingly similar transcriptional profile as Tcmp cells from acute LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>). However, whether additional heterogeneity exists amongst the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell pool during chronic viral infection remains unclear. Moreover, an in-depth assessment into how the transcriptional landscape of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells differs between acute and chronic viral infection at the single-cell level has not previously been explored. Herein, we demonstrate that CD4 T cells responding to chronic viral infection are more heterogeneous than previously appreciated, with several transcriptionally distinct subsets arising during the early phase of chronic infection. These include two potentially unique Th1 cell subsets (Ly6c-hi and Lag3-hi cells), two Tfh-like subsets (GC Tfh2 and Tfh1), a memory-like population, and a pre-Tfh subset that exhibits both a memory-like signature and also expresses some Tfh-associated genes. Additionally, our scRNA-seq analyses identified a cluster of Slamf7-hi cells that may represent a cytolytic CD4 T cell subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cachot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Della-Torre et al., 2018</xref>), as well as a unique cluster that displayed increased expression of multiple ISGs, consistent with chronic infection driving a sustained type I IFN response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Teijaro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). Using spectral flow cytometry, we validate the formation of several of these subsets during chronic viral infection and also highlight a few potential gating strategies and markers that may be useful in interrogating these subsets further. However, future work will be important to elucidate the developmental relationship between these respective populations and to establish whether some of these newly identified subsets represent functionally distinct lineages or merely transitional states along the Th1, Tfh, or memory T cell developmental pathways.</p><p>Notably, while our TCR clonal trajectory analyses indicate that the majority of GP66-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell clones responding to chronic LCMV infection appear to be multipotent, a small fraction of T cell clones appeared to display a biased cell fate decision and favored a particular lineage. Overall, this finding is consistent with other recent studies from resolving infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tubo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>) and suggests that the vast majority of naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are capable of giving rise to multiple distinct lineages independent of TCR sequence, although TCR structure may still influence the differentiation trajectory of some select clones. As certain CDR3 motifs from the TCR alpha chain have previously been implicated as being a useful predictor of T cell fate during acute LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>), a deeper investigation into whether particular TCR alpha or beta chain sequences impact CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell fate determination during chronic viral infection will be of future interest.</p><p>Consistent with chronic viral infection resulting in diminished Th1 differentiation and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamada et al., 2016</xref>), our integrated scRNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the proportions of both Ly6c-hi and Lag3-hi Th1 cells were dramatically reduced during chronic vs acute LCMV infection. Interestingly, module score analyses identified that loss of the Th1 gene expression program was not restricted to only the Th1 cell subsets but was conserved across multiple distinct subsets, indicating that loss of Th1-like pro-inflammatory activity may be a generalizable feature of T helper cell responses during chronic viral infection. This loss in Th1 cell subset formation coincided with increased frequencies of multiple subsets, including Slamf6-hi, pre-Tfh, ISG, and Slamf7-hi clusters, whereas the Tfh clusters remained similar between infections. Intriguingly, we further observed an enriched quiescence or memory-associated transcriptional profile across most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets responding to chronic viral infection, despite viral load remaining high at this time point. Although the reasons for this remain unclear, it is possible that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells responding to chronic infection need to acquire a more quiescent or memory-like phenotype in order to mitigate Th1-mediated pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penaloza-MacMaster et al., 2015</xref>). This enhanced acquisition of a memory-like phenotype is supported by the relative increased formation of Slamf6<sup>+</sup> and pre-Tfh populations during persistent infection, which exhibit high expression of <italic>Tcf7</italic>, <italic>Il7r</italic>, <italic>Ccr7</italic>, and <italic>Bcl2</italic>. However, it is important to note that despite this enriched memory-associated program, most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets responding to chronic LCMV infection also displayed increased TCR signaling and T cell dysfunction or exhaustion module scores, indicating that these cell subsets are not likely to be in a truly quiescent state nor do they fit the description of canonical memory populations. Consistent with this, we identified that <italic>Id3</italic>, a TF known to be critical for memory T cell formation following acute infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yang et al., 2011</xref>), was substantially diminished in most CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets from chronic infection compared to their acute infection counterparts. Moreover, in line with increased TCR signaling during chronic viral infection, we observed a conserved increase in the expression of AP-1 family members <italic>Jund</italic> and <italic>Junb</italic>, as well as in <italic>Cd69</italic>, <italic>Nr4a2</italic>, and <italic>Tox</italic> gene expression across all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets during LCMV Cl13 infection. Similarly, exhaustion markers <italic>Lag3</italic>, <italic>Tigit</italic>, and <italic>Ctla4</italic> were uniformly increased in all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets responding to chronic viral infection. Intriguingly, while these data highlight a broad upregulation of dysfunctional programs spanning multiple distinct populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic viral infection, it is worthy to mention that Th1 cell subsets from chronic infection displayed markedly higher dysfunction and exhaustion module scores compared to all other subsets. This data, coupled with previous observations demonstrating a rapid loss of Th1 responses during chronic viral infection (which may possibly reflect clonal deletion) and that Th1 cells rapidly lose their capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines as the infection progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fahey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Osokine et al., 2014</xref>), indicate that Th1 cells do exhibit some cardinal features of the process of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell exhaustion. At the same time, however, Th1 cells (from both acute and chronic infection) displayed increased expression of effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and Th1 cells further exhibited the highest capacity to produce IFN-γ and TNF-α upon ex vivo peptide stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, while Th1 cells responding to chronic viral infection share some overlap in their transcriptional program with both effector and exhausted CD8 T cells, whether these cells (or other populations of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells) are truly ‘exhausted’ remains to be investigated further.</p><p>Collectively, our results highlight perturbed gene expression programs in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic viral infection, with apparent alterations in both lineage-specific T helper cell programs and also core expression modules that are differentially regulated across all CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets between acute and chronic viral infection. A future investigation into the transcriptional circuits underlying the altered CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation that occurs during chronic infection may have important implications for strategies aimed at improving T cell-based immunotherapies during chronic infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Mx1-GFP homozygous mice (Jackson strain #:033219) were crossed to C57Bl/6 mice to generate Mx1-GFP heterozygous mice that were then used for some experiments where indicated. Mice were bred and maintained in a closed breeding facility, and mouse handling conformed to the requirements of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines of the Medical College of Wisconsin. All of the animals were handled according to approved IACUC protocols (#’s 00003003 and 00003004) of the Medical College of Wisconsin. Mice were infected with 2×10<sup>6</sup> plaque forming units (PFU) of LCMV strain Cl13 via retroorbital injection to establish chronic viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>For cell sorting experiments, splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from LCMV Cl13-infected mice were isolated using the EasySep mouse CD4 T cell isolation kit (STEMCELL; Cat#19852). Enriched CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were then stained using LCMV-specific GP<sub>66-77</sub> PE tetramer from National Institutes of Health along with CD4 and CD44 antibodies in FACS buffer. The staining was performed in the dark for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by three washes with FACS buffer. Gp66-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were sort-purified on a FACS-Aria sorter. For FACS analyses, single cell suspensions obtained from spleenocytes from LCMV Cl13-infected mice were stained with GP<sub>66-77</sub> PE tetramer in conjunction with other surface antibodies in FACS buffer, followed by three washes in FACS buffer. Samples were then acquired on either an Aurora Cytek (Cytek Biosciences) or LSR-II (BD Biosciences). In some experiments, after surface staining, cells were fixed with buffer from the True-Nuclear TF Buffer Set (BioLegend) for 1 hr. Then cells were then washed with permeabilization buffer and stained with antibodies against TFs in permeabilization buffer.

Sorted cells were loaded onto the 10× Chromium Controller with a target cell number of 5000 per mouse. scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 5’ v2 Reagent Kit (10× Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Two libraries were then quantified using the KAPA library quantification Kit and then were loaded onto an Illumina NextSeq 500 sequencer with the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (150 cycles; 20024907; Illumina) with the following conditions: 26 cycles for read 1, 98 cycles for read 2, and 8 cycles for the i7 index read. Raw sequencing data were downloaded from Illumina BaseSpace, then demultiplexed and converted to gene-barcode matrices using the ‘mkfastq’ and ‘count’ functions in Cell Ranger v3.0 (10× Genomics).

Cell cycle scores were regressed when scaling gene expression values and TCR genes were regressed during the clustering process, which was performed with the Louvain algorithm within Seurat and visualized with UMAP. Cells other than CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, sample-specific outliers, and cells not belonging to clones with at least two cells were excluded. A clone was defined as a group of cells sharing the same TCR α and β chain CDR3 nucleotide sequences. Trajectory analyses were performed using Monocle (v 2.12.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>). The Monocle tree structure was generated using the DDRTree algorithm with the top 100 differentially expressed genes from each Seurat cluster.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Gene set enrichment and module score analyses</title><p>A preranked analysis module in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) was used, and the gene sets were found in MSigDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liberzon et al., 2011</xref>). For single cluster enrichment analysis, differentially expressed genes were identified first (logFC &gt;0.1), and the average logFC expression of each gene was calculated. Then, this average gene expression data for each cluster was used as an input for GSEA. After this, a gene set variation analysis score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hänzelmann et al., 2013</xref>) was calculated using log normalized expression data for each cluster and chosen gene sets, as identified by GSEA. Seurat clusters were scored by GSEA gene sets using the Addmodulescore function. Gene sets for Th1, GC T<sub>FH</sub>, Tcmp, T cell dysfunction, and memory CD4 T cells were obtained from published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ciucci et al., 2019</xref>). Gene sets for progenitor, effector, and exhausted CD8 T cell subsets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zander et al., 2022</xref>) or memory CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wherry et al., 2007</xref>) were obtained from previously published data. Module scores for TCR signaling were calculated within our Seurat clusters using the ‘TCR pathway’ gene set from GSEA (KEGG hsa04660).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Cellular distribution at the clonal level for three lineages</title><p>The cellular distribution of all clones (two or more cells/clone; n=327 clones) among the three different lineages defined by Monocle states (Th1, Tfh, and Slamf6 memory-like; described above) was shown using the pheatmap R package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This allowed for visualization of cellular distributions of each clone among the lineages, thus demonstrating the differentiation preference of each clone (i.e. single fate or multifate). To statistically test whether some clones display a biased cell-fate decision, we performed an analysis using clones that have at least four cells (n=176 clones). Briefly, Th1 or Tfh biased clones were identified if 65% of the cells in that clone belonged to either the Th1 or Tfh lineage, respectively, based on their Monocle states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>). The validation of this biased clonal fate was performed using Th1 or Tfh module scores for each clone. Clonal Th1 or Tfh module score was calculated by taking the average module score for all cells in that clone. However, Th1 or Tfh module scores at the clonal level have a different scale or range so direct comparison at the clonal level was not possible. To do this, percentile ranks for the module scores at the clonal level were added by taking the average percentile module score for all cells in that clone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khatun et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Canonical correlation analysis</title><p>A comparative scRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis was performed by combining our previously published scRNA-seq data of GP<sub>66</sub><sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from two LCMV Armstrong-infected mice on day 10 p.i.

To do this, we used the integration function in Seurat to perform a CCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>) and identify shared subpopulations across datasets. As an initial step of the analysis, cells were filtered based on having high percentage of mitochondrial genes in the transcriptome (&gt;10%) and less than 200 to ~4000–5000 unique genes to remove any doublets and dead cells. Following this, a total of ~18,000 cells were included in the analysis for four mice. Cell cycle gene scoring was calculated for all cells and regressed out. To understand cellular heterogeneity, unsupervised clustering was performed using a dimension reduction algorithm called, UMAP, based on 3000 highly variable genes with an input of the top 20 principle components.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical tests for flow cytometry data were performed using Graphpad Prism 8. p Values were calculated using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-tests. p Values for violin plots showing gene set-specific module scores across clusters were calculated by the Wilcoxon test with Holm-Sidak correction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

heterogeneity in response to chronic viral infections. The authors utilize the murine LCMV c13 infection model and perform single-cell RNA seq analysis on day 10 post-infection to identify multiple, previously unappreciated, T-cell subsets and then go on and verify these analyses using multi-color flow cytometry before comparing the transcriptome of CD4 T cells from chronic infection to a previously generated data set of CD4 T cells obtained from acutely-resolved LCMV infection. This is a valuable transcriptomic resource of murine CD4 T cell subsets in chronic viral infection. The study will be of broad interest to a wide range of researchers focused on studying CD4 T cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80079.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Kellie N</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.12.491625">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.12.491625v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We have now performed additional module score analyses, of which include a comparison of progenitor, effector and exhausted CD8 T cell gene expression programs (Zander et al., 2019) across the CD4 T cell subsets identified from our canonical correlation analysis of virus-specific CD4 T cells responding to acute and chronic LCMV infection. In addition to displaying the relative “score” of these expression programs, we have now additionally included a dot plot (in Figure 4—figure supplement 1F) depicting key signature genes from these expression modules, so that readers can assess the relative expression of indicated genes across CD4 T cell clusters.</p><p>With regards to the reviewer’s question on whether certain subsets appear more “exhausted” than others, we do in fact observe that Th1 cell subsets from chronic LCMV infection display markedly higher dysfunction and exhaustion module scores compared to their Th1 counterparts from acute LCMV infection, as well as all other CD4 T cell clusters (Figure 4G-H). Additionally, most CD4 T cell clusters responding to chronic LCMV infection displayed relatively increased dysfunction scores compared to their acute infection counterparts. In line with these findings, we observed that the relative expression of several exhausted and dysfunctional-associated genes (<italic>Pdcd1</italic>, <italic>Lag3, Tox, Nr4a2, Tigit</italic> and <italic>Ctla4</italic>) were upregulated in most CD4 T cell clusters from chronic LCMV infection compared to their acute infection counterparts, and many of these genes were highly expressed in the Th1 cell subsets from chronic infection (Figures 4I, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Taken together, these results show that Th1 cells from chronic infection appear to exhibit a similar gene expression program as exhausted CD8 T cells, although whether these cells are truly “exhausted” remains to be investigated further. Of note, however, and consistent with an “exhausted” phenotype, previous work has demonstrated that there is a rapid loss of Th1 responses during chronic viral infection (which may possibly reflect clonal deletion), and that these cells further display a diminished capacity to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines as the infection progresses. However, Th1 cells still appear to be the major producers of IFN-g and TNF-a during chronic infection, suggesting that these cells may still might play an important role in contributing to control over viral replication.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have included further commentary on these findings in the Discussion section in order to further integrate these findings into the current concept of CD4 T cell exhaustion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The paper should be better contextualized in the introduction with regards to the prior publications from the same group (Khatun 2021, Zander 2022). This will help the reader focus on what is new within the current work.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded some of the paragraphs in the introduction section to help contextualize previous findings from our group and others, and also state what some of the current knowledge gaps in the field were that this study sought to address. These sections in the revised manuscript have been highlighted in yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there any biological basis for a tree structure for the lineage relationships of the different cell subtypes such as assumed by the monocle analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a useful point brought up by the reviewer, and yes, we do believe that there is a biological basis for this tree structure. We and others have recently demonstrated that a subset of Slamf6+ TCF-1<sup>hi</sup> memory-like CD4 T cells display progenitor-like qualities and can differentiate into either Th1 or Tfh cell subsets during persistent viral infection (Zander et al., <italic>Immunity</italic> 2022, Xia et al., <italic>Immunity</italic> 2022). Similarly, several groups have previously demonstrated that Slamf6 (Ly108) expression marks a subset of progenitor CD8 T cells that give rise to more terminally differentiated subsets during persistent infection and cancer. (Miller et al., <italic>Nature Immunology</italic> 2019, Utzschneider et al., <italic>Immunity</italic> 2016, Zander et al., <italic>Immunity</italic> 2019). For this reason, the Slamf6+ memory-like subset was chosen to serve as the root state for our Monocle analyses. Interestingly, memory-like cells appeared to fall along all major branch points, whereas Th1 cell subsets and Tfh cell subsets appeared to localize on separate branches, consistent with these later populations representing separate T cell lineages (Figure 3A). This observation is also consistent with our previous adoptive transfer experiments showing that Th1 and Tfh cells do not readily interconvert between one another following transfer into infection-matched hosts (Zander et al., 2022). We have now discussed these observations further under the trajectory analysis section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Based on the displayed plots in Figure 3AB Monocle seems to have identified three further branching points (labelled 1-3 in the plot) beyond the main branching point (labelled 4 in the plot). This is in contradiction with the description of the tree in the text as being tripartite and deserves some discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. In our initial Monocle analysis, which used the top 110 significant differentially expressed genes to construct the tree, we described the tree as tripartite since there were three major branches present that contained either Th1 cells, Tfh cells, or memory-like cells. However, as mentioned by the reviewer, three smaller branches were also present, and these were located along the branch way spanning from the memory-like cells towards the Tfh cell clusters. Some pre-Tfh cells, Slamf7-hi cells, Tfh cells, and memory-like cells could be seen residing on these smaller branches as well as on the main branch along this trajectory. Overall, we believe that these observations are consistent with there being multiple transcriptionally distinct CD4 T cell populations being present during chronic viral infection, and this may further reflect how far a particular cluster has progressed along a developmental pathway, with cells at the end of branches appearing to be more terminally differentiated than the cells located along the middle of the major branches. For example, many memory-like cells and pre-Tfh cells can be seen along the middle of the two major branches, but not as much at the tips of the branches, suggesting that these populations may exhibit more developmental plasticity compared to the other cells, such as Th1 cells that reside at the end of the branch and accordingly have likely progressed to a terminal differentiation state.</p><p>Of note, we have since re-ran our Monocle analysis using only the top 100 significant DEGs to construct the tree, which has resulted in a more simplified tree structure that once again still has three major branches, but only contains one smaller branchpoint that appears to be enriched with pre-Tfh cells, but also contains some Tfh cells and memory-like cells. Overall, the findings remain very similar to our initial analysis in that mature Th1 and Tfh cells are found at the end of the branches, whereas the Pre-Tfh and memory-like cells are more centrally located along multiple branches. We have now discussed these observations more thoroughly in the paper, and the changes have been highlighted in yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– To demonstrate biases in clonal fate choice beyond chance a more robust statistical analysis is needed. In a clone of two cells say even by chance both of these might come from the same phenotypic cluster even in the absence of bias. Therefore the stated proportions of clones with broad or more narrow fates are not a meaningful metric.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point. In our previous analysis, we were simply using the ≥ 2 cells per clone cutoff to provide an overall view of the cellular distribution for different cell fates. We agree that in order to make any conclusions on the presence of biased cell fate decisions, a more stringent cut-off (higher number of cells/clone) would be required.</p><p>Thus, to test whether some clones display a biased cell fate decision, we have now performed an analysis using clones that have at least 4 cells, which left 176 CD4 T cell clones for analysis. The clonal distribution and cellular fate of these 176 clones are plotted in the heatmap (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A; similar to Figure 3E). To determine clones with biased cellular fates, a threshold of 65% was used meaning Th1 or TFH biased clones were identified if 65% of the cells in that clone belonged to either the Th1 or TFH lineage, respectively, based on their Monocle states (Khatun et al., 2021). The validation of this biased clonal fate was performed using Th1 or TFH module scores for each clone. Clonal Th1 or TFH module score was calculated by taking the average module score for all cells in that clone. However, Th1 or TFH module scores at the clonal level have a different scale or range so direct comparison at the clonal level was not possible. To do this, percentile ranks for the module scores at the clonal level was added by taking the average percentile module score for all cells in that clone (Khatun et al., JEM 2021).</p><p>Notably, and similar to our analysis using at least 2 cells per clone, we identified that a major proportion of clones appear multi-fated. Importantly, however, a small proportion of clones appeared to display a biased cell fate decision, with approximately 21% of the 176 clones displaying a preferential skewing towards the Th1 lineage (p = 2.443521e-09), and approximately 8.5% showing a preferential bias for a Tfh cell fate (p=3.903672e-05). These results are now displayed in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and additions to the text are highlighted in yellow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the clonal trajectory analysis biases in clonal fates are not necessarily indicative of TCR-signaling driven fate choice, as TCR clones are also linked by a common lineage relationship. Stronger evidence for TCR signaling might be provided if it can be demonstrated that fate choices are correlated across distinct clones that have TCRs with a similar sequence, an approach the authors have taken in prior work but is missing here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point, and we wanted to clarify that we are not trying to make any conclusions about the impact of TCR-signaling on regulating cell fate decisions here, but rather wanted to show that TCR signaling appears augmented in multiple developmentally distinct CD4 T cell subsets during chronic viral infection compared to acute infection. This is evident through the augmented TCR signaling module scores spanning multiple subsets, and also the upregulation of multiple genes downstream of TCR signaling indicative of sustained TCR stimulation in the presence of chronic viral infection. However, a determination of how persistent TCR signaling shapes CD4 T cell development and function during chronic viral infection remains an ongoing investigation in our lab.</p></body></sub-article></article>
