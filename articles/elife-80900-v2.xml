lung endothelial cell ablation. Intratracheal instillation of DT in transgenic mice expressing human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor targeted to ECs resulted in ablation of &gt;70% of lung ECs, producing severe ALI with near complete resolution by 7 days. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, eight distinct endothelial clusters were resolved, including alveolar aerocytes (aCap) ECs expressing apelin at baseline and general capillary (gCap) ECs expressing the apelin receptor. At 3 days post-injury, a novel gCap EC population emerged characterized by de novo expression of apelin, together with the stem cell marker, protein C receptor. These stem-like cells transitioned at 5 days to proliferative endothelial progenitor-like cells, expressing apelin receptor together with the pro-proliferative transcription factor, <italic>Foxm1</italic>, and were responsible for the rapid replenishment of all depleted EC populations by 7 days post-injury. Treatment with an apelin receptor antagonist prevented ALI resolution and resulted in excessive mortality, consistent with a central role for apelin signaling in EC regeneration and microvascular repair. The lung has a remarkable capacity for microvasculature EC regeneration which is orchestrated by newly emergent apelin-expressing gCap endothelial stem-like cells that give rise to highly proliferative, apelin receptor-positive endothelial progenitors responsible for the regeneration of the lung microvasculature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>angiogenesis</kwd><kwd>endothelial cells</kwd><kwd>pulmonary biology</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>apelin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN - 143291</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>Duncan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomic analysis reveals novel regenerative endothelial cell populations that mediate remarkably rapid and complete microvascular repair in a novel model of acute lung injury induced by endothelial cell ablation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ALI and its severe clinical counterpart, the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, accounting for ~30% of ICU admission with 28 day mortality approaching 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ranieri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wheeler and Bernard, 2007</xref>). Despite decades of research, no specific therapies have been developed that improve outcomes in ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ranieri et al., 2012</xref>). The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the devastating nature of this condition as infection with the SARS CoV2 virus leads to a particularly severe form of ARDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batah and Fabro, 2021</xref>) which has been responsible for the vast majority of over 5 million deaths world-wide. COVID-19-associated ARDS has a strong vascular component which is characterized by intense endothelial inflammation (endothelialitis) and necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lowenstein and Solomon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joffre et al., 2022</xref>), consistent with the emerging role of endothelial injury in other forms of ALI leading to the breakdown of the air-blood barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jin et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, recent reports have suggested that endothelial repair is required for the resolution of ALI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Minamino and Komuro, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2012</xref>), and thus an important target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie lung microvascular repair and its role in ALI resolution. In experimental models the transcription factor, Forkhead box M1 (<italic>Foxm1</italic>), has been implicated as a driver of endothelial cell (EC) proliferation and microvascular repair that is required for ALI resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mirza et al., 2010</xref>), and apelin has been reported to protect against inflammation and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). During angiogenesis, apelin is induced in endothelial tip cells by tissue hypoxia and VEGF and signals to trailing stalk ECs that express the apelin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eyries et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kidoya and Takakura, 2012</xref>). Even though apelin is known to play an important role in vascular development and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kidoya and Takakura, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yan et al., 2020</xref>), the relevance of this peptide for microvascular repair in ALI and ARDS has not been explored.</p><p>It has increasingly been recognized that ECs play a key role in orchestrating tissue repair through the self-renewal and differentiation of resident stem and progenitor cells in an organ-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rafii et al., 2016</xref>). The understanding of this heterogeneous EC landscape has been greatly facilitated by the introduction of single-cell transcriptomics analysis. Using this approach, two specialized lungs microvascular EC populations have recently been described in the normal lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; ‘aerocytes’ (aCap ECs), which are characterized by the expression of apelin, and general (gCap) ECs expressing the apelin receptor. Aerocytes are highly differentiated, large cells that make up the endothelial component of the alveolar air-blood barrier and are incapable of proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, gCap ECs are smaller and located at thicker regions of the alveolar wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>) and respond to injury by proliferation; therefore, represent the lung EC population within which endothelial stem cells may arise.</p><p>To better understand the role of endothelial injury and repair in ALI, we established a new model induced by targeted lung EC ablation. We now demonstrate that EC ablation was sufficient to result in severe ALI, with all the features of standard models induced by inflammatory or toxic agents. Remarkably, animals survived the loss of up to 70% of the lung vascular endothelium by virtue of rapid EC regeneration initiated by the emergence of a new gCap endothelial stem cell population post-injury that paradoxically exhibited the de novo expression of apelin together with a stem cell marker, protein C receptor (<italic>Procr</italic>). This population rapidly transitioned to highly proliferative progenitor-like cells, characterized by apelin receptor and <italic>Foxm1</italic> expression, which were responsible for repopulating all depleted lung endothelial fields, including aerocytes, by an apelin-dependent mechanism leading to rapid ALI resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Selective lung EC ablation in Cdh5-DTR mice</title><p>Binary transgenic animals harboring Cdh5-cre-iDTR were obtained by crossing homozygous DTR and Cdh5 mice to generate double heterozygous offspring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Remarkably, the loss of more than 70% of lung ECs was compatible with survival by virtue of an efficient endogenous regenerative response that resulted in near complete restoration of the lung microvascular structure and function in just one week. This model underscores the importance of the endothelium in the pathogenesis of ALI and affords a unique opportunity to explore the mechanisms underlying EC regeneration and microvascular repair, which is critical for ALI resolution. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we have identified novel regenerative EC populations emerging in a tightly scripted temporal sequence after EC injury. For the first time, we show robust apelin expression within gCap, stem-like ECs that give rise to apelin receptor-positive, highly proliferative progenitors which are responsible for the replenishment of all depleted EC pools, including the highly specialized aerocytes (aCap ECs) that reform the air-blood barrier.</p><p>In the normal uninjured lung, we confirmed that the expression of apelin identified an EC population corresponding to alveolar aCap ECs, or ‘aerocytes,’ as previously described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>. These were characterized as large, highly specialized cells forming the air-blood barrier, thereby playing an important structural role in gas exchange. This population also appears to be analogous to an EC population described earlier in close apposition to alveolar type 1 epithelial cell and expressing high levels of <italic>Car4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Niethamer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>), one of five genes typically expressed by aCap ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vila Ellis et al., 2020</xref>). We also describe, for the first time, the emergence of novel EC populations after EC injury which, based on the expression of typical marker genes, originate from gCap ECs. In particular, we have identified a gCap EC population that, remarkably, exhibits de novo expression of apelin together with gCap markers such as CD93 (with the exception of the apelin receptor) demonstrating for the first time apelin expression in gCap ECs. This population was also characterized by the unique expression of two other genes, <italic>Procr</italic> (protein C receptor) and <italic>Angpt2</italic> (angiopoietin 2), that have both been implicated in angiogenesis and vascular repair. Angiopoietin 2 is an endogenous antagonist of the Tie2 receptor that is strongly expressed in endothelial tip cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felcht et al., 2012</xref>) and is instrumental in the initiation of angiogenic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maisonpierre et al., 1997</xref>), whereas <italic>Procr</italic> has recently been reported to be a marker of bipotent resident vascular endothelial stem cells that have the capacity to regenerate ECs as well as pericytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), the two cell types required for the genesis of stable neovessels. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Procr</italic> also identifies a subpopulation of CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with markedly greater proliferative and bone marrow engraftment potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balazs et al., 2006</xref>). Together, this is consistent with the stem cell nature of this transient population of endothelial stem cells which initiates the regenerative response after EC ablation.</p><p>Apelin-positive, gCap ECs showed no evidence of proliferation at 3 days post-injury; however, by 5 days they transitioned to a highly proliferative phenotype with expression of apelin being replaced by its receptor, consistent with a dynamic role for the apelinergic system in driving a transition from the endothelial tip- to stalk-like, proliferative progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palm et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, a very similar stalk-like progenitor population emerged within the transient EC Cluster 7. Both these populations expressed <italic>Foxm1</italic>, which has previously been implicated in lung microvascular repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), and exhibited similar proliferative gene expression signatures; however, Cluster 7 showed a greater density of <italic>Foxm1</italic> and <italic>Mki67</italic> expressing proliferative ECs. Finally, the pivotal role of apelin in EC regeneration was confirmed by the failure of resolution of ALI after DT-induced lung injury and excessive mortality in older mice exhibiting reduced expression of apelin and with the administration of a selective receptor antagonist. The proposed mechanism of microvascular endothelial repair is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>.</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Schematic of endothelial cell (EC) populations contributing to microvascular repair.</title><p>At baseline (day 0), there are two main alveolar groups of capillary ECs: larger apelin-positive aerocytes (aCap) ECs, termed aerocytes, that play a key structural role in forming the air-blood barrier; and smaller apelin receptor-expressing general capillary (gCap) ECs, which are found in the thicker regions at the corners of the alveoli. After diphtheria toxin (DT)-induced EC ablation, there is a marked depletion of both EC populations and the appearance of novel transitional and transient populations. At day 3, there is the appearance of stem-like gCap ECs that paradoxically express apelin, but not its receptor, and are characterized by various stem and progenitor cell markers but show no evidence of proliferation. By day 5, these transition to ECs expressing <italic>Aplnr</italic> which have a strong proliferative phenotype, as evidenced by Forkhead box M1 (<italic>Foxm1)</italic> and <italic>Mki67</italic> expression, and then rapidly replenish depleted EC pools, including aCap ECs, by day 7.

As well we were not able to perform lineage tracing studies to define the origin of the endothelial stem- and progenitor-like cells that were responsible for repopulating all depleted EC populations given the difficulties of doing this in a double transgenic model compounded by the very transient nature of the populations of interest. However, consistent with our findings it was previously demonstrated by lineage tracing that only gCap ECs exhibited evidence of proliferation after lung injury, which was interpreted as evidence that regenerative stem cells would reside only within this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the use of single-cell transcriptomics allowed us to reliably identify aCap and gCap ECs at each timepoint during endothelial repair using a panel of marker genes that distinguish between these distinct populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillich et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schupp et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Speculation and Ideas: <italic>Procr</italic> has been suggested to be a marker of primitive, endothelial-like hematopoietic precursors (i.e. pre-HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lan, 2017</xref>) that give rise to both ECs and HSCs during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dzierzak and Bigas, 2018</xref>), playing a critical role in the early genesis of both blood and blood vessels. <italic>Procr</italic> has also been reported to be expressed by ~90% of bone marrow side population cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balazs et al., 2006</xref>), which are thought to have important regenerative activity. However, <italic>Procr</italic> was not expressed by any EC population in the healthy lung, and only appeared transiently in the gCap endothelial stem- and progenitor-like cells during the microvascular repair. This suggests that lung vascular injury results in a re-activation of a fundamental vascular stem cell that is central to both vascular development and repair. Whether this also occurs in other vascular beds after the endothelial injury is unknown; however, the protean nature of the expression of this stem-cell marker in different cell types would support its role as a general mechanism in vascular regeneration and repair. The unique co-expression of <italic>Procr</italic> and apelin in this gCap EC population also allows for the identification and isolation of these regenerative cells to explore the mechanisms underlying their generation post-EC injury. Indeed, on day 3 post-DT-induced ablation, ~15% of all lung ECs expressed <italic>Procr</italic> making their isolation feasible using commercially available kits for PROCR. As well, the therapeutic potential of these cells could be explored using adoptive cell therapy, for example, in syngeneic preclinical models of ALI. However, for translation to clinical use, one would need to develop a cell product suitable for human use that could be scaled. To this end, small molecule libraries could be screened for the ability to induce expression of apelin and EPCR, with the intent of generating endothelial stem-like cells in cultured ECs. As a readily available source of autologous ECs, colony-forming ECs derived from circulating monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoder et al., 2007</xref>) would be well suited for this purpose using <italic>Apln</italic> and <italic>Procr</italic> reporter genes and high throughput technology.</p><p>Thus, we have delineated the cellular and molecular processes involved in rapid and complete microvascular regeneration using a new model of ALI induced by targeted EC ablation. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis has revealed a novel gCap endothelial stem-like population expressing apelin and <italic>Procr</italic> and emerging soon after endothelial injury, subsequently giving rise to <italic>Foxm1</italic>-positive progenitor-like ECs expressing the apelin receptor. These highly proliferative ECs were responsible for replenishing all depleted EC populations leading to the rapid resolution of the ALI phenotype by an apelin-dependent mechanism. These findings highlight the critical role of apelin signaling in regulating the activity of regenerative cells that mediate lung microvascular repair and provide insights for the development of novel regenerative strategies for the treatment of ALI and ARDS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Transgenic models</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care Ethics Committee in agreement with guidelines from the Canadian Council for the Care of Laboratory Animals under protocol OHRI-2747.

Libraries for 48,347 cells were sequenced using a NextSeq500 (Illumina) with a mean of 8550 reads per cell, and a median of 1560 UMIs and 845 genes per cell. CellRanger v4.0 software (10 x Genomics) was used to process raw sequencing reads with the mm10 reference transcriptome and with additional manual annotation of the DTR transgene. MULTI-seq barcode libraries were further trimmed to 28 bp using Trimmomatic v.0.39 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic">https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Demultiplexing, doublet removal, and quality control</title><p>Barcodes were demultiplexed using the R package deMULTIplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGinnis et al., 2019b</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq">https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq</ext-link>).

Cells with a high proportion (&gt;30%) of mitochondrial transcripts and those with low complexity (&lt;200 detected genes) were excluded from the final matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). A total of 21,665 cells were used for downstream analyses. Data were log normalized and variable genes were detected using ‘vst’ method. Integrated analysis on top 3000 genes was conducted under ‘SCT’ method where cell cycle and mitochondrial content and treatment condition were regressed out prior to the calculation of PCA and UMAP on the first 40 principle components. Cell clusters were characterized using an automated annotation tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tan and Cahan, 2019</xref>) and by cross-referencing differential gene expression of individual clusters to previously characterized lung cells of the <italic>Tabula Muris</italic> cell atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabula Muris Consortium et al., 2018</xref>). The identity of the various lung cell clusters was further confirmed by the assessment of the expression of cell-specific genes. Subset analysis was performed on the following bulk populations: endothelial, stromal, lymphoid, myeloid, and epithelial where cell numbers allowed. Subset analysis followed the same integration pipeline during original processing, and high-resolution cell identities were recombined to produce a global UMAP with high-resolution nomenclature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Differential expression analysis</title><p>Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using R package Muscat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crowell et al., 2020</xref>) multi-sample multi-group scRNA-seq analysis tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crowell et al., 2023</xref>).

Briefly, CellRank (version 1.5.2.dev139+g44b213e) was used as a python package (python version 3.8.13). CellRank requires results from scVelo as input to infer macrostates typically include initial and terminal states.

NicheNet takes prior knowledge of cell signaling interactions from data bases of ligand-receptor, cell signaling, and gene regulatory networks. We sought to evaluate cell signaling at day 3 and day 5 of ALI resolution compared to control (day 0) conditions. To identify potential receiver clusters, we set a threshold of &gt;50 DEGs at each timepoint compared to control (day 0) conditions, identifying cells that had been strongly affected by DT injury. We chose to retain all cell types as potential sender cells of the inferred prioritized ligands. Following the pipeline established by NicheNet we identified the top predicted ligands affecting each receiver cluster based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, evaluated by NicheNet. The circos plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) identify which cells are predicted to send these top ligands during ALI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Apelin inhibition</title><p>The role of the apelin pathway in lung microvascular repair was assessed using a selective apelin receptor antagonist, ML221 (Tocris, 10 mg/kg) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maloney et al., 2012</xref>) dissolved in DMSO delivered by intraperitoneal injection as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishimaru et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Code availability</title><p>Code used to generate scRNAseq analysis is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/rsgodoy/Single-Cell-Transcriptomic-Atlas-of-Lung-Microvascular-Regeneration-After-Targeted-EC-Ablation">https://github.com/rsgodoy/Single-Cell-Transcriptomic-Atlas-of-Lung-Microvascular-Regeneration-After-Targeted-EC-Ablation</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Godoy, 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Prism v.8.4.2 (GraphPad Software).

The novelty and elegance of this study are rooted in the regional and specific ablation of lung endothelial cells using diphtheria toxin without the massive inflammatory activation that is seen with lung injury induced by bacterial infections, viral infections, or lipopolysaccharide. The data convincingly demonstrate that there is an emergence of a highly proliferative lung endothelial subpopulation with specific molecular signatures that facilitate regeneration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80900.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Jalees</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Rehman</surname><given-names>Jalees</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>de Jesus Perez</surname><given-names>Vinicio</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00f54p054</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Kuebler</surname><given-names>Wolfgang M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/001w7jn25</institution-id><institution>Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.07.12.452061">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.12.452061v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Clarify the &quot;stem-like&quot; nature of the cells. Is Procr just a marker of the stem-like cells endothelial cells or is it involved in the stem-like nature. &quot;stem-like&quot; really refers to multipotency – can these cells become non-endothelial cells? Or are they merely progenitors of endothelial cells and can only mature into endothelial cells? Providing experimental evidence for the &quot;stem-like&quot; nature by performing differentiation assays or replacing &quot;stem-like&quot; with a more appropriate term may be helpful.</p><p>2. Mechanistic studies: Apelin and Procr are repeatedly mentioned as two key markers of the new transition process that the endothelial cells undergo but the studies remain mostly descriptive except for the apelin inhibitor study which only measures mortality but does not track actual endothelial regeneration. Overexpression of apelin or Procr in vivo using lung endothelial-specific gene delivery (or shRNA delivery to block) and measurement of lung EC regeneration would help define their mechanistic roles. Alternatively, one could consider ex vivo studies on lung ECs to demonstrate potential mechanistic roles for the gCap transition process.</p><p>3. Bioinformatic analysis of ECs: One key claim is the transition of gCap ECs into the proliferative EC subpopulation. How does this observation relate to the emergence of proliferative lung EC populations following lung injury described by others in the field? Can one model the trajectory of the transient &quot;stem-like&quot; and proliferative EC populations using Monocle3 or other trajectory-building algorithms?</p><p>4. FoxM1: An unbiased analysis of the potential transcription factors involved in cell transition and proliferation activation would be helpful. This could be performed by algorithms that infer transcription factor activities in single-cell data (so that one does not have to rely on mRNA levels of transcription factors). it would be very compelling if FoxM1 was one of the top inferred transcription factors by such an unbiased analysis.</p><p>5. Non-endothelial cells: The authors have very valuable non-endothelial single-cell data which shows changes in cell numbers but there is no analysis of the transcriptome change in those cells. if the authors can show how endothelial ablation itself affects the gene expression in alveolar macs, epithelial cells, and other immune cells, then it would have broad implications for our understanding of how endothelial cells regulate lung homeostasis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Single Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Lung Microvascular Regeneration after Targeted Endothelial Cell Ablation&quot; by Soares Godoy et al. underlines the importance of single-cell RNA seq in the discovery of mechanisms in lung microvascular repair. Overall, the study is well-designed, and the experiments are concise and relevant. However, there are certain areas where further explanation is required to greatly improve the quality of the manuscript and make it suitable for publication.</p><p>1. One of the major points referenced in the introduction is the role of ALI/ARDS in Sars-Cov-2 infection. I wonder if it would be possible to compare the datasets obtained from the DT-mouse study and the recently published scRNA-seq analysis of COVID lungs (doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03569-1) to identify whether there are similar cellular/genetic/molecular changes. This will greatly strengthen the implications of this animal study's findings and help mitigate the weaknesses associated with the model.</p><p>2. Could the authors obtain access to lung tissue from ALI/ARDS patients (+/- COVID) and stain for aCap/gCap and apelin molecules? It would be interesting to see whether these cell types exhibit patterns similar to animal ones.</p><p>3. The scRNA-seq dataset is incredibly rich and will be a major resource for the community. While the focus is understandably on ECs, I think attention should be given to cell-cell interactions across the lung. Could the authors carry out ligand-receptor analysis to further emphasize how other cell types react to the injury? Please see doi.org/10.1038/s41576-020-00292-x for details regarding the methodology that can be used to carry out this analysis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors propose apelin-apelin-receptor signaling between &quot;stem-like cells&quot; (Cluster 1, zone 2) and &quot;progenitor-like cells&quot; (cluster 1, zone 3, and cluster 7) as a driver of endothelial regeneration, yet these cells seem to exist at different time points (in fact, the authors propose that the latter emerge from the former). So, how can cell A signal to cell B if at the same time cell A already transitions into cell B by way of this signaling?</p><p>2. For cluster 1, I am surprised that the authors did not use RNA velocity analyses to validate the time-dependent transition of cells across the different zones in this cluster. Such analyses would clearly strengthen the conclusion that this is a single cell type that is undergoing different cell states during this process.</p><p>3. What is the signal that activates these &quot;stem-like cells&quot; and makes them transition from basal gCap into cluster 1, zone 2 cells? Is it the apoptosis of adjacent endothelial cells, or the concomitant inflammation? While it may be difficult to answer this question, some discussion may be warranted as identification of such a signal would allow replicating – e.g., for in-depth studies but also for therapeutic purposes as suggested by the authors – this transition in vitro.</p><p>4. The mortality data comparing young vs. old mice and the effects of the apelin receptor antibody are interesting, but more insight at the cellular level would help to further validate (or refute) the proposed concept. Specifically, one may ask whether age or apelin receptor inhibition can prevent the formation of Cluster 1 zone 3 cells at Day 5 post-DT? I realize that, unfortunately, such an experiment is prevented by the fact that most of these mice die on day 4, and the residual mice may present a survival bias. But how do the authors reconcile the fact that these mice die at D4, while the actual apelin-receptor positive population (cluster 1 zone 3) which supposedly is targeted by the apelin receptor antibody only emerges on D5?</p><p>5. In Figure 1C, it would be helpful to show that the apoptotic cells are indeed endothelial cells by counterstaining with CD144, CD31, etc. rather than DAPI alone.</p><p>6. In their section on Speculations and Ideas, the authors propose isolating stem-like and progenitor-type gCap cells at different time points after DT treatment. Indeed, such isolation would go a long way to validate the proposed non-proliferative nature of the former vs. the high-proliferative nature of the letter by actual functional assays rather than transcriptomic profiles alone. This opportunity should at least be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80900.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Compare scRNA-seq on lung ECs with other recent lung injury endothelial scRNA-seq datasets to identify commonalities and differences in the signatures of clusters related to injury and proliferation responses.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in detail in response to Reviewers 2 (Comment 1), we used a publicly available database from a recently published model of LPS induced ALI (DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.158079) to perform a similar temporal analysis to compare the evolution of EC populations and gene signatures after LPS injury to our DT-induced ablation model. This revealed remarkably comparable cell populations essentially replicating the same profiles described in our report, notably the early emergence of an apelin-EPCR positive gCap EC cluster at early time points followed by the transition to a proliferative FoxM1-postive population. These new data are presented in a new Figure 6, Figure Supplement 3 and confirm that the regenerative endothelial populations that we have identified post EC ablation are indeed relevant to a commonly used model of ALI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analyze the scRNA-seq changes in non-endothelial cells and identify potential cell-cell interactions between endothelial and non-endothelial cells</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have performed further analyses on the major non-endothelial populations and developed a new high-resolution global UMAP now presented in a new Figure 3. We can now resolve 35 separate cell clusters, 26 of which represent non-endothelial cells. We have also performed an analysis of cell-cell interactions using NicheNet (doi.org/10.1038/s41592-019-0667-5), the results of which are presented in a new Figure 9. At Day 3, only one cluster – transitional cluster 1 – met our criteria for a ‘receiver’ population (&gt;50 DEGs) (panels A and B) with the top 10 ligands (signals) originating from 21 clusters encompassing all global cell populations (stromal, myeloid, lymphoid, epithelial and endothelial). At Day 5, there was a substantial increase in cell-cell interactions, with 5 endothelial receiver populations responding to signals from 31 sender populations as shown in panels C and D. This is described in more detail in the response to the Reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Perform a more in-depth analysis of changes in endothelial cell states using trajectory building and RNA velocity analyses as well as infer potential transcription factors driving the changes to assess whether there are additional factors beyond FoxM1 that are activated in the proliferative cluster</p></disp-quote><p>As described more fully in our responses to Reviewers 1 (Comment 3 and 4) and 3 (Comment 2), we have now used the Python package scVelo to evaluate the RNA velocity and trajectory analysis interactions (new Figure 5). In brief, these new analyses validate the transition of EC regenerative populations within Zones 2 and 3 of cluster 1 ultimately repopulating depleted capillary, as well as arterial and venous EC populations. This is described in more detail in the responses to Reviewers #1 and #3 below.</p><p>In addition, we used decoupleR to explore the activity of relevant transcription factors based on prior knowledge of transcription factors-gene set. This analysis confirmed that FoxM1 was among the most prominent transcription factors (Figure 6 —figure supplement 2). See response to Reviewer #1 for a more detailed description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Characterize the apelin signaling pathway and its role in driving the shift of endothelial cells to stem-like states</p></disp-quote><p>While we provide in vivo evidence suggesting a functional role for the Apln-Aplnr pathway in microvascular repair, it should be recognized that we used apelin expression mainly as a marker to identify the regenerative EC population. Even if mechanistic studies did not ultimately support an important functional role, we would argue that this would not detract from the novelty and utility of our data. Nonetheless activation of the major apelin signaling pathways was seen in Zones 2 and 3 of Cluster 1 at Days 3 and 5, respectively (see Figure 7), which is consistent with a functional role for this pathway. We also provide a chord diagram to better illustrate the genes that are activated or inhibited in Cluster 1 during the emergence of this EC population (i.e., Day 3 vs. Day 0; Figure 8, Figure Supplement 2). This analysis shows that three major apelin signaling pathways were activated during this transition (PI3/Akt, mTor, Elf4/p70S6K). However, we fully acknowledge that this is largely observational, and agree that mechanistic studies would be needed to establish whether there is indeed a causal role for apelin signaling in mediating the shift in endothelial stem-like states. We are undertaking these studies using isolated EPCR-positive cells and EPCR mutant transgenic mice, but expect that this will require a substantial of time and resources to complete and respectively suggest that this is beyond the scope of the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Define the stem-like endothelial cells by isolation or in vitro induction, as well as the cues that result in their formation after the loss of adjacent endothelial cells post DT – is it the apoptosis of neighboring endothelial cells or is it the lack of signaling input from neighbors such as junctional cues, or a different mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the isolation of the apelin/EPCR-positive stem-like ECs and defining the cues that result in their formation represent important and logical next steps to follow up on the novel findings contained in the present manuscript. We are making progress in isolating and characterizing these cells; however, this will take considerable time and resources to successfully complete. Therefore, we believe that this work should form the basis of separate follow-on publication. As Reviewer 3 notes, “while it may be difficult to answer this question, some discussion may be warranted as identification of such a signal would allow replicating – e.g., for in-depth studies but also for therapeutic purposes as suggested by the authors – this transition in vitro”. Therefore, we have expanded the discussion to better outline how this might be accomplished (page 17, lines 510-522).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study could be strengthened by addressing the following points:</p><p>1.

However, we used the term, ‘stem-like’ because they do express markers that have previously used to identify resident vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) (doi: 10.1038/cr.2016.85) and hematopoietic stem cells (DOI 10.1182/blood-2005-06-2249). As well, we have shown that they can regenerate all lung EC subtypes, including arterial, venous, gCap and highly specialized aCap ECs (or aerocytes), which are critical for re-establishing the air-blood barrier. As such, the exhibit some features of a potential endothelial stem cell population. While we agree that to call them stem cells would require in vitro characterization of their self-renewal and differentiation potential (which is underway), we respectfully submit that the use of the term ‘stem-like’ is reasonable and justified since it clearly acknowledges to the reader this limitation while highlighting their potential regenerative nature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

While we are pursuing both in vivo and in vitro strategies to better define the functional importance of the apelin and EPCR pathways in microvascular repair, this represents a substantial additional body of new experimental work that we would suggest is beyond the scope of this first report. Nonetheless, even if the results of these mechanistic studies ultimately do not support a functional role in microvascular repair, we would argue that this would not negate the utility of these markers to identify key regenerative cell populations nor detract from the novelty and importance of the data described in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

How does this observation relate to the emergence of proliferative lung EC populations following lung injury described by others in the field?</p></disp-quote><p>The transition to a highly proliferative endothelial population that expresses FoxM1 (among other pro-proliferative TFs) is very consistent with work from others that has implicated FoxM1 lung endothelial repair and resolution of ALI in polymicrobial and LPS models (doi:10.1002/stem.1690; DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0050094; doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.29.442061) as well as in models of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201906-1232OC).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can one model the trajectory of the transient &quot;stem-like&quot; and proliferative EC populations using Monocle3 or other trajectory-building algorithms?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the Reviewer’s suggestions, we have used the Python package scVelo to evaluate the RNA velocity and trajectory analysis within our EC clusters. This dynamical model showed a progressive shift of ECs through Zones 2 and 3 of transitional Cluster 1 with strong vectors towards depleted EC populations, including gCap ECs of Cluster 0, arterial and venous EC populations (new Figure 5A). Notably, Zone 2 cells exhibited evidence of DNA synthesis (panel B), whereas cells in Zone 3, and the proliferative Cluster 7, showed increased G2M score, consistent with EC proliferation. Moreover, we identified the top 15 genes involved in driving these trajectories (panel C), with 8 genes implicated in the transition from cluster 1 to cluster 0, 5 genes related to the transition from Cluster 1 to aCap ECs/aerocytes (Cluster 2) and 2 genes for Cluster 1 to venous ECs. Finally, an inferred latent time plot of the 300 top driver genes revealed the same temporal progression of gene expression as observed with the independent timepoint analysis (Panel D). Therefore, despite the fact that this velocity analysis infers a timeline based only on genomic cues (i.e., proportion of spliced RNA), and is agnostic to the actual timing of the cell harvesting in the serial transcriptomic dataset, it approximates remarkably well the temporal shifts in EC populations that were demonstrated by serial scRNA-seq at the defined timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We used the decoupleR software package to infer TF activity based on known TF-gene set interactions. This revealed 25 TFs that are significantly up or downregulated in our dataset, with very distinct profiles in the different ECs populations (Figure 6, Supplement Figure 2). Not surprisingly, the greatest increase in TF activity was seen in the proliferative Cluster 7 with FoxM1 indeed being among the top candidates. Other TFs known to be involved in cell cycle regulation were also identified, including three members of the E2f family, Myc and Tfdp1. As well, there were some surprising findings such as strong Nanog and Sox 10 activity seen only in aCap ECs. These TFs are known to play important roles in stem cell and developmental biology. In Cluster 3, which is characterized by high expression of early response genes such as c-Fos, we saw strong activity of the Ets family member, Elk4, which binds to the serum response element in the promoter of the c-Fos. Of note, the same four TFs found in gCap-ERG ECs were also seen in the arterial (and less so venous) cluster, but not in other capillary ECs, further confirming the transcriptional heterogeneity of capillary EC populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Non-endothelial cells: The authors have very valuable non-endothelial single-cell data which shows changes in cell numbers but there is no analysis of the transcriptome change in those cells. if the authors can show how endothelial ablation itself affects the gene expression in alveolar macs, epithelial cells, and other immune cells, then it would have broad implications for our understanding of how endothelial cells regulate lung homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and agree that the remarkable changes in non-endothelial populations in response to EC ablation has broad implications. We have performed a subset analysis on non-endothelial populations with higher resolution nomenclature and breakdown of significant temporal changes after EC injury and during lung repair, which is now presented in new Figure 3. While the greatest transcriptomic changes were seen in EC populations, a number of non-EC populations were in the top 10 most affected including alveolar and interstitial macrophages, pericytes and type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. We also assessed cell-cell interactions between non-endothelial populations and ECs in a new Figure 9 as described in detail in response to Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript titled &quot;Single Cell Transcriptomic Atlas of Lung Microvascular Regeneration after Targeted Endothelial Cell Ablation&quot; by Soares Godoy et al. underlines the importance of single-cell RNA seq in the discovery of mechanisms in lung microvascular repair.

One of the major points referenced in the introduction is the role of ALI/ARDS in Sars-Cov-2 infection. I wonder if it would be possible to compare the datasets obtained from the DT-mouse study and the recently published scRNA-seq analysis of COVID lungs (doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03569-1) to identify whether there are similar cellular/genetic/molecular changes. This will greatly strengthen the implications of this animal study's findings and help mitigate the weaknesses associated with the model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their excellent suggestion to compare the dataset from the DT mouse model with other recently published datasets. The Reviewer specifically suggested that we compare our dataset with a recently published human study in COVID ARDS. However, EC populations were grossly underrepresented in this dataset which would make identification of our transient EC populations challenging. Moreover, this transcriptomic data was only obtained from autopsy material and thus represents only the very late stages of disease. Therefore, we choose to use a dataset from a recently published model of LPS induced ALI (DOI: 10.1172/jci.insight.158079) to assess the relevance our model to commonly used preclinical models of ALI. In this report, the authors explored transcriptional changes in EC populations at multiple time points after LPS-induced lung injury and during repair, but separate analyses were performed at each timepoint. Instead, we analyzed this dataset in aggregate over time in the similar way that we analyzed our dataset in order to make a direct comparison. Although the time course was slightly different, we could identify very similar transient gCap EC populations occurring in the same sequence as in our dataset. Specifically, we observed a population of Cd93+ gCap ECs expressing both Apln and Procr, appearing as early as 6h post LPS, followed by a cluster of FoxM1+, proliferating ECs appearing at 3 days (Figure 6, Figure supplement 3). The earlier appearance of the regenerative EC populations in this model may relate to a more rapid action of LPS compared with DT-induced injury. Nonetheless, there was a very similar temporal sequence from Apln/Procr positive, gCap ECs transitioning to highly proliferative FoxM1-positive progenitors which strongly supports the relevance of our findings more broadly in other ALI models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could the authors obtain access to lung tissue from ALI/ARDS patients (+/- COVID) and stain for aCap/gCap and apelin molecules? It would be interesting to see whether these cell types exhibit patterns similar to animal ones.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting to try to identify similar regenerative EC populations in sections of human lung from ARDS patients. Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to suitable human specimens for this purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The scRNA-seq dataset is incredibly rich and will be a major resource for the community. While the focus is understandably on ECs, I think attention should be given to cell-cell interactions across the lung. Could the authors carry out ligand-receptor analysis to further emphasize how other cell types react to the injury? Please see doi.org/10.1038/s41576-020-00292-x for details regarding the methodology that can be used to carry out this analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment and for the reference. As described in our response to Reviewer 1, we have performed a higher resolution analysis of the non-EC populations and have identified a number of interesting cell populations that have clear transcriptomic changes during injury-repair (New Figure 3). As requested, we have performed a ligand-receptor analysis using NicheNet focusing on endothelial receiver populations during the critical period for endothelial regeneration and these results are presented in the new Figure 9. At Day 3, only the transitional ECs of Cluster 1 (Zone 2) met the criteria for an endothelial ‘receiver’ population (i.e., &gt;50 DEGs vs. Day 0) (Figure 9A and B) largely representing apelin/Procr co-expressing gCap ECs. The top 10 ligands originated from 21 individual clusters representing all major cell populations (stromal, myeloid, lymphoid, epithelial and endothelial). Interestingly, the top four predicted ligands based of Pearson correlation coefficients, Occludin (Ocln), FAT Atypical Cadherin 1 (Fat1), Plexin B2 (Plxnb2) and Ephrin B1 (Efnb1), mediate signaling by direct cell-cell contact and play major roles in developmental biology, including regulation of proliferation, migration and differentiation. Ocln and Efnb1 were associated with interactions between other EC subtypes, whereas Plxnb2 was exclusively involved in cell-cell signaling between ECs and non-EC clusters including pericytes, monocyte/macrophages and epithelial cells. In contrast, Fat1 was restricted to interactions between EC and pericytes and smooth muscle cells. At Day 5, there was a substantially greater diversity in cell-cell interactions, with five endothelial receiver populations responding to ligands from 31 cell clusters representing all cell populations (Figure 9C and D). Again, transitional gCap ECs (Cluster 1, Zone 3) exhibited the strongest predictions for the top ligands which, with the exception of Fat1, remained the same as for Day 3. The other endothelial receiver clusters showed considerable differences in their top ranked ligands, likely reflecting the distinct pathways involved in the differentiation of Cluster 1 ECs into these specialized subpopulations during the microvascular repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors propose apelin-apelin-receptor signaling between &quot;stem-like cells&quot; (Cluster 1, zone 2) and &quot;progenitor-like cells&quot; (cluster 1, zone 3, and cluster 7) as a driver of endothelial regeneration, yet these cells seem to exist at different time points (in fact, the authors propose that the latter emerge from the former). So, how can cell A signal to cell B if at the same time cell A already transitions into cell B by way of this signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>The temporal dissociation of expression of apelin and its receptor is in large part artifactual due to the fact that we only measured expression at discreet timepoints that were 2 days apart. While a small number of cells can still be seen expressing apelin at day 5, it is very likely that the overlap in expression of apelin and its receptor was more substantial in between these timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For cluster 1, I am surprised that the authors did not use RNA velocity analyses to validate the time-dependent transition of cells across the different zones in this cluster. Such analyses would clearly strengthen the conclusion that this is a single cell type that is undergoing different cell states during this process.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the Reviewer’s suggestions, we have used the Python package scVelo to evaluate the RNA velocity and trajectory analysis within our EC clusters. This dynamical model showed a progressive shift of EC populations within transitional cluster 1 through zones 2 and 3 with strong vectors towards depleted populations (new Figure 5), including gCap ECs of Cluster 0, and arterial and venous EC populations. Notably, zone 2 cells uniquely exhibited evidence of DNA synthesis based on the S score, whereas cells in zone 3, and the proliferative cluster 7, showed increased G2M score, indicative of proliferation (panel B). We also identified the top 15 driver genes involved in specific transitions (panel C), with 8 genes implicated in the transition from cluster 1 to cluster 0, 5 genes involved in transition from Cluster 1 to aCap ECs (Cluster 2) and 2 genes for Cluster 1 to venous ECs. Finally, an inferred latent time plot of the 300 top driver genes replicated the same temporal progression of dynamic gene expression that was seen by serial transcriptomic analysis beginning with Cluster 1 and progressing through to Cluster 0 and finally Cluster 2 at the end of the pseudotime cascade (Panel D). Therefore, despite the fact that this velocity analysis only infers a timeline based on transcriptional cues (i.e., proportion of spliced to unspliced RNA), and is agnostic to the actual timing of the cell harvesting in the serial transcriptomic dataset, it approximates remarkably well the temporal shifts in EC populations that were demonstrated by serial scRNA-seq at defined timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. What is the signal that activates these &quot;stem-like cells&quot; and makes them transition from basal gCap into cluster 1, zone 2 cells? Is it the apoptosis of adjacent endothelial cells, or the concomitant inflammation? While it may be difficult to answer this question, some discussion may be warranted as identification of such a signal would allow replicating – e.g., for in-depth studies but also for therapeutic purposes as suggested by the authors – this transition in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question; however, as recognized by the Reviewer, it will not be easy address. It is unlikely that simply overexpressing apelin, Procr or both in cultured ECs will be sufficient to induce a stem-like phenotype. Indeed, Procr/EPCR overexpression in hematopoietic stem cells failed to replicate the higher proliferation and engraftment potential of HSCs that spontaneously express EPCR (DOI 10.1182/blood-2016-11-750729). We are in the process of optimizing the isolation and culture of these cells by EC selection based on EPCR expression, which will allow a comprehensive exploration of the cues leading to the generation of these cells after endothelial injury in vitro using transcriptomic, proteomic and high-throughput technologies. While this is a logical follow-on based on our novel findings, we would respectfully suggest that it represents new work beyond the scope of present manuscript. However, as the Reviewer suggests, we have revised the discussion to highlight how this question might be addressed in these future studies (Page 17, lines 510-522).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The mortality data comparing young vs. old mice and the effects of the apelin receptor antibody are interesting, but more insight at the cellular level would help to further validate (or refute) the proposed concept. Specifically, one may ask whether age or apelin receptor inhibition can prevent the formation of Cluster 1 zone 3 cells at Day 5 post-DT? I realize that, unfortunately, such an experiment is prevented by the fact that most of these mice die on day 4, and the residual mice may present a survival bias. But how do the authors reconcile the fact that these mice die at D4, while the actual apelin-receptor positive population (cluster 1 zone 3) which supposedly is targeted by the apelin receptor antibody only emerges on D5?</p></disp-quote><p>Again, as stated in our response to Comment 1, the relative lack of overlap in cells expressing the ligand and receptor is likely related to the fact we performed scRNA-seq only at 3 and 5 days. In fact, even at 5 days there are some cells that continue to express apelin. No doubt there would be a much greater overlap in cells expressing apelin or its receptor at 4 days.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 1C, it would be helpful to show that the apoptotic cells are indeed endothelial cells by counterstaining with CD144, CD31, etc. rather than DAPI alone.</p></disp-quote><p>We did try to show the apoptotic cells were endothelial cells using CD144 as a counterstain but, due to significant differences in the antigen retrieval requirements for the optimized antibodies, we found these antibodies were incompatible. However, we provide the Reviewer with a two-gene UMAP of the EC subset showing the co-expression of caspase 3 and cadherin 5 expression in the lung ECs, which clearly shows co-expression, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80900-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In their section on Speculations and Ideas, the authors propose isolating stem-like and progenitor-type gCap cells at different time points after DT treatment. Indeed, such isolation would go a long way to validate the proposed non-proliferative nature of the former vs. the high-proliferative nature of the letter by actual functional assays rather than transcriptomic profiles alone. This opportunity should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the Reviewer, we now discuss the opportunity of isolation of stem-like gCap ECs to better characterize their regenerative potential and identify the cues that result in their development, which will be necessary to translate this work into potential therapeutic application (page 17, lines 510-522).</p></body></sub-article></article>
