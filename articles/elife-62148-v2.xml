Synergistic and antagonistic interactions between stimuli play major roles in shaping immune processes. To understand combinatorial regulation, we present the immune Synergistic/Antagonistic Interaction Learner (iSAIL). iSAIL includes a machine learning classifier to map and interpret interactions, a curated compendium of immunological combination treatment datasets, and their global integration into a landscape of ~30,000 interactions. The landscape is mined to reveal combinatorial control of interleukins, checkpoints, and other immune modulators. The resource helps elucidate the modulation of a stimulus by interactions with other cofactors, showing that TNF has strikingly different effects depending on co-stimulators.

Studies of immune regulation have largely focused on individual stimuli, elucidating transcriptional and functional programs induced by major immune modulators such as TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Locksley et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kalliolias and Ivashkiv, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bouwmeester et al., 2004</xref>), interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pestka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schneider et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">González-Navajas et al., 2012</xref>), and Toll-like Receptor (TLR) ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kawasaki and Kawai, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vidya et al., 2018</xref>). However, immunological responses are constantly shaped by the combined action of multiple stimuli. As a fundamental example, T helper (Th) cell activation requires a combination of antigen presentation and costimulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Smith-Garvin et al., 2009</xref>). Due to combinatorial effects, the study of individual stimuli alone may provide a misleading oversimplification of their role in complex microenvironments. Developing a systematic understanding of how combinations of stimuli control the immune system is an unmet challenge, with broad biological and therapeutic implications.</p><p>What makes studying immunology from a combinatorial perspective essential is that nonlinear interactions often make the effects of combined stimuli dramatically different from merely additive effects seen with each stimulus alone. Immunological studies have discovered that interaction effects play major roles in shaping immune system processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Noubade et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Min et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tuvim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Walasek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hartmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Teles et al., 2013</xref>). However, the complexity of these effects and the lack of resolution of current combinatorial experiment analysis methods are a barrier to understanding how interactions regulate immunological functions. The standard approach to this problem is to identify genes showing positive (synergistic) or negative (antagonistic) deviations in the combined treatment condition from the sum of individual effects. This restricted binary classification has critical limitations. First, it does not distinguish between biologically relevant and artifactual interactions that depend on the specific assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cappuccio et al., 2015</xref>). Second, it does not allow for meaningful aggregation of interactions to delineate coherent functional programs. Finally, this standard approach does not support integration and shared interpretation of interactions from multiple combination treatments. These limitations obscure general properties and functions of interactions between immunological stimuli.</p><p>To overcome this barrier, we develop a framework based on combinatorial analysis and machine learning. Using combinatorial analysis, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of all interaction patterns that can occur in a combination treatment experiment. Next, we train a machine learning classifier able to robustly map noisy <italic>-omics</italic> data across the pre-defined taxonomy. As we demonstrate, this framework now resolves the most informative synergistic and antagonistic effects. Annotation of genes assigned to each discrete regulatory pattern identifies the regulated immunological functions. In addition, assignment of responses from multiple combinatorial datasets to a standardized taxonomy enables global integration to systematically elucidate the interactions that shape immune functions.</p><p>The resulting immune Synergistic and Antagonistic Interaction Learner (iSAIL) resource includes the machine learning classifier, a curated compendium of immunological combination treatment datasets and a global dataset integration to produce a landscape of ~30,000 interactions from diverse immune cell types and combinations of stimuli. We show how the landscape can be mined to reveal new insight into the prevalence of different types of interactions, and into their immunological functions. Further, we show that the resource facilitates the discovery of new combinatorial regulatory processes. iSAIL analysis of data on TNF and IFNβ co-treatment led us to discover new synergistic mechanisms implicated in dendritic cell-T cell crosstalk.</p><p>iSAIL is available as a user-friendly web-accessible resource to help elucidate the combinatorial complexity of immunity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Background and motivation</title><p>The prototypical combination treatment experiment comprises <italic>-omics</italic> data obtained from the following conditions: a vehicle control (denoted by 0), two individual stimuli (X, Y), and their combination (X+Y), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left subpanel. The goal of this experiment is to discover cellular processes regulated by positive (synergistic) and negative (antagonistic) interactions. This requires a fine-grained analysis able to distinguish between biologically relevant and artifactual interactions, and able to aggregate similar interactions to delineate coherent functional programs. The standard approach, which classifies interactions as positive or negative, does not do this adequately, leading to a loss of important biological information. For example, biologically meaningful positive interactions such as emergent responses (e.g. an increase or decrease with the combination in the absence of any effect in the individual treatment conditions), would not be distinguished from nominal interactions with low biological significance related to saturation effects. Furthermore, the aggregation of all the positive (or negative) interactions obscures the inference of coherent biological processes as typically obtained through pathway enrichment analysis, because this crude aggregation confounds very diverse interaction effects.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive approach to map interaction effects within and among <italic>-omics</italic> datasets from combination treatment experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We developed iSAIL (immune Synergistic/Antagonistic Interaction Learner), a machine learning framework to decipher the effect of combination treatments. iSAIL accommodates -<italic>omics</italic> datasets from the four prototypical conditions of combination treatments: 0 (control), stimulus X, stimulus Y, and the combination X+Y (left subpanel).

The framework increases the resolution of a standard approach by using an abstract, pre-defined taxonomy of 123 distinguishable response profiles that can theoretically occur in a combination treatment experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These profiles represent qualitatively different scenarios for the expression of a gene in a combination treatment experiment. To analyze data on combination treatment, iSAIL applies a machine learning classifier trained to robustly classify the experimental gene response across the taxonomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle subpanel). Interaction classification makes it possible to resolve the most meaningful interactions (e.g. emergent responses), while automatically excluding from downstream analysis all the nominal interactions (e.g. saturation effects) that carry minimal biological information. Importantly, genes classified in the same interaction profile are likely to share a coherent functional program. These coherent gene groups are then interrogated for mechanistic insight via pathway enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right subpanel). By breaking down the combinatorial effects into these functional units, we greatly improve the functional interpretation of biological processes regulated by interactions.</p><p>A key problem we address is to robustly classify gene response from noisy <italic>-omics</italic> data across. To solve this problem, the classifier generates a probabilistic assignment of the response for each gene to the taxonomy-defined profiles. This solution is more robust to noise than the deterministic matching previously used for related problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cappuccio et al., 2015</xref>). We systematically validate our approach by evaluating the classification performance on simulated data. Furthermore, in order to select the optimal framework, we investigate multiple machine learning models and compare their probabilistic output using the synthetic data under different noise regimes. These analyses identify Random Forest as a robust method with high predictive accuracy across all noise regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A resource to analyze user-generated or public immunological combination treatment datasets</title><p>The taxonomy of interaction profiles used by the learning framework provides a standardized abstract space, independent of any specific dataset, where interactions from multiple datasets can be mapped and integrated for global analysis.

We find that the most frequent interactions likely represent range limitations of the assay or biological responses, which we refer to as floor and ceiling effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, top subpanel). These effects provide limited biological information in the absence of dose-response curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chou, 2006</xref>), unavailable in our context. Our approach segregates floor and ceiling effects from less frequent but more biologically relevant interactions, including suppression (9%), inhibition (8%), restoration (4%), emergence (4%), and potentiation (3%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle subpanel). Our analysis also reveals that several theoretically possible combinatorial effects were nearly absent (&lt;0.04%). These rare profiles include reversals, where two signals with the same individual effect (e.g. upregulation of a gene separately by X and Y) are reversed by the combination (e.g. downregulation of the same gene by X+Y) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, bottom subpanel).</p><p>To explore the immunological functions regulated by interactions, we visualize the landscape using an interactive 3D representation. The three axes represent datasets, genes, and scores quantifying the intensity and robustness of the identified interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Each axis is then annotated with additional information. The dataset axis is annotated with metadata on the experiments including species, cell type, stimuli, and time point. The gene axis is annotated with immunological gene families such as chemokines, interleukins, checkpoints and other terms from the ImmPort database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhattacharya et al., 2014</xref>). The interaction axis is annotated by the taxonomy profiles assigned to each interaction by the machine learning classifier. Slicing the landscape along specific dimensions provides different types of insight into immunological interactions.</p><p>For example, slicing by gene family allows systematic identification of positive and negative interactions involving immune modulators of interest. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> shows a 2D projection of the landscape involving stimulatory and inhibitory checkpoints for a selection of datasets including macrophage, moDC, pDC, and T cells.

The profiles of these synergies contain two cases of potentiation from different experimental models, one involving pDC stimulated with IL3 and influenza virus (Flu), and the other involving moDC stimulated with TNF and IFNβ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Because <italic>IDO1</italic> inhibits T cell division and promotes regulatory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van Baren and Van den Eynde, 2015</xref>), these positive interactions may serve to restrict overreacting immune responses in the inflammatory microenvironment.</p><p>Our results show that mining the interaction landscape can reveal new insight on combinatorial interactions and their immunological functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Interactions determine a context-dependent TNF biology</title><p>To further illustrate how the interaction landscape can be analyzed, we study how TNF biology can be altered by the presence of cofactors. To this end, we sliced the combinatorial landscape along two axes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top-left). From the dataset axis, we selected combination treatments involving TNF with other stimuli, including IFNγ and IFNβ in four human cell models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, left-margin).

Further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, top-right, Materials and methods) also suggested that co-modulators can drive the emergence of new functions, not observed by TNF stimulation in isolation.

Although TNF and IFNβ are key modulators of immune function whose individual effects have been extensively studied, their interactions remain poorly understood. We previously reported that TNF and IFNβ act synergistically to induce an antiviral state in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hartmann et al., 2014</xref>). To study the systems level impact of TNF and IFNβ co-treatment on human moDC, we applied iSAIL to this transcriptomic combination treatment experiment.</p><p>iSAIL detected 374 positive interactions, which we mapped to the corresponding profile groups. The interaction groups with the largest number of positive interactions were ‘emergent synergy’, ‘TNF potentiates IFNβ’, ‘IFNβ restores TNF’, and ‘IFNβ potentiates TNF’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To understand the function of these interaction profiles, we sorted the corresponding gene lists based on the synergy score and searched for candidates with potential key immunological roles.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Prediction and validation of IFNβ and TNF synergistic effects in monocyte-derived dendritic cells .</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We applied iSAIL to analyze the synergistic effects induced by IFNβ (3000 pg/mL) and TNF (4500 pg/mL) on monocyte-derived dendritic cells after 1 hr of exposure. We focused on the four profile groups with the largest number of synergies. In the group of emergent synergies, we found <italic>VCAM1</italic>, a gene involved in the regulation of cell adhesion. (<bold>B</bold>) We tested the hypothesis that the emergent induction of <italic>VCAM1</italic> in the DC would mediate an increase in DC-T cell interaction. Assayed by imaging flow cytometry, moDCs exposed to IFNβ+TNF showed an emergent increase in DC-T cell adhesion. VCAM-1 neutralization abolished this synergistic effect. The right subpanel shows the mean synergy score of the three replicates, plus or minus the standard error of the mean. VCAM-1 neutralization significantly reduced the synergy score (t-test, p=0.03). (<bold>C</bold>) To explore whether TNF+IFNβ synergy profiles represented coherent gene programs, we determined the functional enrichment for each of the four patterns, shown in the columns. (<bold>C</bold>, left panel). We compared these iSAIL-based functional analyses to results obtained with a conventional analysis of unclassified synergy genes. (<bold>C</bold>, right panel). iSAIL-based enrichment provided a richer functional annotation. In particular, it suggested that synergy genes in the ‘IFNβ potentiates TNF’ pattern rightmost panel in (<bold>A</bold>) may mediate T cell proliferation. (<bold>D</bold>) This hypothesis was tested using allogeneic cross donor stimulation. The synergy group ‘IFNβ potentiates TNF’ contained two hits potentially responsible for T cell proliferation: <italic>TNFSF9</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic>. Using CCL-5 neutralizing antibodies, we confirmed that IFNβ and TNF act in synergy to promote T cell proliferation, and that this proliferation depends on CCL-5. The right subpanel shows the mean synergy score of the three replicates, plus or minus the standard error of the mean. CCL-5 neutralization significantly reduced the synergy score (t-test, p=0.008).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62148-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Focusing on emergent synergies, we found the largest synergy scores for <italic>LIMK2</italic>, <italic>MCOLN2</italic>, <italic>SLC7A5</italic>, <italic>TP53BP2</italic>, and several genes having more established immunological roles such as <italic>RELB</italic>, <italic>IL15RA</italic>, and <italic>VCAM1</italic>. The protein VCAM-1 has been described as a regulator of leukocyte migration and cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deem et al., 2007</xref>). Due to the fundamental importance of the DC-T cell axis in the generation of an immune response, we hypothesized that TNF and IFNβ synergistically induce VCAM-1 to promote moDC-T cell adhesion. We experimentally tested this hypothesis by quantifying DC-T cell adhesion using imaging flow cytometry (see Materials and methods). When exposed to the combination of TNF and IFNβ, moDC showed an increased adhesion to T cells that was not observed with either cytokine alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The increased DC-T cell adhesion was mediated by VCAM-1, since VCAM-1 neutralization abolished the synergistic effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To our knowledge, these results identify for the first time a role for synergistic induction of VCAM-1 by TNF and IFNβ in promoting DC-T cell adhesion.</p><p>To further explore the immune processes controlled by TNF and IFNβ synergies, we performed enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, left) separately for the different profiles, and compared the results with a conventional analysis that aggregates all the synergies in a single gene set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, right). Annotation by profile increased the number and significance of annotation terms compared to the conventional analysis. Interestingly, we found a reciprocal potentiation of TNF and IFNβ signaling pathways by the combination treatment. Both iSAIL and conventional analysis captured a highly significant enrichment in mineral absorption. However, iSAIL analysis also revealed the pattern ‘IFNβ restores TNF’ as the main contributor to this enrichment. This pattern contains several members of the family of metallothioneins (<italic>MT1X</italic>, <italic>MT1E</italic>, <italic>MT1F</italic>, <italic>MT1HL1</italic>), which are increasingly recognized as important players in the response to cytokines and pathogen signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Subramanian Vignesh and Deepe Jr., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Some annotation terms appeared only in the iSAIL analysis and were not resolved by conventional analysis. In particular, we found the pattern ‘TNF potentiates IFNβ’ enriched in NK cell proliferation, and the pattern ‘IFNβ potentiates TNF’ enriched in T cell proliferation. We studied allogeneic cross-donor stimulation to test the hypothesis suggested by this analysis that a synergistic effect on T cell proliferation resulted from IFNβ and TNF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left panel). We observed a nearly twofold increase in the percent of proliferating T cells upon the combination treatment, an effect not seen with either stimulus alone. The synergy pattern of the T cell proliferation measurement diverged slightly from the gene level profile, which showed some effect by TNF alone. It is not surprising that the interactions profiles comparing mRNA level regulation and protein-dependent functional effects show marginal differences. Importantly, the synergistic induction of T cell proliferation, predicted by iSAIL, was validated experimentally.</p><p>Next, we wanted to identify the molecular mediators of the increased T cell proliferation. Candidate genes for mediating this synergistic response predicted by enrichment analysis included <italic>TNSFS9</italic> and <italic>CCL5</italic>. Review of the literature suggested CCL-5 as the most likely candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Makino et al., 2002</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that CCL-5 may contribute to increased proliferation of T cells induced by TNF and INFβ exposed DC. This hypothesis was confirmed by immunoneutralization of CCL-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right panel). These validation experiments demonstrate the value of iSAIL in mining interaction data for new hypotheses leading to biological and mechanistic insight.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we present a comprehensive resource to map and interpret interaction effects from individual and multiple combination treatment studies. Applying our machine learning classification method to the compendium of immunological combination treatment datasets, we identify ~30,000 interactions. We show that the collection of interactions visualized as a landscape can be mined for general insight into the microenvironment-dependent role of key immunomodulators, for specific testable hypotheses about combinatorial control of immune processes.</p><p>A potential consequence of interactions is the radical modification of effects observed with individual treatments. Using the iSAIL framework, these events are easily identified by isolating interaction profiles that encode qualitative combination changes in the effect of a treatment of interest. In the case of TNF, we found that co-modulators alter fundamental immunological processes, such as antigen presentation and T helper cell polarization, and may produce the emergence of entirely new functions, not modulated by TNF exposure alone. Identifying the context-dependent effects of an agent may be useful from a therapeutic perspective. Our approach may assist in the design of drug combinations that leverage antagonistic interactions to selectively reduce pathogenic activity while preserving necessary homeostatic effects.</p><p>A fundamental tool for biological interpretation of <italic>-omics</italic> experiments is pathway-level enrichment analysis. iSAIL uncovers biological processes regulated in combination treatment studies by fine-grained aggregation of genes showing similar interaction responses. These aggregates can reflect coherent biological processes, providing insight into the principles and functions of interactions. In the analysis of TNF and IFNβ co-treatment, iSAIL uncovered novel synergies that control the DC-T cell interactions and T cell proliferation, both of which are critical immune processes. Importantly, iSAIL analysis generated hypotheses on the molecular mediators controlling these functions, VCAM-1 and CCL-5, which were validated by additional experiments. The ability to identify new interactions and mechanisms in a relatively well characterized combination such as TNF and IFNβ points to an even greater potential for discovery in less characterized combinations.</p><p>In its current version, iSAIL was developed to analyze transcriptomics experiments. Consistent with this, the classifier was trained under the assumption of normally distributed data, which is commonly held in the analysis of microarray and RNA-seq data (upon a suitable transformation). However, under alternative distributional assumptions, our framework can be adapted to any <italic>-omics</italic> data from combination treatment experiments, including proteomics, metabolomics, and epigenomics.</p><p>Understanding the dynamic properties of combinatorial interactions is a very relevant, yet largely unexplored area. Included in our compendium are time-course datasets with only two time points. Due to such poor temporal sampling, these studies were analyzed as separate experiments. Although the dynamics of combinatorial responses is not addressed in our work, the iSAIL framework would still provide a fundamental grammar to map gene trajectories from longer time series. Time-dependent interrelationships could be included in our analysis, for example, by imposing additional constraints that guarantee smooth transitions between interaction profiles at successive time points. Our analysis framework, applied to a large compendium of time course experiments, should they become available, will enable the identification of preferential trajectories and dynamic rules governing time transitions between interaction profiles.</p><p>Despite the centrality of combinatorial interactions to the control of the immune system, many important questions remain open. In particular, the ability to predict combinatorial interaction effects based on the individual effects remains elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Preuer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ryall and Tan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Menden et al., 2019</xref>). Although predicting interactions is unrelated to the objectives of our study, iSAIL may still support research in this direction. For example, our global estimates of the frequency of different interactions may be used as prior information to enhance the predictive power of future models.</p><p>Finally, insight into combination treatment experiments is relevant to the field of drug therapeutics, as thousands of clinical trials in the United States alone are studying the effects of drug combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nature Medicine, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Drug interactions can drive both clinical therapeutic efficacy and treatment side effects. The success of drug combinations relies on the control of pathogenic pathways while preserving the homeostatic pathways. By uncovering relevant interactions and their functions, iSAIL user-friendly online tools can further the understanding and therapeutic applications of interaction mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Definition and simulation of interaction profiles</title><p>The notion of interaction profile was introduced in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cappuccio et al., 2015</xref>) and is briefly summarized here. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the taxonomy of 123 profiles used in this study.

The relevant datasets were identified using key terms typically associated with combination treatments such as 'synergy', 'antagonism', 'combinatorial', and similar. This approach was designed to facilitate automatic update of the resource as new <italic>-omics</italic> data from combination treatment experiments become publicly available. To facilitate comparisons, all the datasets were imported in the format of the original publications. The datasets were preprocessed as follows. First, if different probes were available for the same gene, the probe with the largest coefficient of variation was selected. Second, genes with low coefficient of variation (lower than the median across all genes) were filtered out. Next, differentially expressed genes were determined with the Limma package. A significance cutoff of 0.05 was applied on the p-values corrected for multiple testing. An additional cutoff was imposed on the δ (defined above): genes with δ lower than the median value computed across all differentially expressed genes were filtered out. The resulting differentially expressed genes were then analyzed by the machine learning classifier which assigned to each gene the predicted element of the taxonomy. For each identified interaction, a score was defined to measure its magnitude as well as its significance. The magnitude of the interaction <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf26"><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> was measured as the average Bliss index, defined as the average deviation from additivity <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo accent="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<italic>i = X, Y, X+Y</italic>), <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf29"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for positive interactions and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf30"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for negative interactions.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Deciphering the combinatorial landscape of immunity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The paper describes an method to study interactions in a large immunological molecular system of ~30,000 interactions: The main hypothesis derived from the system is related with the immunological effects of TNFα on IFNβ.</p><p>There are a number of problems with the current submission. First, the proposed method has not been systematically validated beyond the arguments in this paper. The example chosen corresponds to a well-known system, e.g. TNF cytokines synergies, for which it is unclear how much the paper adds. In any case, to have a significant impact in biology a more challenging hypothesis , going beyond the already-known synergies of TNF, should be proposed and ideally, it would be followed by additional experiments. Only then the potential of the system will be demonstrated as actually able to uncover new biology.</p><p>While based on this criticism the paper will not be acceptable for publication, it might be considered if organized as a resource paper (A Tools and Resources article allows authors to publish the details of new experimental techniques, datasets, software tools, and other resources). It will be also possible to consider a future version of this work including a complementary validation of the method and experimental follow-up of the proposed models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have developed an interesting resource with 30k interactions extracted from public immunological datasets (25 human and 7 murine combination treatment studies).</p><p>On this data set they apply a aggrupation and training strategy (random forest algorithm operating on what are called &quot;logic principles&quot; of the interactions) to differentiate single responses from combine ones (synergies) in a set of interleukins, checkpoints, and other immune modulators. The system works at a semi-qualitative level that takes into account the fluctuations and variability of the data, and provides an interpretation at the level of general functional classes (enrichment analysis).</p><p>The potentially more interesting innovation of the model is the systematic introduction of error levels. The most valuable asset is the collection of interactions from public data. The proposed machine learning technology, the biological analysis and the grouping of genes is also rather standard and simple. The visualization is nice and help to understand the results.</p><p>The key problem is that the method is not validated in any systematic way. The proposed experimental follow-up might be interesting from a biological point of view but cannot be considered systematic validation. It might be a nice tool for exploration but the information presented is not enough to consider it as a prediction system.</p><p>Other points are related with the way the methodology is presented, that is rather obscure when in practice it is very simple, i.e. functional inference is enrichment analysis, machine learning interaction classification is a random forest classifier, omic analysis is expression data, etc. While the main idea of combining and averaging results is not explained clearly.</p><p>My opinion is that this paper could be considered for publication if it can be presented as a resource for the exploration of immunological interactions based on the collected data, gene aggregation strategy and visualisation system. In this case, it would have to be written in a different way, clearly oriented to use of the system and providing the biological results as examples of use.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this article, Cappuccio et al. introduce a computational method to better assess the impact of combinations of drug and ligands onto immune cell activation. This is a problem of fundamental significance, both from the theoretical side (how to tackle the combinatorial complexity of immunological interactions?) and from the practical side (how to leverage this combinatorial complexity to maximize clinical perturbation?). There exist many experimental datasets that have attempted at reporting the transcriptional responses of cells under single and dual perturbations, yet, there does not exist a systematic framework to integrate, classify and leverage these datasets. This publication introduces a Synergistic/Antagonistic Interaction Learner (iSAIL) to tackle this issue and to publicize the method.</p><p>One of the key premises of this computational framework is that individual measurement can lead to inaccurate classification of molecular perturbations, because of limited signal/noise and/or saturation. However, when leveraging the large number of datasets already available, one can improve on this computational task and get a more accurate classification. Hence, the key novelty in this manuscript is presented in Figure 2 and 3 where the statistical framework is introduced. Again, the sobering experimental fact is that individual experiments (e.g. dataset acquired for a given cell type and/or a limited set of perturbation) can be misleading classifying how two molecular perturbations can combine. The computational framework proposed here use random-forest classification to sort out this experimental noise and reveal new properties.</p><p>Figure 4 and 5 present one example related to responses to IFN-b and TNF to highlight an emergent function of these cytokines as highly synergistic depending on the molecular/cellular context. One could question whether this method scales up to higher level of combinations of perturbations: given the exponential explosion when combining N drugs, how do the computational framework introduced here help in designing higher order of immunological perturbation?</p><p>Overall, this is a serious/robust study addressing an important issue in pharmacology and immunology. Additional details about the method would help the reader better grasp the novelty of the computational method but release of the iSAIL method on a website is making this criticism less stringent: experimentalists will be able to test the method directly and assess its usefulness. More specific comments/suggestions are listed below.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Results first paragraph: What is defined here as synergy and antagonism is not congruent with the classical definitions of these terms. One example of this is profile 4 in Figure 1—figure supplement 1, which shows that individual treatments inhibit expression of a particular gene, and that the combination of treatments enhances that inhibition. Classically, this would be considered synergism in the ability of inhibiting expression of that gene, but in your classification this is considered as antagonism, because the final expression levels are lower than the expected by additivity. In your previous paper (Cappuccio et al., 2015), your classification was in agreement with previous definitions, and this interaction was classified as &quot;negative synergy&quot;. Unless you provide support and clear explanation for changing this nomenclature, I would recommend going back to the nomenclature used in Cappuccio et al., 2015, namely calling them &quot;positive and negative interactions&quot;, rather than &quot;synergistic and antagonistic interactions&quot;. Additionally, for cases were the combination interactions were not as dramatic as the few examples showed in the figures, or for profiles called &quot;ceiling&quot; or &quot;floor&quot;, it is not possible to determine synergism or antagonism in the absence of dose-response curves obtained by -omics experiments (Chou et al., 2006). The absence of dose-response information would also be problematic for genes which regulation is not monotonic as a function of dose (Senthivel et al., 2016).</p><p>Referring to &quot;emergent responses (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , profile 3)&quot;, make effect bigger in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 so it is clearer to see the differences between profile 3 and 7.</p><p>Referring to &quot;would be aggregated with nominal synergistic effects due to frequent cellular or assay saturation, which have low biological significance (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , profile 7)”. Please explain better the text before the comma. I think in profile 7 you are referring to the &quot;floor&quot; profile, where background in the assay or basal levels of gene expression makes it look like synergistic, and in your current explanation you are referring to the &quot;ceiling&quot; profile, where saturation is the problem. You can write something similar as it appeared later in the paper regarding these interactions that are likely not meaningful: &quot;represent range limitations of the assay or biological responses&quot;</p><p>Multiple instances:</p><p>Please replace TNF-α with simply TNF.

The basic approach dates back to the work of Janes et al. (Science 2005), which, incidentally, is not cited. My main concern centers on the need for a relatively large amount of data combined with synthetic data in order to obtain insights focused on well-studied interactions of TNF with other cytokines. Furthermore, I am unclear as to the true universal applicability of this approach, for the following reasons:</p><p>1) The authors mention that the datasets used involved multiple time points, but it is unclear how dynamics are being handled and modeled across these datasets. One would fully expect that in any extensive time course study of two stimuli, multiple outcomes (e.g. potentiation followed by tolerance or stimulation followed by suppression) would be observed. How can the algorithm then decompose such phenomena into a single characteristic response (i.e., does the algorithm treat each time point as a separate experiment, thereby losing true time-dependent interrelationships?)</p><p>2) The system chosen for validation, namely TNF + IFN-β, does not seem particularly novel. It has been appreciated for decades that TNF synergizes with other cytokines to produce an array of effects, including potentiation and tolerance as examples of preconditioning. A demonstration of a truly unexpected set of interactions between stimuli would have been more convincing.</p><p>3) The additional validation studies focused on VCAM1 also seem to be focused on relatively well-studied phenomena. Multiple other gene transcripts that appear more novel are not followed up.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62148.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

One is classifying and interpreting the presence of interactions. The second is predicting the occurrence of interactions from single treatment data. From this reviewer’s critique, we suspect that these two different goals (classifying and interpreting vs predicting interactions) have not been clearly distinguished in introducing the problem setting, and this may have caused a lack of clarity regarding the main contributions of our work. In this context, we clarify both the objective and validation of our framework below.</p><p>Objective of the method: Our method is not a “prediction system” i.e. our objective is not to predict, denovo, the occurrence of interactions from individual responses. The goal of our method is to identify, using a statistically rigorous approach, to classify and to interpret interactions. Rigorous identification of interaction effects is not a trivial matter. When placed in context, the value of this advance, which is recognized by this reviewer, becomes evident, the rigorous interaction identification component of our work is equivalent to how the study of individual gene fold-changes in transcriptomics datasets only advanced after the systematic introduction of error levels.</p><p>Systematic Validation: Consistent with our main objectives of detecting and interpreting interactions, we provide validation of our framework at two levels: (1) by testing the performance of our method on simulated data, where the classification of interactions can be assessed in the presence of the ground truth, and (2) through validation experiments confirming the correct biological interpretation of new synergies between TNF and IFNb.</p><p>Finally, while we do not aim to directly predict interactions, we show that our framework does provide new insight on general rules that govern combinatorial interactions. As we state in the discussion, these general rules can be used in future work aiming to predict interactions, but this possibility is tangential to the main research objective of the present manuscript. We acknowledge that our results on the probabilistic algebra may have generated confusion, as that section is thematically close to predictive modelling. Thus, in this revised, resource-oriented version, we have removed this section from the Results.</p><p>To clarify these points, we have extensively revised the Introduction and the Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points are related with the way the methodology is presented, that is rather obscure when in practice it is very simple, i.e. functional inference is enrichment analysis, machine learning interaction classification is a random forest classifier, omic analysis is expression data, etc. While the main idea of combining and averaging results is not explained clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions and have revised the manuscript to streamline the description of the method and improve the presentation of aggregating gene responses for more fine-grained enrichment analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My opinion is that this paper could be considered for publication if it can be presented as a resource for the exploration of immunological interactions based on the collected data, gene aggregation strategy and visualisation system.

The reviewer notes both the key methodological novelty of our framework, as well as the extensive validation studies.</p><p>Regarding scaling up iSAIL to combinations of more than two stimuli, we would like to emphasize the fact that our approach is not intrinsically limited to pairwise combinations. In principle, the main steps of our framework (e.g., combinatorial analysis, generation of simulated data, and training of a classifier) could be implemented to handle the case of more than two stimuli. However, the main limitation is due to data scarcity. Our search of public data repositories (datasets deposited before 2019) showed that immunological combinatorial datasets with more than two stimuli are extremely rare, precluding systematic research in this direction. Although higher order perturbation combinations are an important aspect of research into combinatorial treatments, due to a complete lack of appropriately structured datasets and to the need for further extensive development, we consider it beyond the current scope of our work. To acknowledge the relevance of the higher order combinations, we have now addressed this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Results first paragraph: What is defined here as synergy and antagonism is not congruent with the classical definitions of these terms.

One of the main changes, in particular, was to replace the terms of “positive” and “negative” interactions with the terms “synergistic” and “antagonistic” interactions, respectively. However, we would like to point out that, while the nomenclature has been revised, the precise definition of “synergistic” (“positive”) interactions and of “antagonistic” (“negative”) interactions are consistently applied in our previous and current works. In both cases, “synergistic” (positive) interactions comprise super-additive effects, while “antagonistic” (negative) interactions are sub-additive effects. To illustrate this point, we refer to the profiles 4, and 6 in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. From the qualitative point of view, the two profiles represent the same response pattern of a gene in the condition 0, X, Y, X+Y. That is, both profile 4 and 6 express the same ranking of the expression values in the four conditions. Such ranking is compatible both with a positive (synergistic) and with a negative (antagonistic) interaction. However, what makes profile 4 and 6 different is the comparison between the expression value of X+Y and the expected level of additivity. In profile 4 (antagonistic, or negative interaction), the expression value is lower than the expected additivity; in profile 6 (synergistic, or positive interaction), the expression value is larger than the expected additivity.</p><p>Due to the reviewer’s comment, we acknowledge that the change of the terms “positive” and “negative” interactions with “synergistic” and “antagonistic” interactions may generate confusion. To address this issue, we accept the reviewer’s suggestion to revert back to our original nomenclature, namely calling &quot;positive and negative interactions&quot;, rather than &quot;synergistic and antagonistic interactions&quot;.</p><p>Regarding the impossibility to determine synergism or antagonism in the absence of dose-response curves obtained, we agree with the reviewer. These effects are problematic and difficult to interpret but, at the same time, very frequent. Unless otherwise specified by the user, iSAIL automatically excludes these ceiling and floor effects from downstream analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referring to &quot;emergent responses (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , profile 3)&quot;, make effect bigger in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 so it is clearer to see the differences between profile 3 and 7.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been revised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referring to &quot;would be aggregated with nominal synergistic effects due to frequent cellular or assay saturation, which have low biological significance (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1 , profile 7)”.

The basic approach dates back to the work of Janes et al. (Science 2005), which, incidentally, is not cited. My main concern centers on the need for a relatively large amount of data combined with synthetic data in order to obtain insights focused on well-studied interactions of TNF with other cytokines. Furthermore, I am unclear as to the true universal applicability of this approach, for the following reasons:</p></disp-quote><p>When analyzing combinatorial treatments datasets, there are two major challenges. One is classifying and interpreting the presence of interactions. The second is predicting the occurrence of interactions from single treatment data. From this reviewer’s citing of the Janes et al. study, we suspect that these two different goals (classifying and interpreting vs predicting interactions) have not been clearly distinguished in introducing the problem setting, and this may have caused a lack of clarity regarding the main contributions of our work. The Janes study was directed at predicting apoptotic responses from detailed signaling assays. In contrast, our study addressed a completely different problem: systematically detecting, classifying and interpreting interaction effects in a dataset and integrating insight across many studies. In this context, we clarify both the objective of the framework and derived biological insight below.</p><p>Objective of the iSAIL method: iSAIL is not a “prediction system”, i.e. our objective is not to predict, denovo, the occurrence of interactions. The goal of our method is to robustly identify, classify and interpret interactions. This work is a crucial advance, a statistically rigorous identification of interaction effects has been lacking, which has limited the insight gained from combination treatment experiments using heretofore available tools. Furthermore, the method is not predicated on the availability of many datasets (as possibly implied by the reviewer). To clarify, we generate a synthetic dataset to train a machine learning classifier – the only scenario where the ground truth classification of interactions is known. Once the model parameters are optimized, any individual dataset constructed according to the design of a standard combinatorial treatment experiment, including control, single and combination treatment conditions, can be analyzed using iSAIL.</p><p>Biological insight: The reviewer’s main concern is that the insights gained by iSAIL involve a well-characterized system, such as TNF in combination with other cytokines. Our validation system was not meant to confirm the generic prediction that TNF synergizes with another cytokine (e.g. IFN-β), as is well known in the literature. Rather, the validation aimed to show our ability to correctly infer the biological effects and mechanisms associated with such interactions. The validation experiments confirmed the validity of our inferences of biological mechanisms predicated on VCAM1 and CCL5 which are, to the best of our knowledge, original and previously unpublished results.</p><p>From this perspective, the ability of iSAIL to identify new biological effects and corresponding mechanisms of interactions in a relatively well characterized system can be seen -different from the reviewer's interpretation- as a proof-of-concept that our method holds an even greater potential for discovery in less characterized systems of signal combinations.</p><p>Finally, while we do not aim to directly predict interactions in individual datasets, we show that our framework does provide new insight on general rules that govern combinatorial interactions. As we state in the Discussion, these general rules can be used in future work aiming to predict interactions, but this possibility is tangential to the main research objective of our work. We acknowledge that our results on the probabilistic algebra may have generated confusion, as that section is thematically close to predictive modelling. Thus, in this revised, resource-oriented version, we have removed this section from the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors mention that the datasets used involved multiple time points, but it is unclear how dynamics are being handled and modeled across these datasets. One would fully expect that in any extensive time course study of two stimuli, multiple outcomes (e.g. potentiation followed by tolerance or stimulation followed by suppression) would be observed. How can the algorithm then decompose such phenomena into a single characteristic response (i.e., does the algorithm treat each time point as a separate experiment, thereby losing true time-dependent interrelationships?)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the dynamics of signal integration is a very relevant, yet largely unexplored area. Extensive search of public data repositories (datasets deposited before 2019) showed that immunological combinatorial datasets with time course sampling are rare, precluding systematic research in this direction. Included in our compendium are time-course datasets with only two time points. Due to such poor temporal sampling, these studies were analyzed as separate experiments. While independent analysis of each time point would not be optimal for longer time series, developing a method to model temporal dynamics in combinatorial treatment experiments is impractical because of paucity of data.</p><p>Although the dynamics of combinatorial responses is not addressed in our work, our new analysis framework still provides a fundamental grammar and set of tools to map gene trajectories from longer time series. Time-dependent interrelationships could be included in our analysis, for example, by imposing additional constraints that guarantee smooth transitions between interaction profiles at successive time points. Our analysis framework, applied to a large compendium of time course experiments, should they become available, will enable us to identify preferential trajectories and dynamic rules governing time transitions between interaction profiles, similar to the probabilistic algebra we have identified in the static case.</p><p>Although the dynamics is a key aspect of combinatorial treatments, due to a complete lack of appropriately structured datasets and to the need for further extensive development, we consider it beyond the current scope of our work. To acknowledge the relevance of the dynamics, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The system chosen for validation, namely TNF + IFN-β, does not seem particularly novel. It has been appreciated for decades that TNF synergizes with other cytokines to produce an array of effects, including potentiation and tolerance as examples of preconditioning. A demonstration of a truly unexpected set of interactions between stimuli would have been more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>As clarified in the response to the reviewer (under General assessment and major comments section), Our validation system was not meant to confirm the generic prediction that TNF synergizes with other cytokines (e.g. IFN-β), as is well known in the literature, including in our publications. Rather, the validation aimed to show our ability to correctly infer the biological mechanisms of such interactions. For more on this point, please refer to our answer above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The additional validation studies focused on VCAM1 also seem to be focused on relatively well-studied phenomena. Multiple other gene transcripts that appear more novel are not followed up.</p></disp-quote><p>Our validation studies reveal important biological effects and mechanisms mediated by synergistic interactions between TNF and IFN β. To the best of our knowledge, these results are original and unpublished. The choice of VCAM1 and CCL5 as validation targets was driven by a combination of data-driven discovery, as provided by iSAIL, and prior knowledge. In our opinion, using prior knowledge, such as previously published literature and well-annotated functional pathway libraries at the validation step does not diminish the originality of our results. For example, while VCAM1 is generically known as a mediator of cell adhesion, no study has previously shown in a data-driven way that this gene is synergistically induced by TNF and IFNb, and validated the hypothesis that it controls the DC / T cell crosstalk.</p><p>When applied to a combinatorial treatment experiment of interest, iSAIL returns a set of transcripts displaying the most relevant interaction effects. These transcripts typically include both well- and poorly- characterized genes, both of which can be further explored in validation studies. The choice of gene candidates for further experiments depends on the context and underlying research objectives, and is ultimately the prerogative of the experimenter. In our immunological model, we focused on the discovery of new mechanisms regulating the crosstalk between DC and T cells, which is vastly recognized as one the most critical steps in the generation of an immune response.</p><p><bold>References:</bold></p><p>Mack, Chris A. &quot;How to write a good scientific paper: acronyms.&quot; Journal of Micro/Nanolithography, MEMS, and MOEMS 11, no. 4 (2012): 040102.</p><p>Senthivel, Vivek Raj, et al. &quot;Identifying ultrasensitive HGF dose-response functions in a 3D mammalian system for synthetic morphogenesis.&quot; Scientific reports 6.1 (2016): 1-15.</p></body></sub-article></article>
