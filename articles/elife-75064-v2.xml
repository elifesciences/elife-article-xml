However, this simple division of labor model struggles to explain why TFs with identical DNA-binding sequence specificity determined in vitro exhibit distinct binding profiles in vivo. The family of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) offer a stark example: aberrantly expressed in several cancer types, HIF-1α and HIF-2α subunit isoforms recognize the same DNA motif in vitro – the hypoxia response element (HRE) – but only share a subset of their target genes in vivo, while eliciting contrasting effects on cancer development and progression under certain circumstances. To probe the mechanisms mediating isoform-specific gene regulation, we used live-cell single particle tracking (SPT) to investigate HIF nuclear dynamics and how they change upon genetic perturbation or drug treatment. We found that HIF-α subunits and their dimerization partner HIF-1β exhibit distinct diffusion and binding characteristics that are exquisitely sensitive to concentration and subunit stoichiometry. Using domain-swap variants, mutations, and a HIF-2α specific inhibitor, we found that although the DBD and dimerization domains are important, another main determinant of chromatin binding and diffusion behavior is the AD-containing intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Using Cut&amp;Run and RNA-seq as orthogonal genomic approaches, we also confirmed IDR-dependent binding and activation of a specific subset of HIF target genes. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role of IDRs in regulating the TF search and binding process that contribute to functional target site selectivity on chromatin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single particle tracking</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered regions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54-CA231641-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darzacq</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tjian</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live-cell single particle tracking reveals the intrinsically disordered regions of transcription factors playing an unanticipated role in the nuclear search and chromatin binding process leading to functional target site selectivity and gene activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) are key frontline regulators of gene expression. Classical LexA-Gal4 domain-swap experiments in yeast presented a simple modular structure and apparent division of labor for typical TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brent and Ptashne, 1985</xref>). In this textbook paradigm, the DNA-binding domain (DBD) is responsible for DNA sequence recognition and binding specificity while the activation domain (AD) is responsible for target gene transactivation that involves protein-protein interactions with co-factors, the basal transcription machinery, and other ancillary factors that are generally devoid of sequence-specific DNA recognition. In higher eukaryotes, each DBD class usually contains multiple closely related family members. For example, the bHLH class of TFs includes MyoD, Clock, and Max. They all recognize the same E-box DNA-binding sequence motif 5’-CACGTG-3’, yet each differentially regulates muscle differentiation, circadian rhythm, and cell proliferation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kribelbauer et al., 2019</xref>). This raises the specificity paradox: how do TFs with seemingly identical DNA sequence specificity, at least as determined in vitro, nevertheless exhibit non-overlapping binding profiles in vivo and carry out distinct and even opposing functions? In general, when confronted with this conundrum, we have assumed that one or more co-factors or perhaps still to be identified ‘silent partner’ TFs can somehow divert target recognition to a composite cis-regulatory site distinct from the canonical DNA-binding site. Given the high occurrence of short binding motifs for most TFs throughout the genome, even with co-operative binding to composite sites, most potential specific binding sites nevertheless remain unoccupied as determined by genome-wide TF binding studies. What feature or motif within TFs outside of the DBD and dimerization domain may be responsible for such differential site selection has remained unclear. Thus, the simple rule of modular units with well separated divisions of labor between DBD, dimerization, and transactivation may deserve a closer look. We also wondered whether quantitative single molecule dynamics measurements might reveal new aspects of TF behavior in living cells that could inform us regarding potential mechanisms influencing the target search and binding process and differential site selectivity in a native physiologically relevant context.</p><p>Here, we have chosen the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) as a representative example to study the paradox of highly conserved DBDs carrying out distinct target site selection and to dissect potential novel features of TFs that mediate chromatin binding. HIFs are a family of α/β heterodimeric TFs stabilized under hypoxic conditions to promote angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, cell proliferation, and ‘stemness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Semenza, 2012</xref>). The oxygen-labile alpha subunits (mainly HIF-1α and HIF-2α) complex with their oxygen-stable beta partner (mainly HIF-1β) to form a functional dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All HIF subunit isoforms belong to the bHLH-PAS (basic helix-loop-helix-PER-ARNT-SIM) family, where the N-termini are structured domains containing bHLH (DNA-binding) and PAS (dimerization) domains, while the C-termini consist of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) containing ADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). HIF-1α/1β and HIF-2α/1β dimers share a conserved structural fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), recognize the same hypoxia response element (HRE) 5’-TACGTG-3’ binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schödel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wenger et al., 2005</xref>), but share only a partial overlap of target genes in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smythies et al., 2019</xref>). With their own unique target gene sets, HIF-1α and -2α can exert divergent and even contrasting functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keith et al., 2012</xref>). For example, while both HIF-1α and HIF-2α regulate angiogenesis, HIF-1α specifically regulates glycolysis, apoptosis, and promotes NO production, whereas HIF-2α binds to the <italic>POU5F1</italic> locus to maintain Oct4-regulated stem cell identity and pluripotency, promotes cell cycle progression, and inhibits NO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smythies et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our current simple textbook model of exchangeable modular TF functional units does not satisfactorily explain such isoform-specific target gene regulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous tagging of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) in 786-O clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells for fast single particle tracking (fSPT).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing the similar domain organizations of HIFs (top) and the HRE-bound HIF α/β dimers (bottom).

HIFs are aberrantly upregulated and recognized as oncogenic drivers in multiple cancers. However, in addition to their shared roles in cancer onset and progression, HIF-1α and -2α also show many independent, sometimes even opposing roles in specific contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keith et al., 2012</xref>). For example, in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), HIF-2α is the critical tumorigenic driver whereas HIF-1α, in contrast with its usual tumorigenic role, is mostly tumor-suppressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Raval et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schödel et al., 2016</xref>). The regulatory mechanism behind such highly divergent outcomes is still largely unknown. Given such complexity, without a deeper understanding of isoform-specific transcriptional regulation, it is hard to predict the functional outcomes mediated by individual HIF isoforms in various cancer types or stages, which could be a complicating factor in developing more effective HIF-targeting cancer therapeutics.</p><p>In this study, we aim to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating isoform-specific target gene regulation at its most fundamental level – could we detect differential molecular dynamics of distinct TF isoforms during the target search and chromatin binding process in live cells? Which regions or domains of TFs might be responsible for such isoform-specific properties? Could we begin to discern possible mechanisms that guide TFs with highly conserved DBDs to their distinct and specific targets beyond cognate DNA sequence recognition? Here, we use HIFs as an illustrative example, combining endogenous tagging and super-resolution single particle tracking (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) to study the dynamic behavior of these key gene regulators in live cells under physiological conditions. We also dissect the contribution of different domains of HIF-α isoforms by a series of mutation and domain-swap experiments to directly test the concept of modular functional domains. Deploying a combination of genetic and small-molecule perturbations, we found that, although HIF DBD and dimerization are important for DNA target acquisition, differences between HIF isoforms in terms of amount of protein bound and diffusion characteristics are mainly driven by regions outside the DBD and dimerization domains. Finally, using genomic approaches we found that, in concordance with our imaging results, binding strength and gene activation are IDR-dependent for a subset of HIF target sites. Our results reveal a previously unappreciated role of unstructured domains in the target search and binding properties of TFs to functional chromatin sites in a live cancer cell context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing a human cancer cell system for live-cell single molecule imaging of HIF</title><p>To investigate HIF dynamics, we first focused on one of the cognate dimers: HIF-2α/1β. We used the common ccRCC line 786-O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodaczewska et al., 2016</xref>), derived from a VHL-deficient, H2 type primary ccRCC, wherein HIF-2α is stabilized due to an inactivating mutation in VHL (the E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets all HIF-α isoforms for proteasomal degradation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gnarra et al., 1994</xref>). The 786-O line also conveniently lacks any functional HIF-1α due to a truncating mutation of HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Swiatek et al., 2020</xref>), which allows us to study one α isoform independently from the other. Using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, we successfully generated several clonal lines with homozygous knock-in (KIN) of the HaloTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Los et al., 2008</xref>) at the N-terminus of either HIF-2α or its binding partner, HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that the tagged proteins are expressed at levels similar to wild-type (WT) in unedited cells (e.g. HIF-2α clone A31 and HIF-1β clone A21) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Confocal imaging after covalently labeling cells with a fluorescent Halo-binding ligand (JFX646) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grimm et al., 2021</xref>) shows the expected nuclear localization for both Halo-HIF-2α and Halo-HIF-1β proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition, we confirmed by ChIP-seq that both tagged proteins maintain a similar genome-wide binding profile as the WT protein in unedited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>), and RNA-seq confirmed that gene expression profiles in both edited cell lines are not significantly altered from WT unedited cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>, with cells overexpressing WT and mutant HIF-α as controls). We have thus established a human cancer cell system suitable for live-cell imaging of HIF-2α and HIF-1β at endogenous expression levels.</p><p>To evaluate how HIF-2α and -1β explore the nucleus and bind DNA, we used the fast modality of super-resolution live-cell SPT (fast SPT, or fSPT) that is capable of tracking rapidly diffusing molecules.

Briefly, SA analyzes regular Brownian motion with normally distributed localization error (RBME) with a two-dimensional ‘grid of states’ that spans a range of diffusion coefficients (first dimension) and localization error (second dimension) magnitudes, and evaluates the occupancy (proportion) of each state in this array using the observed fSPT trajectory data and a variational Bayesian algorithm. After inference, the proportion of molecules as a function of diffusion coefficient is calculated by marginalizing localization error, creating a ‘diffusion spectrum’ that reports the underlying molecular subpopulations according to their proportions (y-axis) and their diffusive properties (diffusion coefficients, x-axis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

While the heterogeneity we observed was likely due to the limited number of trajectories collected from each cell (i.e. small sample bias) rather than to a difference in behavior of HIF proteins in each cell, our findings do indicate that a range of moving states likely exists for both HIF proteins.</p><p>We then pooled trajectories from many cells (n~60 from three biological replicates for each experimental condition) to estimate the distribution of diffusion coefficients for the population. SA generates a distribution of diffusion coefficient estimates that reports the fraction of stably bound molecules while simultaneously displaying the full behavioral spectrum of the diffusing molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, bottom). We define the fraction with a diffusion coefficient &lt;0.1 μm<sup>2</sup>/s as immobile and presumably chromatin-bound (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and Appendix 1 for discussion of source of variations between replicates). Strikingly, we observed a very different behavior for Halo-HIF-2α compared to Halo-HIF-1β. Whereas a large fraction (about 40%) of Halo-HIF-2α is bound, the majority (above 70%) of Halo-HIF-1β appears freely diffusing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, clones A31 and A21). Also, the overall diffusion coefficient for the Halo-HIF-1β mobile population is much larger than that of Halo-HIF-2α. We repeated measurements in different KIN clones and confirmed the reproducibility of these results for both Halo-HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>, clone B50) and Halo-HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>, clone B89). Note that although we quantitatively compared the bound fraction, due to the complexity of the composition of the moving population (i.e. multiple states might exist but are merged into a single peak), quantitatively comparing mode (i.e. peak) or mean diffusion coefficient may give slightly different results. Therefore, for the rest of the paper we only present the peak diffusion coefficient in the figures but listed both peak diffusion coefficient and mean diffusion coefficient for the moving population in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>The differences between HIF-2α and -1β seem counterintuitive at first, because one would expect HIF-2α and HIF-1β to behave similarly since they should exist as a heterodimer. However, since the endogenous HIF-1β is expressed at a much higher level than HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), the majority of HIF-1β is likely free to diffuse without HIF-2α. Of note, the distribution plot only reflects the fraction of molecules as a function of their diffusion coefficient, but does not report on the absolute number of molecules. Therefore, a smaller bound fraction for Halo-HIF-1β does not mean fewer numbers of bound molecules than Halo-HIF-2α, since many more Halo-HIF-1β molecules are present in the nucleus. Given this scenario, we hypothesized that HIF-1β molecular dynamics and percent binding should be modulated by changing the 2α/1β stoichiometry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>HIF-1β binding and diffusing dynamics can be modulated by HIF-α:β stoichiometry, and are dependent on dimerization</title><p>To test the hypothesis that HIF-1β dynamics depends on 2α/1β ratio, we first tried to modulate its behavior by stably overexpressing HIF-2α in the endogenously HIF-1β Halo-tagged KIN line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We found that the mobile population of Halo-HIF-1β diffuses more slowly when HIF-2α is overexpressed, most likely due to its dimerization with the extra HIF-2α to form dimers capable of DNA/chromatin binding. As expected, we also observed a significant increase in the Halo-HIF-1β bound fraction (up to 50%), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>, top and middle). To confirm that the changes in HIF-1β dynamics caused by increasing levels of HIF-2α are dependent on heterodimerization, we stably overexpressed the HIF-2α R171A/V192D double mutant (HIF-2α DM) that was previously reported to lose its dimerization capability with HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, overexpression of HIF-2α DM did not increase the bound fraction or decrease the overall diffusion coefficient of Halo-HIF-1β to the same extent seen with WT HIF-2α overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>, bottom), suggesting that the changes we observe are dimerization-dependent.</p><p>We further validated our results by stably overexpressing different forms of HIF-α in the HIF-1β Halo-tagged KIN line and treating cells with an HIF-2α-specific small-molecule inhibitor, Belzutifan (PT-2977). Belzutifan inhibits HIF-2α/1β, but not HIF-1α/1β, dimerization by specifically binding to the dimerization domain of HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and thus has been used as an HIF-2α inhibitor for ccRCC treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wallace et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). We first confirmed that Belzutifan inhibits HIF-2α transcription function in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, Belzutifan also reduces the HIF-2α bound fraction in the HIF-2α Halo-tagged KIN line in a similar dosage-dependent manner, again revealing the potential of fSPT to measure TF dynamics and associated functional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). We choose to use 0.2 μM Belzutifan for all subsequent experiments to maximize its effect.</p><p>Next, we carried out a series of experiments designed to probe the consequences of swapping different functional domains of HIF-1α and HIF-2α to determine which parts of these closely related TFs might be involved in selective activities when paired with HIF-1β. Using the HIF-1β Halo-tagged KIN line as the parental line, we stably overexpressed WT or chimeric HIF-α, where we swapped the structured and disordered domains between HIF-1α and HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). All these different HIF-α variants are expressed from a relatively strong EF-1α promoter and are N-terminally 3xFLAG-tagged. A construct that expresses 3xFLAG only is used as control. We then treated these cells with either Belzutifan or DMSO control and measured Halo-HIF-1β dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). While 3xFLAG tag had no effect, overexpressing HIF-α, regardless of which variant form, is able to both increase the bound fraction and reduce the overall diffusion coefficient of HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, top, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, DMSO group). For cells overexpressing the α variants that contain the HIF-2α structured domain, this effect on HIF-1β can be at least partially reverted after Belzutifan treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, +HIF-2α and +HIF-2α/1α). In contrast, for cells overexpressing the α variants that contain the HIF-1α structured domain, this effect is resistant to Belzutifan, consistent with the subunit isoform specificity of the drug for HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, +HIF-1α and +HIF-1α/2α). In untransfected and 3xFLAG only overexpressing control cells, treatment with Belzutifan only weakly reduces the HIF-1β bound fraction, again suggesting that the majority of HIF-1β is not engaged with 2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, parental cell and +3xF). Overall, these results demonstrate that HIF-1β dynamics change after engagement with its α partner and can be selectively inhibited with a specific dimerization inhibitor. The observed differences also confirm that fSPT is a powerful platform to monitor molecular dynamic changes of TFs in living cells thus, allowing us to gain new mechanistic insights while we introduce various perturbations, such as subunit concentration or stoichiometry and specific mutations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HIF-α increases HIF-1β binding and decreases HIF-1β diffusion coefficient through dimerization, in an intrinsically disordered region (IDR)-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of evaluating Halo-HIF-1β behavior with genetic and small-molecule perturbation.

Specifically, the variants containing the HIF-2α IDR have a stronger effect on increasing HIF-1β binding than the variants containing the HIF-1α IDR. Thus, surprisingly, it appears that the bound fraction of HIF-1β is not determined by the HIF-α DBD, but rather by HIF-α IDR, which we found rather counterintuitive. To confirm the importance of HIF-α IDRs in HIF binding, we overexpressed a truncated version of either HIF-1α or -2α that contains only the N-terminal structured region (HIF-1α NT or HIF-2α NT), which still maintains both the DBD and dimerization capability for interacting with HIF-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, both these truncated forms lacking the IDR/AD of HIF-α minimally affect the HIF-1β bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Surprisingly, these truncated HIF-α variants also only marginally influenced the overall HIF-1β diffusion coefficient. These results indicate that dimerization alone neither increases HIF-1β binding nor reduces the overall diffusion coefficient of its moving population. Instead, the extended HIF-α AD-containing IDR appears necessary to influence and direct HIF-1β behavior.</p><p>To further test our hypothesis that HIF chromatin binding and the dynamics of the diffusion population are dominated by the α subunit IDR, we switched to image the α subunit itself. We made different forms of Halo-tagged HIF-α (WT and domain-swapped), stably but weakly expressed them in WT 786-O cells with an L30 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To minimize differences in expression levels among different HIF-α forms, we selected cells with a roughly similar fluorescence intensity in the ‘cell-picking channel’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, left), where Halo-tagged proteins were fully labeled with JFX549 to reflect their amount (except for the few molecules labeled with JFX646 for fSPT tracking) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right). Since we achieved sparse labeling using low JFX646 dye concentrations, we did not need a pre-bleaching step before collecting SPT movies. We could thus more confidently correlate the average number of particles detected in the initial 10 frames (~50 ms) in the ‘fSPT tracking channel’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, right) with expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also Appendix 2 for full discussion). Indeed, the initial average localization density only varied within a factor of 2 across different cell lines in each experimental group. We confirmed that, when controlling for similar expression levels, binding and diffusion characteristics of L30-expressed Halo-HIF-2α are very similar to the endogenous Halo-HIF-2α in the KIN line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), demonstrating that weak overexpression can largely recapitulate endogenous protein behavior.

Our results suggest that while the moving population of HIF-1β alone diffuses relatively fast, the moving population of both HIF-α and HIF-α/β dimers diffuses relatively slowly. We postulate this is potentially due to the HIF-α IDR engaging in protein-protein interactions with various co-factors both when associated with HIF-1β or when alone (Figure 8A). Indeed, this is consistent with our previous observation that the HIF-α NT/HIF-1β dimer diffuses at a relatively fast rate, similar to HIF-1β alone which apparently does not share this HIF-α IDR-mediated capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HIF-α IDR contributes to binding preferences and regulatory specificity of target genes</title><p>To see how differences in HIF molecular dynamics relate to actual genome-wide binding, we performed Cut&amp;Run on 786-O cells stably expressing different forms of Halo-tagged HIF-α driven by the L30 promoter (same cells we performed fSPT on in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

With the successful development of X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, mechanisms of DNA-binding specificity have been extensively studied, primarily based on classically structured globular DBDs of TFs. We now know that a variety of structural mechanisms are used to recognize DNA, including formation of specific hydrogen bonds and DNA contour interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rohs et al., 2010</xref>). However, these inherent binding modalities of DBDs alone cannot explain TF binding site selection in vivo in eukaryotic cells. As revealed by genome-wide in vivo binding assays, only a subset of potential target sites become occupied, and this is not entirely consistent with either DNA-binding site affinity or chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grossman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Srivastava and Mahony, 2020</xref>). On the other hand, TFs have long been recognized to also contain long unstructured transactivation domains with simple amino acid composition (Gln-rich, acidic, Pro-rich, etc.), which often posed challenges to purification and/or crystallization of full-length TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Courey and Tjian, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma and Ptashne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mermod et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tjian and Maniatis, 1994</xref>). Recently, such IDRs were reported to play an important role in weak and multivalent protein-protein interactions to form local small transient hubs that, when exacerbated by overexpression, can drive phase separation. Although not structurally defined, these interactions can still be sequence/amino acid composition selective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong and Mir, 2021</xref>). IDRs are now proposed to have important functions in boosting gene expression through hub or condensate formation to locally enrich for factors that are needed for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). However, few studies of IDRs have investigated their potential role in DNA-binding site search and selection. Some studies reported that for a subset of zinc finger proteins (Sp2 and KLF3), an IDR is critical for in vivo binding and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burdach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Völkel et al., 2015</xref>), and two recent studies using genomic approaches reported the IDR as a determinant for specificity for some of the yeast TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gera et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, using advanced live-cell SPT, we report that TF IDRs previously associated with ADs are, in fact, an important determinant mediating nuclear search dynamics and chromatin binding characteristics. Employing both genetic and small-molecule perturbations together with a series of domain-swap and mutation experiments, we found that it is the AD-associated disordered region of HIF-α rather than the intrinsic molecular weight of the TF that dictates a relatively slow diffusion for both HIF-α monomers and HIF-α/β dimers. On the other hand, when not engaged with HIF-α, HIF-1β diffuses rapidly as expected for an unencumbered subunit. These results indicate that the diffusion characteristic of HIF molecules is profoundly influenced by the properties of their disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In fact, computational analysis shows very different amino acid composition bias among HIF-1α, -2α, and -1β disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, it is very likely that as these molecules navigate through the crowded nuclear environment, their distinct stretches of IDRs that also contain ADs make differential and selective interactions with other nuclear components, resulting in distinct diffusive behaviors. According to Coulomb’s law, acidity, and thus electrostatic charge on the molecules, contributes to the attraction or repulsion forces toward other molecules in the environment. Thus it is also possible that due to differences in acidity, the different charges on these IDRs can cause differential non-specific interactions with macromolecules including not only proteins, but also DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model for intrinsically disordered region (IDR)-mediated nuclear search and chromatin binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The HIF-α IDR determines its slow motion of both the HIF-α monomer and HIF-α/β dimer, likely by HIF-α IDR-mediated interactions with nuclear macromolecules. For HIF-α, the IDR thus determines its slow motion regardless of its dimerization status. For HIF-1β, dimerization slows it down due to extra interactions (yellow and red clouds) brought by HIF-α IDR. (<bold>Β</bold>) HIF-chromatin engagement comprises two components: DNA-binding domain (DBD)- and IDR-mediated interactions. As an obligated dimer, the DBD and the dimerization domain are both necessary for HIF binding, but the IDR determines the bound fraction, possibly via its interaction with nearby macromolecules, including other proteins and/or nucleic acids (DNA and/or RNA).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75064-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While it is easy to conceptualize how IDRs can influence the rate of diffusion, one unexpected result is that they also largely determine how much TFs bind to chromatin, as well as influence their binding site preferences. Although we confirmed that the DBD and dimerization domains are important for chromatin binding, the surprise was that our domain-swap experiments clearly demonstrated that the percentage of bound TF is mainly contributed by regions outside of the DBD/dimerization domains. One explanation could be the differential charge propensities of the different disordered regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). For example, the HIF-2α IDR is more positively charged and may not only slow down nuclear exploration but also stabilize chromatin binding, possibly through stronger non-specific interactions with negatively charged chromatin-associated RNA and/or nucleosome-free DNA regions. Besides direct chromatin interactions, HIF-2α IDR could also increase and stabilize binding via indirect interactions with other chromatin-bound proteins. Moreover, since different IDRs can selectively interact with other IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chong and Mir, 2021</xref>), we also postulate that selective interactions with other TFs or co-regulators may play a role in determining HIF chromatin-binding specificity. One hint of such a ‘combinatorial TF selectivity mechanism’ is the enrichment of different TF motifs at HIF-1α and HIF-2α binding sites. Depending on the cell type, AP-1 or FOXD2, FOXL1 and FOXC2 were previously found at HIF-2α binding sites, while HEY1/2, ZNF263, or SP1/2 were found at HIF-1α binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Smythies et al., 2019</xref>). It was also previously reported that while no target specificity was preserved in reporter gene assays, the N-terminal TAD of HIF-α conferred endogenous target specificity for two of the HIF-1 unique genes examined, possibly via specific interactions with transcriptional co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). Further Co-IP or pull-down assay coupled with mass spectrometry will be needed to more fully dissect this type of in vivo selectivity mechanism.</p><p>Given our results, we believe that the simple ‘division of labor’ model for DBDs and IDRs is an over-simplification which was probably only suitable for prokaryotes. Instead, eukaryotic TFs have evolved to exploit both DBDs and IDRs for chromatin binding as well as binding site selection, which is best suited for the eukaryotic chromatin environment. We propose that TF-chromatin engagement (binding and site selection) comprises two components – the first being DBD-mediated, mainly the classical motif binding force that acts directly on DNA, and the second being IDR-mediated interactions (likely weak and multivalent) with the native chromatin environment that include protein-protein interactions, and interactions with DNA and RNA molecules. Thus, we want to emphasize that the term ‘DNA-binding specificity’ refers to the first interaction component and we propose it should only be used with respect to isolated or naked DNA in eukaryotes. Instead, ‘chromatin binding preferences’ would be a better term to describe in vivo binding preferences of eukaryotic TFs within a native chromatin environment, which not only include DBD-DNA interactions, but also involve ‘micro-environment recognition’ mediated by IDR-chromatin interactions. These two forces can be additive or competitive, depending on the macromolecule composition of each specific chromatin locus, resulting in varied TF occupancy that could not be simply predicted from the DNA code. It seems that in the case of HIFs, for most of their binding sites the combined DBD- and IDR-mediated forces are similar for both HIF-1α and -2α, resulting in overlapping occupancy for different isoforms at these sites. However, for a few but striking cases, IDR-mediated interaction dominates HIFs’ binding preferences, modulating the amount of HIF isoforms at these differentially regulated sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Interestingly, Myc, a closely related bHLH-LZ family TF, shows predominately DBD-mediated chromatin engagement, where non-specific DBD-DNA interactions contribute most of the binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pellanda et al., 2021</xref>). These different observations suggest that different eukaryotic TFs may exploit DBD- and IDR-mediated interactions to different degrees, resulting in distinct chromatin engagement mechanisms.</p><p>We note that IDR-mediated chromatin engagement could happen either before and after DNA binding. It is possible that these IDR-mediated interactions first locate the TF to a few highly concentrated protein hubs in the vicinity of selected genomic binding sites, and then the TF performs a more localized target search with the DBD to find its motif, as it has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Darzacq and Tjian, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staller, 2022</xref>). In this case, whether the TF explores the nucleus alone to join the hubs or explores it as a larger complex containing other TFs/coactivators, IDRs both determine the TF dynamics and significantly improves the TF on-rate. On the other hand, it is also possible that TFs first binds to their target site via the DBD, and then IDR-mediated interactions stabilize the binding, increasing the TF’s residence time and decreasing its off-rate. In both cases, distinct IDRs among different TF from closely related family members can create isoform-specific binding (and thus achieve isoform-specific gene activation) at selected genomic sites among all binding sites that are shared by the same family.</p><p>Finally, we have demonstrated that our fSPT platform provides a powerful tool able to resolve in vivo protein dynamics that is exquisitely sensitive to concentration, subunit stoichiometry, and genetic/small-molecule perturbations. This is especially important when studying TFs, where a slight difference in expression level often generates completely different results, rendering over-expression systems highly susceptible to artifacts. It is also worth underscoring the importance of studying TFs in their native physiologically relevant chromatin environment, given their obligate interactions with higher-order chromatin structures and co-factors. For example, the EPO gene is reported to be responsive to HIF-2α but not HIF-1α in Hep3B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Warnecke et al., 2004</xref>) and in murine liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rankin et al., 2007</xref>), however, a luciferase reporter driven by the upstream EPO enhancer also responds strongly to HIF-1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Varma and Cohen, 1997</xref>), which may generate misleading results and interpretations. Our fSPT platform allows us to study transcriptional regulation in the native chromatin context and with endogenous TF levels to obtain data with physiological and functional relevance. Such live-cell real-time measurements under native cell contexts could prove to be highly valuable, both for dissecting in vivo mechanisms of transcription regulation and for guiding the development of effective therapeutics. Our Belzutifan treatment experiment is an example of how fSPT can reveal the mechanism of action of small-molecule inhibitors, and how it could serve as a powerful tool to screen for drugs that selectively target one isoform versus another, using dimerization and binding readouts as indicators of efficacy and specificity. Moreover, since our results demonstrated how IDRs can affect TF diffusion behavior, potentially distinct dynamic features determined by a particular IDR can be exploited as a readout for screening small molecules or peptides that target allosteric sites of TFs. Assays that can quantitatively measure TF diffusive behavior in live cells could be transformative for advancing drug discovery because a high-throughput imaging strategy opens the door to effectively target what has been traditionally considered ‘undruggable’, such as most protein-protein interactions including potentially unstructured TF ADs.</p><p>In summary, using the HIF protein family as a case study, we uncovered a mechanism of IDR-mediated nuclear search and differential chromatin binding leading to selective gene activation. We expect this fundamental principle to be applicable to a broad range of TF families.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, stable cell line construction, and drug treatment</title><p>Human 786-O clear cell renal carcinoma cells were obtained from the UCB Cell Culture Facility (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_017924">SCR_017924</ext-link>), which were originally obtained from ATCC (#CRL-1932).

For each guide/donor pair, approximately 4 million 786-O cells were nucleofected with 3.75 μg of donor plasmid and 1.25 μg of sgRNA plasmid. Twenty-four hr after transfection, Venus-positive cells were sorted and cultured for another 5–7 days, then Halo-positive cells were sorted individually into single wells of 96-well plates. Clones were expanded and genotyped with two rounds of PCR. The first round used one primer upstream of the left homologous arm and the other primer downstream of the right homologous arm. The second round used either of the external primers and a corresponding internal primer located in the HaloTag coding region.

At least 1 day before imaging, selective medium (if used) was removed and replaced with non-selective growth medium. On the day of imaging, cells should be less than 100% confluent. Immediately before imaging, cells were double-labeled with JFX dyes as follows: cells were first incubated for 5 min in 1 ml growth medium containing JFX646, at a concentration that only gives approximately 10 detected molecules per frame in the initial frames to ensure minimum misconnection of trajectories between detections. This concentration differs from cell line to cell line, ranging from 0.2 to 5 nM, depending on the expression level of the Halo-fusion protein. After 5 min of incubation, medium was removed, cells were rinsed in PBS, and incubated for 5 min in 1 ml medium containing JFX549. The concentration of JFX549 also varies, usually at 25× the concentration of JFX646. After incubation, cells were washed twice for 5 min each, a first time with 2 ml regular growth media, and a second time with 2 ml phenol red-free growth media, with a quick PBS rinse before each wash. After wash, coverslip was transferred to Attofluor Cell Chambers (Thermo Fisher, #A7816) with cells facing up and 1 ml phenol red-free medium added to the chamber. For Belzutifan treatment experiments, Belzutifan or equivalent amount of DMSO was added throughout the labeling and washing steps (except during PBS rinses), as well as in the final imaging medium, at the indicated concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Live-cell SPT</title><p>All SPT experiments were carried out on a custom-built microscope as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McSwiggen et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, a Nikon TI microscope is equipped with a 100×/NA 1.49 oil-immersion TIRF objective, a motorized mirror, a perfect Focus system, an EM-CCD camera, and an incubation chamber maintained with humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. All microscope, camera, and hardware components were controlled through the NIS-Elements software (Nikon).</p><p>During imaging, samples were excited with 561 nm laser at 1100 mW (Genesis Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) with emission filter set to Semrock 593/40 nm bandpass filter to locate and focus the cell nuclei, as well as to adjust laser angle to achieve highly inclined laminated optical sheet (HiLo) illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tokunaga et al., 2008</xref>). An ROI (region of interest) of random size was selected to fit into the interior of the nuclei but with maximized area. Then the emission filter was switched to Semrock 676/37 nm bandpass filter while keeping TIRF angle, stage xyz position, and ROI the same. Because we achieved sparse labeling using low dye concentrations, pre-bleaching was not required to visualize single molecules. Movies were then taken with 633 nm laser (Genesis Coherent, Santa Clara, CA) at 1100 mW and 1 ms pulse, with camera exposure at 5.48 ms frame rate for 800–1600 frames, until samples were completely photobleached. At least 20 movies (corresponding to 20 cells) were taken for each sample as one biological replicate on a given day. A total of three biological replicates on three separate days were collected to produce the final results (&gt;60 cells per cell line/condition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>SPT data processing</title><p>Raw SPT movies were processed with an earlier version of saspt package for state array (SA) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heckert et al., 2022</xref>), which is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alecheckert/quot">https://github.com/alecheckert/quot</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heckert, 2019</xref>) to generate trajectory files (.trajs). Generally, it performs tracking in the following steps: read a frame, find spots in the frame, localize spots to subpixel resolution, and reconnect spots from consecutive frames into trajectories. Since a non-photoactivatable dye was used for all SPT experiments, we labeled cells with a dye concentration that only gives very low spot detection density, which allowed us to track spots from the very first frame. This is important because if the initial frames are filtered due to high localization density, there might be a bias toward moving molecules, due to the bound molecules being photobleached and diffusing molecules moving into the focal plane during the later frames. Although we used very sparse labeling, occasionally there would be frames with high density, to minimize misconnections due to multiple particles in close proximity, we incorporated a filtering step where we removed frames with more than seven detections in the following way. First, we computed the number of detections per frame. Next, this function was smoothed with uniform filtering with a kernel width of 21 frames. Finally, we identified frames with fewer than seven detections after smoothing and isolated trajectories from these frames. Specifically, the following configuration was used for all detections and tracking: Image reading and filtering settings: start = 0, method = ‘identity’, chunk_size = 100; Spot detection settings: method = ‘llr’, k=1.0, w=15, t=18; Subpixel localization settings: method = ‘ls_int_gaussian’, window_size = 9, sigma = 1.0, ridge = 0.001, max_iter = 20, damp = 0.3; Tracking settings: method = ‘euclidean’, max_spots_per_frame = 7, pixel_size_um = 0.16, frame_interval = 0.00548, search_radius = 1.0, max_blinks = 0, min_I0=0.0, scale = 7.0.</p><p>To infer the distribution of diffusion coefficients from experimentally observed trajectories, we used an earlier version of saspt package for state array (SA) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heckert et al., 2022</xref>), which is publicly available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alecheckert/spagl">https://github.com/alecheckert/spagl</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heckert, 2020</xref>) (sample_script_fss.py), which generates the posterior mean occupations for an SA evaluated on trajectories across all cells.

WT 786-O or endogenously tagged KIN clones A31 (V5-Halo-HIF-2α) and A21 (V5-Halo-HIF-1β) were expanded to two 15 cm dishes and cross-linked 5’ at RT with 1% formaldehyde-containing FBS-free medium; cross-linking was stopped by adding PBS-glycine (0.125 M final). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped, centrifuged for 10’, and pellets were flash-frozen. Cell pellets were thawed and resuspended in 2 ml of cell lysis buffer (5 mM PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mM KCl, and 0.5% NP-40, 1 ml/15 cm plate) w/ protease inhibitors and incubated for 10’ on ice. Lysates were centrifuged for 10’ at 4000 rpm and nuclear pellets resuspended in 6 volumes of sonication buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) w/ protease inhibitors, incubated on ice for 10’, and sonicated to obtain DNA fragments around 500 bp in length (Covaris S220 sonicator, 20% Duty factor, 200 cycles/burst, 150 peak incident power, 10 cycles 30” on and 30” off). Sonicated lysates were cleared by centrifugation and chromatin (400 μg per antibody) was diluted in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Na-deoxycholate, 140 mM NaCl) w/ protease inhibitors to a final concentration of 0.8 μg/μl, precleared with Protein G sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 2 hr at 4°C and immunoprecipitated overnight with 4 μg of specific antibodies. About 4% of the precleared chromatin was saved as input. Immunoprecipitated DNA was purified with the Qiagen QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, eluted in 33 μl of 0.1× TE (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.01 mM EDTA) and analyzed by qPCR together with 2% of the input chromatin prior to ChIP-seq library preparation (SYBR Select Master Mix for CFX, Thermo Fisher).

Twenty ng of ChIP input DNA (as measured by Nanodrop) and 25 μl of the immunoprecipitated DNA were used as a starting material and the recommended reagents’ volumes were cut in half. The NEBNext Adaptor for Illumina was diluted 1:10 in Tris/NaCl, pH 8.0 (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM NaCl) and the ligation step extended to 30’. After ligation, a single purification step with 0.9× volumes of Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification beads (Beckman Coulter A63880) was performed, eluting DNA in 22 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Twenty μl of the eluted DNA were used for the library enrichment step, performed with the KAPA HotStart PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics KK2502) in 50 μl of total reaction volume (10 μl 5× KAPA buffer, 1.5 μl 10 mM dNTPs, 0.5 μl 10 μM NEB Universal PCR primer, 0.5 μl 10 μM NEB index primer, 1 μl KAPA polymerase, 16.5 μl nuclease-free water, and 20 μl sample). Samples were enriched with 9 PCR cycles (98°C, 45”; [98°C, 15”; 60°C, 10”] × 9; 72°C, 1’; 4°C, hold), purified with 0.9 volumes of AMPure XP PCR purification beads and eluted with 33 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. Library concentration, quality, and fragment size were assessed by Qubit fluorometric quantification (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Invitrogen Q32851) qPCR and Fragment analyzer. Twelve multiplexed libraries (input, HIF-1β, HIF-1α, and V5 pull-downs in WT 786-O cells and A31 and A21 clones) were pooled and sequenced in one lane on the Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencing platform (50 bp, single end reads) at the Vincent J.

Around 0.5 million cells were used for each experimental condition. Before permeabilization, proteinase inhibitor was left out from the buffer to minimize toxicity to the cells, but was added during the permeabilization step. Digitonin was used at a final concentration of 0.02% for Dig-wash buffer and antibody buffer, as it was tested to be the minimum concentration to fully permeabilize 786-O cells. For each cell line, a primary antibody (either mouse-anti-V5 or mouse IgG, 1 mg/ml at 1:100 dilution) was used with a 4°C overnight incubation. A secondary rabbit-anti-mouse IgG was used at 1:100 dilution with an hour incubation at 4°C. For each wash, 100 μl of Dig-wash buffer was used. Chromatin digestion was done for 30 min on ice. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and the pellet was dissolved in 30 μl 0.1× TE (1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA). DNA was quantified by Qubit (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Invitrogen Q32851) and up to 40 ng (and up to 25 μl) was used for library preparation, using NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB E7645) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with a few modifications. Reagents’ volumes were cut in half. For end prep 20°C 30 min followed by 50°C 60 min was used. For adapter ligation, NEBNext Adapter was diluted 1:20 in Tris/NaCl, pH 8.0 (10 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl), mixture was incubated for 30 min at 20°C (instead of 15 min). After ligation, product was size-selected with 1.75× Agencourt AMPure XP PCR purification beads (Beckman Coulter A63880), and DNA was eluted in 15 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0. 13 µl of eluted DNA was used for library enrichment with 15 μl NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master mix, 1 μl 10 μM NEB Universal PCR primer and 1 μl 10 μM NEB Index Primer. Samples were enriched with 11 PCR cycles (98°C, 30”; [98°C, 10”; 65°C, 10”] × 11; 65°C, 5’; 4°C, hold). The 30 μl PCR product was size-selected with double AMPure XP cleanup (first with 24 μl [0.8×] beads and take the supernatant, then add 12 μl beads [to final PEG/NaCl 1.2×] and discard supernatant). Library was eluted with 15 μl 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and quantified by Qubit (Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Invitrogen Q32851).

A31 for the bootstrapping, as this is the cell line where the most data were collected. We used 243 movies (each movie corresponds to one cell) collected from 11 different replicates (each replicate was done on a different day) as the pool to draw sample from. We performed sampling in three different ways. First, we pooled all trajectories from all cells and randomly drawn different number of trajectories (i.e. sample size n=10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, and 6400) from the pool with replacement. After each draw, the resulting trajectories were used for SA analysis to generate the diffusion spectrum and then the fraction bound was calculated. We performed 100 draws for each of the sampling size and plotted box plot on the resulting bound fraction estimation to see variation. This way, we can estimate if we randomly sample n trajectories 100 times, how variable the result will be. The result was as expected – the more trajectories we draw, the less variable the estimation is between the 100 times of drawing when looking at the bound fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, left).</p><p>Second, instead of sampling a mixture of trajectories from all 243 cells, we randomly picked N number of unique cells (N=1, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120) from the 243 cells, pooled the trajectories from these selected cells, and sampled from these pooled trajectories. The sample size and number of draws were kept the same. This way, we can compare if we randomly take only N cells from the population (243 cells) to estimate the bound fraction, do that 100 times for each sample size, how bad the variation is compared to if we take all 243 cells. This will be a good estimation of how many cells we need to pick. Certainly, small number of cells gives smaller number of total trajectories and if we draw large number of trajectories from them (such as n=6400) it will be over-sampled. Our result shows that when we pick as many as 60 cells, the difference of estimated bound fraction from these 60 cells compared to when estimated from all 243 cells can be less than 5% when sampling more than 800 trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, middle; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>Third, since different replicates were performed on different days, we use day as the unit to group trajectories. We randomly picked 1 day (i.e. 1 replicate), combined all trajectories from Halo-HIF-2α KIN clone A31 from that day, which normally is ~20 cells, and use this mixture of trajectories for sampling. This way, we can compare how variable our estimation will be from replicate to replicate. Indeed 1 replicate is not good enough to give good estimation as the variation is still high even if we sample large number of trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right). However, if we randomly pick 3 days instead of 1, we reduce the variance, and the estimated bound fraction from these 3 days compared to when estimated from all 243 cells from 11 days can be less than 5% when sampling more than 800 trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>From our bootstrapping results, we think an estimation of bound fraction from 3 replicates with 20 cells each replicate (and usually we can collect total more than 2500 trajectories from 3 replicates) can be good enough, at least for comparing different conditions such as WT versus mutants, where a difference of 10% bound fraction was usually observed.</p></sec></app><app id="appendix-2"><title>Appendix 2</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Using fluorescence intensity as approximation for protein expression level</title><p>Since we have shown that stoichiometry may affect protein behavior, to compare the molecular dynamics across different HIF-α forms that were exogenously expressed, it is important to control for similar expression levels. Unfortunately, we observed variegated expression levels with the same L30 promoter even with stable cell lines. As a result, for exogenously expressed Halo-proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we used fluorescence intensity as approximation for protein expression levels to guide our selection of which cell to image.</p><p>During imaging, cells were doubly labeled – one channel with excess JFX549 dye, which was used for localizing cells and define ROI, the other channel with limited JFX646 dye for fSPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The expression level for the Halo-tagged protein can be estimated by looking at fluorescence intensity from the JFX549 channel. Since we do not perform any bleaching before collecting SPT movies, the initial localization density (i.e. average number of molecules detected per ROI in the first 10 frames of the tracking experiment) from the JFX646 channel can also reflect the concentration of Halo-tagged proteins. Because first, for quantification of initial localization density, we only averaged the first 10 frames of each movie (corresponding to the first 50 ms) so that impact from photobleaching is neglectable, and second, with our fast-acquisition rate, we are capturing all molecules in the focal plane, including the fastest-moving population.</p><p>For Halo-HIF-1β and Halo-HIF-2α KIN lines, because the endogenous HIF-1β expresses at a much higher concentration than HIF-2α, when cells were fully labeled with JFX549, the fluorescence level for Halo-HIF-1β KIN cells were much higher than Halo-HIF-2α KIN cells. Similarly, when stained with same concentration of JFX646 for these two cell lines, the overall Halo-HIF-1β localization density was much higher compared to Halo-HIF-2α, consistent with much higher expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, for SPT, a low localization density is needed to minimize tracking error. To keep localization density low, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Halo-HIF-1β had to be stained at ~1/10 of the JFX646 concentration used for Halo-HIF-2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, 0.3125 or 0.625 nM instead of 5 nM) to achieve ideal localization density that is similar to Halo-HIF-2α (orange dots). This shows that for different expression levels, an order-of-magnitude difference in dye concentration needs to be used to get similar localization density. In addition, we found that while 5 nM gives very high localization density, when stained at a low concentration within a factor of 2 (0.3125 versus 0.625 nM), the resulting localization density for Halo-HIF-1β was also roughly the same. This shows that with similar dye concentration (within a factor of 2), localization density can be a rough approximation for protein levels.</p><p>We then utilize the localization density as a quality control for experiments where expression level needs to be kept similarly. For the L30-driven Halo-HIF-α expression, the variation of expression level is big from cell to cell and we are able to find cells with similar expression levels (close to endogenous) across different HIF-α variants. Thus, we used the JFX549 channel to pick cells with similar fluorescence intensity (usually the lowest intensity, which is the closest to endogenous expression level) for imaging, after cells were fully labeled with JFX549. Because these cells were also stained with similar level of JFX646 dye for fSPT when a set of experiments with multiple conditions were compared, cells picked for similar JFX549 intensity usually have similar localization densities in the JFX646 channel. As confirmed by quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>, we did have within twofold differences in localization density for different conditions in each set of experiments performed, indicating that for each comparison, the expression level across different conditions were kept roughly similar.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75064.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>Editor's evaluation</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Daniel R</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><related-object id="sa0ro1" object-id-type="id" object-id="10.1101/2021.10.27.466110" link-type="continued-by" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.27.466110"/></front-stub><body><p>This work on dissecting the function of transcription factors using single-molecule methods is likely to appeal to the broad <italic>eLife</italic> readership and the gene regulation community at large.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David M Suter (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As you can see below, there was broad enthusiasm for the single-molecule imaging approach for uncoupling DNA binding domains and trans-activation domains. However, there was also a consensus that the key potential advance of this paper is connecting reaction diffusion kinetics to the specificity of DNA binding. Yet, the specificity aspect, although given as a primary motivation, is not adequately established experimentally. Such data are essential to include in a revision.</p><p>2) Analysis of single-molecule tracking data is central to the claims, and there were a number of concerns raised by each referee about the choice of algorithms, models, use of controls, types of mobility, etc. These issues need to be addressed in detail in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors motivate the work with the fact that different HIF1 isoforms have similar in vitro binding specificity but different biological activity. Yet, they don't ultimately resolve this question or even shed much light on it. For example, nothing in the present analysis says whether the different dimer moieties actually bind different sequences (for example ChIP-seq or in vitro gel shift). As such, the claim of specificity being determined by IDRs is a little oblique. Dynamics are clearly determined by IDRs as the authors nicely show, but the connection back to binding specificity is very indirect. However, this group could easily carry out gel shift binding assays or even single-molecule kinetic assays in vitro to solidify this point.</p><p>2. All the conclusions are essentially reached exclusively through the SPT assay with a new analysis approach that has not yet been peer-reviewed.

When we talk about sequence specificity, we refer to DNA sequence specificity, traditionally validated by <italic>in-vitro</italic> binding experiments. However, inside a living cell, TFs do not bind naked DNA, but rather land on chromatin fibers composed of DNA and various nuclear proteins. It is already known that outside their native chromatin environment HIF-1α and 2α bind to the same DNA sequence (Schödel et al., 2011; Wenger et al., 2005). Even luciferase reporter assays are misleading, as HIF-1α can also activate reporter expression via an EPO enhancer, which only responds to HIF-2α in vivo (Varma and Cohen, 1997; Warnecke et al., 2004; Rankin et al., 2007). Because of the concerns raised by reviewers, we decided to address the specificity question with genomic approaches complementary to SPT measurements in vivo. We thus performed Cut&amp;Run on cells expressing either HIF-1α or -2α isoforms and in parallel analyzed their RNA expression profile. Our new data show that, although by Cut&amp;Run analysis most of the HIF binding sites are shared between 1α and 2α, there are numerous specific subsets of binding sites (and genes) that clearly respond differentially to HIF-1α vs -2α levels. We have also included Cut&amp;Run and RNA-seq results of HIF-α domain-swap variants (HIF-1α/2α or HIF-2α/1α), showing that the IDR indeed contributes to the target specificity of HIF-1α and -2α (Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

As a result, unfortunately, we are not able to reliably estimate the actual off-rate. We have also tried FRAP, but these L30-driven proteins are expressed at very low levels (near background fluorescence level on our Airyscan confocal microscope), which would require substantial optimization to be able to get reliable data.</p><p>As a result, due to technical challenges we would like to hold-off deciding the relative contribution of on- vs off-rates to the bound fraction to speed up publication.
