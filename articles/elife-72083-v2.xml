Deletions of the <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>hrp3</italic> genes result in false-negative tests and are a threat for malaria control. A novel assay for molecular surveillance of <italic>hrp2</italic>/<italic>hrp3</italic> deletions was developed based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The assay quantifies <italic>hrp2</italic>, <italic>hrp3</italic>, and a control gene with very high accuracy. The theoretical limit of detection was 0.33 parasites/µl. The deletion was reliably detected in mixed infections with wild-type and <italic>hrp2</italic>-deleted parasites at a density of &gt;100 parasites/reaction. For a side-by-side comparison with the conventional nested PCR (nPCR) assay, 248 samples were screened in triplicate by ddPCR and nPCR. No deletions were observed by ddPCR, while by nPCR <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion was observed in 8% of samples. The ddPCR assay was applied to screen 830 samples from Kenya, Zanzibar/Tanzania, Ghana, Ethiopia, Brazil, and Ecuador. Pronounced differences in the prevalence of deletions were observed among sites, with more <italic>hrp3</italic> than <italic>hrp2</italic> deletions. In conclusion, the novel ddPCR assay minimizes the risk of false-negative results (i.e., <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion observed when the sample is wild type), increases sensitivity, and greatly reduces the number of reactions that need to be run.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria</kwd><kwd>diagnosis</kwd><kwd>rapid diagnostic test</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI137891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koepfli</surname><given-names>Cristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>D43 TW001505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Guiyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 AI129326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Guiyun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel high-throughput method for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> genotyping will enable malaria control programs to make informed decisions about the best tool to use for the diagnosis of malaria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In 2019, over 200 million cases of malaria and over 400,000 deaths were recorded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">World Health Organisation, 2020</xref>). <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> remains the primary cause of malaria in humans. Fast and accurate diagnosis and treatment of clinical episodes are key components of malaria control. Diagnosis is commonly performed either by light microscopy, or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). RDTs are lateral flow devices that detect parasite proteins in human blood through immunohistochemistry. Light microscopy requires basic lab infrastructure and skilled microscopists. In contrast, RDTs require minimal infrastructure and training, and results are available within approximately 15 min at a cost of less than 1 USD per test. RDTs are the only field-deployable diagnostic tool available at peripheral health centers and for community screening to diagnose asymptomatic infections, for example through reactive case detection (RCD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuck et al., 2020</xref>). In 2016, over 300 million RDTs were used by malaria control programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">WHO, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The most sensitive RDTs for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> rely on the detection of Histidine-Rich Protein 2 (HRP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2017</xref>). HRP2 is a highly expressed secreted protein, and thus an ideal target for diagnosis. It is also the target for a new generation of ultra-sensitive RDTs with a limit of detection of &lt;100 parasites/µl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acquah et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hofmann et al., 2019</xref>). While alternative RDTs detecting other proteins, for example parasite lactase dehydrogenase (pLDH), or aldolase, are available, they are generally less sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">World Health Organisation, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">World Health Organisation, 2018</xref>). HRP2-based RDTs can also detect HRP3, a structurally similar protein sharing multiple epitopes with HRP2.</p><p>In 2010, a report revealed that a large proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in Peru did not carry the <italic>hrp2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamboa et al., 2010</xref>), and thus could not be detected by HRP2-based RDTs. Since then, an increasing number of reports from Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maltha et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sáenz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murillo Solano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorado et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akinyi Okoth et al., 2015</xref>), Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amoah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Menegon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bharti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kumar et al., 2013</xref>), and Asia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pati et al., 2018</xref> found varying proportions of parasites with <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion, reaching up to 80% of clinical cases in certain hospitals in Eritrea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, <italic>hrp3</italic> can be deleted. The deletion of either <italic>hrp2</italic> or <italic>hrp3</italic>, or both genes, has no known impact on parasite fitness. RDTs can yield a positive result if <italic>hrp2</italic> is deleted but <italic>hrp3</italic> is expressed, but the sensitivity of the RDT is lower in this case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Molecular surveillance to assess the frequency of <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>hrp3</italic> deletion is crucial to decide whether HRP2-based RDTs can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). The WHO recommends to use alternative diagnostics if the prevalence of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion is above 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">World Health Organisation, 2016b</xref>). At this level, the number of tests that are false-negative tests because of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion will exceed the number of tests that are false-negative tests because alternative diagnostics offer a lower sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">World Health Organisation, 2016b</xref>). The prevalence of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion has been found to differ substantially within countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murillo Solano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parr et al., 2017</xref>), thus the choice of diagnostics might need to be adapted at subnational level. The feasibility of such approaches depends on the organization of the national control program, barriers to transmission within-country, and other factors. Where low levels of deletions are present, HRP2-based RDTs remain a highly useful tool for diagnosis.</p><p>Deletion screening has been classically done using nested PCR (nPCR) followed by gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). Absence of a band is interpreted as deletion. False-negative results could occur when PCR conditions are suboptimal, or when parasite density is low and amplification is stochastic. To overcome this limitation, threefold repetition of the nested <italic>hrp2</italic> PCR and a control PCR (e.g., <italic>msp2</italic> or <italic>glurp</italic>) is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). As a result, for each sample 12 PCRs need to be run. Deletion status might remain unresolved if results differ among replicates. As an additional problem, multiple clone <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections are common in most endemic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lopez and Koepfli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grignard et al., 2020</xref>). In case of a multiple clone infection with a wild-type parasite and a parasite carrying the deletion, the wild-type parasite will result in a band on the gel when using the nPCR assay. While multiple clone infections will result in a positive RDT (if the density of the wild-type strain is sufficiently high), their presence can mask the presence of deletions, resulting in an underestimation of the frequency of deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocols for <italic>hrp2</italic>/<italic>hrp3</italic> deletion typing were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grignard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreidenweiss et al., 2019</xref>), greatly enhancing throughput. However, when parasite densities are low, considerable variation in quantification is observed between replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koepfli et al., 2016</xref>). While quantification is accurate in the case of clinical samples that are high density, accurate estimates of the population frequency of deletions might require typing of asymptomatic, low-density samples. As a result of the technical challenges for accurate typing, maps of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion frequency remain scattered and incomplete.</p><p>We have developed a novel method for the typing of <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>hrp3</italic> deletions based on droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). ddPCR yields highly accurate quantification of parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koepfli et al., 2016</xref>). In a ddPCR experiment, the reaction volume is partitioned into approximately 15,000 microdroplets, which are then subject to endpoint PCR. Each droplet function as an individual PCR reaction, with amplification occurring if the droplet contains template DNA. ddPCR offers multiple benefits over qPCR for quantification. Template DNA concentration can be derived directly from the number of positive and negative droplets using Poisson statistics. No external standards are required. Quantification is reliable as long as positive and negative droplets are separated, even if amplification is suboptimal, for example in the case of PCR inhibitors. Amplification efficiency, which is crucial for accurate quantification by qPCR, is thus not relevant in a ddPCR experiment. Using two different probes, two targets can be quantified in a single reaction well, for example a control gene and a target gene. Because the target DNA of each assay is partitioned into separate droplets (with the exception of a few droplets partitioned into the same droplet in case of high-density infections), no competition between assays occurs, thus circumventing a common problem of multiplexed qPCR assays. As each droplet with a template can be considered a ‘within-well replicate’, a single well offers the sensitivity and specificity of a large number of replicates by nPCR or qPCR. The risk of false-negative results (i.e., no amplification when the template is present) is thus minimal compared to nPCR or qPCR. A sample negative for <italic>hrp2</italic>/<italic>3</italic> and the control gene (e.g., due to pipetting error) will not be classified as carrying a deletion and will be excluded from any calculations on deletion frequency in a population. The novel assay greatly reduces the number of reactions to be run compared to gel-based assays, showed high sensitivity and accuracy, and can detect the deletion in mixed infections. The assay was extensively validated using culture strains, and field samples from Kenya, Zanzibar/Tanzania, Ethiopia, Ghana, Brazil, and Ecuador.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Assay development and validation</title><p>New primers and probes were developed for ddPCR assays for <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 1, <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 2, <italic>hrp3</italic>, and <italic>tRNA</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

By ddPCR, 235/248 (94.6%) of samples met inclusion criteria of ≥2 droplets positive for <italic>tRNA</italic> in all three replicates. Highly similar quantification among replicates was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Correlation among technical replicates was very high (<italic>n</italic> = 235, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.990). Likewise, for each sample, the highest and lowest value of <italic>tRNA</italic> copies was recorded, and correlation was very high (<italic>n</italic> = 235, <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.991). The coefficient of variation (CV) across the triplicates was calculated. CV was 17.7% for the <italic>hrp2</italic> assay, and 17.1% for the <italic>tRNA</italic> assay. As no deletions were observed in this sample set, highly similar quantification of <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>tRNA</italic> was expected, and CV between <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>tRNA</italic> in the same reaction could be calculated.

Mixtures were prepared at ratios from 0% to 100% Dd2, and at densities of 10–500 parasites/µl. At densities of 200–1000 parasites/reaction, the quantification by ddPCR represented the mixture ratio with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Whenever 40% or more of parasites carried the deletion, the observed ratio was clearly below 100%. In cases where only a small proportion of all parasites carried the deletion (20% Dd2 vs. 80% 3D7), the difference in quantification of <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>tRNA</italic> was too small to observe the deletion. Likewise, at densities of 20 parasites/reaction the ratio did not accurately reflect the experimental mixture.

The novel assay based on ddPCR yielded highly accurate results, and was able to detect mixed infections with wild-type parasites and parasites carrying <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion. The good performance of the assay was shown by typing samples from six countries. The samples reflected a range of parasite densities, from low-density asymptomatic infections to high-density clinical infections, and sites represented a range in the frequency of <italic>hrp2</italic> and/or <italic>hrp3</italic> deletions. Across over 800 field samples screened, &lt;10 samples needed to be repeated because of poor separation between negative and positive droplets, or failure of droplet generation.</p><p>The assay can be used to screen samples for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity based on the result for <italic>tRNA</italic>, and <italic>hrp2</italic> or <italic>hrp3</italic> deletion in a single assay. Alternatively, it can be used to type samples prior determined <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positive by microscopy or another molecular assay. High sensitivity is required for accurate typing of low-density infections. We validated a threshold of two droplets positive for <italic>tRNA</italic> as the limit of detection. When 9 µl of DNA are used as template, this results in a theoretical limit of detection of 0.33 parasites/µl. Sensitivity can be further increased by concentrating the DNA prior to typing.</p><p>The ddPCR assay showed increased sensitivity and specificity to type low-density infections compared to nPCR. Out of 248 asymptomatic samples from western Kenya, 95% could be analyzed by ddPCR, but only 85% by nPCR. More importantly, results on deletion status differed substantially. By ddPCR, no deletions were observed. By nPCR, no band was observed for <italic>hrp2</italic> in 8% of samples that had a positive band for the control gene (<italic>msp2</italic>) in all three replicates. Thus, the frequency of deletion was above the 5% threshold, and it would be erroneously recommended to discontinue the use of HRP2-based RDTs. The frequency of deletion by nPCR was similar to a previous study conducted in a nearby site in western Kenya that found <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion in 8/89 samples using nPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beshir et al., 2017</xref>). The direct comparison of ddPCR and nPCR in a large number of samples points to a possible overestimation of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion frequency by studies relying on nPCR. Further systematic comparison with qPCR-based assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grignard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreidenweiss et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schindler et al., 2019</xref>) will be required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each assay.</p><p>In almost all transmission settings, polyclonal <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections are frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lopez and Koepfli, 2021</xref>). Using a gel-based assay for deletion typing, in a mixed infection with a wild-type parasite and a parasite carrying a deletion, the wild-type parasite will produce a band and mask the deletion. These infections can be detected by RDT, but depending on the proportion of polyclonal infections, they can result in pronounced underestimation of the true frequency of deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Watson et al., 2019</xref>). The highly accurate quantification by ddPCR allows detection of mixed infections. Based on experimental mixtures of 3D7 and Dd2, and field samples, mixed infections were reliably detected when at least 40% of parasites carried the deletion, and at densities above 100 parasites per reaction. Using a well-working qPCR assay with an amplification efficacy of 100%, a similar difference between <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>tRNA</italic> copy numbers would result in less than half a cycle difference. This is within the normal variation of technical replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koepfli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hindson et al., 2013</xref>), and thus such mixed infections could not be detected by qPCR.</p><p>Twenty-nine samples from Zanzibar and 16 from Ghana had tested negative by HRP2-based RDT despite high density of 100 to &gt;10,000 parasites/µl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stuck et al., 2020</xref>), yet no <italic>hrp2</italic> deletions were observed in these populations. False-negative RDT results might be caused due to incorrect handling, prozone effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gillet et al., 2009</xref>), or sequence variation without deletion of the <italic>hrp2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nderu et al., 2019</xref>). The finding corroborates the importance of molecular typing. Studies comparing microscopy and RDT results can give important clues for the presence of deletions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berhane et al., 2017</xref>), but molecular typing is required for confirmation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Though not reported in the literature, deletion of <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 1 only, but not exon 2, could result in a lack of expression of HRP2. In this scenario, the <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 2 assay would not show any deletion, yet HRP2-based RDTs would show a false-negative result. In this study, no discrepancy was observed between deletion status for <italic>hrp2</italic> exons 1 and 2. Thus, for future surveillance, it is recommended to only type samples for <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 2 and <italic>hrp3</italic>. In case of negative RDTs despite no <italic>hrp2</italic> exon 2 deletion, typing for exon 1 can be done.</p><p>No <italic>hrp2</italic> deletions were found in Zanzibar, and Kenya, and one mixed infection in Ghana. The data from Ghana contrasts an earlier study that reported a frequency of deletion of &gt;30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Amoah et al., 2016</xref>). A single <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion was found in southwestern Ethiopia. This is in stark contrast to very high levels of deletion in western Ethiopia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alemayehu et al., 2021</xref>), Eritrea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>), and Sudan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prosser et al., 2021</xref>). The results corroborate the need for studies assessing <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion and selection of diagnostic tools at subnational level.</p><p>Contrasting findings were obtained from the sample sets from South America, with very high levels of deletion in Brazil, and no deletions in Ecuador. Brazil and Ecuador share no borders, and the amount of human migration is limited. The results add to the heterogeneous pattern of <italic>hrp2</italic>/<italic>hrp3</italic> deletion in South America, with high frequency of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion in the Amazon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamboa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murillo Solano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Góes et al., 2020</xref>), but low levels among the Pacific coast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sáenz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Murillo Solano et al., 2015</xref>). An outbreak of parasites with <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion at the Peruvian Pacific coast was caused by infections imported from the Amazon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldeviano et al., 2015</xref>). Brazil is committed to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> elimination, and the samples typed originated from the main hotspot of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferreira and Castro, 2016</xref>). RDTs remain relatively little used in Brazil. Microscopy remains the diagnostic method of choice, and RDTs are mostly used in remote areas, for example, populations from Amerindian Reserves and some traditional riverine communities with no access to conventional microscopy. The frequency of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion in Brazil clearly exceeds the 5% threshold, thus it is recommended that no HRP2-based RDTs are used.</p><p>To determine whether the frequency of the deletion exceeds the threshold of 5%, the WHO recommends systematic surveillance and typing of a minimum of 370 per site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). Limitations of the molecular assays available for typing have been a major hindrance to type that number of samples in many sites where <italic>hrp2</italic> or <italic>hrp3</italic> deletion is suspected. Even a low proportion of false-negative results could impact the decision to discontinue HRP2-based RDTs. As a result of the scarcity of field data, the spatiotemporal dynamics of <italic>hrp2</italic> deletion in parasite populations, drivers of the deletion, potential fitness costs, and clinical consequences remain poorly understood. Results from simulation studies suggest that the use of <italic>hrp2</italic>-based RDTs selects for <italic>hrp2</italic>-negative parasites, in particular, if transmission levels are low and a large proportion of all infections turn clinical and result in treatment seeking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gatton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). While digital PCR is less common than nPCR or qPCR, it has been successfully established in malaria-endemic countries. The assay is run in 96-well format; thus throughput is comparable to qPCR, and assay setup is similarly straightforward. While costs of digital PCR instruments and reagents are moderately higher than for qPCR, they have declined recently.</p><p>In conclusion, the novel, high-throughput, highly sensitive and specific ddPCR assay will facilitate molecular surveillance for <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>hrp3</italic> deletion, and thus aid the selection of diagnostic tests to accelerate malaria control and elimination.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Bavesh Kana as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall, there are concerns regards assay robustness and reliability, further details below:</p><p>1. The assay was designed without an internal (human DNA) control. The absence of internal control makes it difficult to decide whether a negative result is true negative or invalid due to error in DNA extraction, pipetting or a poor sample.</p><p>2. In the methods section, the authors mentioned the development of four novel ddPCR assays but they have only shown the validation of hrp2 exon2 and tRNA assays in the result section. Figure 1 only shows the performance of hrp2 exon2 and tRNA assays but not hrp2 exon1 and hrp3.</p><p>3. The authors used a &quot;wide range&quot; of parasite densities to optimise and assess the reproducibility of the assays. It is not clear what this range is and the data for reproducibility (variation within replicates) such as STD and CV are missing.</p><p>4. It is not clear why data for repeatability (assay variation between replicates) is not shown.</p><p>5. The accuracy of detection of hrp2 clones in polyclonal infection using ddPCR was not validated by any other method – e.g genome sequencing coverage, qPCR etc. This is important to determine if the test if truly fit for purpose.</p><p>6. The authors used absolute quantification to measure DNA for both hrp and tRNA, and then used ratio between the two DNA concentrations to determine hrp2 deletion clone in polyclonal infections. This approach assumes that the amplification efficiency for both assays (hrp and tRNA) is the same or similar, but no data has been presented to show this is the case. This is essential to demonstrate.</p><p>Other comments that must be addressed:</p><p>1. It is unclear why the authors did not compare the ddPCR against the recently described multiplex qPCR assay approaches. There are three qPCR methods that have been recently published and already deployed in field studies and it is essential that the performance of ddPCR is compared against the qPCR methods, including scalability, ease of use, cost and accessibility, particularly in in resource limited laboratories in endemic countries. The authors should include this in the discussion.</p><p>2. Line 80-82: reference is missing.</p><p>3. Line 82-84: is it practical to introduce a change in diagnosis policy at sub-national level? Pfhrp2/3-deleted parasites can spread within a country due to test-and-treat policy using HRP2-based RDTs and therefore it is a matter of time before they spread.</p><p>4. Line 95: pfhrp2/3 deletions in multiclonal infections were previously reported (Sepulveda et al. 2018) and reference should be included and the authors need to discuss why their methods is better.</p><p>5. Line 96-97: Two more qPCR-based assays for the detection of pfhrp2/3 have been published (Lingard et al. 2020 and Kreidenweiss et al., 2019) with comparable sensitivity and good reproducibility, and the authors need to discuss why their assay is better.</p><p>6. Line 97-98: It is not clear why the authors suggested quantification is an issue for pfhrp2/3 deletions genotyping. Most HRP2-based RDTs detect as low as 200 parasites per microliter and this parasite density can be accurately detected and quantified using qPCR. The authors need to clarify the issue of pfhrp2/3 deletions genotyping with respect to quantification accuracy.</p><p>7. 107-110: This claim was not backed up by data.</p><p>8. Line 123: Provide information about which part of exon the hrp3 primers amplify.</p><p>9. Line 124: The authors say &quot;Upon optimisation of the assay conditions&quot; – where is the data for assay optimisation?</p><p>10. Line 125: The authors mention a wide range of parasite densities but no specific numbers were given.</p><p>11. Line 128: Figure 1 – how many parasites per microliter is medium and low density? It is not clear whether the hrp2 assay is based on exon 1 or exon 2. Figure for hrp3 in difference parasite density is also missing.</p><p>12. Line 160: How do the authors came up with the 0.33 parasites per microliter?</p><p>13. Line 138: Are the 248 samples from Kenya cultured? Otherwise, they should be referred to just as samples rather than isolates.</p><p>14. Line 138: The authors used asymptomatic carriers in Kenya to evaluate the reproducibility and limit of detection. Reproducibility and limit of detection are usually conducted using a dilution of a DNA sample with known concentration. The Kenyan samples should be used for validation of the ddPCR assays. In fact, the authors correctly referred the data in figure 2 as &quot;validation&quot;. How were the genome copies measured for the Kenyan samples originally and what method was used to quantify them?</p><p>15. Line 139-140: most pfhrp2/3 genotyping assays (nPCR and qPCR) are evaluated based on parasite density (parasites per microliter) and it is difficult to compare ddPCR performance if the parameter is genomes per microliter. The authors need to either use parasite density throughout the manuscript or include a genome to parasite density conversion formula in the analysis section of the methods.</p><p>16. Line 139: again the validation was for hrp2 exon-2 and the validation for hrp2 exon-1 and hrp3 are missing.</p><p>17. Line 164: For validating deletions in mixed clones the authors used parasite culture lines 3D7 and Dd2. Why have not the authors used the same parasite lines to assess the reproducibility, repeatability and limit of detection of all individual assays (hrp2 exon-1, exon2, hrp3 and tRNA)?</p><p>18. Line 164: Clone mixture was done for hrp2 but not for tRNA and hrp3. Since identification of hrp2/3-deleted clone in a multiclonal infection is relative to tRNA detection of mixture should also be validated using tRNA assay.</p><p>19. Line 270: not clear how 0.33 parasites per microliter is determined.</p><p>20. Line 293: This depends whether the quantification is relative or absolute. In a relative quantification, both targets with similar amplification efficiency are expected to have similar variation of technical replicates and therefore not affecting the mean cycle/quantification threshold value.

In qPCR assay published by Grignard et al. 2020, hrp2 reverse primer with three nucleotide differences amplifies hrp3 and the authors introduced a deliberate mutation at the 3’ end to increase specificity.

Regards assay optimisation, the authors used 1.3-49,000 parasites per microliter for assay optimisation/validation but the data has not been shown in the figures cited. The figures for the mixed dilution between 20-1000 (for the mixtures) show that at 20 parasite per reaction (3D7 at 100% or below) there is significant variation and it is not clear how 1.3 parasites per microliter (or as claimed in the abstract 0.33 parasites per microliter) be detected with greater confidence. Since 2 microliter of DNA was added per reaction the minimum parasite per microliter used is 10. The authors need to clarify this.</p><p>5.

Line 139-140: most pfhrp2/3 genotyping assays (nPCR and qPCR) are evaluated based on parasite density (parasites per microliter) and it is difficult to compare ddPCR performance if the parameter is genomes per microliter.

To clarify, we have changed the text according to the reviewer’s recommendation and now always refer to ‘parasites/µL’. It is, however, important to remember that there are caveats with this term. Many authors refer to ‘parasite density’, meaning the number of genomes they encounter in extracted DNA, without any control for the amount of DNA lost during extraction. Depending on whether extraction is done from whole blood or filter papers, the volume of blood used for extraction, etc., DNA concentration from the same sample can differ &gt;10-fold (this data stems from a manuscript on a systematic comparison we currently have under review).</p><p>We have clarified this in the methods (lines 477 – 481):</p><p>“Data is reported as parasites/µL, representing the number of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> genomes per µL eluted DNA.

As a result, the conversion from parasites per µL blood to genomes per µL eluted DNA differs among sample sets. For the present study, these differences are not relevant, as for the validation of PCR assays, the number of genomes per µL input DNA is crucial.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16.

In this study, no discrepancy was observed between deletion status for hrp2 exons 1 and 2. Thus, for future surveillance, it is recommended to only type samples for hrp2 exon 2 and hrp3.

It is, however, challenging to control for the sensitivity of the <italic>hrp2</italic> and control assays. In the case of nPCR, assays are run in separate tubes, and while a low density sample might result in a band for hrp2, it might not amplify the control gene (as observed in our data from Kenya). In a multiplexed qPCR, slightly different amplification efficiencies of the two assays might result in a positive curve for <italic>hrp2</italic> only, but not the control gene. As explained above, amplification efficiency is not relevant for ddPCR. A wild type sample will always result in positive droplets for <italic>hrp2</italic> and the control gene. The only exception is if parasite density is so low that only DNA templates of one target is added to the PCR.

In response to the absence of internal control (human gene), the authors argue that the assay was not designed to confirm <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity, rather it was designed to determine hrp2/3 status in P.f positive samples. The authors do not mention which assay was used to detect and quantify Pf of the clinical samples – this needs to be clarified in the methods section, including which qPCR method was used. Adding additional assays to determine the Pf positivity before detecting deletion using current assay will undoubtedly complicate the deletion calling process. Any error introduced during the first assay ( to determine Pf positivity) will affect the determination of deletion frequency (under or over estimate) depending how good the assay is.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is incorrect that another assay is required prior to the hrp2/tRNA assay to determine <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity. Our statement refers to the fact that we are not aware of any study that applied hrp2 deletion typing without any prior step to determine <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity, either by microscopy or another PCR assay. If preferred by a researcher, our assay can easily be applied to screen samples for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and hrp2 deletion at the same time. Of note, none of the frequently used molecular assays (PCR, LAMP, etc.) to determine <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity includes a human control. Thus, as with any other assay, if DNA is lost or degraded during extraction, the sample will come up negative (see below for an explanation that this will NOT impact estimates of deletion frequency).</p><p>We have clarified this on lines 257-259:</p><p>“The assay can be used to screen samples for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positivity based on the result for <italic>tRNA</italic>, and <italic>hrp2</italic> or <italic>hrp3</italic> deletion in a single assay. Alternatively, it can be used to type samples prior determined <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positive by microscopy or another molecular assay.”</p><p>We have added the qPCR for the samples we have screened ourselves to the methods (lines 392-393):</p><p>“Samples were determined <italic>P. falciparum</italic> positive either by microscopy (Brazil, Ecuador), 18S qPCR [50] (Ethiopia), or varATS qPCR [51] (Zanzibar, Kenya, Ghana).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors acknowledged this weakness and included a sentence &quot;A sample negative for hrp2/3 and the control gene (e.g. due to pipetting error) will not be classified as carrying a deletion, and will be excluded from any calculations on deletion frequency in a population&quot;. If samples negative for both genes are excluded this will under or overestimate frequency estimation. Have the authors encountered such cases? how did they resolve the issue and what was the percentage of the excluded?</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree, this is a strength, not a weakness. As a reminder, a frequency is calculated as ‘nominator/denominator’. The nominator are all samples lacking hrp2, while the denominator are all samples successfully typed (i.e. positive droplets are seen for tRNA). If a sample is negative, it will be removed from the analysis, i.e. it will not appear either in the nominator nor denominator. Thus, this case will decrease the number of samples typed, but not the proportion.</p><p>The reviewer can easily find such cases in our data from Kenya. As described in lines 142-146, we tested the assay on 248 low-density samples in triplicate. Typing was successful in 235/248 samples; thus all frequency calculations were based on a total of n=235 (we did not find deletion in this sample set, but would still make the same calculations if we did).</p><p>Now, compare this to a gel-based (nPCR) assay or a qPCR assay where hrp2 and a control gene are typed in separate wells. In case of a pipetting error (i.e. no DNA added to the hrp2 assay), only the control gene might come up positive. Such a sample would wrongly be classified as hrp2 deletion. Our side-by-side comparison of the nPCR to ddPCR has revealed many such cases using the nPCR, resulting in a wrong estimate of hrp2 deletion frequency. The weakness clearly</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The dependence for parasite positivity on a different assay prior to using the current ddPCR assay will be a major weakness of the ddPCR assay compared to other qPCR assays that has incorporated parasite detection and quantification within the multiplex assay.The authers need to acknowledge this in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is wrong and there seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding what digital PCR is. There is NO need for another assay prior to our tRNA/hrp2 assay. Both assays are specific for <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. ddPCR is as specific as any other type of PCR. If a sample is negative, no signal will be observed and the samples will be deemed negative. We do not understand where this comment comes from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Regards assay optimisation, the authors used 1.3-49,000 parasites per microliter for assay optimisation/validation but the data has not been shown in the figures cited. The figures for the mixed dilution between 20-1000 (for the mixtures) show that at 20 parasite per reaction (3D7 at 100% or below) there is significant variation and it is not clear how 1.3 parasites per microliter (or as claimed in the abstract 0.33 parasites per microliter) be detected with greater confidence. Since 2 microliter of DNA was added per reaction the minimum parasite per microliter used is 10. The authors need to clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>The 1.3 parasites/uL (or 0.33 parasites/uL) refer to the limit of detection. The 20 parasites/uL refer to the limit of quantification. We have clarified this in the abstract (line 40);</p><p>“The deletion was reliably detected in mixed infections with wild-type and <italic>hrp2</italic>-deleted parasites at a density of &gt;100 parasites/reaction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors added the requested STDs and CVs for each assay and the CVs look very high for an assay where accuracy was supposed to be a unique selling point. Do the assays need further optimisation to decrease the CVs or the authors need to acknowledge that the limit of detection with greater accuracy (example 3% CV) is higher than they have reported?</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree that the CVs are high. We like to remind the reviewer that we typed low-density, asymptomatic samples where variation in quantification is higher. In fact, such data is usually highly heteroscedastic, as seen in Figure 3. The variation increases fast with lower density and this effect is not fully corrected for by the formula for the CV. This effect is evident when calculating the CV only for samples at a density of &gt;100 parasites/uL. At this density the CV decreases to 11% for the replicates, and to 3-5% for the intra-well comparison (i.e. hrp2 vs. tRNA).</p><p>The lower CV within a well than among replicates nicely shows that at lower densities, the major source of variation comes from adding slightly different numbers of template into each replicate just by chance. Maybe this could be further minimized using a pipetting robot, which we have not tested. We are not aware of any molecular assay were a CV of 3% can be achieved at low density.</p><p>We have added this to the manuscript (lines 152-156):</p><p>“CV was lower among samples of a higher density of &gt;100 parasites/µL (n=126) at 11.5% for hrp2 assay, 10.1% for the tRNA assay, and 4.7% for the within-well <italic>hrp2</italic>/<italic>tRNA</italic> comparison (n=126). The lower CV within wells than among replicates shows that variation in pipetting, resulting slightly different numbers of template added to each replicate reaction, is the main source of variation, while within-well quantification of <italic>hrp2</italic> and <italic>tRNA</italic> is highly accurate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Detection of hrp2/3 deletion in polyclonal infection is the unique selling point of the ddPCR assay and the authors need to compare the accuracy with other available tools such as qPCR (reference 29 and 31) and genome sequencing (based on coverage difference). If this is not possible, the authors need to acknowledge this weakness in the discussion. The authors rightly pointed out qPCR is generally less accurate (in detecting minor clones) than ddPCR, and the authors have a good opportunity to show that their ddPCR is better than the published qPCR assays in detecting minor clones using data in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not agree that this is the unique selling point. We present a very robust method for deletion typing, that we have meanwhile used for hundreds additional samples for follow up studies (see e.g. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.26.22274317v1 and https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.13.22273827v1). We are in the process of establishing this method in reference laboratories in endemic countries. We do not claim it is the only method that can be used, but we are convinced we present a very useful additional tool for deletion typing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
