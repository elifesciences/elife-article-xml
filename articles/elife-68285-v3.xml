focused on a few laboratory strains. Much less is known about the phenotypic effects of natural variation within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>’s DNA repair pathways. Here, we use natural polymorphisms to detect historical mutation spectrum differences among several wild and domesticated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains. To determine whether these differences are likely caused by genetic mutation rate modifiers, we use a modified fluctuation assay with a <italic>CAN1</italic> reporter to measure de novo mutation rates and spectra in 16 of the analyzed strains. We measure a 10-fold range of mutation rates and identify two strains with distinctive mutation spectra. These strains, known as AEQ and AAR, come from the panel’s ‘Mosaic beer’ clade and share an enrichment for C &gt; A mutations that is also observed in rare variation segregating throughout the genomes of several Mosaic beer and Mixed origin strains. Both AEQ and AAR are haploid derivatives of the diploid natural isolate CBS 1782, whose rare polymorphisms are enriched for C &gt; A as well, suggesting that the underlying mutator allele is likely active in nature. We use a plasmid complementation test to show that AAR and AEQ share a mutator allele in the DNA repair gene <italic>OGG1</italic>, which excises 8-oxoguanine lesions that can cause C &gt; A mutations if left unrepaired.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mutation rate</kwd><kwd>mutation spectrum</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>mutator phenotype</kwd><kwd>genetic variation</kwd><kwd>reporter assay</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM133428-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kelley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41GM103533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dunham</surname><given-names>Maitreya J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM118854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Herr</surname><given-names>Alan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kelley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kelley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kelley</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

At the molecular level, they usually arise as a spontaneous consequence of DNA replication errors or damage and are the ultimate cause of genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sebat et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Antonarakis and Beckmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crow, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nei, 1983</xref>). All organisms have evolved complex mechanisms for keeping mutation rates low and safeguarding their genetic information as it is passed from generation to generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beckman and Loeb, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eisen and Hanawalt, 1999</xref>); in multicellular organisms, these mechanisms also safeguard somatic tissues from mutations that can cause cancer and age-related decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexandrov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Loeb, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Risques and Kennedy, 2018</xref>). A low mutation rate is essential for long-term population survival, and the larger and more complex a genome is, the lower the mutation rate must be to prevent deleterious mutations from arising faster than natural selection can eliminate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eigen, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Drake, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sung et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta et al., 2015</xref>). Over long time scales, however, mutations also serve as the raw material for evolution. Although beneficial mutations are rare occurrences, they are essential for the acquisition of novel phenotypes and adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gompel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McGregor et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>A large body of theory has been written to describe how natural selection might act on the mutation rate to balance these beneficial and deleterious effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sturtevant, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kimura, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leigh,, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">André and Godelle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sung et al., 2012a</xref>). One prediction is that organisms living in more changeable environments might evolve higher mutation rates than organisms living in more stable environments, assuming that the environment determines whether a higher rate of beneficial mutations is likely to counterbalance a higher rate of deleterious mutations. This prediction has been borne out in laboratory evolution experiments, where mutator phenotypes sometimes emerge in populations that are forced to tolerate challenging conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Good et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tenaillon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Couce et al., 2017</xref>) and mutator strains are often observed to take over chemostat populations by producing beneficial mutations at a higher rate than competing non-mutator strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chao and Cox, 1983</xref>). Many mutator phenotypes in <italic>E. coli</italic> have been linked to defects in DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Horst et al., 1999</xref>). Mutator phenotypes also commonly occur in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Loeb, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prindle et al., 2010</xref>), likely either because of relaxed selection against cellular dysfunction or because it is beneficial for cancer cells to adapt rapidly to their aggressive growth niche. However, it is less clear how much mutation rate variation exists within and between natural populations, and if such variation exists, whether it is maintained by natural selection. The drift barrier hypothesis predicts that mutator alleles will usually be deleterious because they produce more damaging mutations than beneficial ones, but that mutator alleles with relatively small effects may persist in populations because they are not deleterious enough to be efficiently eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lynch et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although next-generation sequencing has rapidly increased our ability to measure the genetic variation that currently exists within populations, the extent of mutation rate variation is still more difficult and expensive to measure. One of the original methods for measuring mutation rates is the Luria-Delbrück fluctuation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>), in which a population of microorganisms is allowed to grow clonally for a controlled length of time, then challenged with a form of artificial selection that kills most cells except for those that have happened to acquire specific resistance mutations. The mutation rate can then be calculated from the number of colonies that manage to grow after this artificial selection is imposed.</p><p>Although fluctuation assays are an elegant and efficient way for measuring the mutation rates of specific reporter genes, the results are potentially sensitive to the reporter gene being used and where it is located within the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lang and Murray, 2011</xref>); in addition, they are not applicable to multicellular organisms. These drawbacks have motivated the development of newer methods that take advantage of high-throughput sequencing, such as mutation accumulation (MA) assays in which a laboratory population is serially bottlenecked for many generations, eliminating most effects of natural selection and allowing mutations to be directly counted by sequencing at the end of the experiment. MA studies have been used to estimate mutation rates in a wide variety of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lynch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Farlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keightley et al., 2009</xref>), including a recent study of nine heterozygous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dutta et al., 2021</xref>). However, higher throughput MA experiments require DNA repair genes to be knocked out to induce higher mutation rates that can be accurately measured with fewer generations of labor-intensive propagation, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Zhang, 2021</xref>.</p><p>An alternative source of information about mutational processes in strains with low mutation rates is genetic variation among related individuals who share common ancestors. Polymorphic sites are easier and cheaper to discover than new mutations, because they are present at a higher density within the genome and often shared among several individuals. Mining polymorphisms for information about mutation rates can be difficult since their abundance is affected by genetic drift and natural selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scally and Durbin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ségurel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), but despite these limitations, they have provided surprisingly strong evidence for the existence of historical changes to the mutation spectrum, meaning the tendency of mutations to occur most often in certain nucleotide contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hwang and Green, 2004</xref>). In humans, for example, Europeans and South Asians have a significantly higher proportion of TCC&gt; TTC mutations than other human groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Pritchard, 2017</xref>), a pattern that is difficult to explain without a recent population-specific increase in the rate of this type of mutation. This pattern might have been caused by either a genetic mutator or an environmental mutagen, but is not explicable by the action of selection or drift or any other process that simply modulates the retention or loss of genetic variation.</p><p>Polymorphism data has revealed that each human population and great ape species appears to have a distinctive triplet mutation spectrum, which implies that genetic and/or environmental mutators likely emerge relatively often and act within localized populations to increase mutation rates in specific sequence contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Pritchard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Harris, 2021</xref>). However, identifying these hypothetical mutators is a challenging proposition, not least because some population-specific signatures such as the human TCC&gt; TTC enrichment appear to be relics of mutators that are no longer active. A recent study of de novo mutations in diverse human families found some evidence of mutation rate variation between human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kessler et al., 2020</xref>), but argued that most of this variation was driven by the environment rather than genetics. Given that humans from different populations tend to be born and raised in different environments, it is extremely challenging to determine the degree to which genetics and/or the environment are responsible for variation of the rates and spectrum of de novo mutations accumulating within human populations today.</p><p>More is known about the genetic architecture of mutagenesis in model organisms, including the single-celled organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae,</italic> where it is tractable to disentangle genetic mutator effects from environmental ones by accumulating mutations on different genetic backgrounds in controlled laboratory environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Serero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stirling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herr et al., 2011</xref>). Many <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutator alleles have been discovered using genetic screens, which involve creating libraries of artificial mutants in the lab and determining which ones have high mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stirling et al., 2014</xref>). Mutation rates can be elevated by up to a thousand-fold in lines where DNA proofreading and repair capabilities are artificially knocked out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Serero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lang et al., 2013</xref>), and quantitative trait loci with more modest effects have been found to underlie a five-fold range of mutation rate variation among a few natural <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gou et al., 2019</xref>). A more complex mutator phenotype has been observed as a result of epistasis between two incompatible alleles found as natural variation in the mismatch repair genes <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>PMS1</italic>, although the natural isolates in which these alleles are found appear to have acquired compensatory variants that suppress this mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bui et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Argueso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Raghavan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heck et al., 2006</xref>). An extreme case of long-term maintenance of a hypermutation lineage comes from phylogenetic analysis of bipolar budding yeasts <italic>Hanseniaspora</italic> which shows large amounts of gene loss, accelerated evolutionary rates and altered mutation spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Steenwyk et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mild environmental stressors, such as high salt, ethanol, and heat, can also alter the mutation rate of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu and Zhang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Voordeckers et al., 2020</xref>) as well as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Belfield et al., 2021</xref>). The same environmental perturbations can cause detectable changes to both species’ mutation spectra. The mutation spectrum has also been observed to depend on whether <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is replicating in a haploid or diploid state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, environmental mutagens, more complex ploidy, and genetic mutation rate modifiers could all conceivably affect the mutation spectrum of natural variation as it accumulates. However, no study to our knowledge has looked at whether any mutational signatures measured in the laboratory are capable of explaining natural mutation spectrum variation observed in polymorphism data from a model species.</p><p>Recently, comprehensive sampling efforts have produced a collection of 1011 natural isolates of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>). This is a uniquely powerful system containing abundant natural variation that accumulated within diverse environments during the recent and ancient evolution of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and the panel is also amenable for experimental accumulation of mutations over laboratory growth. Many genetic polymorphisms differentiate these strains, and these are relics of mutations that accumulated over many generations on divergent genetic backgrounds adapted to diverse environmental conditions, ranging from forests to beverage fermentation pipelines. Both environmental mutagens and genetic mutators may have created differences among the mutation spectra of these 1011 strains, but only genetically determined mutation spectrum differences should have the potential to be reproduced in the spectra of mutations accumulated in a controlled lab environment.</p><p>We hypothesized that yeast strains with outlying spectra of natural polymorphisms are more likely to have distinct de novo mutation spectra than strains whose polymorphisms have indistinguishable mutation spectra.

To enable such direct testing in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we describe a new Luria-Delbrück-based assay that efficiently measures the spectra of de novo mutations in haploid strains using pooled amplicon sequencing. We then use this assay to identify strains with reproducibly measurable mutator phenotypes that explain the spectrum biases of these strains’ polymorphisms. Some proportion of natural mutation spectrum variation might not be reproducible in the lab if it is driven by environmental mutagens, bioinformatic artifacts, or extinct genetic mutators, but our assay has the potential to identify which gradients of mutation spectrum variance are driven by extant genotypic differences.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The mutation spectrum of natural variation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>To measure the mutation spectrum of genetic variation present in the 1011 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> natural isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>), we polarized single nucleotide polymorphisms using the outgroup <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yue et al., 2017</xref>), then classified them into two transition types and four transversion types based on their ancestral and derived alleles.

In contrast, PC2 separates the majority of other populations, such as human-associated strains isolated from wine, dairy, and bioethanol production, along a gradient of varying transition/transversion ratio.</p><p>Although strains from the same population tend to cluster together, this trend is less pronounced in the 1,011 <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomes than in previously reported mutation spectrum PCAs of humans, great apes, and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Pritchard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dumont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Harris, 2021</xref>). That being said, one methodological difference from these previous studies is that we only partition the yeast mutation spectra into six basic types (A &gt; C, A &gt; G, etc.) rather than the 96 trinucleotide-based types used in analyses of vertebrate mutation spectra, a concession to the small size of the yeast genome. We found that the trinucleotide mutation spectra of yeast exhibit similar PCA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), but that the sparsity of yeast triplet spectra appears to limit their utility.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows a PCA of rare variant mutation spectra from the same collection of strains used in 1 A. We define rare variants as those with derived allele counts of 2, 3, and 4 (423,312 SNPs out of 729,357 fall within this allele count range) and exclude singletons to minimize the impact of sequencing error. These spectra are noisier than the spectra computed from variants up to 50% frequency, but are potentially more likely to reflect recently active mutational processes. While rare variant spectra exhibit less clustering by population than those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, a subset of strains from several groups appear as outliers. For example, a few Mixed origin and Mosaic beer strains are outliers along a C &gt; A mutation gradient, and African beer and French dairy strains separate out along an A &gt; G mutation gradient. For completeness, we also examined mutation spectra of singleton variants alone (Materials and methods), which are the youngest mutations among polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). It resembles the PCA of non-singleton rare variants, except that C &gt; A mutation variation explains a larger fraction of variation and becomes the PC1 axis.</p><p>Several previous studies have found a puzzling discrepancy between the spectra of de novo mutations and polymorphisms in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>: polymorphisms have a transition-to-transversion (ts/tv) ratio around 3:1, compared to only 1:1 for de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agier and Fischer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis of the 1011 strain collection replicates this finding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also replicate the prior finding that singletons and higher frequency variants have nearly identical ts/tv ratios, but that singletons inferred to be young based on their presence on long shared haplotypes have a lower ts/tv ratio somewhat closer to that of new mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We note that a discrepancy between de novo and segregating mutation spectra has also been observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, though in the opposite direction, as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> de novo mutations are surprisingly enriched for C &gt; T transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Weng et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A scalable experimental pipeline for measuring de novo mutation rates and spectra</title><p>In order to test whether any of the mutation spectrum differences evident from natural variation in different <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains are driven by extant genetic mechanisms that increase the rates of specific mutation types, we set out to measure several strains’ de novo mutation spectra and rates experimentally. To this end, we developed an experimental pipeline using the reporter gene <italic>CAN1</italic>. Traditional reporter gene fluctuation assays only estimate the overall rate of mutations, but we introduced an extra step that utilizes Illumina sequencing of pooled amplicons derived from <italic>CAN1</italic> mutants to estimate each strain’s mutation spectrum as well.</p><p>The gene <italic>CAN1</italic> encodes a transport protein that imports arginine and arginine analogs into yeast cells from the surrounding growth media. This means that strains with a functional <italic>CAN1</italic> transporter are sensitive to poisoning by the arginine analog canavanine, while a single loss-of-function mutation can render such cells able to survive on canavanine media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Whelan et al., 1979</xref>). Poisoning a culture with canavanine is thus a very efficient method to select for cells with point mutations in <italic>CAN1</italic>. A limitation of this method is that it only works on genomes that contain exactly one functional copy of <italic>CAN1</italic>, since canavanine resistance is recessive. This means that it cannot be used to measure mutation rates in diploid or polyploid strains directly, which unfortunately include the Taiwanese strains and African beer strains that are PCA outliers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. However, 133 of the 1011 strains are haploid, leaving many strains of interest that are amenable to the assay, including several outliers in the rare variant PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>A schematic overview of our experimental setup is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. First, we estimated mutation rates using established fluctuation assay methodology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gou et al., 2019</xref>), which involves plating multiple independent cultures from each strain being investigated. After plating, we picked a single colony from each plated culture and grew it to saturation in canavanine-containing media. We then selected mutants observed to grow in culture to similar saturation density and pooled them in equal proportions to give each mutant a roughly equal frequency in the pool. Individual pools of mutants from each strain were then subjected to PCR amplification of <italic>CAN1</italic> followed by Illumina sequencing. Individual mutants were called from the sequencing pools using a customized pipeline (Materials and methods). Mutations collected from different pools of the same strain were combined to calculate the strain’s mutation spectrum. We aimed to collect roughly 300 mutants per strain, enough to detect mutation spectrum differences of the magnitude estimated from polymorphism data in several of the 1011 genomes populations.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic overview of the experimental pipeline.</title><p>Overview of the experimental pipeline used to estimate the mutation rate and spectrum for each strain using the reporter gene <italic>CAN1</italic>.

However, pooling too many mutants during this step could have the potential to compromise the pipeline’s accuracy by putting the frequency of each mutation too close to the expected frequency of Illumina sequencing errors. To test for this failure mode, we Sanger-sequenced 38 independent mutants generated using the lab strain LCTL1 (SEY6211-MATɑ). After pooling these 38 mutants, we performed two replicate library preps and Illumina-sequenced both using our standard procedure. Sanger sequencing identified 37 mutants with single nucleotide mutations plus one containing two adjacent mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We expect each of these mutations, which should be present at a frequency of about 1/38 in the pooled culture, to be easily distinguishable from Illumina sequencing errors that occur at a rate of less than 1% per base.</p><p>To identify bona fide mutations from each Illumina sequencing pool, we developed a pipeline designed to call mutations present at or above an expected frequency that is inversely proportional to the number of mutants being pooled. In order to minimize false positive mutation calls introduced by sequencing errors, we excluded low coverage regions located at the ends of the amplicons (Materials and Methods). We also identified multinucleotide mutations (MNMs) based on the co-occurrence of variation on the same reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Averof et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schrider et al., 2011</xref>), separating these complex mutations from single base substitutions and small indels. When we tested this Illumina sequencing pipeline on the same mutant pool (~17,000x coverage) that we had previously Sanger sequenced, we detected 37 of the 38 mutations identified by Sanger sequencing, missing only one mutation that occurred at the end of the amplicon located outside our pipeline’s callable region. A second Illumina sequencing replicate measured only 36 of these mutations, missing one additional true mutation. Neither Illumina replicate produced any false positives, verifying that the pipeline is accurate enough to permit pooling of up to 40 <italic>CAN1</italic> mutants before each library prep.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutation rate variation among haploid natural isolates</title><p>We used our pipeline to measure mutation rates and spectra in 16 haploid strains from a wide variety of environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

We also selected two lab strains, LCTL1 and LCTL2, to use as controls, since their mutation rates were previously measured: the mutation rate of LCTL1 was measured using a genome-wide mutation accumulation assay by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp et al., 2018</xref>, while the mutation rate of LCTL2 (GIL 104, a derivative of W303) was measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref> using a <italic>CAN1</italic> fluctuation assay.

Eighty-five of these hits created the same G &gt; T mutation, while 19 created another G &gt; C mutation. Across all mutations counted with multiplicity, we observed 2676 missense mutations, 1866 nonsense mutations and only 17 synonymous mutations. These synonymous mutations made up less than 0.37% of the total point mutations observed.

AEQ and AAR differ at roughly 14,000 variant sites (the median pairwise genetic distance in the 1011 strains is 64,000) and SACE_YAG differs from AEQ and AAR at about 11,000 sites each. These differences among haploid derivatives reflect the high level of heterozygosity in the parental diploid strain. The fourth strain with an elevated C &gt; A mutation fraction, BRM, is derived from an independent source: it was isolated in 1988 from a cassava flour factory in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laluce et al., 1988</xref>). Despite its distinct origin, BRM differs at only 14,000–17,000 sites from each of the aforementioned three strains.</p><p>In AAR, AEQ, BRM, and SACE_YAG, rarer variants are notably C &gt; A-enriched, but higher frequency variants exhibit weaker C &gt; A enrichment that declines with increasing allele frequency such that variants of allele count greater than eight have C &gt; A fractions more typical of other strains. We verified that the same pattern holds for variants present in the whole genome of the ancestral diploid isolate CBS 1782, which we sequenced after obtaining a sample from the NCYC database (see Materials and Methods). This suggests that AAR and AEQ indeed inherited their mutator phenotype from their wild ancestors and that this phenotype is at least partially penetrant in the diploid state. In contrast, the four closest outgroups to AAR, AEQ, BRM, and SACE_YAG in the 1011 yeast genomes phylogeny exhibit a consistently lower C &gt; A fraction that does not vary with allele frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The concordant enrichment of C &gt; A mutations in rare polymorphisms and de novo mutations from the same strains suggests that this C &gt; A enrichment is genetically determined and is not specific to the <italic>CAN1</italic> locus but has affected the entire genome during the recent history of this clade.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>A scan for candidate mutator alleles</title><p>To explore genetic variation that could underlie the C &gt; A enrichment phenotype observed in AEQ and AAR, we scanned for nonsense and missense mutations in a list of 158 candidate genes known to play roles in DNA replication and repair, including genes that were previously identified to harbor mutator alleles through genetic screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boiteux and Jinks-Robertson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stirling et al., 2014</xref>). No candidate premature stop codons were found to be both present in AAR and AEQ and rare (MAF &lt;0.05) in the 1011 yeast genomes overall. However, we identified 40 sites with at least one rare non-synonymous allele (MAF &lt;0.05) shared by AEQ and AAR and absent from the other haploid strains that we experimentally found to have normal mutation spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>One of these missense variants was observed within <italic>OGG1</italic>, a glycosylase involved in the oxidative stress response that excises the guanine lesion 8-oxo-G. <italic>ogg1</italic> null mutants are known to have high C &gt; A mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shockley et al., 2013</xref>) and mutation rates that are 10-fold elevated above normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ni et al., 1999</xref>).

A close examination of rare variant mutation spectra revealed that AQH may have a C &gt; A enrichment phenotype that is masked by a high rate of C &gt; T mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), but no evidence of C &gt; A enrichment was found in AAQ.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Experimental evidence that <italic>OGG1<sup>AEQ/AAR</sup></italic> is a mutator allele</title><p>We sought to experimentally test whether the <italic>OGG1</italic> allele present in AEQ and AAR, hereafter called <italic>OGG1<sup>AEQ/AAR</sup></italic>, contributes to the AEQ/AAR mutator phenotype.

Through Sanger sequencing, we found that <italic>OGG1<sup>AEQ/AAR</sup></italic> in fact contains two single nucleotide differences from the reference sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). One of these variants (an A &gt; G substitution) lies 156 bp upstream of <italic>OGG1</italic>, presumably in the gene’s promoter region, which we previously missed when examining the coding sequence.

Since the promoter mutation is more widespread and not linked to the nonsynonymous mutation, we hypothesize that it is less likely to cause the mutator phenotype. To avoid truncating any important regulatory sequences, we used PCR to amplify two fragments with different lengths of flanking sequence from each endogenous <italic>OGG1</italic> locus: one shorter fragment called <italic>OGG1-A,</italic> (1.7 kb) and one longer fragment called <italic>OGG1-B</italic> (2.2 kb), creating a total of four plasmids.

We find both population genetic and experimental evidence pointing to a recent increase in the rate of C &gt; A mutations within one clade as a result of a naturally occurring genetically encoded mutator phenotype.</p><p>Our highly accurate pipeline uses a classical fluctuation assay to quantify de novo mutation rate in the reporter gene <italic>CAN1,</italic> then utilizes sequencing of pooled mutants to measure mutation spectra. Sanger validations confirmed that this approach has an undetectably low false positive rate and a very low false negative rate. The reliability of our pipeline is further supported by concordance between our mutation spectrum measurements and previous measurements made from the same lab strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>). Using this method, we identified two extreme mutation spectrum outliers—the Mosaic beer strains AEQ and AAR—as well as several strains with more subtle mutation spectrum phenotypes that are good candidates for future investigation.</p><p>Although the mutation spectrum variation from natural polymorphisms we report here is reminiscent of observed mutation spectrum variation among humans, great apes, and laboratory mouse strains, we note that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutation spectra separate less by population compared to vertebrate mutation spectra. While it is possible to infer a human genome’s continental group of origin using its mutation spectrum alone, the same is not generally true in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Several factors, which are not mutually exclusive, might underlie this difference. One is the presence of complex population structure and pervasive gene flow between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schacherer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liti et al., 2009</xref>). Another factor is the small size of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome; each strain has two orders of magnitude fewer derived alleles than most vertebrate genomes have. This limits our ability to detect how flanking base pairs affect the mutation rate of each site in the genome and constrains us to study a lower dimensional mutation spectrum than the context-dependent ones studied in species with larger genomes.</p><p>While gene flow and genome size might be responsible for the relatively modest magnitude of mutation spectrum divergence between most strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it is also possible that DNA replication and repair are intrinsically more uniform in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> than in vertebrates, perhaps because of the greater efficiency of selection against weakly deleterious mutator alleles in a unicellular organism that exists at large effective population sizes and often reproduces asexually. Asexual reproduction should theoretically increase the efficiency of selection against mutator alleles because deleterious variants created by the mutator cannot recombine onto other genetic backgrounds; on the other hand, it can also limit the efficiency of selection against individual deleterious mutations by permanently tethering them to particular genetic backgrounds. Further measurements of mutation spectrum variation within other species will be needed to determine whether the stability observed here is indeed characteristic of unicellular eukaryotes. If mutation spectra tend to be stable within species that have low mutation rates and strong selection against mutation rate modifiers, we might expect to see even less mutation spectrum variation among populations of ciliates like <italic>Paramecium</italic> and <italic>Tetrahymena</italic>, whose mutation rates are substantially lower than that of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sung et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Many questions about mutation spectrum variation within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and other species remain unresolved and present important avenues for future work. For example, it is unclear whether rare polymorphisms in the Mixed origin and Mosaic region three clades are enriched for C &gt; A mutations due to the same genetic mechanisms active in AEQ and AAR. Other genes might underlie the mutation spectrum differences observed among other strains, though our analyses suggest that some mutation spectrum gradients that dominate the common variation PCA are unlikely to be explained by extant mutators. One such gradient is the A &gt; G enrichment in the African beer yeast clade, which is less pronounced in our rare variant PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) compared to our PCA extracted from variation of all frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This is somewhat reminiscent of the frequency distribution of the TCC&gt; TTC mutation ‘pulse’ that distinguishes Europeans and South Asians from other human populations, and may suggest that the African beer A &gt; G enrichment was caused by an extinct mutator allele or a mutagen found in a past environment.</p><p>Natural selection might contribute to the mutation spectrum variation within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> if certain mutation types are more often beneficial than others and if such asymmetries vary between populations. One example of how natural selection can affect mutation spectrum variation is that transitions are more often synonymous than transversions are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Freeland and Hurst, 1998</xref>), leading to more frequent selection against transversions in genic regions. However, we note that most of the gradient structure observed in our analyses can be reproduced with synonymous mutations alone, meaning that selection is unlikely to explain much of the natural yeast mutation spectrum variation we observe.</p><p>The C &gt; A mutations enriched in AEQ, AAR, and their relatives might be a signature of oxidative stress damage; such mutations are a known signature of failure to repair 8-oxoguanine lesions, which is consistent with a causal role for these strains’ missense substitution in the oxidative stress response gene <italic>OGG1</italic> as verified through our <italic>OGG1</italic> plasmid assay. A recent study knocked out <italic>OGG1</italic> in human cells and found that this elevated the rate of a C &gt; A-dominated mutational signature known in the Cosmic catalog as SBS18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zou, 2020</xref>). SBS18 was initially identified in tumors from individuals with pathogenic variation in <italic>Mutyh</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Viel et al., 2017</xref>), a direct interacting partner of <italic>OGG1</italic> in the 8-oxoguanine repair pathway that has also been implicated in a C &gt; A-dominated germline mutational signature in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sasani et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although our <italic>OGG1</italic> plasmid assay provides compelling evidence that the 8-oxoguanine repair pathway plays a role in the AAR/AEQ mutator phenotype, we note that C &gt; A mutations do not comprise all of the excess mutations measured in AEQ and AAR. Compared to LCTL1, the ratio of C &gt; A mutations to C &gt; T mutations is elevated roughly threefold in AEQ and AAR, which is less than the 10-fold overall elevation of the mutation rate in these strains. These mutation data imply that all mutation types have higher rates in AEQ and AAR compared to other <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, not just C &gt; A. Further work will be required to verify whether the C &gt; A enrichment and broad-spectrum mutation rate increase are driven by the same biochemical mechanism.</p><p>Although our estimates of de novo mutation spectra are all based on the <italic>CAN1</italic> locus, we note that <italic>CAN1</italic> mutation spectra are generally similar to the genome-wide spectra obtained from MA experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sharp et al., 2018</xref>), except that <italic>CAN1</italic> spectra have more mutations at C/G base pairs and relatively fewer mutations at A/T base pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). The 2676 and 1866 missense and nonsense mutations in our dataset contain numerous instances of all six mutation types that comprise our summary mutation spectrum, suggesting that <italic>CAN1</italic> contains many opportunities to ascertain the full spectrum observed genomewide. We noticed that the <italic>CAN1</italic> spectra we measured from the LCTL2 strain showed a slightly higher proportion of C &gt; A mutations than that measured from the same strain by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref> also using a <italic>CAN1</italic> reporter. This could be due to the fact that Lang et al. used ten times the concentration of canavanine that we used, which might mean that some mutants could have grown after plating on our canavanine media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shor et al., 2013</xref>). The fact that we do not see elevated C &gt; A mutations in LCTL1 suggests that this could be a LCTL2 strain-specific behavior.</p><p>In summary, the results presented in this paper provide some of the most direct evidence to date that eukaryotic mutation spectra are variable within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harris, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris and Pritchard, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dumont, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberg and Harris, 2021</xref>). It has been proposed that the best explanation for such mutation spectrum heterogeneity is the frequent emergence of nearly neutral mutator alleles that turn over rapidly as a consequence of weak purifying selection on the mutation rate. Our de novo mutation spectrum measurements provide experimental verification of this claim, showing that at least one mutational signature whose activity varies among natural yeast strains is likely caused by an extant mutator allele.</p><p>Although our results show that the mutation spectrum bias shared by certain Mosaic beer yeast is genetically encoded, it is worth noting that this C &gt; A gradient is not the principal axis of mutation spectrum variation in the 1011 yeast genomes that we computed from all variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). It remains to be seen how many other mutator or antimutator alleles might exist within this strain collection and to what extent they can explain the mutation spectrum variation observed among strains from different environments. A broader question still is whether the forces that created <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>’s mutation spectrum variation are similar to the forces that shaped the distinctive mutation spectra of different human populations and great ape species. If we can identify the genes that underlie natural yeast mutator phenotypes such as the one described in this study, it will likely be more straightforward to test these genes for mutator activity in humans and other species than to discover mutator alleles via any kind of agnostic genome scan.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Variant filtering and mutation PCA analysis</title><p>We filtered the original variants from the 1011 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>) by including biallelic SNPs with less than 20% missing genotypes. We restricted to regions in the genomes where reads can be uniquely mapped (‘mregions_100_annot_2011.bed’ from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jubin et al., 2014</xref>) and excluded repeat-masked regions. Closely related strains (pairwise genetic distance less than 8000) are excluded from the 1011 dataset. Singletons were excluded when counting individual mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to minimize the impact of sequencing errors. Strains with extensive introgression from <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (clades 2, 9, and 10 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>) were excluded in order to minimize bias from errors in the inference of ancestral and derived alleles. Ancestral states of mutations were inferred using five <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yue et al., 2017</xref>), aligned to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> reference genome R64-1-1 using lastz v1.04.00 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harris, 2007</xref>). Only sites that are fixed in four out of five strains were inferred to be the ancestral alleles, and other sites were ignored. When computing the mutation spectra of strains from variants for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, each individual strain was assumed to be diploid, with homozygous derived alleles counted with twice the weight as heterozygous derived alleles. When counting rare variants, homozygous derived alleles were given the same weights as heterozygous derived alleles.</p><p>To further minimize confounding of the mutation spectrum by ancestral allele misidentification, only variants with derived allele frequency less than 0.5 were used. Variants that passed all filtering criteria were used to compute a normalized mutation spectrum histogram for each individual strain. When performing PCAs, no more than 30 strains from each population were randomly sampled to minimize bias from uneven sampling. The same strains were used to generate PCA plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), except that strains with fewer than eight singletons or rare variants were further excluded when generating <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Our definition of singletons varied as a function of ploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>): In haploids and homozygous diploids (as defined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peter et al., 2018</xref>), a singleton will be fixed in the strain where it occurs (represented as homozygous), but in other types of strains, a singleton is required to be heterozygous. In all cases, a singleton is a variant present in only a single strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fluctuation assays and sequencing</title><p>We performed fluctuation assays according to an established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lang, 2018</xref>) with the following modifications: 4μl of overnight inoculant was diluted in 40 ml SC-Arginine +2% Glucose media. 50μl of the diluted cultures were distributed in 96-well round-bottom plates (Costar 3788) for each strain. Plates were sealed with Breathe-Easy sealing membrane (Sigma Z380059). SC-Arginine-Serine+ Canavanine (60 mg/liter L-canavanine) Omni plates (Nunc OmniTray 242811) were used and dried for 2–4 days in a 30℃ incubator before using. Depending on the strains, 50μl of culture were diluted one- to fourfold when plating on the Omni plates, either to reduce the background or to avoid growth of too many mutant colonies. After plating, the plates were dried and then incubated at 30℃ for 48 hr. Independent mutants from separate cultures were inoculated into 200μl SC-Arginine-Serine + 60 mg/Liter Canavanine +2% Glucose media, and then grown to saturation over ~43 hr at 30℃ with shaking. Optical densities (ODs) were measured after incubation, and only mutants that reached similar saturation ODs were pooled (150µμl each) to achieve equal proportions. Genomic DNA from each pool was extracted using the Hoffman Winston protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoffman and Winston, 1987</xref>). <italic>CAN1</italic> was then PCR amplified using published primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>) with 15 cycles. Two independent 25μl PCR reactions were then pooled and cleaned up with a Zymo Clean &amp; Concentrator Kit (D4004). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation Kit with customized indices. Sequencing runs with 75 or 150 bp paired-end reads were performed using an Illumina NextSeq 550 sequencer (BioProject: PRJNA691686).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Calculation of mutation rates</title><p>The rSalvador package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zheng, 2017</xref>) was used to estimate the number of mutation events (<italic>m</italic>) in each fluctuation assay using maximum likelihood under the Lea-Coulson model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lea and Coulson, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ma et al., 1992</xref>). The total number of cells (<italic>Nt</italic>) was measured by counting colonies seeded with dilutions of cells on YPD plates with dilutions ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:40,000. The rate of loss-of-function mutations per <italic>CAN1</italic> gene per cell division was estimated to be <italic>m/Nt</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Mutation calling</title><p>Sequencing reads were first mapped using bowtie v2.2.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) to the Scer3 S288C reference <italic>CAN1</italic> PCR fragment sequence using primers designed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref>. Mutation coordinates were therefore called relative to the start of the <italic>CAN1</italic> amplicon. Adapters were trimmed using the program trim_galore v0.6.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krueger, 2021</xref>) and paired-end reads were merged using pear v0.9.11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The command `fastq_quality_filter -q 20 p 94` was used to remove low quality reads before running bowtie. A MAPQ cutoff of 40 was used for SNPs and a cutoff of 20 was used for indels. Pysamstats v1.1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alistair, 2021</xref>) was used to compute the frequencies of all possible alleles at each base pair. Sites with read depth less than 200 or with less than 40% coverage of the amplicon were excluded. After the first round of mapping, sites that were fixed in each strain were called and compared to the SNPs in the 1011 collection to confirm strain identity. We then performed a second round of read mapping using the same pipeline except that each strain’s reads were mapped to a strain-specific <italic>CAN1</italic> reference sequence.</p><p>For each sequencing pool, we let <italic>N</italic> be the number of mutants that were pooled prior to sequencing. Non-reference alleles with frequencies between 0.65 ⨉ 1 <italic>/N</italic> and 0.95 were included as evidence of mutations, discarding alleles below this frequency range as likely to be sequencing errors and alleles above this frequency range as likely to be strain-specific SNPs. Adjacent indels were merged if their frequencies differed by less than 10%. MNMs were identified in each pool by first flagging pairs of mutations occurring at similar frequencies (plus or minus 9%) within 10 bp of one another and then verifying the coexistence of the two mutations on at least 70% of the paired-end reads where at least one of the two mutations appears. Complex MNMs containing three or more variants were identified by merging MNMs that share an SNP in common. To obtain single nucleotide mutation counts and indel counts, mutations that are part of MNMs were first excluded from each pool. The coordinates of each mutation were converted back from <italic>CAN1</italic>-specific coordinates to genomic positions. Point mutations were further annotated using VEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>) to further categorize into missense, nonsense, or synonymous mutation types.</p><p>Allele frequencies were used to estimate the multiplicity of each mutant as follows: First, the mean and standard deviation of all mutant allele frequencies were calculated from each pool. Each allele frequency more than two standard deviations above the mean was then translated into a mutation count by dividing it by the mean allele frequency and then rounding to the nearest integer. Mutations with frequencies less than two standard deviations above the mean are assumed to be mutations with count 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistically quantifying mutation spectrum differentiation</title><p>To compare the mutation spectra between strains, mutations were first classified as one of the six general classes of base-substitutions (A &gt; C, A &gt; G, A &gt; T, C &gt; A, C &gt; G, C &gt; T) or as single base-pair insertions or deletions. We then compared the mutation spectra of the two control strains LCTL1 and LCTL2 to all other haploid isolates as well as one spectrum published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lang and Murray, 2008</xref> (a total of 35 tests) using a pairwise hypergeometric test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Skopek, 1987</xref>), a custom python script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tracy et al., 2020</xref>). In the first round of this test, the paired mutation counts were arranged in a 2 × 8 contingency table. To test the null hypothesis that the two mutation spectra are the same, the hypergeometric probability of the observed table was calculated and compared to the hypergeometric probabilities of 10,000 random tables with the same row and column totals. The number of random tables with a higher hypergeometric probability than the observed provides an estimate of the p-value. We used the conservative Bonferroni correction to compute the significance cutoff (0.05/35 = 0.001429). A second set of Bonferroni-corrected p<italic>-</italic>values was calculated after excluding indels to form a 2 × 6 contingency table. These p<italic>-</italic>values were used to determine how many of the significant mutation spectrum differences were driven by the indel category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Whole-genome sequencing and variant calling of CBS 1782</title><p>A sample of CBS 1782 was obtained from the National Collection of Yeast Cultures (NCYC 361) January of 2021.

We address questions compiled from the editor as well as updates from our previous response to reviewers below. Moreover, we are pleased to report the results of an extra experiment that we believe considerably strengthens the paper by providing evidence for the mutator activity of the candidate gene <italic>OGG1</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This manuscripts uses differences in the pattern of polymorphism between various yeast strain to argue that there must have been differences in mutation rates between them, then uses experiments to demonstrate that these differences still exist and have a genetic basis. Understanding mutation rate variation could help us understand the process of mutation, arguably one of the most fundamental processes in genetics and evolution.</p><p>Everyone was generally happy with your response to the public reviews, with one exception: we strongly suggest you try a reversion-based mutation essay to validate the inferred spectrum. While we find your results convincing, we feel that such a control should at least be attempted, as it would take the paper to a new level in terms of the supporting evidence. We agree that it is possible that the control experiment will not work for your strains, but you would be able to find that out for sure in less than 1 week by simply plating a haploid yeast cultures on 5-FOA plates. If it does not work, so be it, but if it does, the paper will be much stronger.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion regarding performing a reversion-based mutation essay as a validation to our measured mutation spectrum. We attempted to perform such an assay, but we unfortunately encountered many road-blocks along the way that prevented us from doing this successfully in the natural isolates AEQ and AAR. Before detailing these roadblocks, we also wish to point out that for the <italic>URA3</italic> reversion reporter, the <italic>ura3-29</italic> allele can be successfully reverted by C&gt;T, C&gt;A, and C&gt;G mutations (Bulock, Xing, and Shcherbakova 2020), making it complicated to use this reporter to specifically detect whether a strain’s mutation spectrum is enriched for C&gt;A mutations, but a version of <italic>TRP5</italic> has been engineered to specifically detect C&gt;A mutations (Williams et al. 2005).</p><p>We tested whether AEQ or AAR might already be auxotrophic for Trp or Ura, but found that they were prototrophic. Therefore, we attempted to use CRISPR to engineer a reversion allele into AEQ and AAR, but we noticed that it failed to replace the locus with the provided template and instead induced a small deletion at the guide RNA cut site. It seems that AEQ and AAR use non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) rather than homologous recombination (HR) to repair double-strand breaks introduced by CRISPR. This phenomenon could be interesting to study further, but also makes it more challenging to perform genomic engineering on these strains. For the above reasons, we are not able to perform the reversion assay as asked. That being said, we are hopeful that our new section verifying the mutagenicity of <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>AAR/AEQ</sup> might in part make up for the lack of this confirmatory reversion assay, since it provides additional evidence that AAR and AEQ have a mutator phenotype by showing that the <italic>OGG1</italic> allele present in these strains does not complement the <italic>ogg1</italic> knockout strain as effectively as the laboratory strain allele of <italic>OGG1</italic> is able to do (Line 501-542).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the Reviewing Editor humbly suggests adding a discussion about similar findings in Arabidopsis &quot;strains&quot;, where attempts have also been made to link natural polymorphism patterns with measured mutation rates (including interesting environmental effects).

We have added several of them to the paper’s introduction and Results sections:</p><p>Line 142: “Mild environmental stressors, such as high salt, ethanol, and heat, can also alter the mutation rate of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> laboratory strains (Liu and Zhang 2019; Voordeckers et al. 2020) as well as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (Jiang et al. 2014; Belfield et al. 2021)”</p><p>Line 240: “We note that a discrepancy between de novo and segregating mutation spectra has also been observed in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, though in the opposite direction, as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> de novo mutations are surprisingly enriched for C&gt;T transitions (Weng et al. 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors describe a useful modified fluctuation assay that couples conventional</p><p>mutation rate analysis with mutational spectrum characterization of forward mutations at the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> CAN1 locus. They nicely showed that wild yeast isolates display a wide range of mutation rates with strains AAR and AEQ displaying rates ~10-fold higher than the control lab strain. These two strains also showed a bias for C&gt;A mutations, and were the only strains analyzed that had a mutation spectrum statistically different from the lab control. Together, these data provide a compelling proof-of-principle of the applicability of the modified fluctuation analysis approach described in this manuscript. Overall, the manuscript is very well written, and the work reported in it does represent a valuable contribution to the field. However, two primary shortcomings were identified that can be addressed to strengthen the conclusions prior to publication. Both points described below pertain to the analysis of the possible C&gt;A specific mutator phenotype in strains AAR and</p><p>AEQ.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The work presented in the manuscript does suggest that these two haploids are likely to display the C&gt;A mutator phenotype. Yet, the authors fell short of providing a full and unambiguous demonstration that would elevate the significance of their discovery. They could have directly tested the predicted C&gt;A specific mutator phenotype by conducting additional experiments, one of which is relatively simple. Specifically, they could have performed a simple reversion-based mutation assay to validate the reported C&gt;A mutator phenotype displayed by AAR and AEQ. For example, into AAR, AEQ, and a wild type control, the authors could introduce an engineered auxotrophic marker allele (e.g., ura3 mutation) caused by an A to C substitution, which upon mutation back to A restores prototrophic growth in minimal media (ie. reversion from ura3-C to URA3-A). Such specific reversible allele should be relatively easy to integrate into the AAR and AEQ genomes, as well as in the control strain. Based on the authors' prediction, AAR and AEQ should display a very large increase (far higher than 10 fold) in the reversion rate when compared to a control haploid. To demonstrate the specificity of the mutation spectrum, the authors could test the reversion rates of a different engineered allele requiring a reversion mutation in the opposite direction (ie. reversion from ura3-A to URA3-C). If the AAR and AEQ mutator is specific C&gt;A, one would predict that all three strains should have similar mutation rates for a reversion in the A&gt;C direction. This additional genetic work would thoroughly validate the central discovery and would reinforce the usefulness of the method described in the manuscript.</p><p>Alternatively, a conventional mutation accumulation and whole genome re-sequencing experiment with parallel lines of AAR, AEQ and a control strain would also very effectively validate the C&gt;A mutator prediction, and it would also answer the authors' discussion point about specificity to the CAN1 locus. However, it would be more costly and much more time consuming.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to this issue above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The second concern is in regard to the relatively extensive conclusions drawn about the possible evolutionary significance of the possible C&gt;A mutator in AAR and AEQ. The authors should be more cautious and conservative in the proposed interpretation. As the authors note:</p><p>'Three of the four C&gt;A-enriched mosaic beer strains, AAR, AEQ, and SACE_YAG, are all haploid derivatives of the [highly heterozygous] diploid <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> var diastaticus strain CBS1782, which was isolated in 1952 from super-attenuated beer.'</p><p>From this statement, and because the paper cited provided few details on the isolation of CBS1782, it is presumed that these haploid derivatives were most likely isolated as recombinant spores. Furthermore, it is unclear when this isolation occurred, and for how many generations strains AAR and AEQ have been propagated in a haploid state.</p><p>Herein lies a critical point: AAR and AEQ were recently derived from a diploid background with a &quot;high level of heterozygosity&quot;. In a heterozygous diploid context, deleterious point mutations (and any resulting mutator phenotypes) would likely be masked by the presence of wild-type alleles. Now, as haploids, they express a novel genotype (i.e., combination of defective or incompatible parental alleles), which manifests as a mutator phenotype. In this respect, AAR and AEQ appear analogous to the spore derivatives of the incompatible cMLH1-kPMS1 isolate referred to in the manuscript as a notable exception. The analysis of strains harboring incompatible MLH1-PMS1 mutations by Raghavan et al. demonstrated that the heterozygous diploid parents were not themselves mutators, but that haploid spores which had inherited the pair of incompatible alleles displayed mutator phenotype. Collectively, while it can certainly be argued that the strains AAR and AEQ (like the MLH1/PMS1 incompatible strains) are mutators now, this fact alone does not support the conclusion that they have adapted to survive the expression of an extant mutator phenotype. This premise could be tested by analyzing the mutation rates/spectra of four new spores derived from a single tetrad of CBS 1782. Do the four sibling spores display similar or different mutational rates and spectra? If all four spores from a single tetrad exhibit the 10-fold increase in CAN1 mutation rate and the C&gt;A transversion bias, then it can be inferred that the diploid parent is also a mutator in the same manner. Further direct analysis of mutation rates and spectrum in the parent diploid CBS 1782 would complete the work. This finding would be quite significant, and would provide strong evidence that wild strains can in fact tolerate the expression of a chronic mutator allele.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a new experiment where we sequenced the diploid ancestral strain CBS 1782, called variants and examined polymorphisms together with the 1011 strains (Figure: 5C).</p><p>We found that the diploid CBS 1782 also shows the enrichment of C&gt;A mutations that is seen in AEQ and AAR, especially in the rarest category of variants. This result supports the hypothesis that the naturally arising mutator allele is present in the diploid CBS 1782.</p><p>To better investigate whether the mutator phenotype is caused at least in part by the <italic>OGG1</italic> allele in AEQ and AAR, we put this allele on a plasmid and used it to transform an <italic>ogg1</italic> knockout strain. The resulting yeast has a higher mutation rate than an <italic>ogg1</italic> knockout transformed with a plasmid containing the reference allele of <italic>OGG1</italic>, suggesting that <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>AEQ/AAR</sup> is less effective at DNA repair than <italic>OGG1<sup>wt</sup></italic>. The <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>AEQ/AAR</sup> allele contains two SNPs in AEQ and AAR, both of which are homozygous in CBS 1782, further supporting our hypothesis that the diploid harbors the mutator allele.</p><p>We had hoped to measure mutation rates from four haploid derivatives of CBS 1782 and examine their segregation patterns, but this would ideally require sporulation to produce four viable spores. We performed tetrad dissection on CBS 1782 after knocking out its HO locus, but unfortunately found one or two surviving spores out of the four spores produced. As an alternative strategy, we could make the diploid hemizygous for <italic>CAN1</italic> or use a dominant drug resistance marker. We hope to attempt these modifications in a future study, as they require some care in the experimental design and strain engineering.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>A final, relatively minor point. That the new haploids AAR and AEQ show distinct mutation rates and spectra opens the door to an interesting line of inquiry, which may help to identify the causative mutator allele in a manner more efficient than searching for missense mutations. It is stated, and it is understandable, that the identification of the possible causal mutations is beyond the scope of the present manuscript. In this spirit, it would be much more appropriate to restrict such considerations to the Discussion section. Specifically, while the authors make a plausible case for OGG1 being a candidate gene responsible for the C&gt;A mutator phenotype, no experimental demonstration was attempted.</p><p>As such, that text segment should be moved from the Results to the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We have conducted extra experiments to test whether the <italic>OGG1</italic> allele present in AEQ and AAR is responsible for their increase in mutation rate by expressing a plasmid carrying different <italic>OGG1</italic> alleles in an <italic>ogg1</italic> knockout strain (Figure:6). Our results clearly show that the <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>AEQ/AAR</sup> allele increases mutation rate (~2.4-fold increase compared to expression of the lab strain allele). The fact that <italic>OGG1</italic> is in the oxidative stress pathway in which null alleles specifically increase C&gt;A mutations adds additional evidence for our hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>As stated in the summary section above, the manuscript by Jiang et al. represents a substantial contribution to the fields of genome stability and genome evolution. The method described is likely to be useful beyond budding yeast. The work will be appreciated by a broad audience of geneticists. The additional work and text modifications proposed above would likely further elevate the impact of this work.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Mutation is a fundamental force in organismal evolution, and therefore understanding the evolution of mutational mechanisms are important in evolutionary studies. In this manuscript, the authors used strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a model system to study the variations of rates and spectra in mutations with bioinformatic and experimental approaches. First, the authors analyzed the polymorphism data from 1011 strains by PCA analysis and show the variations in spectra. Second, the authors used fluctuation test combined with deep sequencing of the resistance gene to identify mutation rates and spectra in 18 strains, which show ~10-fold mutation rate variations and increased C-to-A mutations in two strains.</p><p>For the second part, the experimental procedures and statistical analysis are mostly solid. For the first part, as what authors said in the introduction, polymorphism is not equal to the mutation spectra. I think the authors did a good job by being cautious in the wording and having no over-inference after the analysis. It is thus inevitable that the conclusion of this part sounds mostly descriptive. The overall writing is very clear. I will recommend the publication in field-specific journals.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>P9 – It is very hard to not wonder how the 16 strains were picked in the fluctuation tests. Some comments on that will be appreciated. E.g., was that informed by the results of Figure 1?</p></disp-quote><p>We actually did not pick strains based on the results of Figure 1, one reason being that the <italic>CAN1</italic> reporter method only works on haploid strains with a canavanine sensitivity phenotype. We also restricted our analysis to strains without known aneuploidies to maximize our ability to accurately measure the spectra of the strains’ polymorphisms. When possible, given these constraints, we included at least two randomly selected strains from each clade of the 1011 collection whenever possible. These constraints are now explained on page 8:</p><p>Line 308: “We used our pipeline to measure mutation rates and spectra in 16 haploid strains from a wide variety of environments (Supplementary File 1C). […] We also selected two lab strains, LCTL1 and LCTL2, to use as controls, since their mutation rates were previously measured”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P17- In the paragraph &quot;natural selection might contribute.…&quot; , is there any example of &quot;certain mutation types are more often beneficial than others&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion of this point to the revision (Page: 15).</p><p>Line 605: “One example of how natural selection can affect mutation spectrum variation is that transitions are more often synonymous than transversions are (Freeland and Hurst 1998), leading to more frequent selection against transversions in genic regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>P20 – Extra '' in the sentence &quot;Adjacent indels were merged if their frequencies differed by less than 10%.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this in revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the discussion, it might be good to add a paragraph to compare the rate and spectra reported here and the ones found by MA and then NGS approach(e.g., Zhu et al. 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a reference to the Zhu et al. (2014) spectrum in the discussion (Page 15, Line 633, Figure 4—figure supplement 7), extending our existing comparison of mutation spectra previously reported using <italic>CAN1</italic> (Lang and Murray 2008) and the MA approach (Sharp et al. 2018). Our <italic>CAN1</italic> method also obtains results that are consistent with the Lang et al. 2008 study on the same control strain, with a small (but not significant) discrepancy discussed in the discussion (Line 404, Line 638).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The significance of this manuscript will be relatively specific to evolutionary biologists and geneticists, especially those who use yeasts as a model system. For example, I expect the variation of mutation rates and spectra found in this manuscript will impact the following population-genetic analysis in this collection of 1011 strains and motivate more studies on the molecular machineries which affect mutation rates and spectra.</p><p>In addition, in terms of methodological novelty, adding a novel step of reporter-gene sequencing is a reasonable way to get some information on mutation spectra as it is less labor-intensive than NGS of MAs. Other statistical or experimental procedures in this manuscript mostly follow the approaches which have been developed in previous literature and thus show not much novelty.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors show that certain yeast strains have altered mutation rates/bias. The study is well motivated, genetic variation in mutation rates are not easily uncovered, and capitalizes on yeast and a high-throughput mutation rate/bias method that validates findings of C&gt;A bias from yeast polymorphism data. The results are solid and clearly presented and I have no major concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these encouraging comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p></disp-quote><p>None.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Should have comma: &quot;In addition, environmental.…&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this in revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Using S. paradoxus to classify derived vs ancestral alleles may not work as well as allele frequency. A 1/100 rare variant is 100x more likely derived than common variant. But with S. paradoxus divergence of say 5%, 5% polymorphic sites are misclassified or NA. Of course, since you used both, this is not a concern. But the number of variants included/excluded in each analysis should be reported. Also, I was a bit surprised that the rare variants are more noisy since most variants are rare.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the heuristic of classifying rare alleles as derived will do the right thing the majority of the time, but this could potentially create artifactual differences between the mutation spectra of different populations because the exact ratio of rare derived alleles to common derived alleles depends on the population’s demographic history and true site frequency spectrum. If two populations had the same mutation spectrum but very different proportions of variants that are polarized incorrectly, this could create the appearance of a mutation spectrum difference where none exists. In the revision, we report the total number of variants filtered because of the variation present in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (Line 187, 189, 191 for all natural variants after filtering, Line 220 for rare variants).</p><p>Although the reviewer is correct that most variants are rare, most of the derived variants present in an individual genome are common (since each common variant is present in many genomes). Since each mutation spectrum in the default PCA is computed by counting up the derived variants in an individual genome, these counts are considerably lower and noisier when only rare variants are used or when the common variants are subsampled to randomly assign each one to just a single genome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In regards to variation in mutation rate based on canavanine resistance. There is a caveat that some strains may be more canavanine resistant – due to differences in transporter abundance or some other aspect of metabolism. Thus, the same mutation would survive and grow (barely) in one strain background, but not another. This caveat is very unlikely to have much of an impact but it would be worth discussing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We also considered the possibility that our mutation rate estimates could be confounded by slight differences in canavanine resistance between strains, and have added results in the revised version (Page 10):</p><p>Line 389: “One possible contributor to the observed differences in mutation rates and spectra are differences in target size: the number of distinct <italic>CAN1</italic> mutations that are able to help the strain survive on canavanine media. […] among strains, but it is large enough that we cannot confidently translate our <italic>CAN1</italic>-based mutation rate estimates into genome-wide estimates of the mutation rate per base pair per generation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The explanation for synonymous mutations is hitchhikers or errors. However, they could also disrupt translation, here's one possibility PMC4552401.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We now mention the possibility of synonymous mutation disrupting translation in Line 366.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are there CAN allele differences between strains? If there are some, it might be worth mentioning why you do/don't think this influences the mutation rate. E.g. CGG is one step from stop but CGT is not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing to this analysis. We calculated the number of opportunities for missense and nonsense mutations in each strain, and estimated the mutational target size for each strain in the results (Page: 10, Line 389). We find that the overall number of opportunities for missense and nonsense mutations do not differ among strains substantially enough to explain the observed differences between the actual numbers of missense and nonsense mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the allele counts in Figure 5B. 2 indicates a variant is present in one strain so there are only 9 mutations present in AAR and not found in ANY other strain or just not found in the four listed? Likewise AAR has 36 for count 4, meaning that there are 36 variants present in AAR and one other strain, where other strains are just the 4 shown in the table, or other strains being any of the 1011?</p></disp-quote><p>The Figure 5B in the previous version is the Figure 5C in the updated manuscript, with the extra diploid CBS 1782 included as well. We have explained rare allele count more clearly in the revised manuscript (first described in Line 220, which is calculated the same way throughout).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;To our knowledge, this is one of the first&quot; This is an odd way to put it and could be rephrased. As it stand you are either the first and not knowledgeable or knowledgeable and not the first.</p></disp-quote><p>We have fixed this in our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;humans, great apes,..&quot; Could you put the citations in the discussion too. I was a little surprised there was no mention of C&gt;A bias as it relates to studies in bacteria and cancer, where there has been a lot of work on mutational spectra. A comment on this literature or whether the C&gt;A biases are not found elsewhere would be nice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this excellent suggestion. We have added a discussion paragraph about some relevant C&gt;A signatures previously identified in cancer as well as the mouse germline:</p><p>Line 55: “Many mutator phenotypes in <italic>E. coli</italic> have been linked to defects in DNA repair enzymes (Horst, Wu, and Marinus 1999; Loeb 2001; Prindle, Fox, and Loeb 2010)). Mutator phenotypes also commonly occur in cancer ((Horst, Wu, and Marinus 1999; Loeb 2001; Prindle, Fox, and Loeb 2010), likely either because of relaxed selection against cellular dysfunction or because it is beneficial for cancer cells to adapt rapidly to their aggressive growth niche.”</p><p>Line 612: “The C&gt;A mutations enriched in AEQ, AAR, and their relatives might be a signature of oxidative stress damage; such mutations are a known signature of failure to the repair of 8-oxoguanine lesions, which is consistent with a causal role for these strains’ missense substitution in the oxidative stress response gene <italic>OGG1</italic> as which were verified through our <italic>OGG1</italic> plasmid assay. […] SBS18 was initially identified in tumors from individuals with pathogenic variation in <italic>Mutyh</italic> (Viel, et al. 2017), a direct interacting partner of <italic>OGG1</italic> in the 8-oxoguanine repair pathway that has also been implicated in a C&gt;A-dominated germline mutational signature in mice (Sasani, et al. 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>I am an evolutionary geneticist with expertise in genomics and bioinformatics. In addition to reviewing papers I also regularly handle papers as an editor. The manuscript provides rare insight into population variation in mutation rates. While differences in mutational biases are well known between species and in some cases within a species, we typically don't know what causes this biases. Environmental factors are often thought to be involved; this work clearly shows that genetic (mutator strains) exist and impact polymorphism in yeast. The manuscript does a nice job in the introduction of explaining the background on mutation rate research and motivation for the work. It also clear explains the advantage of an experimental high-throughput mutation rate/spectra approach. Thus, I believe this new angle on a long-standing problem will be of interest to the community of evolutionary geneticists outside of yeast researchers.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the kind comments, which exactly capture the type of impact we hope our study will have.</p><p>References:</p><p>Belfield, Eric J., Carly Brown, Zhong Jie Ding, Lottie Chapman, Mengqian Luo, Eleanor Hinde, Sam W. van Es, et al. 2021. “Thermal Stress Accelerates <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Mutation Rate.” Genome Research 31 (1): 40–50.</p><p>Bulock, Chelsea R., Xuanxuan Xing, and Polina V.
