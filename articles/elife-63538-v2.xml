exhibits multiple physiological activities. To elucidate the mechanisms by which curcumin affects systemic amyloidosis, we investigated amyloid deposition and molecular changes in a mouse model of amyloid apolipoprotein A-II (AApoAII) amyloidosis, in which mice were fed a curcumin-supplemented diet. Curcumin supplementation for 12 weeks significantly increased AApoAII amyloid deposition relative to controls, especially in the liver and spleen. Liver weights and plasma ApoA-II and high-density lipoprotein concentrations were significantly elevated in curcumin-supplemented groups. RNA-sequence analysis revealed that curcumin intake affected hepatic lipid metabolism via the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) pathway, especially PPARα activation, resulting in increased <italic>Apoa2</italic> mRNA expression. The increase in liver weights was due to activation of PPARα and peroxisome proliferation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that curcumin is a PPARα activator and may affect expression levels of proteins involved in amyloid deposition to influence amyloidosis and metabolism in a complex manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>amyloidosis</kwd><kwd>PPARα</kwd><kwd>curcumin</kwd><kwd>peroxisome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H04063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>26670152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Curcumin regulates gene expression via PPARa activation and exhibits biological activities involved in amyloidosis, peroxisome proliferation, lipid metabolism, and hepatocyte hypertrophy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal aggregation of proteins to form amyloid fibrils, and subsequent deposition in various tissues and organs, which can lead to severe functional failures. More than 30 amyloid proteins have been identified; some result in localized tissue deposits, such as Aβ in Alzheimer's disease and α-synuclein (αSyn) in Parkinson’s disease that deposit in the brain, while others result in systemic amyloidosis and are widely deposited in various tissues and organs, such as ALλ and ALκ in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis and transthyretin in ATTR amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benson et al., 2018</xref>). In general, when amyloid proteins are exposed to certain conditions that affect protein homeostasis (e.g., overexpression, gene mutation, and enzyme cleavage), they may undergo structural changes into stable structures that are rich in β-sheets, and which promote subsequent aggregation to form oligomers, protofibrils, and amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merlini and Bellotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>). Because the formation of amyloid fibrils is nearly irreversible, maintaining proteostasis and inhibiting amyloid aggregation present a challenge for development of an effective treatment.</p><p>Some natural phenolic compounds extracted from plants exhibit certain anti-amyloid activity in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefani and Rigacci, 2013</xref>). Curcumin, a polyphenol compound, is extracted from the rhizome of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic> and has a long history of use in traditional medicines in some countries in Asia. In in vitro experiments, curcumin has been shown to suppress the aggregation and cytotoxicity of Aβ, αSyn, islet amyloid precursor protein, ATTR, and prion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefani and Rigacci, 2013</xref>). In 2001, the first evidence of the efficacy of curcumin against Aβ amyloidosis in a transgenic model mice was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2001</xref>). Curcumin was found to suppress amyloid deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and improve memory function. It was subsequently demonstrated that the amount of amyloid present in TTR- and tau-transgenic mice was reduced by curcumin supplementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma Q-L et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the strong affinity of curcumin for the amyloid structure, it is believed that curcumin inhibits the formation of amyloid fibrils by binding to amyloid protein monomers or aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefani and Rigacci, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hafner-Bratkovic et al., 2008</xref>). This curcumin-protein complex exhibits better stability and reduces the tendency to aggregate. However, another mechanism that has been proposed suggests that curcumin inhibits Aβ production by downregulating the expression of amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) or beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Song et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, there are few reports that suggest that curcumin will provide clinical benefit in patients with Alzheimer's disease or AL amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefani and Rigacci, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golombick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Small et al., 2018</xref>). In fact, it is unclear how curcumin inhibits amyloid deposition in vivo.</p><p>Curcumin is a compound with multiple physiological activities, which include anti-oxidation, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, lipid metabolism regulation, and anti-amyloid properties. However, a link between the various physiological activities has not been completely established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liczbiński et al., 2020</xref>). Curcumin has been found to exert an influence on multiple signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shishodia, 2013</xref>). In 2003, curcumin was first shown to inhibit rat hepatic stellate cell growth by activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), suggesting that curcumin might have an effect on the PPAR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Xu et al., 2003</xref>). In mammals, the PPAR subfamily (PPARs) is a group of nuclear receptor proteins, for example transcription factors, and consists of three members, namely PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and PPAR-γ, that play essential roles in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, glucose and energy metabolism, cellular differentiation, inflammation, and ROS metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pyper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Monsalve et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamichane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmon et al., 2011</xref>). The functions of the three PPAR subtypes are different. PPAR-α regulates fatty acid transport and oxidative decomposition in the liver and muscle in response to energy metabolism levels. PPARγ mainly regulates fatty acid synthesis and fat accumulation in adipose tissue, as well as differentiation of adipose cells and macrophages. PPARβ/δ plays an important role in lipid catabolism, energy homeostasis, and cell differentiation, but the mechanism and network of action are not completely clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magadum and Engel, 2018</xref>). Among the three isotypes, the relationship between curcumin and PPARγ is the most extensively studied, while information on α and β/δ remains scarce.</p><p>In this study, we sought to determine whether curcumin affects the amyloid deposition process besides directly binding to amyloid proteins, and identify a link between curcumin’s anti-amyloid activity and its various other biological activities. In our previous study, we found that antioxidants (tempol and apocynin) can effectively reduce AApoAII amyloid deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dai et al., 2019</xref>). It is therefore possible that the anti-oxidative effects of curcumin also play an important role in amyloid formation. We examined the effects of curcumin supplementation in a mouse model of AApoAII amyloidosis, in which mice were induced to develop systemic amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higuchi et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast to expectations, our results showed that curcumin significantly promoted AApoAII amyloid deposition by activating the PPAR signaling pathway. Moreover, our results suggest that activation of PPARα plays a major role in the amyloid formation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Degree of AApoAII amyloid deposition and liver weights were significantly increased after supplementation with curcumin</title><p>Two-month-old female R1.P1-<italic>Apoa2<sup>c</sup></italic> mice were randomly divided into four groups: the control (Con) and curcumin (Cur) groups are non-amyloid-induced groups and fed a common diet or 2% w/w curcumin diet, respectively. The other two groups were injected with 1 μg AApoAII amyloid fibrils into the tail vein to induce amyloidosis, and were fed a common diet (A-NT group) or 2% curcumin diet (A-Cur group) (see experimental design in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, body weight and food intake in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After 8 and 12 weeks, we evaluated the effect of curcumin intake on amyloid deposition. Unlike previous studies, the degree of amyloid deposition in the A-Cur group was significantly increased compared to the A-NT group at both 8 and 12 weeks, especially in the liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This is the first evidence that curcumin promotes amyloid deposition in vivo and suggests that curcumin can affect the amyloid deposition process via a complex mechanism, not just via binding with amyloid protein monomers or aggregates. In addition, no amyloid deposition was observed in the Cur group, suggesting that curcumin does result in the pathogenesis of amyloidosis without induction by amyloid fibril injection. These results suggest that curcumin accelerates amyloid deposition but does not cause structural changes in amyloidogenic proteins.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Degree of AApoAII amyloid deposition and liver weights.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Amyloid index (AI) in the 8-week group.

We hypothesized that the increase in amyloid deposition in the curcumin diet group was due to upregulation of ApoA-II or other co-deposition proteins.

In the present experiment, we found that the gene expression changes in mouse liver after curcumin supplementation are centered on the PPAR signaling pathway. In the enrichment pathway analysis, most of the DEGs involved in retinol metabolism, metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, and the peroxisome pathway are also downstream of PPARα. Until now, research on curcumin has mainly focused on the activation of PPARr, and it has been demonstrated that curcumin participates in glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammatory cytokine production, and inhibiting tumor cell proliferation via PPARr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shishodia, 2013</xref>). Although some studies have found that PPARα expression is increased after curcumin intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>), there is currently a lack of further experimental results revealing any connection between curcumin and PPARα pathway activation. Our results complement the theoretical system suggesting that curcumin regulates the transcription of many genes in the liver depending centrally on PPARα activation and broadly affects fatty acid transport and catabolism. These changes in genes and proteins levels may be involved, in which curcumin regulates the occurrence and development of various diseases or phenotypes, such as amyloidosis, changes in HDL and triglycerides, oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferation, and hepatocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the effect of curcumin mediated by PPARa in mouse liver.</title><p>Curcumin regulates gene expression via PPARa activation and exhibits biological activities involved in amyloidosis, peroxisome proliferation, lipid metabolism, and hepatocyte hypertrophy.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63538-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Due to the unexpected promotion of AApoAII amyloid deposition by curcumin in this study, we suspect that the anti-amyloid effect of curcumin is not applicable to all types of amyloidosis. To better understand the findings of the present study, we suggest that the effects of curcumin on progression of amyloidosis should be divided into two aspects, one of which is a pro-amyloidosis effect. In this experiment, the plasma concentration of ApoA-II increased almost threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) via PPARα pathway activation. Levels of amyloid protein are the most important factor for progression of amyloidosis, and suppression of amyloid protein levels is the main target for treatment of various systemic amyloidosis, including AA, AL, ATTR, and dialysis-related Aß<sub>2</sub>M amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Merlini and Bellotti, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Knowles et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Calhoun et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ueda et al., 2007</xref>). In ApoA-II transgenic mice, the serum concentration of ApoA-II increased twofold and AApoAII amyloid deposition was notably accelerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ge et al., 2007</xref>). However, calorie restriction (diet) decreased the ApoA-II/ApoA-I ratio in serum and suppressed amyloidosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we believe that the pro-amyloid effect of curcumin observed here is mainly caused by increased ApoA-II levels.</p><p>The other aspect is the anti-amyloid effect of curcumin. Curcumin has shown general affinity for the amyloid protein structure and it has been demonstrated that this binding is efficient to maintain stability of the amyloid protein and inhibit the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stefani and Rigacci, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hafner-Bratkovic et al., 2008</xref>). In addition to direct binding to amyloid proteins, it has also been shown that curcumin activates autophagy and macrophages in some studies to reduce the dysfunction caused by amyloid proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it was reported that some molecules elevate lysosome biosynthesis via activation of PPARα and accelerate the clearance of amyloid proteins and protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chandra et al., 2018</xref>). Compared with previous data, we noticed that amyloid deposition in <italic>Apoa2<sup>c</sup></italic> transgenic mice with twice the serum concentration of ApoA-II is more severe than in those with greater ApoA-II concentrations in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ge et al., 2007</xref>). In transgenic mice injected with 1 μg AApoAII fibrils for 8 and 12 weeks, the average amyloid score in the liver and spleen at 12 weeks and the amyloid index at 8 weeks was 3.4, 4, and 3, respectively, compared with values of 2, 3.4, and 1.5, respectively, in curcumin-supplemented mice. We believe that this difference demonstrates that curcumin may also exert a certain anti-amyloid ability in this experiment, but it is difficult to evaluate and further analyses should be carried out in the future.</p><p>Curcumin interacts with various cellular metabolic pathways by activating PPARs. Most biological process, such as metabolic control and defect, involve complex molecular interactions and are regulated via various signaling pathways. When amyloid proteins play functional roles in certain metabolic pathways, progression of amyloidosis may be accelerated or decelerated via treatments that modulate such metabolic pathways. As ApoA-II interacts particularly with lipid metabolism, it is likely that amyloid deposition was increased by metabolic changes caused by curcumin, including acceleration of ß-oxidation of fatty acids, reduction of lipogenesis, and increased synthesis of apolipoproteins.</p><p>In addition, we think the peroxisome proliferation is the most important factor that explains the hepatocyte and liver hypertrophy. There was no significant change in food intake between the four groups investigated in our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and no significant lipid deposition was observed in the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Peroxisomes in liver parenchymal cells are very few and represent &lt;2% of cytoplasmic volume under physiological conditions and contribute about 35% of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-production levels. However, peroxisomes in the liver in the presence of peroxisome agonists may occupy as much as 25% of the cytoplasmic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeldandi et al., 2000</xref>). In previous studies, long-term administration of PPARα agonists was shown to induce disordered peroxisome proliferation, liver hypertrophy, and liver tumors in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corton et al., 2018</xref>). In our experiments, overexpression of catalase and peroxisomal proteins suggests that curcumin promotes peroxisome proliferation mediated by PPARα. The hypertrophic changes in the hepatocyte nucleus we observed in histological sections are consistent with the early pathological changes of hepatocyte heterogeneity.</p><p>Peroxisomes are a conserved organelle and play a key role in lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis in both plants and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeldandi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farré et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schrader et al., 2020</xref>). According to the proliferation mode of peroxisomes, the process of peroxisome fission is a three-step process involving peroxisome elongation, constriction, and scission. Pex11 is essential for this process and its overexpression causes peroxisome proliferation, while its deletion causes a decrease in the number of peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erdmann and Blobel, 1995</xref>). Overexpression of Pex11 in curcumin-supplemented mice suggests that Pex11 may play a key role in peroxisome proliferation mediated by PPARα and curcumin. Moreover, proteins such as Acsl1, Acaa1, and Ehhadh upregulated by curcumin in this experiment are localized in the peroxisome matrix and may be involved in this process.</p><p>A hallmark of eukaryotic cells is the presence of membrane-bound organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, and peroxisomes. Such distinct compartments create special micro-environments for more efficient metabolic reactions. To coordinate complex metabolic processes and signal transduction, there are functional interplays between various organelles. Due to the central metabolic role, it was shown that peroxisomes interact with many organelles involved in cellular lipid metabolism, such as the ER, mitochondria, lysosomes, and lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schrader et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wanders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugiura et al., 2017</xref>). There is also functional interplay between peroxisomes and the nucleus, which may also involve signaling via H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schrader et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullineaux et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Other means by which peroxisome proliferation affects ER or mitochondrial functions are also known. However, the mechanism by which curcumin activates PPARs is not yet clear. There are two means of activating PPARs, namely ligand-dependent and ligand-independent. In the ligand-dependent manner, the molecular shape of PPARs is modified by ligand binding in the cytoplasm, and PPARs enter into the nucleus. In a ligand-independent manner, PPARs can be phosphorylated by protein kinases to induce a structural change of phosphorylated PPARs, even in the absence of ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lamichane et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harmon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Magadum and Engel, 2018</xref>). Further experiments are needed to confirm whether curcumin directly binds and activates PPARs as an exogenous ligand, or whether activation involves a ligand-independent pathway.</p><p>PPARα and PPARr involve different aspects of metabolic pathways, such as decomposition or storage of fatty acids, fatty acid-based energy production, or glucose-based energy production. PPARα agonists (e.g., fibrates) or PPARr agonists (e.g., thiazolidinedione) play important roles in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes in the clinic. PPARα/r dual agonists are also under development to treat more complex metabolic diseases, but some exhibit side effects and cause liver or cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalliora et al., 2019</xref>). In clinical trials, it has been demonstrated that supplementation with curcumin at a high dose is safe in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sahebkar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Improving the molecular structure of drugs based on that of curcumin offers the possibility to produce dual or specific agonists without side effects.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate the novel agonistic effect of curcumin on PPARα. We identified specific effects of curcumin on mice, including promotion of AApoAII amyloidosis and peroxisome proliferation. Curcumin is involved in various physiological activities mediated by PPARs activation, leading to regulation of genes participating in the PPAR pathway. The beneficial use of curcumin based on these particular abilities requires further consideration. The development of derivative agents based on curcumin with high bioavailability or specific effects may have far-reaching significance for the treatment of diseases such as amyloidosis, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and other metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and drug administration</title><p>R1.P1-<italic>Apoa2<sup>c</sup></italic> congenic mice were used in this study, which carry the amyloidogenic type c allele (<italic>Apoa2<sup>c</sup></italic>) of amyloidosis-susceptible SAMP1 strain on a genetic background of the SAMR1 strain.

Reference 1: Amyloid nomenclature 2018: recommendations by the International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) nomenclature committee.</p><p>2) In our study, PPARα was selected as the major target protein of curcumin supplementation in the liver, rather than other PPARs, for the following reasons:</p><p>i) In previous studies, it has been reported that intake of PPARα agonists increases the plasma concentration of HDL and ApoA-II. In our study, we found a 2-fold increase in plasma levels of ApoA-II, and RNA seq results confirmed activation of the PPAR signaling pathway to be the most important molecular event following curcumin supplementation.</p><p>ii) PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ are functionally different. PPARα is a core transcription factor involved in lipid catabolism, while PPARγ plays an important role in the synthesis and storage of lipids in adipose tissue. We analyzed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of the RNA seq analysis and found that a large number of DEGs located downstream of PPARα were up-regulated.</p><p>iii) It is known that activation of PPARα, but not PPARβ and PPARγ, leads to peroxisome proliferation and hepatocyte hypertrophy, and even hepatic cancer in rodents. The same phenomenon also appeared in our experiments.</p><p>The mechanism by which curcumin activates PPARs remains unclear. Further experiments are needed to confirm whether curcumin directly binds and activates PPARs as an exogenous ligand, or whether activation involves a ligand-independent pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I'm wondering if the concentration of APOC II and III were determined.

In our study, we did not identify changes in the expression of ApoC-II and ApoC-III in the plasma. We confirmed the original RNA seq analysis data, and found no significant difference in the mRNA expression of <italic>Apoc2</italic> and <italic>Apoc3</italic> in the liver. In a previous study, we determined the proteomics of AApoAII deposition and did not detect ApoC-II and ApoC-III in the liver extract. Reference: Comprehensive proteomic profiles of mouse AApoAII amyloid fibrils provide insights into the involvement of lipoproteins in the pathology of amyloidosis.</p><p>As a result of the short amyloid induction time in the present study, the degree of amyloid deposition in the liver was still relatively low, especially in the A-NT group, and extraction of amyloid deposits for proteomics was not feasible. We plan to extend the induction time in a future study to confirm the changes in the proteomics of amyloid deposits as a result of curcumin supplementation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
