The mechanism behind left-right establishment is not fully understood. Symmetry breaking occurs in a dedicated organ called the left-right organizer (LRO) and involves motile cilia generating fluid-flow therein. However, it has been a matter of debate whether the process of symmetry breaking relies on a chemosensory or a mechanosensory mechanism (Shinohara et al., 2012). Novel tailored manipulations for LRO fluid extraction in living zebrafish embryos allowed us to pinpoint a physiological developmental period for breaking left-right symmetry during development. The shortest critical time-window was narrowed to one hour and characterized by a mild counterclockwise flow. The experimental challenge consisted in emptying the LRO of its fluid, abrogating simultaneously flow force and chemical determinants. Our findings revealed an unprecedented recovery capacity of the embryo to re-fil and re-circulate new LRO fluid. The embryos that later developed laterality problems were found to be those that had lower anterior angular velocity and thus less anterior-posterior heterogeneity. Next, aiming to test the presence of any secreted determinant, we replaced the extracted LRO fluid by a physiological buffer. Despite some transitory flow homogenization, laterality defects were absent unless viscosity was altered, demonstrating that symmetry breaking does not depend on the nature of the fluid content but is rather sensitive to fluid mechanics. Altogether, we conclude that the zebrafish LRO is more sensitive to fluid dynamics for symmetry breaking.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>left-right</kwd><kwd>Kupffer's

embryonic development and define left and right. The left-right axis is the third and final body axis to be established in the embryo and encompasses a biophysical process yet to be fully elucidated. In mouse, frogs, and fish it involves fluid movement in a specialized organ called the left right organizer (LRO). In the mouse embryo, cilia driven fluid flow inside the LRO has been proposed to activate either a mechanosensory mechanism in the epithelial cells that constitute the LRO, or to transport morphogens (as dissolved molecules or carried inside extracellular vesicles) towards the left side of the LRO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McGrath et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). While the mechanism is unknown, it culminates in asymmetric left-sided calcium signalling at the node cells and a subsequent conserved Nodal pathway on the left side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2020</xref>). The endpoint of this developmental process is the asymmetric localization of internal visceral organs, such as the heart and liver.</p><p>Analysis of cilia-driven LRO flow is therefore crucial to understand this initial process of symmetry breaking. The transparent zebrafish embryo is a particularly suitable model system enabling flow visualization and subsequent scoring of organ asymmetry in the same individual. We and others have shown that wildtype (WT) zebrafish embryos have a stereotyped flow pattern in the LRO (known as Kupffer’s vesicle or KV), exhibiting higher dorsal anterior speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Supatto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>). Our group has demonstrated that deviations from this flow pattern due to less cilia or shorter motile cilia, predictably generate larvae with wrong laterality outcomes, indicating a biological relevance to flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, flow dynamics and the mechanical-chemical readout are central to solving the problem of how left-right asymmetry is first established.</p><p>Although the LRO is an organ with a limited lifetime, from ~2 ss to 14 ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oteíza et al., 2008</xref>), seminal work unveiled that the zebrafish Kupffer’s vesicle is dispensable for left-right establishment after 10 somite stages (ss) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essner et al., 2005</xref>). Guided by this finding, most subsequent studies have been performed at 8–10 ss, when an asymmetry in <italic>dand5</italic> gene expression is first detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>). The decrease of <italic>dand5</italic> gene expression on the left side of the LRO is the first asymmetric molecular signal in left-right development, downstream of fluid flow, an event conserved across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marques et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hojo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schweickert et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Yuan and colleagues have shown that, as soon as zebrafish LRO cilia are formed and some start beating, at around 1–4 ss, intraciliary calcium oscillations (ICOs) can be registered in LRO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). These signals were reported to precede cytosolic calcium elevations that extend mostly to the left mesendodermal regions and were shown to be essential to trigger correct left-right patterning. Therefore, it is conceivable that an asymmetry in <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA expression, first detectable at 8 ss in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>), results from molecular events that significantly precede that time point. Although it is evident from pioneer studies using mouse mutants without cilia or with immotile cilia that fluid flow has a critical role in conveying a LR biased signal to the nearby cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nonaka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Supp et al., 1999</xref>), both the nature of the signal and its detection mechanism remain elusive. The mechanosensory hypothesis postulates that fluid flow can be mechanically sensed by cilia, through a Polycystin protein complex involving PKD1L1 and PKD2 cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Field et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kamura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, the chemosensory hypothesis posits that vesicular parcels or extracellular vesicles containing an unknown chemical determinant are transported by the directional fluid flow towards the left side of the mouse node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartwright et al., 2020</xref>). However, the existence of such signaling morphogen has not yet been confirmed or any evidence for extra-cellular vesicle endocytosis or content release has ever been revealed with the exception of the work from Hirokawa’s lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The difficulty in testing which hypothesis is correct relies on the fact that it is virtually impossible to perform genetic manipulations of the LRO cell secretion pathway without impacting cilia length or motility. This is not surprising if we think that any perturbation in lipid or protein trafficking affects motile cilia function, which reflects an experimental impossibility, because to test chemosensation we need to keep fluid mechanics constant. To address these 20 year-long-standing questions, we decided to take a step back and unequivocally determine the developmental period for left-right initiation. We envisaged that by determining the critical time-window within the 7 hr lifetime of the zebrafish LRO, we could then characterize its fluid flow and, thus, narrow down the variables that contribute to left-right establishment. Ultimately, we aimed at obtaining evidence for one or the other model for LR initiation as current scenarios fail to fully uncouple the LRO hydrodynamics from the potential role of fluid flow in transporting vesicles or molecules with signalling properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cartwright et al., 2020</xref>). The LRO is filled with fluid, but the nature of the fluid content is unknown because, so far, its minute volume, around one hundred picolitres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roxo-Rosa et al., 2015</xref>), prevented a detailed biochemical analysis. However, the swelling mechanism of the LRO lumen is known to be driven by the chloride channel known as cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that, when impaired, predictably leads to empty LROs and left-right defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navis et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is possible to block the swelling process by using pharmacology, anti-sense technology or mutants for CFTR, without affecting cilia number or motility. However, manipulation with precision and higher resolution in time was lacking.</p><p>To determine the sensitive time-window for LR initiation, we devised a novel assay that allows for highly controlled mechanical manipulation of the LRO fluid. We performed total fluid extractions from the LRO at different developmental time points only 30 min apart. After confirming that the KV was still present and able to refill, we followed the development of each embryo until organ laterality could be determined. This approach led us to narrow the time-window for symmetry breaking to 1-hr, from 4 to 6 ss, corresponding to the cell rearrangement period mechanistically explained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref> and initially noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreiling et al., 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okabe et al., 2008</xref>. During this time interval, we found fluid flow to be mild but already directional. Extraction of LRO fluid at 5 ss led to 35% of WT embryos with both heart and liver incorrect localization. Embryos did not develop LR defects when the original KV fluid was replaced with Danieau’s buffer, but LR axis was perturbed when viscosity of the same buffer was increased. Altogether, our experiments suggest that fluid flow mechanics, contrary to the nature of fluid content, has a major role in LR initial establishment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fluid extraction affects LR during 1-hr time-window</title><p>KV fluid flow was disrupted by performing fluid extraction at each LRO developmental stage using a microscope-based micromanipulation setup connected to microfluidic actuators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We envisaged that if we found the sensitive time-period, we could then investigate with more precision the properties that were necessary and sufficient to break LR. For this purpose, we challenged WT embryos by extracting the liquid from their LRO lumen from 3 to 12 ss (see extraction <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> at 8 ss and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref> at 5 ss). Manipulated embryos that recovered the LRO liquid, were later characterized according to heart and liver laterality. This procedure intendedly depleted the LRO fluid transiently, disrupting the flow generated by motile cilia, while at the same time it potentially extracted any molecular signals that are present in the fluid.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluid extractions uncover a sensitive one-hour interval.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation on the micromanipulation setup developed for the zebrafish LRO fluid extraction throughout development.

Concomitantly, we analysed cilia beat frequency (CBF) of motile cilia, by high-speed video microscopy.

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>), cilia from control ‘Sham’ embryos at 6 ss (n=7) were predominantly motile (82±4 SEM %) and localized preferentially to the anterior half of the LRO (Fisher test, <italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The total number of motile cilia for each analysed ‘Sham’ embryo revealed some intrinsic embryo variability even among the control group as reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sampaio et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, in the manipulated group (n=6 embryos), motile cilia were more abundant (78 ± 10 %) and were distributed more anteriorly (Fisher test p-value &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, no significant differences were found for the ratio of motile / immotile cilia between manipulated group compared to ‘Sham’ controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Although most embryos recovered the fluid extraction procedure without LR defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), some presented both heart and liver misplacements, starting with intervention at 3 ss (2/13 embryos, 15%, p-value = 0.235), becoming more pronounced for intervention at 4 ss (7/26 embryos, 27%, Fisher test, p-value = 0.002) and peaking with intervention at 5 ss (14/40 embryos, 35%; Fisher test, p-value = 6.44e-7). LR organ misplacements then became progressively non-significant from 6 ss onwards (4/27 embryos, 19%; Fisher test, p-value = 0.865; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At this point, as a response to the fluid extraction challenge, we had identified the most sensitive time-window for LR establishment. Next, we wanted to investigate in detail what were the factors that did not allow some of the challenged embryos to recover the correct laterality.</p><p>To elucidate how fluid depletion affected LR signalling, we examined the expression pattern of <italic>dand5</italic>. It is well established that in WT embryos, zebrafish <italic>dand5</italic> is mainly expressed on the right side of the LRO at 8 ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>) due to left-sided decrease of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA. Thus, we first evaluated <italic>dand5</italic> expression pattern at 8 ss in embryos that were manipulated at 5 ss, which was the developmental stage with highest incidence of LR defects upon liquid extraction. We observed that <italic>dand5</italic> expression also became abnormally bilateral in 35% of the cases (6/17 manipulated embryos compared to 0/26 controls, Fisher test, p-value = 0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) suggesting that either lack of fluid flow or depletion of a molecular signal prevented left-sided degradation of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA. Next, to further challenge the system we performed an additional fluid extraction 1 hr after the first intervention when enough liquid was replenished, at 7 ss. Results showed a similar proportion of bilateral <italic>dand5</italic> expression (6/16, 37.5%) to that observed at 5 ss (comparing both plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Fisher test p-value = 0.728). This experiment confirmed that fluid extractions at 7 ss no longer affect LR development significantly, as already implied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. To continue the investigation on a potential deficiency in flow recovery in the ‘LR Defects’ group after fluid extraction at 5 ss, we next assessed how fluid flow dynamics varied with time by retrospectively comparing embryos with and without LR defects.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>LRO recovers lumen area after fluid extraction</title><p>The lumen of manipulated LROs started to expand soon after fluid extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the fluid secretion machinery mediated by CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roxo-Rosa et al., 2015</xref>) was not collaterally affected by the manipulation procedure and was able to drive the swelling of the LRO lumen. Our observations contrasted with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hojo et al., 2007</xref>) of irreversibly emptied LROs after manipulations, highlighting that the technical approach developed in this work confers minimal damage to the LRO core structure.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gokey et al., 2016</xref> showed that below 1300 μm<sup>2</sup> of KV cross-sectional area at 8 ss, LR patterning could be compromised. Therefore, a scenario where some LROs replenish better than others could explain a differential recovery, enabling the correct organ patterning in most, but not all embryos. Thus, we first investigated if there were significant differences in fluid recovery between manipulated embryos that developed LR defects from those that did not. We performed LRO fluid extraction at 5 ss and followed the recovery of the LRO cross-sectional area and fluid dynamics along development (at 6 ss, 7 ss and 8 ss, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As expected, the LROs from the control group (‘Sham’) were larger at each sampled time point (t-test, p-value &lt;0.05) compared to the fluid extracted groups Further, our results showed that the LRO area was similar as well as the area change per somite (t-test, pvalue &gt;0.05) in manipulated embryos that developed a normal organ patterning (‘No Defects’ group) and those that developed incorrect LR axis establishment ‘Defects’ group, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fluid flow angular velocity is reduced in manipulated embryos showing LR developmental defects</title><p>Flow can be determined by following native particles in KV as a proxy for tracking fluid directly.

following significant fixed (embryo-independent) effects: (i) a significant reduction of angular velocity in the ‘Defects group’ (p-value = 1.2e-5, coefficient –0.13 rad/s), (ii) greater angular velocity in the anterior compared with posterior region of the LRO (p-value = 6.3e-98, coefficient 0.16 rad/s), (iii) increased flow velocity over time (p-value = 7.1e-6, coefficient 0.021 rad/s/stage), (iv) enhanced left-right difference in the ‘No Defects group’ (p-value = 0.006, coefficient 0.027 rad/s), (v) reduced posterior-anterior difference in the ‘Defects group’ (p-value = 9.5e-5, coefficient –0.041 rad/s), (vi) enhanced posterior-anterior difference in the ‘No Defects group’ (p-value = 0.002, coefficient 0.034 rad/s), (vii) enhanced degree of velocity increase over time in the ’No Defects’ group (p-value = 2.3e-5, coefficient 0.027 rad/s/stage) and (viii) (at marginal significance level) some degree of velocity increase over time in the 'Defects group’ (p-value = 0.041, coefficient 0.013 rad/s/stage).</p><p>It is important to note that the increase in anterior angular velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in the 'No defects' group compared with the 'Sham group' can be explained by the change in size of the Kupffer’s vesicle after extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>): assuming that cilia beating and, therefore, material transport at the periphery is the same in ‘Sham’ group and ‘No-defect’ group, the fluid flow absolute velocity is also unchanged, but in a smaller sphere (R = ~25 µm versus R = ~30 µm) it leads to a proportionally higher angular velocity. In the ‘Defects’ group, despite this geometric effect, the angular velocity suggests that flow velocity was decreased.</p><p>Next, to clarify for further differences we showed that radial velocity was modestly stronger and positive on the left-anterior sections of the LRO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) denoting directionality towards the membrane was enhanced in the ‘No defects’ group.</p><p>Further, between the ‘Defects’ group and the other groups we investigated the directionality of the individual particles as it could provide more cues for localized differences that we observed denoted by negative values for angular velocity indicating the existence of some particles with clockwise flow. We divided the LROs into sections of 30 degrees each and by looking at the direction of each tracked particle in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>), we only found significant differences in directionality when comparing the group ‘Defects’ with the ‘Sham’ control group in anterior sectors of the LRO at 6 ss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). In this region the ‘Defects’ group presented disoriented particle trajectories compared to both the ‘Sham’ control group and the ‘No Defects’ group at 6 ss. This suggests that the manipulation might have regionally perturbed the fluid so that at 6 ss, the earlier time point after extraction, the effect of the transient manipulation was still detectable. Conversely, the ‘No Defects’ group never showed significant differences in directionality compared to the ‘Sham’ control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">6</xref>) for complete data on all sectors of the LRO for 7–8 ss.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Directionality of vector fields changes in embryos that develop LR defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram representing particle directionality.

At 6 ss, we detected a right-sided asymmetry (p-value = 0.0012) that persisted throughout 7 ss (p-value = 0.0015) and 8 ss (p-value = 0.0347), making 6 ss the earliest <italic>dand5</italic> L&lt;R asymmetric expression reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). We also compared the number of detected transcripts on the left and right anterior sides of the KV from 3 to 8 ss and found that <italic>dand5</italic> expression was symmetrical at 3 and 5 ss, but a right-sided anterior asymmetry was established at 6 ss (p-value = 0.0378) and sustained at 7 ss (p-value = 0.0467) and 8 ss (p-value = 0.0197) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Together, these results indicated that <italic>dand5</italic> asymmetry is established at 6 ss, which is 1 hr earlier than the previously reported timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lopes et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, we found that <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA reduced expression on the left-side was mainly restricted to the anterior region of the KV, where flow from right-to-left has stronger angular velocity, suggesting that the left-anterior cells are the first to perceive the flow and show a difference in <italic>dand5</italic> expression. Supporting this idea, Yuan et al. reported significant higher anterior left intraciliary calcium oscillations as an initial response to fluid flow sensing dependent on Pkd2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>).

With this information we highlighted the most sensitive developmental stages. We narrowed the LR time-window for symmetry breaking to 1 hr, peaking at 5 ss. Next, we focused on 5 ss and repeated fluid extractions to study flow recovery dynamics from 6 to 8 ss, carefully analysing progression of midplane area, fluid angular velocity components and flow directionality. Most embryos succeeded to display a correct LR organ <italic>situs</italic> and did so by quickly restoring fluid and flow anterior angular velocity. In embryos with LR defects we found a general decreased anterior angular velocity, a smaller difference between anterior-posterior angular velocity and an abnormal flow directionality in anterior sections of the LRO.</p><p>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref>) showed that in unperturbed embryos the intraciliary calcium signal intensity peaked on the left side of the LRO around 3 ss. This period coincides with the first defects we observed upon depletion of the LRO fluid content. Nevertheless, results and modelling showed that these younger embryos may have greater tolerance to challenges and higher chances of recovering the normal LRO fluid and flow parameters and subsequent correct LR pattern than those extracted at 5 ss. Therefore, physiologically, our results highlighted the most susceptible timing to the fluid manipulation challenge was at 5 ss, which does not mean that intraciliary calcium transients do not occur before or cannot be triggered by using optical tweezers, as recently shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Djenoune et al., 2023</xref> in zebrafish and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh et al., 2023</xref> in mice. Other studies showed that a process of LRO remodelling occurs between 4 and 6 ss resulting in a biased ciliary distribution to the anterior region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreiling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okabe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). It is also at this period that we previously observed an increased number of motile cilia at the expense of immotile cilia, in robustness of the fluid flow and in establishment of characteristic patterns of fluid dynamics, such as the higher flow speed in the anterior dorsal pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). We showed that if the fluid extraction is made until 6 ss the system senses it and there is a response that may compensate the insult but if the extraction is made at 7 ss the LRO does not sense it anymore. This heightened the need of identifying the mechanism that senses the challenge in the relevant short time-interval.</p><p>We therefore proceeded to assess the effect of replacing extracted fluid with either buffer, which simply dilutes the KV contents, or buffer with added methylcellulose, which also increases viscosity and serves here as a positive control. Simple dilution did not significantly affect situs whereas increasing viscosity dramatically increased rates of right situs. Statistical analysis of flow data showed that increasing the viscosity via injection is associated with very strong reduction in angular velocity, a strong reduction in anterior-dominance of the flow, and modestly faster flow on the right compared with the left. By contrast, dilution which does not increase viscosity is associated with a modest reduction in anterior-dominance and a modest reduction in flow acceleration over time. The strong effects appear to explain the effect of viscosity on situs. We therefore concluded that the sensory mechanism detects flow properties, as angular velocity and viscosity but seems to be insensitive if we quickly replace the fluid and keep flow dynamics fairly constant.</p><p>In the presence of a low Reynolds number, when viscosity dominates and inertia is negligible, a sensory system to be efficient must be very sensitive, as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shinohara et al., 2012</xref>. The most plausible mechanosensory system in the zebrafish LRO involves Pkd1l1 and Pkd2, both present in the LRO cilia as shown by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roxo-Rosa and Santos Lopes, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacinto et al., 2021</xref>) and by recent functional studies for Pkd2 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Djenoune et al., 2023</xref>. Although it has not been possible to demonstrate that these two Polycystin proteins function together as a mechanosensory complex in zebrafish, there is evidence to be the case in the mouse node (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Field et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuno et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, patients with mutations in PKD1L1 or in PKD2 present laterality phenotypes such as <italic>situs inversus</italic>, heterotaxia and congenital heart disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bataille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Le Fevre et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Live quantifications of cilia motility along time, using two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tavares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>) attested that in the first stages after the formation of the LRO, there are many more immotile cilia (around 94%) than motile, but then, a gradual loss of cilia immotility occurs during development. The present study showed that in all embryos that developed correct LR ‘Sham’ and ‘No defects’ groups; scored at 6 ss, very few immotile cilia were present (9 on average) in a total average of 43 cilia (n=13 embryos), which is only 20,9% of the total LRO cilia. So, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref>, this fact brings to light that perhaps immotile cilia number is not a crucial factor, at least in zebrafish. A more recent hypothesis for the sensory system in the zebrafish embryo postulates that cilia themselves may sense their own movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yuan et al., 2015</xref> filmed intraciliary calcium oscillations (ICOs) in the zebrafish LRO motile cilia in action and showed that ICOs were abrogated in knockdowns for Pkd2 or in cilia motility mutants. The motile cilia self-sensing model becomes appealing in view of the flow response to increased viscosity. Motile cilia pattern and power are known to differ at increasing viscosities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kikuchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallagher et al., 2019</xref>), which could potentially be detected by a ciliary mechanosensitive transduction channel, like in the fish lateral line where stereocilia bending allows sensing the velocity and direction of water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadnia et al., 2016</xref>). In summary, we suggest that a ciliary mechanosensory system, such as Pkd1l1/Pkd2 could be sensitive to a sustained flow angular velocity.</p><p><inline-graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="gif" xlink:href="elife-83861-inf001-v1.gif"/>The role of Pkd2 and calcium in LR symmetry breaking is now unquestionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Djenoune et al., 2023</xref>). Both these recent studies elegantly suggest a mechanosensing component in LR symmetry breaking, totally independently from our work. A previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delling et al., 2016</xref> contradicted the idea that crown cells LRO cilia were good calcium-responsive mechanosensors. Conversely, work from Hamada’s lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Minegishi et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated that LR asymmetric intraciliary calcium transients can be in fact detected at the node. Mizuno and colleagues further revealed that discrepancies between the two studies relate to the culture conditions used, which led calcium signals to be missed in the work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delling et al., 2016</xref>. Moreover, Minegishi et al. unveiled that in the mouse model, the 3′-UTR of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA responds to the direction of fluid flow in a Pkd2-dependent manner via stimulating Bicc1 and Ccr4-Not. Together, these molecular players seem to mediate <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA degradation specifically on the left side of the mouse node and <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrocel roof plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maerker et al., 2021</xref>). Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh et al., 2023</xref> provides the first evidence-based mechanism for how Pkd2 channels may be preferentially activated by the flow on the left-side of the mouse node. Katoh et al. show asymmetric enrichment of Pkd2 protein in the ciliary membrane of each crown cell cilium with reference to the midline.</p><p>We and others showed that in zebrafish there is a counterclockwise flow direction and an anterior-posterior positive ratio in angular velocity, which causes a stronger right-to-left flow anteriorly compared to a slower flow from left-to-right posteriorly. Our fluid extraction experiments highlighted these two properties must be met for zebrafish to recover and succeed in symmetry breaking in a defined time-window. So, cells at the anterior-left pole are likely to experience stronger flow as showed by radial velocity denoting flow directionality towards the membrane was enhanced in this region.</p><p>Concomitantly, performing cellular resolution smFISH showed anterior left sided cells are the first to show a reduction in <italic>dand5</italic> expression as early as 6 ss. How the anterior right to left stronger flow is mechanistically and molecularly translated into anterior-left reduction of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA remains unclear in zebrafish. If <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA decay is the process involved, then this is a relatively fast process (measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katoh et al., 2023</xref>), which physiologically should happen straight after the sensitive time-window we defined here. So, the observed left-anterior reduction of <italic>dand5</italic> expression at 6 ss matches the correct spot and timing. Therefore, in a consistent timeline, most zebrafish embryos start to display a LRO lumen by 2 ss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oteíza et al., 2008</xref> and our own lab), then according to our data, reach a physiological window for breaking symmetry at 4 ss that persists until 6 ss, culminating with the first left-sided <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA reduction at 6 ss.</p><p>According to a recent evolutionary developmental biology publication, there are five conserved genes that are predicted to be involved in symmetry breaking in vertebrates with ciliated LROs, we can only speculate that perhaps CIROP and/or Metalloproteinase21 function, predicted to be downstream of flow, may further explain the left-sided <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szenker-Ravi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>After fluid extraction, the time lag and complexity of the fluid flow recovery process motivated the development of a mathematical model of flow, its variability, and the effect of experimental interventions, with the aim of determining the sensitivity of KV to its own flow field through fitting experimental data. The core idea of the model is to represent symmetry breaking as a random process which is biased by flow. The analysis took account of natural variability in the flow field and its modification by intervention, with the biasing effects of each stage to be determined through fitting, and for a comparison to be made against alternative models in which only later developmental stages are important. This analysis confirmed the critical importance of 4 ss to 6 ss in symmetry breaking, and the limited role for flow during 7 ss and 8 ss. The process of constructing the model also emphasised that intervention has two effects: the transient gross reduction in flow associated with removal of the entire luminal fluid, but also a greater variance of flow following recovery – hence observed defects are as much a consequence of a proportion of embryos making a below average recovery, as the interruption itself.</p><p>Finally, we need to discuss whether our experiments exclude the potential contribution of signalling morphogens or EV secretion to LR establishment. Literature on EV secretion rates is scarce but we found an estimate of 60–80 EVs per cell per hour is expected, depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiu et al., 2016</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferreira et al., 2017</xref> in a simulated transport of signaling molecules in the Kupffer’s vesicle between 9–14 ss, mixing would take only 8 s to occur. At 5 ss, at the peak of physiological symmetry breaking, we estimate that mixing would take longer to occur because flow is weaker than at 9–14 ss, but nevertheless it would be fast, perhaps taking a few minutes. Thus, according to this line of thought, it is still possible that secretion of morphogens or EVs can occur between fluid extraction at 5 ss and the limit of the responsive time-window by 7 ss (1 hr interval). The only problem with this hypothesis is that all fluid extraction experiments (n=33) resulted in <italic>dand5</italic> defects at 8 ss, except when we replaced the fluid with physiological buffer. If a secreted molecule was being continuously replenished for 1 hr, we would expect absence of <italic>dand5</italic> defective phenotypes in all extraction experiments since the extractions were performed at 5 ss and the fixation for <italic>dand5</italic> conventional in situ hybridization was done at 8 ss, meaning 2 hr later, allowing enough time for recovery of any secreted factor within the competent time-window. Therefore, our results suggest the zebrafish LRO is more sensitive to mechanical properties for breaking symmetry.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fish husbandry and strains</title><p>Zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, were maintained at 25 °C or 30 °C and staged as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>) according to the number of somites.

Individually embryos were hold from the anterior dorsal side of the body using a holding pipette while a second pipette was used to penetrate the LRO from the posterior dorsal side. After extracting the LRO liquid the microinjection pipette was withdrawn, and embryos were incubated and let to develop. Collectively 173 embryos were manipulated along the different stages.

The micromanipulation system, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, was composed of an inverted microscope (Andor Revolution WD, Oxford Instruments; or Nikon Eclipse Ti-U) with a 10 x Plan DL air objective, a 60 x Plan Apo VC water immersion and a 100 x Plan Fluor oil immersion objective (Nikon), a set of two motorized axis manipulators (MPC-385–2, Sutter Instruments) placed on both sides of a culture dish for moving pipettes to the desired positions, a CMOS camera (Monochrome UI3370CP-M-GL, Imaging Development Systems GmbH; or high speed FASTCAM MC2 camera, Photron Europe, Limited) to capture images in the microscope field of view, and a set of two CellTram’s (CellTram Vario, FemtoJet, Eppendorf). Each respective microinjector are connected to a holding micropipette for immobilizing the zebrafish embryo, and injection micropipette that allows fluid manipulation from or to the Kupffer’s vesicle (KV). All the setup components were constructed over an optical table with vibration isolation (ThorLabs) to minimize the effects of any residual vibrations or disturbances introduced during the embryo manipulation procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immobilizing embryos</title><p>The embryo holding step was based on immobilization of the embryo by a pipette positioned on its left side in order to allow the injection micropipette to be introduced from the right side through the dorsal tissue into the KV. Of the several positions tested immobilization by the zone dorsal to the developing head of the embryo was the most effective. Unlike the yolk, the back of the head offered a resistant tissue with a shape that easily adapted to the diameter of the holding pipette. At the same time this setup allowed the KV to be aligned with the microinjection needle field of action. The creation of a chamber for easy handling of the injection micropipettes while keeping the specimen in an aqueous solution was crucial for the success of this procedure. Using silicone grease (Dow Corning) a rectangular coating was outlined on a coverslip. Next, a sufficient amount of embryo medium E3 was carefully pipetted on the coverslip forming a liquid pond. This setup contained zebrafish embryos in an aqueous environment with very low physical impediment, allowing a high range of contact angle for micropipette manipulation to happen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pipette forging for micropipette extractions</title><p>During its developmental time period the LRO or KV will migrate from 70 to 120 µm below the tail mesodermal cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kimmel et al., 1995</xref>). Consequently, vesicular fluid extraction and compound microinjection procedures require resistant sharp capillaries capable of piercing through the tail tissue dorsal to the KV. Micropipette tip size and shape of the taper are crucial factors determining if a micropipette will effectively impale the embryo tissue. Small tips and uniform tapers have the great advantage of causing less cell damage (Sutter Instrument, pipette cookbook, 2008) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sutter.com/contact/faqs/pipette_cookbook.pdf">http://www.sutter.com/contact/faqs/pipette_cookbook.pdf</ext-link>. Likewise, a shorter tapered and very stiff micropipette is needed to penetrate very tough and rigid membranes.</p><p>Aluminosilicate glass capillaries are known to have an increased hardness and ability to form small tips compared with its borosilicate counterpart, allowing to form stiff longer tapers important for reaching the KV and avoiding unwanted tissue damage. Taking this in consideration, microinjection pipettes (Aluminosilicate, inner diameter 0.68 mm, outer diameter 1.00, length 10 mm, without inner filament) were designed using a custom-made program in a horizontal filament puller (P-97 Micropipette Puller, Sutter Instrument). Reduced cone angle and slender taper can be achieved using a 2-loop puller program.</p><p>The resulting pulled pipettes were often sealed or have a very narrow tip (&lt;1 µm). Shaping the tip to the desirable size was important to avoid clogging of the pipette and deliver a sharp cut when impaling the embryo tissue. Therefore, the tips of micropipettes were shaped to small apertures (&lt;5 µm) under the microscope. Using the motorized manipulators, the tips were carefully cut-opened against a polished borosilicate capillary. This allows to have a balance between micropipette longevity and minimal tissue damage during embryo manipulation. For better results reducing the amount of mechanical stress caused by the needle injection, a micropipette beveller (BV-10, Sutter Instrument) was used to increase sharpness of the pipette tips. This additional step was not always carried out due to the significant time increase in preparation of each micropipette.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Holding pipette</title><p>Since our organism of interest is immersed in an aqueous non-viscous solution, oscillations of the zebrafish embryo are a major concern during micromanipulation. Thus, special care should be taken to assure a rigid stable connection between the embryo tissue and the tip of the micropipette.

Ideal holding pipettes have a flat straight break at the tip with large inner and outer diameter to provide better attachment and support to the zebrafish embryo. Fire-polishing was then performed to create a smooth surface to interface with the embryo tissue without damaging it, and produce an inner diameter (around 0.50 mm) best suited to hold the embryo as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Flaming, 1974</xref>, where a common Bunsen burner or a micro forge (MF-900, Narishige) were used to fire-polish the holding pipette.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cilia number, length and anterior-posterior distribution in fixed samples</title><p>To ensure that low damage is caused during embryo manipulation we further quantified KV cilia number and length upon fluid extraction.

On the first day of the protocol, the embryos were rehydrated in a series of MeOH and PBSTw solutions (50% and 100% PBSTw) before the manual removal of the chorion. The embryos were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 300 µL of pre-hybridization buffer (10% formamide, 2 x SSC, 0.1% TritonX-100, 0.02% BSA, and 2 mM ribonucleoside-vanadyl complex [NEB]). This was followed by ON incubation in the dark at 30 °C with probes diluted 1:100 in 100 µL of hybridization buffer (10% dextran sulfate dissolved in pre-hybridization buffer) and anti-GFP (1:500; Invitrogen) diluted in hybridization buffer with the probes. After staining, the embryos were washed twice for 30 min each at 30 °C in a hybridization washing solution (10% formamide, 2 x SSC, and 0.1% Triton X-100), followed by a brief rinse in a solution of 2 x SSC and 0.1% Tween-20, and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in 0.2 X SSC. The embryos were then incubated for 2 h at room temperature in the dark with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500), followed by six washes with PBSTw for 5 min each. Embryos were then incubated with DAPI for 15 min at RT in the dark, followed by two washes in 2 x SSC and 0.1% Tween-20 for 5 min each. If not mounted immediately, the embryos were stored in 2 x SSC at 4 °C in the dark.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>SmFISH imaging and analysis</title><p>Imaging of the embryos was performed using a Zeiss LSM-980 Airyscan Confocal Microscope equipped with Airyscan SR detectors and controlled by Zen software version 3.3. The z-stack acquisition was achieved using a 40 X water immersion objective and a 1.8×zoom factor, with images obtained at 0.18 μm intervals. 3D datasets were analyzed using the software IMARIS v. 9.8.2. The first step was to align the axes with the notochord, visible in the DAPI channel, by rotating the image and applying the ‘Free Rotate’ image processing setting. A surface representation of the KV was then generated by manually tracing it in the AF 488 channel. The surface was then used to mask the Atto565 and DAPI channels to eliminate voxels outside the surface. Next, an automatic detection setting was applied to the masked DAPI channel to create a surface representation of the nuclei, which was then used to mask the Atto565 channel and to remove the fluorescence signal from the nuclei. Finally, the KV was divided into two regions of interest, and automatic spot detection was applied to these ROIs to quantify the number of cytoplasmic <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA transcripts. An XZ clipping plane was used to select only the spots on either the anterior or posterior side, allowing the extraction of the anterior and posterior number of spots on both sides of the KV.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Flow speed, angular velocity, and particle directionality</title><p>The flow speed, angular velocities and velocity components were calculated by customized scripts in the program environment R (Supplementary data). The centre of the LRO was used as reference point of a polar coordinate system in which angles are expressed in radians. To study the flow dynamics near the LRO apical membrane, tracked points near the centre (corresponding to a circle with half of the LRO radius) were removed, as angular quantities are poorly defined along the axis of rotation, close to the centre of the LRO. Angular velocity represents the effective circular flow magnitude of a particle moving between two consecutive time frames. The centre of the KV was used as reference point of a polar coordinate system in which angles are expressed in radians. Instantaneous angular velocity (rad/sec) was calculated by dividing particle angle change by the time between consecutive image frames (0.2 s). Particle directionality quantification at any given point was obtained by dividing the LRO in 30 degree sections and calculating the change of particle angle between two consecutive time frames, where the axis of the reference is the position of the particle in the first time point. The particle directionality values range from 0 to 2π.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Fluid dilution and viscosity manipulation in the zebrafish LRO</title><p>The KV fluid dilution assay was performed by aspirating the vesicular fluid into a micropipette previously filled with Danieau’s solution 1 x (58 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 0.6 mM Ca(NO3)2, 5.0 mM HEPES pH 7.6) diluted in 10,000 MW rhodamine-dextran solution (1:4; Sigma-Aldrich). The mixed solution was injected again into the KV and only embryos with rhodamine-positive KV’s were selected for the experiment. For viscosity manipulation, the micropipette was filled with Danieau’s solution 1 x containing 1.5% (w/v) of methylcellulose (M0555, Sigma). Aspirated KV fluid and methylcellulose were then injected again into the KV lumen until reaching the KV volume observed before the manipulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A Fisher’s exact test performed with RStudio was used to compare frequency of left-right defects and <italic>dand5</italic> expression patterns between WT and manipulated embryos. To assess potential differences in KV area, cilia number, cilia length between WT and manipulated embryos Student’s t-test was used. To assess area changes per somite Mann-Whitney U test was used. To assess cilia motility differences between anterior and posterior regions Fisher’s exact test was used. Kolmogrov-Smirnov test was used from comparing particle trajectory distribution between two groups. Angular velocity data for tracks imaged in each of the suction and injection experiments was analysed via linear mixed effects regression to characterise how angular velocity varies across LRO and over time, how these velocity field patterns are altered due to intervention, and how they are reflected by different embryo fates. Fixed effects were group (injection experiment: sham, buffer injection, methylcellulose; suction experiment: sham, no-defects, defects), somite stage, normalised posterior-anterior axis coordinate, normalised left-right axis coordinate, and interactions of group with somite stage, posterior-anterior and left-right coordinates.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please revise the conclusions on the proposed mechanism and reduce the strong emphasis made on the role of mechanical forces. The set of experiments presented is not sufficient to make strong conclusions on the mechanism of the mechanosensory hypothesis because the fluid extraction experiments affect both chemical and physical features. This, it is not possible to disentangle the two with this approach. Please also attend to the comments of the reviewers as detailed below.</p><p>2. Please provide more context for the computational modeling.</p><p>3. It is important that the authors discuss their results in light of the recent papers of Hiroshi Hamada and Shiaolou Yuan published in Science. In particular, the Yuan lab shows that left-right symmetry breaking occurs between 1-4 somites in zebrafish which contrasts with what the Lopes lab proposes in their manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are some specific comments to help the authors to help improve their work for subsequent submission:</p><p>1) The authors claim that symmetry breaking occurs in one-hour intervals in the LRO, however, it looks like there is a trend for 3SS and 4SS embryos to present left-right defects, but the embryo number is extremely low for these datapoints (n=13 and n=26, respectively). Increasing the embryo number will certainly lead to statistical significance. The authors should provide dand5 expression after LRO liquid extraction in embryos at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and ss to validate their observation. The authors should provide alternative methods to conditional block flow should be provided to confirm this result (conditional inactivation of cilia motility) or other types of ablation.</p><p>2) About the mechanosensory hypothesis/chemosensory hypothesis. The authors try to show that the chemosensory hypothesis is not valid to demonstrate that it is the mechanosensory hypothesis that prevails. The authors exclude the chemical hypothesis based on the fluid replacement experiment, which is a negative result. The authors propose that since there are no left-right defects when we replace the KV fluids with inert fluids, this means that it cannot be a chemical factor at work in the system. However, the authors never exclude the possibility that once the fluids are replaced, the cells of the Kupffer's vesicle quickly secrete back any diffusible factor they can secrete. Without excluding this very likely possibility, this conclusion does not stand. Other important comments: Figure1c: the legend is the following: 'dand5 expression pattern after intervention for LRO liquid extraction in a subset of fixed embryos at 8 ss'. When was the intervention? How many embryos were analysed here?</p><p>Figure 3: why not show velocity? Why interval 4-6ss for LR establishment? The defective embryos show a reduced flow at 8ss; it is possible that the extraction at 5ss damages the flow and leads to defects during later readout? Figure2 and 3: Do the authors see a left-right difference in velocity? If not, they should comment on it.</p><p>Detailed comments on some conclusions:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, if a signalling molecule contained in the LRO fluid was needed for dand5 mRNA degradation, then the prediction would be that the DB dilution experiment resulted in many more embryos with dand5 bilateral expression pattern than it did, as well as more heart misplacements.&quot; This conclusion is not valid. A signalling molecule that is present in the fluid over a longer time obviously can't discriminate between L and R. The chemosensitive hypothesis, as discussed in Ferreira 2017, proposes secretion in the anterior region and detection a few seconds later. Buffer replacement wouldn't affect this mechanism.</p><p>&quot;Alternatively, if we attempt to interpret these results within a chemosensory mechanism, the dilution of a moving extracellular vesicle (EV) or molecule within could only occur without impacting LR if its secretion rate was sufficiently high to allow a fast turnover. This last hypothesis, however, is very unlikely and was refuted when we showed a limited response capacity to recover the asymmetric dand5 expression, after a second extraction intervention (Figure S4) that was performed one hour later than the first extractions in the same embryos (Figure 1c).&quot; This part is very confusing: How can the second extraction experiment rule out the chemical hypothesis? Any chemical that can be secreted back within minutes in the LRO would explain these results very well.</p><p>&quot;So, according to Ferreira et al. (2017), this fact brings to light that perhaps immotile cilia number is not a crucial factor at least in zebrafish.&quot; The authors should expand and explain better what they mean here. Reading Ferreira et al. in detail, I could not find any claim stating that the immotile cilia number is not a crucial factor.</p><p>&quot;The fact that CBF is significantly lower in the methylcellulose injected embryos (Figure 4g) suggests that may be there is a minimum CBF threshold for the sensory system to generate efficient ICOs.&quot; The system would need to be very sensitive if a 25% frequency reduction messes up the mechanism. How about temperature fluctuation, etc.?</p><p>&quot;However, our data does not show a consistent difference in left versus right angular velocity and correct LR development, leading us to suggest that anterior flow is the relevant factor not left.&quot; The authors should clarify how and what exactly is sensed by the system, is it flow direction or flow magnitude? They suggest that &quot;Pkd1l1/ Pkd2 could be sensitive to flow magnitude&quot; with no experiment to back this up. How flow magnitude could break left-right symmetry if not different between the right and left sides of the LRO?</p><p>&quot;Our data highlights anterior flow magnitude as a major mechanical property in LR. Interventions that decreased flow magnitude or reduced its A/P difference were the ones that generated abnormal LR outcomes.&quot; How can this work? In any mechanosensitive scenario, the flow needs to be detected on the side. Anterior flow magnitude alone can't break the symmetry unless the authors propose a new mechanism.</p><p>Any methyl-cellulose injection: A mechanosensitive cilium can only detect forces, not velocities. So in a dense fluid, the forces should actually be enhanced. With chemicals, it is hard to say – the Peclet number will increase drastically, which improves the directionality but also reduces detection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions to help improve the paper for readers:</p><p>1) The linear mixed-effects model isn't well explained and the figures that accompany this part of the article are hard to parse. Not being an expert in mathematical models, I am unable to get anything meaningful from these analyses. For example, I can't look at Table 1 or the explanation and understand what these numbers are supposed to indicate. I can't understand what the bars indicate in Figure 6 even though I understand the experiments that are supposedly represented. It would be helpful to have a bit more explanation for the audience for this information to be more impactful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83861.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Additionally, there may be a difference in the background of the zebrafish lines used between our lab and Yuan lab, as the KV lumen often opens at 2 ss (Oteíza et al., 2008). This point /possibility was also taken by Shiaolu Yuan and was later included in their published article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Here are some specific comments to help the authors to help improve their work for subsequent submission:</p><p>1) The authors claim that symmetry breaking occurs in one-hour intervals in the LRO, however, it looks like there is a trend for 3SS and 4SS embryos to present left-right defects, but the embryo number is extremely low for these datapoints (n=13 and n=26, respectively).

So, we are considering 4 to 6 ss as the major interval for symmetry breaking, meaning that 4 ss is already included in the interval.</p><p>We do acknowledge the trend is there for 3 ss but experimentally, this is the most challenging stage as the KV is very, very small (lumen opens at 2 ss Oteíza et al., 2008). So, to perform extractions that still result in embryos that are able to refill the liquid (which was an important criteria) is not trivial and we tried it for longer that for the other stages. So, we have stopped trying at 13 embryos that show a trend and therefore we present a model that also shows 3 ss extractions are an important contributor for the symmetry breaking. So, we could indeed include 3 ss and state the relevant physiological interval is from 3 ss to 6 ss which translates in 1.5h. We thank the reviewer for pointing this out but statistically we need to keep the 4-6 ss window. We also note that the intervention disrupts flow at least half an hour (1 somite stage) and increases variability for much longer and so inferring critical period is not simple – which forms the motivation for building and fitting the probabilistic model of signal integration and symmetry breaking.</p><p>We also note that selectively conducting more experiments in pursuit of a statistical significance threshold constitutes ‘p-hacking’ and therefore would not be sound science at this stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide dand5 expression after LRO liquid extraction in embryos at 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and ss to validate their observation.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the request that <italic>dand5</italic> expression should be included after each extraction, we have to explain to the reviewer that such a request represents at least one year of work. I am afraid this is not possible to perform at this stage. Both Pedro and Sara are gone from the lab and I would have to train extensively to do it myself. Pedro trained one year to be good at this technique. Most important, our aim was indeed to look at organs as a readout because we wanted to find the most sensitive period of time that resulted in real <italic>situs</italic> defects (meaning organ defects) and also find the proportion of heterotaxy versus <italic>situs inversus</italic> cases. We did not want to use a readout that was early as 8 ss. We then explored in detail the extraction stage that showed more <italic>situs</italic> defects – 5 ss, at which we extracted more embryos and fixed embryos at 8 ss to perform <italic>dand5 in situ</italic> hybridizations. We had an extremely similar proportion of <italic>dand5</italic> mRNA defects compared to <italic>situs</italic> defects. So, we also think this request represents a duplication of work that will not add much to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide alternative methods to conditional block flow should be provided to confirm this result (conditional inactivation of cilia motility) or other types of ablation.</p></disp-quote><p>It is known and it is extensively published that cilia immotility will result in LR defects. We did not want to show this. On the contrary, we wanted to keep every parameter intact as much as possible and only extract the fluid without affecting cilia motility. It is known that blocking cilia motility at 1 cell stage or by using cilia motility mutants, will generate random situs and provide stronger phenotypes than our extraction experiment. Alternatively, as suggested by the reviewer, conditional mutants for cilia immotility are not available and would represent another phD project at least. We would love to do it in the future with a new grant and new students but we are afraid this is impossible to perform at the moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) About the mechanosensory hypothesis/chemosensory hypothesis.

We apologize because we had included a final paragraph in the discussion on this subject of the current manuscript that the reviewer missed entirely. Please read what we wrote regarding the potential secretion on the last page, last paragraph, last version.

The intervention was at 5 ss for the single extraction and at 5 and 7 ss for the double extractions. We added this information to the legend and Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many embryos were analysed here?</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry, this information was only present in the text (in previous page 6) and we agree it should be copied to the figure legend in a more clear way (6/17 manipulated embryos at 5 ss showed <italic>dand5</italic> expression defects compared to 0/26 in non-manipulated controls, Fisher test, p-value = 0.002; Figure 1C) and 6/16 double extracted embryos at 5 and 7 ss showed dand5 expression defects. When comparing single and double extractions we found no significant difference (Fisher test p-value = 0.728).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: why not show velocity?</p></disp-quote><p>We find this question confusing, velocity is a vectorial parameter, which velocity does the reviewer refer to? Angular velocity is shown and is the correct parameter to show in a spheroid organ. We have however, added in supplementary data, plots for tangential velocity and radial velocity (Supplemental Figures 4 and 5), which we mention on page 12 and discuss further now in page 27, 1<sup>st</sup> paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why interval 4-6ss for LR establishment?</p></disp-quote><p>Because our experimental data in Figure 1 shows this is the physiological interval at which embryos are more sensitive to the fluid extraction manipulation. The probabilistic model of signal integration also shows that only models in which there is sensitivity to flow between 4-6ss are capable of making a satisfactory fit to experimental data (compare Figures 6A, D, G, J and M).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The defective embryos show a reduced flow at 8ss; it is possible that the extraction at 5ss damages the flow and leads to defects during later readout?</p></disp-quote><p>At 8 ss angular velocity is indeed reduced. Yes, it is possible. We show that the embryos that show defects have lower anterior angular velocity patterns and have slower recovery over time (Table 1 shows all the significant parameters that are changed).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure2 and 3: Do the authors see a left-right difference in velocity? If not, they should comment on it</p></disp-quote><p>We did observe a significant LR difference in angular velocity. This is clearly shown in the p-values in Table 1. From Table 1 we can extract that for the no-defects group we saw a LR axis difference (p=0.006176 **) for the defects group we lose this difference (p=0.79567) for the sham controls we did not see a LR difference (p=0.57655).</p><p>The multivariable linear regression of Table 1 shows that there is no significant trend in left-right position affecting angular velocity, but there is a trend within the ‘no-defects’ group. This is commented on page 10 ‘(iv) enhanced left-right difference in the ‘No Defects group’ (p-value=0.006, coefficient 0.027 rad/s)’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>.</p><p>Detailed comments on some conclusions:</p><p>&quot;Indeed, if a signalling molecule contained in the LRO fluid was needed for dand5 mRNA degradation, then the prediction would be that the DB dilution experiment resulted in many more embryos with dand5 bilateral expression pattern than it did, as well as more heart misplacements.&quot; This conclusion is not valid. A signalling molecule that is present in the fluid over a longer time obviously can't discriminate between L and R. The chemosensitive hypothesis, as discussed in Ferreira 2017, proposes secretion in the anterior region and detection a few seconds later. Buffer replacement wouldn't affect this mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we disagree with the reviewer. Buffer replacement affects this mechanism at a short time scale. Again, the predictions by Ferreira et al. (2017) are just predictions. Nobody measured any signaling molecule dynamics yet. Here we performed direct manipulations to the fluid that must result in mixing and advection at a short scale and are denoted in our results at Table 2 when looking at Interaction: DB injection and time (p=0.0099937 ***).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Alternatively, if we attempt to interpret these results within a chemosensory mechanism, the dilution of a moving extracellular vesicle (EV) or molecule within could only occur without impacting LR if its secretion rate was sufficiently high to allow a fast turnover. This last hypothesis, however, is very unlikely and was refuted when we showed a limited response capacity to recover the asymmetric dand5 expression, after a second extraction intervention (Figure S4) that was performed one hour later than the first extractions in the same embryos (Figure 1c).&quot; This part is very confusing: How can the second extraction experiment rule out the chemical hypothesis? Any chemical that can be secreted back within minutes in the LRO would explain these results very well.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, exactly! but it did not happen that way. In the double extraction experiment we did not have recovery of <italic>dand5</italic> expression, which suggests that any potential secretion of molecules did not occur at a sufficiently fast rate. So, in the end, <italic>dand5</italic> defects were maintained in single and double extractions (Figure 1). We alert and inform the reviewer that fixation for <italic>dand5</italic> in situs occurs at 8 ss, which is 2 hours later. However, no recovery of <italic>dand5</italic> expression was noted, even after 2 hours of potential secretion. This is now stated in the end of the Discussion section because it is an important fact to correctly interpret the replacement experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;So, according to Ferreira et al. (2017), this fact brings to light that perhaps immotile cilia number is not a crucial factor at least in zebrafish.&quot; The authors should expand and explain better what they mean here. Reading Ferreira et al. in detail, I could not find any claim stating that the immotile cilia number is not a crucial factor.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing that this point needs further explanation. In the abstract of Ferreira et al. (2017) DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.25078, one can read:</p><p>“Our results show that the number of immotile cilia is too small to ensure robust left and right determination by mechanosensing, given the large spatial variability of the flow. However, motile cilia could sense their own motion by a yet unknown mechanism”.</p><p>This conclusion is given in the abstract because the modelling performed therein led to that statement. In our own argumentation we are considering this conclusion by the Vermot lab and comparing it to our experimental data on supplementary Table 1 and agreeing that they may be correct given that immotile cilia number was also low in our hands, in this present experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The fact that CBF is significantly lower in the methylcellulose injected embryos (Figure 4g) suggests that may be there is a minimum CBF threshold for the sensory system to generate efficient ICOs.&quot; The system would need to be very sensitive if a 25% frequency reduction messes up the mechanism. How about temperature fluctuation, etc.?</p></disp-quote><p>Room temperature was controlled throughout these experiments. I want to bring to light that in Yuan lab last publication (Djenoune et al., 2023) they also noted that the system is very sensitive, and even suggest that noise may be filtered at different levels in WT versus no-flow mutants:</p><p>“We posit that the cilium’s noise filtering capability may be adaptable, as the filter threshold in WT embryos with intrinsic flow appears to be higher than in flowless embryos as suggested by the lower number of responses in WT LRO cilia (Figure 3, I and J) compared with c21orf59 cilia (Figure 3, C and D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;However, our data does not show a consistent difference in left versus right angular velocity and correct LR development, leading us to suggest that anterior flow is the relevant factor not left.&quot; The authors should clarify how and what exactly is sensed by the system, is it flow direction or flow magnitude? They suggest that &quot;Pkd1l1/ Pkd2 could be sensitive to flow magnitude&quot; with no experiment to back this up. How flow magnitude could break left-right symmetry if not different between the right and left sides of the LRO?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spotting this confusing point. We have changed the word magnitude to sustained flow angular velocity (page 26), which is what we tested. We, of course do not know the correct mechanism, as nobody else knows. We were speculating that as Pkd1l1 and Pkd2 are present in all cilia of the zebrafish LRO (see our immunostainings in Roxo-Rosa &amp; Lopes, 2017; Jacinto et al. 2019) a directional sensing capacity (as now observed in mouse node by Hamada’s lab) seemed impossible and therefore we hypothesized that what was being sensed was velocity magnitude = speed of flow, because in our hands and also in Amack’s lab previous work, keeping the ratio between anterior and posterior number of cilia or flow angular velocity seems to matter more. However, recent data from Hamada´s lab (Katoh et al. 2023) has shed light into this problem at least for the mouse system. We discuss this point extensively throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding left and right: setting a clear difference anterior-posteriorly immediately generates a difference L and R because of the inherent counterclockwise direction of flow. So, anterior higher angular velocity causes a right to left flow anteriorly that is stronger than a left to right flow posteriorly. This is stated in the manuscript in the results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Our data highlights anterior flow magnitude as a major mechanical property in LR. Interventions that decreased flow magnitude or reduced its A/P difference were the ones that generated abnormal LR outcomes.&quot; How can this work? In any mechanosensitive scenario, the flow needs to be detected on the side. Anterior flow magnitude alone can't break the symmetry unless the authors propose a new mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Anterior whirling flow is directed towards the left side of KV, so if the anterior flow were dominant, then a mechanosensory mechanism would only need to be able to differentiate flow incoming to the left compared with outgoing from the right. The data of Katoh et al. (Science 2023) suggest that differentiation of incoming versus outgoing flow could be achieved in the mouse node through asymmetric location of Pkd2. So, we don’t believe a new mechanism is necessary here, rather a translation between the whirling flow in KV and leftward flow in mouse node.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Any methyl-cellulose injection: A mechanosensitive cilium can only detect forces, not velocities. So in a dense fluid, the forces should actually be enhanced. With chemicals, it is hard to say – the Peclet number will increase drastically, which improves the directionality but also reduces detection.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret the reviewer as meaning ‘viscous’ rather than ‘dense’ here (as MC minimally affects density). An increase in viscosity will increase forces only if the flow magnitude is the same. However, we know that increasing viscosity significantly affects cilia beat frequency and amplitude, and hence fluid velocity (Table 2 line 3). What is more, MC injection also appears to reduce anterior-posterior asymmetry, which is key to establishing situs. We are unsure of the precise mechanism of how MC reduces AP asymmetry but it is clear that once this effect has occurred, signal transduction will not be enhanced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions to help improve the paper for readers:</p><p>1) The linear mixed-effects model isn't well explained and the figures that accompany this part of the article are hard to parse. Not being an expert in mathematical models, I am unable to get anything meaningful from these analyses. For example, I can't look at Table 1 or the explanation and understand what these numbers are supposed to indicate. I can't understand what the bars indicate in Figure 6 even though I understand the experiments that are supposedly represented. It would be helpful to have a bit more explanation for the audience for this information to be more impactful.</p></disp-quote><p>The comment conflatestwo distinct quantitative analyses, which we acknowledge indicates that greater clarity is needed in the manuscript. We also acknowledge that we should have included more discussion of the findings.</p><p>The first quantitative analysis is the linear mixed effects regression analysis of each experiment (in our revision we now replace ‘model’ with ‘regression’ to minimise confusion) which seeks trends in the angular velocity data depending on location in the node, and taking into account somite stage and group (in Table 1 this is sham/no defects/defects and in Table 2 this is sham/DB dilution/MC dilution). We are looking for trends here rather than a simple group versus group analysis. Mixed effects regression takes account of the issue that repeated observations from the same embryo are not independent. (There is a good introduction to linear mixed effects models aimed at a general audience here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00002/full)</p><p>We did try to interpret results better as we indicate them and included a summary/interpretation of the findings of the linear mixed effects regression of Table 1 in the Discussion section: see all highlighted text please.</p><p>‘In embryos with LR defects we found a general decreased anterior angular velocity, a smaller difference between anterior-posterior angular velocity and an abnormal flow directionality in anterior sections of the LRO.’</p><p>We have also expanded on the discussion session to integrate a summary of dilution and viscosity experiments and analysis of Table 2:</p><p>We showed that if the fluid extraction is made until 6 ss the system senses it and there is a response that may compensate the insult but if the extraction is made at 7 ss the LRO does not sense it anymore. This heightened the need of identifying the mechanism that senses the challenge in the relevant short time-interval.</p><p>We therefore assessed the effect of replacing extracted fluid with either buffer, which simply dilutes the KV contents, or buffer with added methylcellulose, which also increases viscosity. Simple dilution did not significantly affect situs whereas increasing viscosity dramatically increased rates of right situs. Statistical analysis of flow data showed that increasing the viscosity via injection is associated with very strong reduction in angular velocity, a strong reduction in anterior-dominance of the flow, and modestly faster flow on the right compared with the left. By contrast, dilution which does not increase viscosity is associated with a modest reduction in anterior-dominance and a modest reduction in flow acceleration over time. The strong effects appear to explain the effect of viscosity on situs. We therefore concluded that the sensory mechanism detects flow properties, as angular velocity and viscosity but seems to be insensitive if we quickly replace the fluid and keep flow dynamics constant.</p><p>The second type of quantitative analysis is the probabilistic mathematical model of signal sensing and integration which is used to reinforce the time window analysis, in addition to presenting a conceptual framework for how flow perturbations influence situs (including by increasing the variance of flow velocity as well as a transient reduction). The model parameters to be determined by fitting to experimental data are the sensitivity weightings of each stage. The model fit is what is shown in Figure 6. The figure caption refers to ‘stage weightings’ and ‘stage contributions’, which quantify how important each stage is in breaking situs (the first being a sensitivity, the latter taking account of flow magnitude also). A tall bar corresponds to that stage being important. While a description of the model was given in the main text, we have revised the text to improve accessibility. The relevant part of the Results section is revised as follows:</p><p>“Taking account both stage weighting and anterior angular velocity to quantify the contribution of each stage, nearly 90% of the contribution to symmetry breaking occurred in the 4 ss – 6 ss interval (Figure 6C; note that tall bars indicate a high contribution relative to other stages).”</p><p>We have also rewritten the Figure 6 caption to guide the reader through the figure:</p><p>“Figure 6 – Mathematical modelling confirms the critical role of one-hour interval confirming the experimental observations. Outcome of model fitting to experiment, associated stage weightings (sensitivity of KV to its own flow) and signal contribution (sensitivity multiplied by flow strength) for (A-C) Unrestricted model, (D-F) model with 3 ss contribution omitted, (G-I) model with 3-4 ss contributions omitted, (J-L) model with 3-5 ss contributions omitted, (M-O) model with 3-6 ss contributions omitted. The restricted models are included to assess alternative explanations for the data in which later stages still make a significant contribution. (A, D, G, J, M) fitted model outputs of rates of normal and abnormal situs for direct comparison with experiment; (B, E, H, K, N) fitted stage weightings (sensitivity of KV to its own flow) where tall bars mean ‘relatively more sensitive’ in arbitrary units, (C, F, I, L, O) signal contribution (sensitivity multiplied by flow strength) where tall bars mean ‘relatively more contribution’. The fitted restricted models for (G-I, J-L and M-O) do not fit the experiment well which confirms that they are unlikely to represent what is occurring in the KV. The fitted models for (A-C, D-F and G-I) have a much better fit and confirm that 5ss makes a major contribution, as do 4ss and/or 6ss. ss: somite stage.”</p><p>Finally we have modified the relevant paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“After fluid extraction, the time lag and complexity of the fluid flow recovery process motivated the development of a mathematical model of flow, its variability, and the effect of experimental interventions, with the aim of determining the sensitivity of KV to its own flow field through fitting experimental data. The core idea of the model is to represent symmetry breaking as a random process which is biased by flow. The analysis took account of natural variability in the flow field and its modification by intervention, with the biasing effects of each stage to be determined through fitting, and for a comparison to be made against alternative models in which only later developmental stages are important. This analysis confirmed the critical importance of 4 ss to 6 ss in symmetry breaking, and the limited role for flow during 7 ss and 8 ss.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
