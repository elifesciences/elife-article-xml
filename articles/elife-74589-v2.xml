From a chemical perspective, we distinguish the alkaline earth metals Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> from transition metal ions such as Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which show distinct properties owing to their size and electronic structure. As major constituent of bone, Ca<sup>2+</sup> has to be taken up by vertebrates in high amount. Although its largest part is immobilized within the body, free Ca<sup>2+</sup> is present in the extracellular medium in low millimolar concentrations. In contrast, cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> serves as second messenger and its distribution in the cell thus requires tight control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli and Krebs, 2016</xref>). Mg<sup>2+</sup> on the other hand is a ubiquitous ligand of nucleotides and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Baaij et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maguire and Cowan, 2002</xref>). Despite the similar extracellular concentration, its abundance in the cytoplasm is several orders of magnitude higher compared to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In their interaction with other molecules, these alkaline earth metal ions are coordinated by electronegative hard ligands, preferentially oxygens, which compensate their positive charges by either full or partial countercharges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carafoli and Krebs, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payandeh et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which both constitute minor elements in the human body, transition metals are trace elements that are found at much lower concentration, as they are required for specialized processes. Transition metals are distinguished by their incompletely filled d-orbitals. This property permits coordinative interactions with soft ligands containing free electron pairs and allows them to change their oxidation state, which makes them important cofactors in redox reactions. The transition metal ion Fe<sup>2+</sup> plays a central role in oxygen transport and, together with Mn<sup>2+</sup>, it is a cofactor of enzymes catalyzing redox reactions. Due to their low abundance in the extracellular environment, the uptake of transition metals has thus to proceed with high selectivity to prevent competition with several orders of magnitude more abundant alkaline earth metals, which would prohibit their efficient accumulation. This challenge is overcome by specific transmembrane transport proteins, which catalyze the accumulation of transition metal ions inside cells. Among these proteins, members of the SLC11/NRAMP family play an important role. They are expressed in all kingdoms of life where they facilitate the transmembrane transport of different transition metal ions by a secondary active process that involves the cotransport of H<sup>+</sup> as energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Courville et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nevo and Nelson, 2006</xref>). In animals, these proteins are used for the transport of Fe<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Montalbetti et al., 2013</xref>), whereas in prokaryotes the primary substrate is Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makui et al., 2000</xref>). Besides the transport of both transition metals, plant NRAMPs are also involved in detoxification processes by transporting noxious metal ions such as Cd<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><p>The transport properties of SLC11/NRAMP proteins have been investigated in numerous functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunshin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Makui et al., 2000</xref>), supported by the structures of prokaryotic transporters determined in different conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>). With respect to its fold, the family is distantly related to other secondary active transporters that include the amino-acid transporter LeuT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yamashita et al., 2005</xref>), although there is little relationship on a sequence level, SLC11/NRAMP structures provide detailed insight into substrate preference and transport mechanisms. Characterized family members show an exquisite selectivity for transition metals over alkaline earth metal ions, but they poorly discriminate between transition metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunshin et al., 1997</xref>). This is accomplished by a conserved ion binding site that is located in the center of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>). Several residues coordinate the largely dehydrated metal ion with hard, oxygen-containing ligands, which would equally well interact with other divalent cations. Additionally, the site allows interaction with the free electron pair of the thioether group of a conserved methionine residue, which serves as soft ligand that permits coordinative interactions with transition metal- but not alkaline earth metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>). The mutation of this methionine to alanine in one of the bacterial homologues had a comparably small effect on transition metal ion transport but instead converted Ca<sup>2+</sup> into a transported substrate, which emphasizes the role of the residue in conferring ion selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozzi et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Although, throughout kingdoms of life, the majority of SLC11/NRMP transporters share similar functional properties, there are few family members that were described to transport with distinct substrate preference. Among these family members are prokaryotic proteins, termed NRAMP-related magnesium transporters (NRMTs), that were identified as uptake systems for Mg<sup>2+</sup>. In the bacterium <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic>, the prototypic NRMT (CabNRMT) has permitted growth at limiting Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, even in absence of any alternative transport pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). The altered substrate preference is remarkable since, owing to its small ionic radius and the consequent high charge density, the interaction of Mg<sup>2+</sup> with its surrounding solvent is unusually strong, which makes the dehydration of the ion energetically costly and therefore requires unique features for its transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maguire and Cowan, 2002</xref>). The uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into cells is thus accomplished by few selective transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payandeh et al., 2013</xref>) that include the bacterial proteins CorA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lunin et al., 2006</xref>), CorC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021</xref>), MgtE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hattori et al., 2007</xref>) and their eukaryotic homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schäffers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schweigel-Röntgen and Kolisek, 2014</xref>), the TRP channel TRPM7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2020b</xref>) and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-selective P-type pumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maguire, 1992</xref>). In the present study, we became interested in the mechanism of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport by SLC11 proteins and we thus set out to investigate the functional and structural basis of this process by combining transport experiments with structural studies. We identified a biochemically well-behaved NRMT, which allowed us to characterize its transport behavior using in vitro transport experiments. Structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography revealed an expanded substrate binding site that binds the divalent cation as complex with most of its hydration shell, which permits selection against the larger Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is not a transported substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic analysis of NRAMP transporters</title><p>In light of the proposed altered substrate preference of certain prokaryotic SLC11 proteins, we became interested in the phylogeny of the family. For that purpose, we have identified numerous SLC11 homologues in BLAST searches of pro- and eukaryotic sequence databases using human DMT1, the prokaryotic Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporters EcoDMT and ScaDMT, the putative NRAMP-related aluminium transporter (NRAT) from <italic>Orzya sativa</italic> and the proposed Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter CabNRMT as queries. In this way, sequences of 1100 eukaryotic and 447 prokaryotic NRAMP proteins and 745 prokaryotic NRMTs were aligned and subjected to phylogenetic characterization. The resulting phylogenetic tree displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a distributed organization with different family members clustering into separated clades. Branches of this phylogenetic tree group proteins from the animal kingdom including human DMT1 and NRAMP1, which both function as H<sup>+</sup> coupled Fe<sup>2+</sup> transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forbes and Gros, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunshin et al., 1997</xref>), prokaryotic homologues including proteins of known structure such as ScaDMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>), EcoDMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>) and DraNRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>), whose primary function is H<sup>+</sup> coupled Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport and plant proteins ascribed to be involved in the transport of various transition metal ions such as the toxic metal Cd<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2020a</xref>). Within the plant kingdom, a small but separated branch encompasses putative Al<sup>3+</sup> transporters classified as NRATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauhan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xia et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, a large and distant clade of the family containing homologues of the prototypic CabNRMT defines a group of transporters which, although clearly being part of the family, appear to have evolved to serve a different purpose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). The proposed functional distinction between different clades is manifested in the sequence of the substrate binding site that was identified in structural studies of prokaryotic SLC11 family members to coordinate divalent transition metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This site is defined by a signature containing a DxxN motif in the unwound center of α-helix 1 and an A/CxxM motif in the unwound center of α-helix 6. The signature is fully conserved in animal Fe<sup>2+</sup> transporters, bacterial Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporters and most transporters of plant origin, which all exhibit a strong selectivity against alkaline earth metal ions but poor discrimination between transition metal ions. Conversely, the motif is replaced by a DxxN-AxxT motif in NRATs and a DxxG-TxxA/T motif in NRMTs thus indicating that latter clades would exhibit a different substrate preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of the SLC11/NRAMP family.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the consensus ion binding site of NRAMP transporters as obtained from the X-ray structure of ScaDMT (PDBID 5M95) in complex with Mn<sup>2+</sup>.

To do so, we employed previously established proteoliposome-based transport assays with appropriate fluorophores to detect the uptake of specific ions into vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). All transport experiments were carried out in in presence of a 100-fold outwardly directed K<sup>+</sup> gradient, which after addition of the ionophore valinomycin establishes a membrane potential of –118 mV, to enhance the sensitivity of the applied assays.</p><p>Classical NRAMP proteins efficiently transport divalent transition metal ions with low micromolar affinity, while discriminating against alkaline earth metal ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>). These functional properties are reflected in transport studies of EcoDMT, which employ the fluorophore calcein as efficient reporter to monitor micromolar concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> whereas it is not responsive to either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mg<sup>2+</sup> even at much higher concentrations. In our experiments, we find a concentration-dependent quenching of the fluorescence due to Mn<sup>2+</sup> influx into vesicles containing the trapped fluorophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which is neither inhibited by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> nor Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the outside solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Latter would be expected if these ions would compete for the binding of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. As suggested from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozzi et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2014</xref>), we expected a key role of the methionine (Met 235) in the binding site of the protein as major determinant of this pronounced selectivity. We thus initially investigated whether it was possible to alter the substrate preference of EcoDMT by shortening the methionine side chain in the mutant EcoDMT M235A. This construct was still capable of transporting Mn<sup>2+</sup> with a threefold increase of its K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, E and G</xref>), whereas now also Ca<sup>2+</sup> became a permeable substrate as illustrated by the competition of the ion with Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>) and the direct detection of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport using the fluorophore Fura2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). A similar result was previously obtained for the equivalent mutation of the homologue DraNRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozzi et al., 2016a</xref>). In contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we were not able to detect any interaction with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), indicating that the energetic requirements to transport this smaller divalent cation are higher than for Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of EcoDMT mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EcoDMT-mediated Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport into proteoliposomes.

As for the mutant M235A, this construct folded into a stable protein that retained its capability of Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport while remaining unable to interact with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–L</xref>). In summary, the mutation of the binding site residues of EcoDMT towards an NRMT was well tolerated with the resulting constructs retaining their capability for Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport. This suggests that the structural and energetic requirements for interactions with this transition metal are lower than for alkaline earth metals. We also confirmed the role of the binding site methionine as an important determinant for the counterselection of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which due to its much higher concentration would outcompete Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in a physiological environment. However, neither the replacement of the methionine nor the conversion of the binding site to residues observed in NRMTs was sufficient to facilitate Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport, demonstrating that structural features beyond the immediate binding site residues are required to transport this small divalent cation. Consequently, we decided to turn our attention towards the characterization of prokaryotic NRMTs to gain further insight into Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport by SLC11 homologues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional characterization of EleNRMT</title><p>Initially, our attempts toward the characterization of NRMTs were focused on the identification of a suitable candidate for structural and functional studies. Towards this end, we cloned and investigated the expression properties of 82 representative homologues selected from the pool of 745 sequences of putative NRMTs identified in BLAST searches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Within this subset, we were able to single out a candidate from the bacterium <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> termed EleNRMT with promising biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). After expression and purification in the detergent n-dodecyl-beta-D-Maltoside (DDM), we found this protein to elute as monodisperse peak from a size exclusion chromatography column. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Although much better behaved than the other investigated homologues, EleNRMT was still comparably instable in detergent solution and difficult to reconstitute into liposomes. We thus attempted to improve its stability by consensus mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cirri et al., 2018</xref>) by converting 11 positions identified in sequence alignments to their most abundant residues in NRMTs to create the construct EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This approach improved the thermal stability of the monomeric protein and the efficiency of reconstitution without affecting its functional properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>). Due to the sensitivity of the assay and the fact that binding site mutants of EcoDMT retained their ability to transport Mn<sup>2+</sup>, we initially investigated transport properties of EleNRMT for this divalent transition metal ion and found robust concentration-dependent activity that saturates with a K<sub>m</sub> of around 120 µM for either WT or the thermostabilized mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, B, D and E</xref>). For both constructs, we found Mg<sup>2+</sup> to inhibit Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in a concentration-dependent manner, thus indicating that Mg<sup>2+</sup> would compete with Mn<sup>2+</sup> for its binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>). We subsequently quantified binding of either ion to detergent solubilized protein by isothermal titration calorimetry and found a K<sub>d</sub> of around 100 µM for Mn<sup>2+</sup>, which corresponds well with the measured K<sub>m</sub> of transport of the same ion and a somewhat lower affinity of around 400 µM for Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>, F).

Since the monomeric protein, with a molecular weight of only 47 kDa and lacking pronounced domains extending from the membrane, is itself not a suitable target for cryo-EM, we initially attempted structural studies by X-ray crystallography but were unable to obtain crystals, despite extensive screening. To enlarge the size of the protein and facilitate crystallization, we generated specific nanobodies by immunization of alpacas with purified EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup> followed by the assembly of a nanobody library from blood samples and selection by phage display. These experiments allowed us to identify three distinct binders recognizing the protein termed Nb1-3<sup>EleNRMT</sup> (short Nb1-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Despite the increase of the hydrophilic surface, which was frequently found to facilitate crystallization, all attempts to obtain crystals of EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup> in complex with a single nanobody were unsuccessful. Similarly, efforts toward the structure determination of the same complexes by cryo-EM did not permit a reconstruction at high resolution. We thus attempted to further increase the size of the complex and found that Nb1 and either one of the two closely related nanobodies Nb2 or Nb3 were able to bind concomitantly to the protein to assemble into a ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). This complex showed improved crystallization properties and was of sufficient size to allow structure determination by single particle averaging. The structure of the tripartite EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup> nanobody complex was determined by cryo-EM in absence of additional Mg<sup>2+</sup> (EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup>-Nb1,2) and in buffer containing 10 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup>-Nb1,2). Datasets collected from respective samples allowed the 3D-reconstruction of a map at 3.5 Å for EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup>-Nb1,2 and at 4.1 Å for EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup>Mg<sup>2+</sup>-Nb1,2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

general organization of the SLC11 family. It encompasses 11 membrane-spanning segments, with the first 10 segments organized as two structurally related repeats of five α-helices that are inserted in the membrane with opposite orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The protein adopts an inward-facing conformation that is illustrated in the comparison with the equivalent conformations of the transporters ScaDMT and DraNRAMP, which both superimpose with RMSDs of 2.2 and 2.0 Å, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This structure contains a large and continuous water-filled cavity that extends from the cytoplasm and leads to a pocket located in the center of the protein at the unwound parts of α-helices 1 and 6, which together form the ion binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). The location of the bound ion is defined in the anomalous difference density of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and its position presumably also corresponds to the binding position of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B-E</xref>). Although the bound ion is found at an equivalent position as in the transporter ScaDMT, the binding pocket of EleNRMT is expanded as a consequence of the about 1.5 Å shift in the location of backbone atoms and differences in the volume of interacting side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). In both, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> transporters, an aspartate on α-helix 1 and a main chain interaction at the site of the unwound part of α-helix 6 remain a common feature of their binding sites, whereas the replacement of an alanine (Ala 223) in ScaDMT by a threonine (Thr 224) in EleNRMT introduces a side chain containing a hydroxyl group whose oxygen atom serves as additional ligand for ion interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Further changes of other residues of the binding site alter its shape and volume. In ScaDMT, the bound ion is to a large extent excluded from the aqueous environment and instead tightly surrounded by residues of the binding site, whereas in EleNRMT the replacement of the asparagine side chain on α1 with a glycine and the methionine residue on α6 to alanine in conjunction with differences in the main chain positions widen the cavity to leave sufficient space for interacting water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>), suggesting that Mg<sup>2+</sup> binds to the transporter in a partly solvated state retaining much of its first hydration shell. Thus, the EleNRMT structure implies that it is a combination of both, changes in the local environment conferred by the chemical nature of side chains and more delocalized changes causing an expansion of the binding site, which together are responsible for the altered selectivity.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>EleNRMT structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon representation of EleNRMT viewed from within the membrane with α1-α5 colored in beige, α6- α10 in blue and α11 in magenta.

Proton transport in classical NRAMP transporters was proposed to be linked to structural features extending from the ion binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bozzi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bozzi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mackenzie et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pujol-Giménez et al., 2017</xref>). These include the conserved aspartate involved in the coordination of metal ions, two conserved histidines on α-helix 6b downstream of the binding site methionine and a continuous path of acidic and basic residues on α-helices 3 and 9 surrounding a narrow aqueous cavity, which together appear to constitute an intracellular H<sup>+</sup> release pathway. Apart from the binding site aspartate (Asp 55) and glutamate on α-helix 3 (Glu 133) close to the metal ion binding site, all other positions in EleNRMT are altered to residues that cannot accept protons. The two histidines on α-helix 6b are substituted by a tryptophane and an asparagine, respectively, and the polar pathway residues on α-helix 3 and 9 are replaced by hydrophobic residues and a threonine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional properties of EleNRMT binding site mutants</title><p>After identifying the structural determinants of ion interactions in NRMTs, we were interested in the consequence of mutations of residues of the binding site on selectivity and thus investigated the transport properties of mutants. Consistent with experiments on other family members, the mutation of the aspartate in the binding site (Asp55), which is a universally conserved position in all SLC11 proteins, strongly compromises transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Similarly, the mutation of Gln 379 on α10, a conserved position that was proposed to be involved in ion coordination in the occluded state of DraNRAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>), exerts a similarly strong effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), thus suggesting that EleNRMT undergoes an equivalent conformational change. In contrast, the mutation of Thr 224 to alanine, the amino acid found in the equivalent position of NRAMP transporters, has smaller but still detectable impact on Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport, which is reflected in an at least two-fold increase of its K<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, D and E</xref>). In contrast to Mn<sup>2+</sup>, this change has a much more pronounced effect on Mg<sup>2+</sup> interactions, which is manifested in the absence of appreciable inhibition of Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in presence of increasing Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentrations and the non-detectable Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport when directly assaying this alkaline earth metal ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). Finally, by replacing Gly 58 to asparagine in the background of the T224A mutant, we create an EleNRMT construct with a similar binding site signature as the EcoDMT mutant M235A, which showed increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability. We thus investigated whether an equivalent conversion would also change the properties of EleNRMT with respect to its ability to transport Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which is not a substrate of the WT protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In line with the pronounced effect already observed for T224A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>), we see a further reduction of Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in the double mutant T224A/G58N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>). In contrast to the compromised Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport properties, this double mutant shows detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport activity, thus illustrating that the conversion has introduced structural determinants that facilitate Ca<sup>2+</sup> interactions and that change the properties of the binding site to more closely resemble NRAMP proteins.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Functional characterization of binding site mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of the ion binding site of EleNRMT with ion (black sphere) showing bound Mn<sup>2+</sup>.

Whereas the bulk of the family efficiently transports divalent transition metal ions such as Fe<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> from a high background of alkaline earth metal ions, there is an extended clade of the family in prokaryotes that has evolved as transport systems of the divalent cation Mg<sup>2+</sup> and that were thus termed NRAMP related Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporters (NRMTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These proteins are characterized by a distinct signature of residues constituting the ion binding site, located in the center of the protein in the unwound parts of the pseudo-symmetry related transmembrane helices α1 and α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). We thus initially investigated whether we would be able to confer the capability to transport Mg<sup>2+</sup> to a transition metal ion transporter by mutation of its ion binding site.</p><p>The most striking difference in the ion binding site of both clades of the NRAMP family concerns the position of a conserved methionine that serves as a soft ligand for the interaction with transition metal ions, which is replaced by an alanine in NRMTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The mutation of this residue in the classical NRAMP EcoDMT only moderately affected its capability to transport Mn<sup>2+</sup> and instead exerted its pronounced effect by converting Ca<sup>2+</sup> into a transported substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–H</xref>). This emphasizes the primary role of this residue to disfavor binding of this ubiquitous alkaline earth metal ion, which was already proposed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bozzi et al., 2016a</xref>). Similarly, an EcoDMT mutant where all three deviating residues of the binding site were mutated to their correspondents found in NRMTs was still efficient in Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), thus suggesting that, among divalent cations, the transport of transition metal ions might not depend on stringent structural prerequisites. In contrast to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, neither of the mutants converted EcoDMT into a Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and K</xref>), thus suggesting that the transport of latter might require specific features to cope with the unique chemical properties of this ion. Among divalent cations of biological relevance, Mg<sup>2+</sup> is distinguished by its small ionic radius, which results in an unusually strong interaction with the surrounding water molecules that would render its dehydration during transport energetically costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Persson, 2010</xref>). The first hydration shell of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which coordinates the ion in an octahedral geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>), was thus suggested to remain bound to the ion in its initial encounter with the binding site and probably also during transport. A similar feature was indeed observed in the structures of the unrelated bacterial Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport proteins MgtE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeda et al., 2014</xref>) and CorA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guskov et al., 2012</xref>) whereas protein interactions in the membrane-inserted domain of the transporter CorC are established with a fully dehydrated ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Features of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport by NRMTs.</title><p>Schematic depiction of (<bold>A</bold>), the octahedral coordination of the first hydration shell surrounding a Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and (<bold>B</bold>), the same octahedral coordination within the binding site of a NRMT with five of the six water molecules remaining bound to the ion and where the bulk of protein interactions with the ion are mediated via coordinated water.

The Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion was placed on the position of Mn<sup>2+</sup> obtained from the anomalous difference density defined in the X-ray structure. A single water molecule with a backbone oxygen atom was removed and the remaining complex was oriented to maximize interactions of coordinating waters with protein residues.

Its capability to transport Mn<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D and G</xref>) underlines the described promiscuity of this ion in its interaction with proteins. In contrast, our studies have shown transport of Mg<sup>2+</sup> but not Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E, F, H ,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–E</xref>) thus illustrating that both ions rely on distinct features of the protein which mediate their interaction. These are illustrated in the structure of EleNRMT in an inward-facing conformation determined by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In this structure, a wide aqueous cavity leads to an ion binding site whose spacious volume would preclude simultaneous interaction with a completely dehydrated ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B and C</xref>). The larger size of the site is an immediate consequence of the decreased side chain-volume of the surrounding residues concomitant with local differences in the backbone positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), which explains why it was impossible to convert EcoDMT into a Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter upon mutation of respective residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D, I, K</xref>). The position of a Mn<sup>2+</sup> ion bound to EleNRMT was defined by its anomalous difference density in a crystal structure of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Since Mn<sup>2+</sup> shows a similar octahedral coordination as Mg<sup>2+</sup>, although with weaker affinity to the surrounding waters, we assume Mg<sup>2+</sup> to bind in an equivalent manner, which is also reflected in the presence of residual density in a dataset determined at high Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5E</xref>). Although the limited resolution of our structures does not permit assignment of water molecules, an octahedral Mg<sup>2+</sup>-water complex model placed in the binding site suggests that only one of the solvent molecules would be substituted by a direct interaction with the oxygen of the amide backbone group of Thr 224, whereas other interactions with the conserved binding site would be mediated by coordinating waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>). The detailed structural properties of this cavity are expected to change upon a transition from an inward-open into an occluded intermediate conformation, which was observed in the corresponding structure of DraNRAMP, where the access of the binding site to the cytoplasm is closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bozzi et al., 2019b</xref>). However, in contrast to DraNRAMP, where the bound ion becomes tightly encircled by protein residues, the distinct structural features of EleNRMT and the lower side chain volume of residues of its binding site suggest that this cavity would be sufficiently big for Mg<sup>2+</sup> to retain much of its surrounding water during transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–F</xref>) thus emphasizing that it is the larger hydrated complex of Mg<sup>2+</sup> rather than the naked ion that is relevant for transport.</p><p>A second pronounced feature that distinguishes EleNRMT and likely other NRMTs from classical SLC11 proteins concerns the absent coupling of metal ion transport to an energy source, which in case of NRAMPs is conferred by the cotransport of protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gunshin et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>). This property is reflected in the location of ionizable residues that are conserved within the proton-coupled part of the family and that are absent in EleNRMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E and F</xref>). It thus appears that in light of the high extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration and the inside negative membrane potential such coupling may not be required for efficient uptake in the natural habitat of the bacterium.</p><p>Collectively, the presented study has provided detailed mechanistic insight into the structural basis of Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport in homologues of the SLC11/NRAMP family and it has confirmed previous results that have proposed this role based on biochemical considerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). Our work also illustrates the promiscuity of transition metal ion transport, which contrasts the tight requirements for the alkaline earth metal ions such as Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, latter of which is transported in a largely hydrated state. The observation that the previously investigated NRMT homologue did not permit growth upon Mn<sup>2+</sup> -limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shin et al., 2014</xref>) could be a consequence of the lower affinity to this ion, the competition with abundant Mg<sup>2+</sup> and the absence of an energy source, which might be mandatory for efficient accumulation of the scarce substrate. Our study illustrates the specific requirements for the transport of Mg<sup>2+</sup> which are not met by classical NRAMP transporters. In this respect, it appears unlikely that the human transporter SLC11A1, which resides in the phagosomes of macrophages and is involved in the immune response against invading microbes, would itself permit Mg<sup>2+</sup> transport as suggested in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunrath and Bumann, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

All datasets were collected on a 300 kV Titan Krios (ThermoFischer Scientific) with a 100 μm objective aperture and using a post-column BioQuantum energy filter with a 20 eV slit and a K3 direct electron detector in super-resolution mode. All datasets were recorded automatically using EPU2.9 with a defocus ranging from –1–2.4 μm, a magnification of 130,000 x corresponding to a pixel size of 0.651 Å per pixel (0.3255 Å in super resolution mode) and an exposure of 1.01 s (36 frames). Three datasets were collected for EleNRMT-Nb1,2 without Mg<sup>2+</sup>with respective total doses of 69.725, 61 and 69.381 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> and for EleNRMT-Nb1,2 with Mg<sup>2+</sup> one dataset with a total dose of 69.554 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cryo-EM data processing</title><p>Datasets were processed using Cryosparc v3.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>) following the same processing pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). All movies were subjected to motion correction using patch motion correction with a fourier crop factor of 2 (pixel size of 0.651 Å/pix). After patch CTF estimation, high quality micrographs were identified based on relative ice thickness, CTF resolution and total full frame motion and micrographs not meeting the specified criteria were rejected. For the EleNRMT<sup>ts</sup>-Nb1,2 complex, a partial dataset (981 micrographs) was used to generate a low-resolution 3D <italic>ab initio</italic> model. For this purpose, particles were selected using a blob picker with a minimum particle diameter of 160 Å and a minimum inter-particle distance of 64 Å. The selected particles were extracted with a box size of 360 pixels and binned 4 x (pixel size of 2.64 Å per pixel). These particles were initially used to generate 2D classes and later for template-driven particle picking. After extraction and 2D classification, an initial 3D ab initio model was generated in Cryosparc. This model was subsequently used to generate 2D templates for particle picking on the remainder of the dataset.</p><p>The 2D classes generated from particles selected from the entire dataset were extracted using a box size of 360 pix and down-sampled to 180 pixels (pixel size of 1.32 Å/pix). These particles were used for generation of 4 <italic>ab initio</italic> classes. Promising <italic>ab initio</italic> models were selected based on visual inspection and subjected to heterogenous refinement using one of the selected models as ‘template’ and an obviously bad model as decoy model. After several rounds of heterogenous refinement, the selected particles and models were subjected to non-uniform refinement (input model filtering to 8 Å) followed by local CTF refinement and another round of non-uniform refinement. Finally, the maps were sharpened using the sharpening tool from the Cryosparc package. The quality of the map was evaluated validated using 3DFSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) for FSC validation and local resolution estimation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cryo-EM model building and refinement</title><p>Model building was performed in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). Initially, the structure of ScaDMT (PDB 5M94) was rigidly fitted into the densities and served as template for map interpretation. The quality of the map allowed for the unambiguous assignment of residues 43–438. The structure of Nb16 (PDB 5M94) was used to build Nb1 and Nb2. The model was iteratively improved by real space refinement in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonine et al., 2018</xref>) maintaining secondary structure constrains throughout.

This work identifies factors responsible for selectivity of classical NRAMPS for transition metal ions (Fe, Mn) and the NRMT clade for alkali metal ion (Mg). Although selectivity is much discussed in transport of divalent metal ions, this is an outstanding example of a study that gets to the bottom of the structural determinants governing this behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74589.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Stockbridge</surname><given-names>Randy B</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Stockbridge</surname><given-names>Randy B</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Michigan</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Motoyuki</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>Fudan University</institution><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.17.464711">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.17.464711v2.full">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Structural and functional properties of a magnesium transporter of the SLC11/NRAMP family&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy B Stockbridge as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Motoyuki Hattori (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A valinomycin/K<sup>+</sup> gradient was used to establish a membrane potential for the transport assays. The exact magnitude of the K<sup>+</sup> gradient in each assay is not clearly stated, but it appears that the K<sup>+</sup> gradient may differ between the proton- and metal-uptake assays. Since membrane potential is known to influence transport by the NRAMPs, the manuscript should be revised to include the reasoning for applying a membrane potential in the main text, and to clearly describe the K<sup>+</sup> gradients used in the methods. In addition, an extra control experiment should be performed to show that manganese/magnesium uptake occurs when the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration is matched to that used for the proton uptake assays.</p><p>2) Since the applied membrane potential might drive non-specific substrate leak, no-protein controls should be shown for the highest concentrations of each substrate.</p><p>3) The reviewers are not fully convinced that the data support the conclusion that substitution of Trp for His is the sole determinant for proton coupling. It may be of interest to test a mutation at this site. However, if the authors choose not to do this, a more robust discussion of the proton transport pathway and a more tentative conclusion about the His to Trp change is warranted.</p><p>4) The reviewers had several suggestions for clarity of data presentation (described in the &quot;Recommendations for authors&quot;). These should be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) A valinomycin/K<sup>+</sup> gradient was used to establish a membrane potential in the transport assays. This aspect of the assay was only mentioned in the methods, and should be mentioned/discussed in the main text as well. Was this maneuver necessary for assay sensitivity (to drive accumulation of higher substrate concentrations for detection), or was it necessary for transport (to drive substrate translocation over an energy barrier?).</p><p>From the methods, it appears that the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the uptake experiments is determined by the dilution of the proteoliposomes into the assay buffer, and liposomes were diluted to different extents for metal and proton uptake assays, ~6-fold difference. Assuming I understand the various dilutions correctly, the applied membrane potential driving force is likely reduced by ~50 mV in the proton-detection assays compared to the metal-detection assays. It has been shown that some NRAMPs have a fairly strong dependence on the membrane potential, such that a 50 mV change could impact the observation of transport (Bozzi et al., 2019, JGP 151: 1413-1429.) This loose end should be tied up by simply showing that manganese/magnesium uptake occurs when the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration is matched to that used for the proton uptake assays.</p><p>2) Divalent metals are occasionally known to leak nonspecifically across liposomal membranes, and this would be enhanced under the conditions of these metal transport assays, in which a K<sup>+</sup> gradient/valinomycin is used to drive uptake of the divalent metal ions into the liposomes. Therefore, it is important to show a no-protein control, at least at the highest concentrations of permeant substrate. Such controls were only shown for the proton uptake assays (which were negative results anyway).</p><p>3) At least in my rendering of the figures, for panels 2D, 4D, 4F, the datapoints for some datasets can't be seen because they are behind the shaded error envelope for another dataset. Even though the point is taken that these datasets are similar to each other, it's important to see the datapoints. Could this be visualized in some other way?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I understand that Trp229 in EleNRMT may account for proton-independent metal transport by EleNRMT. In this case, how does the transport cycle including the transition from the inward-facing to the outward-facing occur? Do the authors have any idea or speculation?</p><p>2. Page 5. &quot;The uptake of Mg<sup>2+</sup> into cells is thus accomplished by few selective transport systems (Payandeh et al., 2013) that include the bacterial proteins CorA (Lunin et al., 2006), CorC (Huang et al., 2021), MgtE (Tanaka et al., 2007) and their eukaryotic homologues (Schaffers et al., 2018; Schweigel-Rontgen and Kolisek, 2014), the TRP channel TRPM7 (Huang et al., 2020b) and Mg<sup>2+</sup>-selective P-type pumps (Maguire, 1992).&quot;</p><p>The citation on MgtE (Tanaka et al., 2007) is a crystallization paper. I highly recommend the authors to correct the citation to the article on the MgtE structure (PMID: 17700703).</p><p>3. Page 16. &quot;Finally, by replacing Gly 88 to asparagine in the background of the T224A mutant, we create an EleNRMT construct with a similar binding site signature as the EcoDMT mutant M235A, which showed increased ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability.&quot;</p><p>This is a typo. It should be Gly58, not Gly 88.</p><p>4. Page 16. &quot;In line with the pronounced effect already observed for T224A (Figure 8D, E), we see a further reduction of Mn<sup>2+</sup> transport in the double mutant T224A/G88N (Figure 8H).&quot;</p><p>This is a typo. It should be G58N, not G88N.</p><p>5. This is not a specific recommendation or request. Do the nobodies affect the transport activity of EleNRMT? This is just out of curiosity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Despite my overall enthusiasm for the rigor of the work, there are a number of improvements that could be made in the presentation of data.</p><p>Although the arguments about changes at the ion binding site are compelling and logical, the depiction of densities and atomic coordination at this site are somewhat ineffective.

It may be of interest to test a mutation at this site. However, if the authors choose not to do this, a more robust discussion of the proton transport pathway and a more tentative conclusion about the His to Trp change is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>Our transport assay demonstrated the absence of H<sup>+</sup> transport in EleNRMT and we have correlated this observation to structural features that were previously proposed to be connected to H<sup>+</sup> transport in pro- and eukaryotic SLC11 family members, which are all absent in EleNRMT. It was not our intention to speculate on the mechanism of H<sup>+</sup> transport in classical H<sup>+</sup>-coupled family members as this is not the subject of our study. In no way we did want to imply that the single replacement of the mentioned tryptophane (TRP 229) located on α-helix 6 for a histidine would restore H<sup>+</sup> transport, particularly since our study has shown that a change in selectivity can generally not be accomplished by a single point mutation in the protein.</p><p>To clarify this point we have reworded the paragraph in the results:</p><p>Line 311-322:</p><p>“Proton transport in classical NRAMP transporters was proposed to be linked to structural features extending from the ion binding site (Bozzi et al., 2019a; Bozzi et al., 2020; Bozzi et al., 2019b; Ehrnstorfer et al., 2017; Mackenzie et al., 2006; Pujol-Gimenez et al., 2017). These include the conserved aspartate involved in the coordination of metal ions, two conserved histidines on α-helix 6b downstream of the binding site methionine and a continuous path of acidic and basic residues on α-helices 3 and 9 surrounding a narrow aqueous cavity, which together appear to constitute an intracellular H<sup>+</sup> release pathway. Apart from the binding site aspartate (Asp 55) and glutamate on α-helix 3 (Glu 133) close to the metal ion binding site, all other positions in EleNRMT are altered to residues that cannot accept protons. The two histidines on α-helix 6b are substituted by a tryptophane and an asparagine, respectively, and the polar pathway residues on α-helix 3 and 9 are replaced by hydrophobic residues and a threonine (Figure 7B, D.

These should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all suggestions below and, where appropriate, introduced corresponding changes to our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) A valinomycin/K<sup>+</sup> gradient was used to establish a membrane potential in the transport assays. This aspect of the assay was only mentioned in the methods, and should be mentioned/discussed in the main text as well. Was this maneuver necessary for assay sensitivity (to drive accumulation of higher substrate concentrations for detection), or was it necessary for transport (to drive substrate translocation over an energy barrier?).</p></disp-quote><p>The established membrane potential was applied to increase assay sensitivity. This is now clarified in the results (see essential reviews point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the methods, it appears that the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration in the uptake experiments is determined by the dilution of the proteoliposomes into the assay buffer, and liposomes were diluted to different extents for metal and proton uptake assays, ~6-fold difference. Assuming I understand the various dilutions correctly, the applied membrane potential driving force is likely reduced by ~50 mV in the proton-detection assays compared to the metal-detection assays. It has been shown that some NRAMPs have a fairly strong dependence on the membrane potential, such that a 50 mV change could impact the observation of transport (Bozzi et al., 2019, JGP 151: 1413-1429.) This loose end should be tied up by simply showing that manganese/magnesium uptake occurs when the external K<sup>+</sup> concentration is matched to that used for the proton uptake assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The same membrane potential (-118 mV) was applied in all experiments. This is clarified in the results and the methods of our revision (see essential reviews point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Divalent metals are occasionally known to leak nonspecifically across liposomal membranes, and this would be enhanced under the conditions of these metal transport assays, in which a K<sup>+</sup> gradient/valinomycin is used to drive uptake of the divalent metal ions into the liposomes. Therefore, it is important to show a no-protein control, at least at the highest concentrations of permeant substrate. Such controls were only shown for the proton uptake assays (which were negative results anyway).</p></disp-quote><p>We are now showing the non-specific background for metal ion transport, which is in all cases negligible (see essential reviews point 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) At least in my rendering of the figures, for panels 2D, 4D, 4F, the datapoints for some datasets can't be seen because they are behind the shaded error envelope for another dataset. Even though the point is taken that these datasets are similar to each other, it's important to see the datapoints. Could this be visualized in some other way?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to change this by moving the mean values to the front and the errors to the back. In that way we hope that we have allowed a better view of all measurements. However, some overlap is unavoidable in cases where different conditions do not affect transport. The indicated panels were replaced in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. I understand that Trp229 in EleNRMT may account for proton-independent metal transport by EleNRMT. In this case, how does the transport cycle including the transition from the inward-facing to the outward-facing occur? Do the authors have any idea or speculation?</p></disp-quote><p>It is common that representatives of transport proteins sharing the same general fold include secondary-active and uncoupled transporters. Examples for this behavior has been found for transporters of the major-facilitator superfamily, ones that share an UraA-like fold and also for proteins sharing a LeuT fold that include members of the SLC11/NRAMP family. In all cases, coupled and uncoupled transporters undergo equivalent conformational transitions, which in case of the SLC11 family are illustrated in different structures showing inward- occluded and outward-facing conformations. In case of an uncoupled transporter, the protein is able to sample these conformations irrespectively of whether its binding site is occupied. In contrast, in coupled transporters certain transitions are energetically unfavorable, such as that of a partially loaded transporter in symporters and of an unloaded transporter in case of exchangers.</p><p>In this respect it is noteworthy that a lose coupling of Fe<sup>2+</sup> transport to protons has been proposed for the human transporter DMT1 based on electrophysiology (Mackenzie et al., 2006). In this case the transporter would also be able to change its conformations in a partially loaded state, which would be highly unfavorable in case of a strictly coupled symporter. As detailed above, we do not want to imply that the His replacing Trp229 in H<sup>+</sup> coupled family members would be the only feature conferring H<sup>+</sup> coupling as discussed in detail before. Homology models of EleNRMT in occluded and outward-facing conformations, where Trp 229 would be buried in the protein, do not show any indication of steric hindrance by this bulky sidechain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Similarly, the X-ray structures obtained in Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> do not show evidence for an altered backbone structure, although the limited resolution in these cases prohibited a detailed interpretation of sidechain conformations. This behavior resembles the case of ScaDMT, where the inward-facing structure of the protein did not show pronounced changes in its conformation irrespective of the binding of Mn<sup>2+</sup>. In all cases, it should be emphasized that smaller changes in side-chain orientation would not be detected at the comparably low resolution of the data. In that respect, we consider the anomalous density of Mn<sup>2+</sup> in the X-ray structure as the strongest proof for metal ion binding at the described site. This density is shown in Figure 5C. We wanted to report about residual density in the cryo-EM structures, which are found at similar location as the observed Mn<sup>2+</sup> position, as we consider it of potential relevance for Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding. However, it should be emphasized that the experimental datasets at this resolution do not permit to draw definite conclusions and we thus decided to show this density as panels in Figure 5—figure supplement 5D and E.
