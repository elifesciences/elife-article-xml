These include succinate, lactate, fumarate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate. 2-Hydroxybutyrate (2HB) is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis, produced during periods of cellular stress. 2HB rises acutely after exercise; it also rises during infection and is also chronically increased in a number of metabolic disorders. We show here that 2HB inhibits branched-chain aminotransferase enzymes, which in turn triggers a SIRT4-dependent shift in the compartmental abundance of protein ADP-ribosylation. The 2HB-induced decrease in nuclear protein ADP-ribosylation leads to a C/EBPÎ²-mediated transcriptional response in the branched-chain amino acid degradation pathway. This response to 2HB exposure leads to an improved oxidative capacity in vitro. We found that repeated injection with 2HB can replicate the improvement to oxidative capacity that occurs following exercise training. Together, we show that 2-HB regulates fundamental aspects of skeletal muscle metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>muscle fiber</kwd><kwd>metabolite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>VetenskapsrÃ¥det</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-00755</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006313</institution-id><institution>Barncancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PR2023-0072</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/214283</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wadsworth</surname><given-names>Brennan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>180676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023.0350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Randall S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/115612/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cunha</surname><given-names>Pedro P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

During exercise, metabolic end products accumulate and are released into the circulation; prototypical examples of such molecules include hypoxanthine and lactate. Metabolic intermediates of pathways with increased flux during exercise may also exhibit increased levels in the circulation post-exercise, particularly as an indication of pathway saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2022</xref>). Accumulation of individual exercise-induced metabolites may lead to a diverse range of cellular responses in different tissues, with acute and lasting effects on physiology. Such mechanisms have been defined for succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reddy et al., 2020</xref>), lactate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks et al., 2023</xref>), hypoxanthine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yin et al., 2021</xref>), and other exerkines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hawley et al., 2014</xref>), demonstrating that the exercise-induced metabolome includes factors with significant physiological effects.</p><p>Exercise-induced lactate and succinate exert effects on physiology despite a relatively rapid return to baseline levels during recovery post-exercise. Conversely, 2-hydroxybutyrate (2HB, also known as Î±-hydroxybutyrate) is an exercise-induced metabolite with plasma concentrations that continue to increase for at least 3 hr after exertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morville et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rundqvist et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Contrepois et al., 2020</xref>). Production of the majority of 2HB in circulation has been attributed to the liver, although 2HB accumulates in many other tissues post-exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2022</xref>). 2HB is also present in disease states, as untargeted metabolomics analyses have identified 2HB as a metabolic marker for infection severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruzzone et al., 2020</xref>), and as an indicator of metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Thompson Legault et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharma et al., 2021</xref>). Cellular responses to accumulated 2HB have not been characterized to date, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2022</xref>, report that exogenous administration of 2HB caused an acute shift in mouse whole body metabolism, including a reduction in the respiratory exchange ratio (RER), and increased blood glucose; indicating that 2HB has the potential to alter metabolism.</p><p>2HB is the product of a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-mediated reduction of 2-ketobutyrate (2 KB), which itself is a byproduct of endogenous cysteine synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. Oxidation of 2 KB is not well characterized beyond isolated enzyme assays; these show it to be a substrate for the branched chain keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettit et al., 1978</xref>). BCKDH converts 2 KB to propionyl-CoA, which can be re-carboxylated by propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), producing the tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mann et al., 2021</xref>). Mammalian cells are not capable of reverse transsulfuration, that is production of methionine from cysteine; thus, the metabolic fate of 2 KB is driven by the balance between mitochondrial oxidation or reduction to 2HB. Importantly, the metabolism of exogenous 2HB has not been described. Based upon the current literature, the fate of 2HB depends on the capacity for LDH-dependent oxidation of 2HB, and thus, 2 KB metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>2HB is an alpha-hydroxy carboxylic acid similar to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). The latter is a dicarboxylic acid, and an established physiological competitor of Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG). Both the <italic>S</italic>- and <italic>R</italic>- enantiomers of 2HG are known to competitively inhibit Î±KG-dependent enzymatic reactions, including the branched chain amino-transferase (BCAT) enzymes, and the much broader family of Î±KG-dependent dioxygenases (Î±KGDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Intlekofer et al., 2015</xref>). Î±KGDDs include regulators of the cellular responses to hypoxia, the prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) and factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), and epigenetic regulators such as lysine demethylases (KDM), among others. Regulation of these targets by endogenous or exogenous <italic>S</italic>-2HG is sufficient to alter numerous cell fate decisions, for example the differentiation of cytotoxic CD8 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tyrakis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Foskolou et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>R</italic>-2HG inhibition of BCAT is reported to reduce metabolism of branched chain amino acids (BCAA), leading to reduced levels of glutamate and glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McBrayer et al., 2018</xref>). As an alpha-hydroxy acid, we hypothesised that 2HB may be a novel competitive inhibitor of Î±KGDDs or BCATs.</p><p>In this work, we investigate the physiological and molecular role of 2HB. We find that cells treated with 2HB demonstrate a metabolic response that leads to transcriptional regulation of BCAA degradation enzymes via a BCAT2 and SIRT4-dependent shift in compartmental protein ADP-ribosylation (ADPr). The reduced ADPr in the nuclear compartment following 2HB treatment promotes binding of the transcription factor CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPÎ²) to the promoters of BCAA degradation genes. We find that repeated administration of 2HB to mice increases oxidative capacity in exercise tests that replicates the effect of exercise training. Finally, we find repeated 2HB treatment gives rise to an improved resistance to fatigue in oxidative skeletal muscle, consistent with the improvement to oxidative metabolism. Overall, we find that 2HB induces a range of cellular responses that are consistent with it being a feedback signal from exertion, one that leads to increased capacity in the BCAA degradation pathway and improved exercise performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Daily 2HB treatment accelerates the metabolic response to exercise in mice</title><p>As described above, physical exertion induces a persistent increase to circulating 2HB. To investigate the role of 2HB in whole animal metabolism, we first subjected mice to daily incremental exhaustive exercise tests for five consecutive days. Immediately following each test, mice were injected with 1 mmol/kg of Na2HB, or an equivalent dose of NaCl as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mouse basal VO<sub>2</sub>, maximum ÎVO<sub>2</sub> (change in VO<sub>2</sub> relative to basal VO<sub>2</sub>), RER, and ÎVO<sub>2</sub> throughout exercise were similar across treatment groups on the first day, prior to group randomization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

In this study, blood was sampled prior to exercise, immediately post-exercise, and then 1-hr post-exercise. Few markers of BCAA degradation are available in the human dataset, so we focused on the amino acid, the keto acid, and the hydroxy acid versions of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and 2HB. Transamination of BCAA to the respective keto acid is the first step towards mitochondrial oxidation. In line with this, BCAA levels are reduced immediately post-exercise compared with pre-exercise levels, while keto acids and hydroxy acids are increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The accumulation of 2HB alongside increased BCAA degradation is consistent with a model wherein BCAAs compete with 2 KB for early oxidation steps, for example the BCKDH and PCC-mediated reactions.</p><p>Indicating a return to homeostasis, 1-hr after completion of exercise, BCAAs increase and keto acids decrease towards pre-exercise levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The hydroxy acids are intriguing, as these remain significantly greater than pre-exercise levels even 1-hr after completion of exercise, suggesting slow clearance of all members of this metabolite group, including 2HB. Among the hydroxy acids, 2HB is the standout, with the greatest fold-increase at the 1-hr time point and the greatest absolute abundance in both human and mouse datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rundqvist et al., 2020</xref>). Collectively, these data describe a positive correlation for the production of 2HB in proportion with production of branched chain keto acids (BCKA) during exercise. The slow clearance of 2HB and the branched chain hydroxy acids (BCHA) represent a possible indication of saturation in the capacity for the oxidation of 2 KB and BCKAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Repeated 2HB treatment alters BCAA metabolite balance following exercise</title><p>We next investigated whether repeated treatment of 2HB for four days would alter BCAA metabolism during an exercise test on the fifth day. To limit mouse dropout from exhaustion, the exercise protocol increased speed only up to 18 m/min. This speed was held for 30 min for all mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). There was no effect of 2HB treatment on basal VO<sub>2</sub>, or on RER throughout the exercise protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâF</xref>). 2HB-treated mice tended to spend more time running on the treadmill, indicated by an increased ÎVO<sub>2</sub> during the 18 m/min segment of the exercise protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and G</xref>). These data demonstrate again that repeated 2HB treatment increases oxidative capacity during exercise.</p><p>We hypothesized that the change to exercise performance, in both the incremental exercise tests to exhaustion and moderate exercise tests, was in part due to a change in skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise. Untargeted metabolomics of mouse serum, red gastrocnemius, and white gastrocnemius collected immediately post-exercise shows modest clustering of mice based on treatment group in the serum, separating vehicle-treated sedentary controls from other treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Conversely, we observe strong clustering in the red and white gastrocnemius, delineating each experimental group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and J</xref>). These data begin to suggest that skeletal muscle is a site of metabolic regulation by 2HB.</p><p>When we visualize the data trends in the BCAA metabolic pathway within each tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K and L</xref>), a shift in the BCAA, BCKA, and BCHA appears to be exercise and 2HB dependent; specifically 2HB treatment appears to reduce BCAA levels in red gastrocnemius at rest and during exercise, but increase BCKA and decrease the hydroxy acids during exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). The levels of intermediates within the BCAA degradation pathway increase in each compartment with exercise, with no strong effect of 2HB. These data suggest a shift in red gastrocnemius BCAA homeostasis induced by 2HB treatment.</p><p>To compare the effects of 2HB given the quantifiable difference in exercise performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâG</xref>), we adjusted metabolite values based on VO<sub>2</sub> measures during the exercise protocol or sham control. This adjustment yields values that indicate whether the levels of a given metabolite were high or low relative to the matching VO<sub>2</sub> measures for each mouse. We observed a number of differences and trends in the red gastrocnemius muscle: reduced levels of BCAA at rest and post-exercise, increased BCKA post-exercise, reduced BCHA post-exercise, and reduced 2HB post-exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). In white gastrocnemius we only observe a reduction to BCAA and the BCHA post-exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Each of these effects are weaker in the serum VO<sub>2</sub>-adjusted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that 2HB treatment alters muscle BCAA metabolic balance in excess of the changes to mouse VO<sub>2</sub> during exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>2KB is a fuel for oxidative metabolism</title><p>The metabolomics analysis led us to hypothesize that physiological 2HB accumulation is associated with competition for the BCAA degradation pathway, limiting oxidation of 2 KB. However, despite validation as a substrate for BCKDH in isolated enzyme assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pettit et al., 1978</xref>), 2 KB has not been validated as a potential fuel for mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Thus, we next aimed to investigate the potential of 2HB and 2 KB as fuel for oxidative metabolism in vitro and dependency of 2 KB oxidation on the BCAA degradation pathway. We subjected cells to Seahorse assays monitoring the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) during a standard âmitochondrial stress testâ protocol following acute administration of 500â5000 Î¼M of either Na2HB, Na2KB, or NaCl control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). With C2C12 myoblasts, we found a modest increase to OCR immediately following 2 KB addition, with no response to 2HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Presence of 2HB or 2 KB provided a small increase to the maximum OCR. We hypothesized that the standard assay media saturated cells with fuel, leaving little capacity for 2HB or 2 KB as a fuel. We therefore repeated the assays with no pyruvate in the medium. Similarly, an acute uptick in OCR was observed upon addition of 2 KB, but not 2HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). There was now a dose-dependent increase to maximal OCR in cells treated with 2 KB, up to a similar magnitude when pyruvate was included. Addition of 2HB was not able to recapitulate the maximum OCR observed when pyruvate was present in the media. These trends could be replicated with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), although with a lower magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

To broadly investigate cellular response to acute exogenous 2HB, we quantified cellular NAD+/NADH ratio after addition of 500 Î¼M 2HB to culture media. In C2C12 lysates harvested 60 min following addition of 2HB we found an increase to the NAD+/NADH ratio, indicating a drop in the cellular reducing potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). If cells were harvested after overnight culture, NAD+/NADH ratio had rebounded. There was no effect of treating cells with 2 KB, indicating that this metabolic response was specific to 2HB. These findings were replicated in MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To determine if the NAD+/NADH shift induced by 2HB exposure was dependent upon BCAT expression, we transfected C2C12 cells with a vector driving constitutive expression of DDK-tagged hBCAT2, or empty vector control. The increase to NAD+/NADH could be replicated in vector control cells, but the NAD+/NADH ratio in hBCAT2-transfected cells was insensitive to 2HB addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data describe an acute metabolic shock induced by addition of 2HB to cells, dependent upon BCAT inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>2HB treatment stimulates SIRT4 ADP ribosyltransferase activity</title><p>Increases to cellular NAD +are sensed by Sirtuins, a family of deacetylase enzymes that modify cellular metabolism. Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4) is localised to the mitochondria and is previously described to induce increased expression and post-translational activation of the BCAA degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaganjor et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that SIRT4 would be stimulated by the acute shift in NAD +induced by exogenous 2HB, and that SIRT4 may drive the cellular response to 2HB. First, we transfected MEFs and C2C12 myoblasts with siRNA against SIRT4 and checked for transcriptional induction of BCAA degradation pathway genes following overnight culture in media supplemented with 500 Î¼M 2HB or NaCl control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref> C). We found induction of genes including <italic>BCAT2</italic>, <italic>BCKDHA</italic>, <italic>BCKDHB</italic>, <italic>PCCA</italic>, <italic>SLC7A5</italic>, as well as <italic>LDHB</italic> and <italic>LDHA</italic> in both MEFs and C2C12s treated with 2HB compared with controls. Transfection with siRNA against SIRT4 disrupted the induction of these genes when cells were treated with 2HB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These data indicate that expression of SIRT4 is critical for the transcriptional feedback induced by 2HB treatment.</p><p>SIRT4 is perhaps better characterized as an ADP ribosyl transferase than as a deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Min et al., 2018</xref>). Addition of ADPr to protein requires consumption of local NAD+. Replacing the consumed NAD +can cause a compartmental shift in the supply of NAD+, and therefore the source of protein ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hopp et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, metabolic activity in one compartment may induce transcriptional change via regulating ADPr of transcription factors within the nucleus. To investigate the ability of SIRT4 to regulate compartmental ADPr, we separated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with siRNA against <italic>SIRT4</italic>, or non-targeting control, treated with 500 Î¼M 2HB or NaCl control for 16 hr. In western blots detecting total poly/mono-ADPr, we see that 2HB treatment increases ADPr in the cytoplasmic compartment, while reducing ADPr in the nuclear extracts, each dependent upon SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We were next interested in whether 2HB-induced SIRT4 activity might alter the ADPr of a transcription factor relevant to regulation of metabolism. C/EBPÎ² has been described to regulate adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>), which is also known to involve SIRT4-dependent regulation of BCAA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaganjor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, C/EBPÎ² transcriptional activity was shown to be dependent upon compartmental ADPr, wherein C/EBPÎ² ADPr reduces its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments pulling down total poly/mono-ADPr protein from C2C12 nuclear extracts and blotting for C/EBPÎ², or vice versa. We observed a strong effect of SIRT4 knockdown leading to increased ADPr of C/EBPÎ², and a trend towards reduced C/EBPÎ² ADPr in cells treated with 500 Î¼M 2HB for 8 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). It is possible that a small shift in ADPr may lead to significant changes to C/EBPÎ² transcriptional activity. We therefore continued by conducting chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments pulling down C/EBPÎ² and conducted qPCR for different promoter regions in the genes of <italic>BCKDHA</italic> and <italic>PCCA</italic> containing C/EBPÎ² consensus binding sites. We found that treating cells with 500 Î¼M 2HB for 8 hr stimulated binding of C/EBPÎ² to both gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). In summary, we find that treating cells with exogenous 2HB induces a metabolic response via BCAT inhibition, which stimulates SIRT4 to trigger a compartmental change in protein ADPr, leading to C/EBPÎ² binding to <italic>BCKDHA</italic> and <italic>PCCA</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

As the capacity for 2 KB oxidation will modify 2HB production, future work interested in the presented 2HB-dependent mechanism should carefully consider the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase and BCKDH in the tissue of interest as well as the metabolic environment guiding flux through these enzymes. Alternatively, 2 KB may be reduced by LDH to 2HB. The balance of oxidation versus reduction likely depends on cellular demand for NADH, oxygen availability, and capacity within the BCAA degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaganjor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Min et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We find that 2HB is a poor substrate for LDH oxidation, supporting the well-described accumulation of 2HB post-exercise, with a slow return to homeostatic levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morville et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these observations are consistent with the accumulation of 2HB as an indicator of saturated capacity for 2 KB oxidation via the BCAA degradation pathway. Interestingly, this pattern is mirrored by the BCHA, 2-hydroxyisocaproate, 2-hydroxy-3-methylvalerate, and 2-hydroxyisovalerate in human plasma metabolomics following exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The BCHA are rare metabolites, which is consistent with our observation of very low relative reaction rates for the reduction of BCKA by LDH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Further, we were unable to observe significant oxidation of the BCHA in isolated LDH assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which is consistent with the pattern of accumulation without return to baseline for all the hydroxy acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, we propose that the reduction of 2 KB and BCKA indicate oversaturation of the BCAA degradation pathway, leading to the LDH-dependent production of 2HB or BCHA that are metabolically stubborn and tend to accumulate.</p><p>It is reported that the liver is the major producer of circulating 2HB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2022</xref>), which would suggest that many tissues receive external 2HB, and that therefore the balance of 2HB metabolism will depend upon 2HB oxidation. LDH isolated from bovine heart had a greater capacity for oxidation of 2HB than LDH isolated from bovine skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that <italic>LDHB</italic> gene expression may provide an advantage when metabolising exogenous 2HB. Skeletal muscle expression of <italic>LDHB</italic> was previously reported to be induced by exercise training, and to be dependent upon peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ coactivator 1Î± (PGC-1Î±), and that <italic>LDHB</italic> expression was required for generating an exercise training benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liang et al., 2016</xref>). Together, this would suggest that improved capacity for metabolising 2HB is common to the progression of endurance training. Since we observed no induction to PGC-1Î± gene expression or mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>), treatment with exogenous 2HB does not appear to replicate all exercise training responses in oxidative skeletal muscle. It is possible that 2HB-induced effects on BCAA metabolism occur in an early stage of skeletal muscle endurance training, and that additional signals are required to continue training progression.</p><p>We found that the in vitro improvement to oxidative capacity induced by 2HB was dependent upon expression of BCKDHA and SIRT4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). SIRT4 has been previously reported to produce greater expression and activation of BCAA degradation pathway members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zaganjor et al., 2021</xref>), along with C/EBPÎ² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ryu et al., 2018</xref>), making this a logical signaling axis for 2HB response. SIRT4 is relatively unique in its preference for ADP-ribosylation activity as opposed to the de-acylation activity of other sirtuins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kumar and Lombard, 2015</xref>), providing further support for the role of SIRT4 in the presented mechanism. However, future work should investigate the role of other sirtuins, particularly the other mitochondrial sirtuins SIRT3 and SIRT5, as these are often more prevalent than SIRT4 and modify a large range of target proteins.</p><p>Increased flux in the BCAA degradation pathway is reflected by a reduced proportion of BCKDHA phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paxton and Harris, 1984</xref>), which we observe in the soleus of 2HB-treated mice post-exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). BCKDHA phosphorylation by BCKDH kinase is inhibited by BCKA. Thus, the reduced BCKDHA phosphorylation is consistent with the increase to BCKA observed in oxidative red gastrocnemius muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). That we observe reduced levels of muscular BCHA despite the increase to BCKA levels, without an increase in release of BCKA to the serum, suggests an increase to the oxidative muscle capacity for BCKA oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data form a logical feedback loop where accumulation of 2HB provides negative feedback to reduce BCAA degradation at the stage of BCAT. Acutely, this would reduce competition for 2 KB in the BCAA degradation pathway by slowing conversion of BCAA to keto acids. A sufficiently large acute dose of 2HB may limit mitochondrial fuel by inhibiting BCAT. This model is consistent with the observed rapid increase to NAD+/NADH ratio in MEFs and C2C12s treated with 2HB in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We show that this metabolic effect will lead to transcriptional feedback; an increase BCAA and 2 KB oxidation capacity will in the long-term reduce the production of 2HB and BCHA, as observed in red gastrocnemius post-exercise in 2HB-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). That we observe similar transcriptional regulation, changes to BCKDHA phosphorylation, and changes to oxidative metabolism phenotypes in vivo suggests that a similar mechanism is occurring in response to intraperitoneal injections of 2HB. In the case of exercise, the physiological accumulation of 2HB would occur during high metabolic demand when mitochondrial fuel supply may be sensitive to the 2HB despite a potentially lower concentration than the exogenous doses used in this study. This is supported by the lack of additive effect on mouse ÎVO<sub>2</sub>max when exogenous 2HB treatment was combined with exercise training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, this study presents an axis of cellular response to 2HB and presents a functional response to repeated 2HB treatment in the form of improved exercise performance and resistance to fatigue in oxidative murine skeletal muscle. Further work investigating cellular responses to accumulated 2HB are warranted as this metabolite accumulates in the circulation of individuals with infection and metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruzzone et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cobb et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Labs (C57Bl/6JRj) and housed at Karolinska Institutet under specific pathogen-free conditions.

Excess adipose tissue was manually cleaned from the muscles and tendons were tied with a braided silk thread and mounted in a 15 mL stimulation chamber between a force transducer and an adjustable holder (World Precision Instruments).

To investigate the effects of 2HB treatment against or in combination with a progressive exercise training protocol would require an experiment duration between 4 to 12 weeks, based on previous studies (Systematic Review by Massett et al., Frontiers in Physiology, 2021, 10.3389/fphys.2021.782695). However, our experience with these types of experiments is that such a pursuit would require a breadth of work beyond the scope of this current study. For instance, if there were evidence of weakened effect of 2HB over time, one may be compelled to investigate other organs such as the liver to find signs of metabolic adaptation to the exogenous metabolite. If there were additive or synergistic effects on exercise performance, one may be compelled to investigate changes to the cardiovascular system in addition to the skeletal muscle. Additional questions would be raised around the skeletal muscle as well, including assessment of structural and fibre-type changes. Further, these additional mechanisms would need to be characterized in a time course fashion. Rather, we view the scope of the current study to be the acute response to 2HB as an initial report on mechanistic effects of 2HB.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Exercise training leads to significant mitochondrial changes, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle. It would be valuable to compare the impact of 2HB treatment on mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity in treated mice to that in exercised mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the author that it is of interest to investigate how 2HB may affect mitochondrial biogenesis. However, our preliminary findings were that 2HB-treated MEFs, C2C12s, and mouse soleus muscles showed no change in PGC1Î± gene expression after four days of treatment (data not shown). As a follow-up assessment of mitochondrial protein expression, although not specific to mtDNA derived genes, we quantified the expression of the respiratory chain proteins in cells and soleus muscle and found no effect of 2HB treatment (SFig. 5,6). At this stage we conclude that there is not evidence of 2HB modifying mitochondrial biogenesis in this time frame and that further investigation would be best suited to a follow-up study such as one interested in long-term exercise training.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors demonstrate that 2-ketobutyrate (2KB) can serve as an oxidative fuel, suggesting a role for the intact BCAA catabolic pathway. However, it's puzzling that the knockout of BCKDHA, a subunit crucial for the second step of BCAA catabolism, did not result in changes in oxidative capacity in cultured myoblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>While we report the BCKDH complex to be dispensable for 2KB oxidation it is important to note that previous studies have reported the following: (1) that 2KB is a viable substrate for BCKDH, (2) that 2KB is a viable substrate for pyruvate dehydrogenase, and (3) that pyruvate dehydrogenase is also dispensable for 2KB oxidation (see Steele et al., J Nutr., 114: 701-710, and Paxton et al. Biochem J., 234:295-303). Collectively, these data have led previous studies to conclude that BCKDH and pyruvate dehydrogenase are redundant for the first step of 2KB oxidation, with a preference for BCKDH. The flux through either may depend upon the metabolic environment. The aim for figure 3C was to determine whether the BCAA degradation pathway was required for 2KB oxidation. We conclude that this pathway is required, first at the step of PCC.</p><p>While these past studies were mentioned in paragraph 2 of the discussion, in light of thereviewerâs comment we have expanded this paragraph. We have added language to explain that future research interested in the presented 2HB mechanism should carefully consider BCKDH and PDH expression in the cell or tissue of interest, as the metabolism of 2KB is quite central to the presented mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, this innovative model of metabolic signaling during exercise will serve as a valuable reference for informing future.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;A 2-HB-mediated feedback loop regulates muscular fatigue&quot; by the Johnson group reports interesting findings with implications for the health benefits of exercise.
