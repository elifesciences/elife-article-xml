While the diversity of life may indeed seem endless, the many examples of convergent or parallel evolution reveal that evolution commonly is on repeat. Both the developmental biology and the ecology of organisms contribute to such instances of repeated evolution. The mechanisms of development make some morphologies arise frequently and others rarely (i.e., developmental bias; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Uller et al., 2018</xref>), while the ecology of the population makes some of the morphologies that do arise consistently fitter than others. These explanations have often been pitted against each other (‘constraint’ <italic>versus</italic> ‘selection’), but this is a false dichotomy. For example, the striking parallelism of cichlid fish in Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika is jointly determined by the similarity in the ecology, and hence selective pressures, of the lakes, and the shared developmental biology of the fish that provided natural selection with similar morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kocher et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p><italic>Anolis</italic> lizards are one of the iconic examples of evolution on repeat. Following colonization of the Greater Antillean islands (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Puerto Rico) some 50 mya, lizards have diversified by exploiting a variety of habitats, including tree trunks, twigs and bushes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rand and Williams, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). While the role of natural selection in the adaptive radiation of <italic>Anolis</italic> is undisputed, it remains poorly understood how developmental bias has shaped their phenotypic diversification and convergence. One hypothesis posits that plastic responses to the microhabitat contributed to, and perhaps facilitated, the evolution of similar morphologies (i.e., ‘ecomorphs’) on different islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Losos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>). Plasticity is conducive to repeated evolution when the developmental mechanisms that enable individuals to accommodate new conditions are evolutionarily conserved. This is particularly relevant to the locomotor skeleton (i.e., limbs, shoulder and hip girdles) given that bone growth responds to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall, 2005</xref>), that microhabitat is known to affect limb growth in lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolbe and Losos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Downes and Hoefer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langford et al., 2014</xref>), and the well-documented ability of <italic>Anolis</italic> populations to adaptively evolve limb length to fit their structural habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schoener et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stuart et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the locomotor skeleton of <italic>Anolis</italic> species could be prone to evolve similar morphologies on different islands because the mechanical stress imposed by each habitat makes some functional solutions (i.e., fit morphologies) consistently more accessible to selection than others.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of ecomorphs on the four main Greater Antillean islands and elements of the morphological dataset capturing variation in the locomotor skeleton.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The four islands of the Greater Antilles, Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, each inhabit a set of independently evolved ecomorphs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poe et al., 2017</xref>).

However, since limb length can only vary in one dimension (i.e., longer or shorter), it provides limited information on the alignment between plasticity and evolutionary divergence. Multivariate data are more suitable for sorting between alternative adaptive solutions to the same problem (i.e., many-to-one mapping between morphology and performance). Such data make it possible to assess if traits that are highly plastic are also highly evolvable, and if plastic responses are well aligned with adaptive divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radersma et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To assess the extent to which morphological plasticity is likely to have shaped the adaptive radiation of <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards, we quantified the shape of the pectoral (shoulder) and pelvic (hip) girdles, the length of individual limb bones and the thickness of the long bones for 95 species of Greater Antillean <italic>Anolis</italic>. Using these data, we firstly assessed to what extent the morphological divergence of pairs of ecomorphs are parallel on the four main islands. Secondly, we tested if the features of the locomotor skeleton that respond to mechanical stress are particularly evolvable and, thirdly, if morphological divergence between those ecomorphs is aligned with the morphological plasticity induced directly by the microhabitat. Both of these associations are expected if plasticity were to contribute to the repeated evolution of similar morphologies. However, environmentally induced morphologies only shape evolution if the changes have functional consequences. Finally, we therefore assessed if evolutionary divergent and phenotypically plastic features of the locomotor skeleton predict perching behavior and locomotor performance in species adapted to different microhabitats.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Using micro-CT scans of museum specimens, we quantified the morphology of the locomotor skeleton of 259 males from 95 Greater Antillean <italic>Anolis</italic> species that have been assigned to one of six ecomorph categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Losos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We acknowledge that the ecomorph classification does not always rely on well-documented habitat use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Poe and Anderson, 2019</xref>), but there is a very close concordance between classification based on habitat use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref>) and classification that also includes gross morphology, such as the total length of limbs, head size and tail length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Losos, 2009</xref>). We quantified shape using 18 3D landmarks each on the pectoral and the pelvic girdle (partially adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tinius and Russell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tinius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), and measured the length of 15 limb elements of fore- and hindlimb, as well as the cortical thickness and bone diameter in virtual cross-sections of the four long bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used the centroid size of the pelvic girdle as a proxy for body size. This resulted in a morphological dataset consisting of 132 features or traits that were scaled to allow vector-based analyses on combined shape and univariate data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams and Collyer, 2019</xref>), following a similar approach by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2017</xref>; see Materials and methods). While this approach means that differences between, for example, ecomorphs are not interpretable in terms of shape, the data capture the overall morphology of the locomotor skeleton, which is the primary focus of this study. However, for completeness, we also report the main results for girdles and limbs analysed separately. Note that this data set is very different from the traits (e.g., total limb, head and tail lengths) that form the basis for most inference on <italic>Anolis</italic> adaptive radiation and convergence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mahler et al., 2013</xref>).

The differences in the structural habitats promoted different styles of locomotion and perching behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feiner et al., 2020</xref>). Both species belong to the Cuban clade and, therefore, the appropriate evolutionary divergence to compare against is the contrast between the respective ecomorphs in this clade on Cuba (trunk-ground [N<sub>Individuals</sub> = 20, N<sub>Species</sub> = 9] <italic>versus</italic> trunk-crown [N<sub>Individuals</sub> = 20, N<sub>Species</sub> = 9]).</p><p>The morphology of both species responded to the microhabitat treatment. As expected, the magnitude of environmentally induced morphological change was substantially smaller than the evolutionary divergence between the corresponding ecomorphs. The vector length was three times larger for the evolutionary divergence compared to the environmentally induced shift in morphology (<italic>A. sagrei</italic><sub>(broad vs narrow)</sub>, L = 12.05; <italic>A. carolinensis</italic><sub>(broad vs narrow)</sub>, L = 12.23; ecomorph<sub>(trunk-ground vs trunk-crown)</sub>, L = 39.47). Among all 132 traits, we singled out 15 traits that significantly distinguish between Cuban trunk-ground and trunk-crown specimens (i.e., the most evolutionary divergent traits), and 14 and 10 traits that significantly distinguish the environmentally induced microhabitat specialists in <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> and <italic>A. sagrei</italic>, respectively (i.e., most plastic traits; see Material and methods). Notably, these traits showed limited overlap between the three runner/climber contrasts: while <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> showed the greatest plastic response in the anterior part of the locomotor skeleton, the most affected traits in <italic>A. sagrei</italic> were found in the posterior part associated with the pelvic girdle or the hindlimb (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). In contrast, the 15 most evolutionary divergent traits were mostly associated with limb bones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). This qualitative difference between the runner/climber axis of ecomorphs and environmentally induced phenotypes is supported by comparing angles between runner/climber vectors.

Plasticity can promote repeated evolution when the developmental mechanisms are conserved, since species will tend to generate similar phenotypes under similar ecological conditions. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a detailed analyses of the morphology of the locomotor skeleton of <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards in the Greater Antilles and compared this to the morphological variation induced by locomotion in different microhabitats. While the morphological divergence in the locomotor skeleton between ecomorphs occurred along similar trajectories on the four islands, the results suggest that phenotypic plasticity at best played a minor role in the repeated evolution of these morphologies.</p><p>The adaptive radiation of <italic>Anolis</italic> in the Greater Antilles appears to have filled the morphospace of the locomotor skeleton homogenously, without leaving gaps. While some ecomorphs are rather distinct in their morphology (e.g., crown-giant, twig and grass-bush), others show substantial overlap. Nevertheless, morphological divergence between pairs of ecomorphs tended to occur along similar trajectories, even if the ecomorph divergence on one island rarely was indistinguishable from that of another island (i.e., Θ ≈ 0). The alignment of morphological divergence was highly consistent for all ecomorph pairs across the four islands, and this result held up in separate analyses of limb bones and the pectoral and pelvic girdles. Thus, <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards adapted to a given microhabitat show a moderate degree of morphological similarity in their locomotor skeleton, a similarity that appears consistent across the Greater Antillean islands (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tinius and Russell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tinius et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several different morphologies of limbs and girdles can perform well in a given microhabitat (i.e., a many-to-one mapping of form to function; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wainwright et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alfaro et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vanhooydonck et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, repeated evolution is more likely when species share a developmental biology that makes some phenotypes appear readily while others are rare or even impossible. For example, <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards that live on tree trunks would be prone to adapt in similar ways if morphological variation was highly structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Herrel et al., 2008</xref>). However, this does not appear to be the case within the morphospace of Greater Antillean <italic>Anolis</italic>. Some ecomorphs were primarily distinguished by the shape of the pelvis, and others by the shape of the pectoral girdle or limb length. Such low concordance in ecomorph ‘signature traits’ would hardly be possible if different parts of the locomotor skeleton were highly constrained to vary together. Thus, we anticipate that genetic variants that affect one part of the locomotor skeleton (e.g., hindlimbs) will not have systemic effects on the morphology of other parts (e.g., pelvis).</p><p>Even without such ‘genetic constraints’, morphological variation can be structured since individual responses to the environment make some phenotypes common and others rare. It has been hypothesized that the responsiveness of bone to mechanical stress imposed by the microhabitat contributed to the repeated evolution of ecomorphs – and in particular limb morphology – by consistently biasing the distribution of phenotypes that can be selected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>). Our experimental and comparative data provide three strong pieces of evidence against this hypothesis when applied to the locomotor skeleton. Firstly, plastic responses differed qualitatively between the two species. Although the plasticity of the ancestor is unknown, the lack of a shared response between species suggests that the developmental bias induced by mechanical stress is too transient to bear responsibility for the repeated evolution of ecomorphs. Secondly, traits that were highly plastic in either of the species did not appear to be highly evolvable within <italic>Anolis</italic>, and the changes in morphology caused by plasticity were poorly aligned with morphological divergence between the corresponding ecomorphs. This non-alignment persisted if only highly plastic or highly evolutionary divergent traits were considered. In other words, there was no evidence that evolution would proceed primarily through modification of plastic responses. Thirdly, the morphological variation induced by the microhabitat largely failed to explain individual differences in locomotor performance in those habitats. That is, while plasticity affects the phenotypes that <italic>can be</italic> selected in a particular microhabitat, it is perhaps unlikely to affect which phenotypes that <italic>are</italic> selected. We therefore conclude that morphological plasticity at best played a minor role in the repeated evolution of <italic>Anolis</italic> ecomorphs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>When will plasticity take the lead in adaptive evolution?</title><p>The literature on developmental plasticity and evolution has repeatedly emphasized how bone development orchestrates functional integration between skeletons, muscles and other parts of the body, partly by being responsive to mechanical stress imposed by the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Standen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levis et al., 2018</xref>). The apparent lack of a relationship between plasticity and adaptive divergence of the <italic>Anolis</italic> locomotor skeleton may therefore seem surprising. However, while the developmental biology of bone makes morphologies highly evolvable, it does not follow that plastic responses and adaptive divergence will be well aligned.</p><p>To see why, consider that environmentally induced phenotypes are most likely to ‘take the lead’ in adaptive evolution when (i) plasticity has a directional and recurrent effect on the phenotype distribution in a given environment; (ii) this shift in phenotype distribution has consequences for which phenotypes are selected (i.e., the ones in the population with highest fitness), and (iii) the phenotypes that are selected are heritable. We suggest that these three conditions are particularly likely to hold either when environmental perturbations are severe or when the environmental variables that change are those that developmental systems use as cues in adaptive plasticity.</p><p>Firstly, if the environmental perturbation is severe, developmental plasticity is crucial since it enables individuals to maintain some (but variable) degree of functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">West-Eberhard, 2003</xref>). The individuals may not be very fit in absolute terms but, if the perturbation is recurrent or affect a large fraction of the population, selection may retain at least some of the induced variants. As a result, the adaptations that evolve will tend to resemble phenotypes that once were environmentally induced, perhaps resulting in phenotypes that are distinctively novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moczek et al., 2011</xref>). That the morphology of the shoulder girdle in Polypterus fish forced to move on land resembles the shoulder girdle of stem tetrapods is at least compatible with this scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Standen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, classic laboratory experiments by Waddington on <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Waddington, 1953</xref>), and more recent work on heat-shocked tobacco hornworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suzuki and Nijhout, 2006</xref>) demonstrates that it is possible to adapt through selection on novel, environmentally induced traits.</p><p>Secondly, when organisms have evolved an adaptive response to environmental cues, most individuals in a population will respond in similar (yet variable) ways to an extreme environment. These phenotypic ‘extrapolations’ may be reasonably fit, especially if the cue and selective environment are highly correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kouvaris et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, locally adapted phenotypes should resemble environmentally induced phenotypes, a pattern supported by a meta-analysis of reciprocal transplant experiments in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Radersma et al., 2020</xref>). The phenotype dimensions that are adaptively plastic may in fact have particularly high evolvability since theoretical and empirical studies suggest that those dimensions harbour particularly high levels of additive genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Draghi and Whitlock, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Noble et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brun-Usan et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, all three conditions above are fulfilled, making plasticity appear to take the lead in adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kovaka, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Uller et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The present results suggest that neither of these scenarios are likely to apply to the repeated evolution of similar locomotor skeletons in <italic>Anolis</italic> ecomorphs. While some microhabitats may rarely be encountered in nature by a given species, our experiments show that the plastic responses to these microhabitats do not radically change what phenotypes are available to selection, or which ones are fit. That is, selection on genetic variation appears sufficient to cause the evolutionary divergence in the locomotor skeleton between ecomorphs. Our experiments also suggest that <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards have not evolved to exploit the responsiveness of bone growth as a mechanism for adjusting their morphology to the microhabitat in which they happen to be born. The hallmarks of such adaptive plasticity are precise developmental ‘switches’ (e.g., seasonal polyphenism in butterflies and other insects; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brakefield, 1996</xref>) or physiological mechanisms that ensure that individuals can adjust their phenotype adaptively and often reversibly (e.g., vertebrate stress responses). In comparison, the flexibility of bone growth in <italic>Anolis</italic> appears a poor mechanism for adjusting individual morphology to match the local environment. In fact, the developmental mechanisms that underlie species differences in limb length may act very early in development, before any mechanical stress imposed by locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sanger et al., 2012</xref>). If this is not peculiar to <italic>Anolis</italic>, environmentally induced variation in bone morphology may typically exercise a transient effect on the direction of adaptation to microhabitat. Thus, in general, comparisons of the relationship between plasticity and adaptive divergence over different time scales will be important to reveal the extent to which plasticity is consequential, and when it facilitates or hampers adaptation.</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal a consistent but moderate degree of morphological convergence in the locomotor skeleton of Greater Antillean <italic>Anolis</italic>. Our comparative and experimental analyses demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity is unlikely to have contributed to the repeated evolution of limb and girdle morphologies in <italic>Anolis</italic> ecomorphs. Instead, we suggest that the locomotor skeleton has evolved within a subset of possible morphologies that are highly accessible through genetic change, allowing repeatability of adaptive divergence independently of plasticity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Micro-CT scanning</title><p>Museum specimens were subjected to micro computed tomography (micro-CT) scanning using a GE phoenix v|tome|x m system (source voltage 100 kV; source current 200 µA; isometric voxel size 30–130 µm) at the Nanoscale Facility of the University of Florida, US.

In these cases, we landmarked the right sides of the structures and used the R package ‘StereoMorph’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olsen and Westneat, 2015</xref>) to mirror landmarks onto the left side.

A statistical feature of this procedure is that seven degrees of freedom are lost in the case of 3D-landmarks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kendall, 1984</xref>). A possible operation to remove this redundancy in dimensions is to extract principal components from the Procrustes shape variables. However, when principal components instead of Procrustes shape variables are transformed to standard normal deviates (see section’ Transformation of morphological dataset’ below), their properties change and biological signal would therefore be lost. Ultimately, the seven redundant dimensions in the Procrustes shape variables have no impact on the downstream analyses (e.g., trajectory analyses) and the analyses can therefore proceed on Procrustes shape variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohlf, 1999</xref>).</p><p>For assessing the repeatability of the landmarking procedure (including the thresholding of raw imaging data to extract mesh files), we re-extracted and re-landmarked a set of 10 pectoral and pelvic girdles.

The resulting mean squares were used to assess the variance due to differences among individuals compared to the total variance. Using this method, we found that the repeatability of the entire procedure of extracting morphologies and applying landmarks was 0.98 for the pectoral girdle, and 0.94 for the pelvic girdle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1J and 1K</xref>).</p><p>The centroid size of the pelvic girdle was highly correlated with the centroid size of the pectoral girdle (<italic>r</italic> = 0.99, p-value&lt;0.001, N = 375), and with snout-vent length (SVL) measured in lab-reared lizards using a digital caliper (<italic>A. carolinensis: r</italic> = 0.96, p-value&lt;0.001, N = 45; <italic>A. sagrei: r</italic> = 0.97, p-value&lt;0.001, N = 71).

One downside of this approach is that the results are not interpretable in terms of changes in morphological shape. However, the focus of this study is to address how parallel ecomorph divergences are on different islands, and how well plastic responses are aligned with these divergences, across the entire morphology of the locomotor skeleton.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Species selection</title><p>Since species status of some <italic>Anolis</italic> taxa is under debate, we included all <italic>Anolis</italic> taxa that are currently (December 2019) recognized as ‘species’ by the Reptile Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Uetz, 2019</xref>). We aimed at covering at least three male individuals per <italic>Anolis</italic> species that fulfill the following criteria: 1) being classified as one of the six main ecomorphs (trunk-ground, trunk-crown, crown-giant, twig, grass-bush and trunk) by either <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Losos, 2009</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2012</xref> and 2) having a geographic origin on one of the main islands of the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Jamaica, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico).

This is necessary because the nature of the vector-based analysis does not allow controlling for sex as is common practice, for example, in linear mixed models. While this prevents us from detecting sex differences in the alignment between plasticity and evolutionary divergence, the present study was designed to test for an effect of microhabitat (broad or narrow surfaces) on the locomotor skeleton that is not specific to one sex.</p><p>During the process of micro-CT scanning, sex was assigned to all individuals based on external morphology, and cross-checked with sex identity based on information provided in museum catalogues. When such assignment of sex was not possible or ambiguous, we used the shape of the pelvic girdle to corroborate sex identity. The rationale is that, due to reproductive functions that differ between males and females, sex differences should be most pronounced in the shape of the pelvic girdle. We used a linear discriminant analysis to classify individuals lacking sex assignment based on a training set of individual with sex unambiguously assigned. We only accepted sex assignments that had a posterior probability of ≥0.8. The method was first validated on a large dataset consisting of 687 pelvic shape variables of 218 <italic>Anolis</italic> species for which sex assignments were available, and which was arbitrarily split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets. We found that 94.40% of all specimens were correctly assigned to their sex class, and we thus deem this method appropriate for assigning sex to individuals with unknown sex identity.</p><p>The final dataset consisted of 259 individuals from 95 species from the Greater Antilles with a minimum of one, a maximum of 14, and a mean of 2.73 (±1.59 standard deviations) individuals per species. We used principal component analysis (R package ‘stats’) to visualize broad patterns of variation between all individuals in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we confirmed these patterns by performing phylogenetic principal component analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Revell, 2009</xref>) on the level of species and by constructing ‘phylomorphospaces’ (both using the R package ‘phytools’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Revell, 2012</xref>); version 0.6–99).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of convergence</title><p>We quantified convergence in morphology across the Greater Antillean <italic>Anolis</italic> using the Wheatsheaf index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arbuckle et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, the Wheatsheaf index is a metric of how similar a group of distantly related taxa is given their phylogenetic distance (large indices indicate high degrees of convergence). The R package ‘windex’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Arbuckle and Minter, 2015</xref>; version 1.0) calculates a Wheatsheaf indexes for a focal group of taxa (i.e., ecomorphs) given a trait matrix and a phylogenetic tree, and by permuting the dataset estimates the significance levels of the observed convergence. Since scaled values were used as input in these analyses, the Wheatsheaf indices were calculated with the setting ‘SE = FALSE’. The input tree for both analyses was a phylogeny constructed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poe et al., 2017</xref> that was pruned to contain the 95 focal species. Six <italic>Anolis</italic> species (<italic>A. chlorodius, A. eladioi, A. loysiana, A. pecuarius, A. peynadoi and A. viridius</italic>) were missing from the phylogeny since they were recently split from other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Köhler and Blair Hedges, 2016</xref>). According to the phylogenetic affinities described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Köhler and Blair Hedges, 2016</xref>, species were grafted onto the phylogenetic tree using the function ‘bind.tip’ in the R package ‘phytools’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Revell, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of parallelism across islands</title><p>To assess the degree of parallelism between pairs of ecomorphs on pairs of islands, we followed a phenotypic trajectory analysis approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams and Collyer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams and Collyer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collyer et al., 2015</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2017</xref>). We conducted these analyses both on the full data set and separately for the two girdles, limb length and bone (cortical) thickness. The latter makes the results for the girdles directly comparable to standard analyses of geometric morphometric data. For a given pair of ecomorphs on a pair of islands, the phenotypic trajectories between ecomorphs are described by a vector in multivariate space. The vector for a given island consists of independent two-sample <italic>t</italic>-values calculated for each of the 132 traits between the two focal ecomorphs. Thus, the elements of each vector are <italic>t</italic>-values, and each vector has 132 elements. <italic>T</italic>-values are the differences in trait means, divided by the standard errors of the differences and therefore represent the difference is trait means expressed in units of standard error. Resulting vectors for ecomorph pairs have both a direction and length in morphospace and can therefore be compared between island pairs using two metrics: the angle Θ between two vectors describes the alignment in direction and ΔL describes the difference between the length of two vectors. Values for the angle Θ fall between 0 and 180°, while ΔL can take positive or negative values. The angle Θ and the ΔL between vector a and b were calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtable columnalign="left left" columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo></mml:msqrt><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo></mml:msqrt><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>180</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:mspace width="2em"/><mml:mspace width="2em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo></mml:msqrt><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo></mml:msqrt><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The significance levels of observed angles Θ and ΔL values were assessed using a permutation approach (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stuart et al., 2017</xref> for a similar approach). To simulate parallelism, islands of origins were permuted for each set of ecomorph/island comparisons and 999 ‘parallel’ angles Θ and ΔL values were calculated. Based on this distribution of angles Θ and ΔL values, we assessed if the observed values are significantly different from parallel. Similarly, to assess if the angles Θ deviate significantly from orthogonal (90°), we bootstrapped the individuals for each ecomorph/island comparisons by drawing with replacement. We then assessed if this ‘bootstrapped’ distribution was significantly different from 90°, that is, if orthogonal direction between two vectors could be rejected. Note that vectors drawn at random are expected to have an average angle Θ of 90°. We performed these tests for 53 ecomorph/island comparisons resulting from 15 ecomorph pairs and 6 island pairs (three ecomorphs missing on two islands preclude several comparisons).</p><p>The results of this t-test based trajectory analysis were confirmed by an alternative analysis that calculates phenotypic change vectors based on differences in multivariate means using a linear model with randomized residuals in a permutation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Collyer and Adams, 2007</xref>). This was done using the function ‘trajectory.analysis’ in the R package ‘RRPP’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collyer and Adams, 2018</xref>; version 0.4.3) with the formula ‘traits ~ island*ecomorph’ and 999 iterations. Importantly, this analysis was performed separately for landmark and univariate data and, for the sake of comparison, the t-test based analysis was also repeated for these two data subsets. The observed angles Θ between the t-test based and the phenotypic change vector based approaches were highly correlated (landmark data: <italic>r</italic> = 0.984, p-value&lt;0.001; univariate data: <italic>r</italic> = 0.956, p-value&lt;0.001). We did not apply the phenotypic change vector based approach to test whether ecomorph divergences are aligned with environmentally-induced changes since the groups are different in kind (the plasticity data are within species and ecomorph data between species; see below) and therefore not appropriate for this statistical model.</p><p>A corollary of applying a <italic>t</italic>-value based calculation of trajectories in morphospace is that a decomposition of the vector into its 132 elements allows us to assess which of the morphological traits are contributing most to the overall ecomorph differences. Thus, sorting the 132 individual <italic>t</italic>-values by absolute values provides a ranking of traits according to impact on ecomorph divergence. Furthermore, we used the function ‘scores’ in the R package ‘outliers’ (version 0.14) to single out traits that had significantly (outside the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile) higher or lower <italic>t</italic>-values compared to the distribution of all 132 traits. We used this method to identify traits that significantly distinguish the evolutionary divergence between ecomorph pairs (trunk-ground and trunk-crown on Cuba) and the most plastic traits for both <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> and <italic>A. sagrei</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Locomotor-induced variation in morphology</title><p>Skeletons are malleable by physical activity and adjust based on the stress that bones experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall, 2005</xref>). To quantify morphological variation induced by locomotor activity, we raised juveniles of two species in structurally different habitats that foster phenotypes specialized in climbing or running. We selected a trunk-ground species specialized in running (<italic>A. sagrei</italic>), and a trunk-crown species specialized in climbing (<italic>A. carolinensis</italic>). Both are derived from the Cuban clade, which allows us to compare trajectories between plastic responses and morphological divergence between the ecomorphs in this clade. The following information is a brief summary of the detailed description in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feiner et al., 2020</xref>.</p><p>Twenty-four female and eight male adult lizards of each of the two species, <italic>A. sagrei</italic> and <italic>A. carolinensis</italic>, were collected in Palm Coast, Florida in April 2016 and brought to the animal facility at Lund University. We housed all animals in 80 litre cages (Wham Crystal box with mesh on top, 590 × 390×415 mm), with one male and three females per cage. Males were swapped between cages twice during the course of the experiment to increase the spread of parentage among experimental animals. Cages were enriched with twigs, hiding areas, basking spots and a water bowl. Plastic cups with moist vermiculite were provided for oviposition. Adult lizards were kept at a light cycle of 12 L:12 D and given access to basking lights (60 W) for 10 hr per day and a UV light (EXO-TERRA 10.0 UVB fluorescent tube) for 6 hr per day. Mealworms and crickets were provided <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Eggs were collected every second day and incubated at 26°C in individual small plastic containers filled two-thirds with moist vermiculite (5:1 vermiculite:water volume ratio) and sealed with clingfilm.</p><p>Hatchlings (at most 24 hr after hatching) were alternatingly assigned to experimental treatments that consisted of 80 litre cages (see above) with different interior fittings. The narrow treatment consisted of an arrangement of six unpainted wooden dowels, three 0.4 cm and three 0.8 cm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The broad treatment contained two unpainted wooden planks (4 × 8×50 cm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Both dowels and planks were angled at approximately 40°. Each cage contained a water bowl, and light conditions were identical to the adult setup described above. Cage walls were coated with Fluon, which proved fully effective in restricting lizards to the experimental interior fittings. A group of six juveniles were housed in a single cage since prior observations indicated that grouping lizards encourages locomotor activity and the development of a natural behavioural repertoire. To minimize negative effects due to social hierarchies (e.g. ‘runting’), we grouped lizards of roughly the same age together (±3 days). Juvenile lizards were fed daily with different size classes of crickets according to their gape size, and crickets were dusted with vitamins and calcium (Zoo Med Reptivite Reptile Vitamins with D3) twice a week to promote normal bone growth. The structural habitat in this setup reflects biologically relevant conditions (range of natural perch diameters of <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> juveniles and <italic>A. sagrei</italic> juveniles, 0.3 to 4.4 cm and 0.3 to &gt;10.8 cm, resp.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoener, 1968</xref>). Although the diameter of perch sites was comparable to previous studies testing the effect of structural habitat on limb plasticity in <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Losos et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolbe and Losos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langford et al., 2014</xref>), our setup provided more total surface area and greater cage size than in previous studies, and treatment commenced immediately upon hatching.</p><p>Most lizards in our experiment reached sexual maturity at the age of five months, at which time growth typically begins to slow down (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">O'Bryant and Wade, 2001</xref>), and we therefore chose this as the end point of the experiment. Before lizards were sacrificed (through a blow to the back of the head followed by neck dislocation and destruction of the brain), we conducted behavioural experiments (see below). Immediately after lizards were sacrificed, sex was determined based on external features and confirmed by inspecting internal anatomy <italic>post mortem</italic>. Lizards were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in 100% ethanol. Morphological data was extracted from micro-CT scans as described above.</p><p>We successfully raised 154 juveniles of <italic>A. sagrei</italic> (N = 80 broad treatment, N = 74 narrow treatment) and 89 of <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> (N = 43 broad treatment, N = 46 narrow treatment) to 5 months of age. Survival rate from hatching until the termination of the experiment was 90% for <italic>A. sagrei</italic> and 87% for <italic>A. carolinensis</italic>. In this paper, we restricted the data collection of <italic>Anolis</italic> species to male specimens to allow comparison to the comparative dataset, resulting in the following sample size: <italic>A. sagrei</italic> (N = 41 broad treatment, N = 34 narrow treatment) and <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> (N = 22 broad treatment, N = 23 narrow treatment).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Behavioural and performance assays</title><p>To quantify the effect of the treatment on locomotion, we performed two trials that capture different functional aspects of lizards. First, we assessed perching behaviour, and second, we scored running and climbing performances.</p><p>We tested perching behaviour of <italic>A. sagrei</italic> and <italic>A. carolinensis</italic> by scoring the propensity of lizards to climb a challengingly narrow dowel. Locomotion on narrow dowels presents a challenge for <italic>Anolis</italic> lizards, with species not specialized in manoeuvring narrow surfaces frequently losing balance or even falling off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Losos and Sinervo, 1989</xref>). The rationale of this behavioural assay was to test whether lizards that were reared in the narrow treatment show greater confidence with perching and basking on narrow surfaces.</p><p>The experimental setup of the perching assay consisted of a wooden dowel (52 cm), gradually narrowing towards the tip (diameter: 2 cm at base, 0.5 mm at tip), that was placed at 45° angle with the tip 5 cm under a heat lamp. During a trial, lizards were placed at the base of the dowel and we recorded the position it would chose to bask. To increase the motivation of the lizards to move towards the narrow tip of the dowel, and thus closer to the heat lamp, the experiment was performed at 16°C, and lizards were acclimatized to this temperature 30 min prior to the trial. Temperatures were measured at the tip of the dowel directly under the lamp (26°C) and at 5 (21°C), 10 (20°C), and 20 cm (18°C) distance from the tip of the dowel. This means that the lizards could only approach the preferred body temperature range by climbing to the very top of the dowel (preferred body temperature of both species is around 33°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corn, 1971</xref>). All experiments were performed in the early afternoon between 1 and 3 pm. Each lizard was tested three sequential times, with each trial lasting for 1 min. During this trial period, we recorded positions (i.e., the distance away from the tip of the dowel) where the lizard was resting for more than 5 s and calculated the average position as the mean of all positions. A subset of lizards was also tested at 4 months of age to determine individual consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feiner et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To assess locomotor performance we followed previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Losos and Irschick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolbe et al., 2016</xref>) and tested both species using two different setups, a narrow track consisting of a 0.8 cm diameter-wide dowel, and a flat track (15 cm broad). To avoid confusion with the broad and narrow rearing treatments, we refer to lizards moving on the narrow track as ‘climbing’ and lizards moving on the broad track as ‘running’. Both tracks were made of unpainted wood (the same material as the lizards were raised on), 1.2 m in length, and oriented at 37° angle to encourage lizards to run rather than jump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Losos and Irschick, 1996</xref>).</p><p>All trials were conducted blindly with respect to the treatment group of the lizard, as a second person allocated lizards from both a broad and a narrow treatment cage into individual cages (150 × 150×200 cm) the evening before the locomotor performance trials. This procedure standardized the handling and ensured that lizards could be placed on the running track swiftly. All trials were conducted in the mornings between 10 am and noon at 27.0°C (SD 0.99°C) with 53% humidity (SD 0.07%). All lizards were tested on both the climbing and running tracks on consecutive days with the order of tracks randomized between groups of lizards. Each lizard was tested three times successively on the same track and we only used the fastest of the runs for each individual per track for the analysis. Lizards were filmed in dorsal view using a GoPro camera (Hero3+ Silver, California, USA) at 30 frames-per-second. The camera was arranged on a tripod so that the lens and the racetrack were in parallel planes to allow for accurate analysis of videos. By using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), we calculated total race time (over 1.2 m) and maximum speed.</p><p>At the beginning of each trial, we placed the lizard at the start of the track (i.e., the first interval line) and encouraged it to run by gently tapping it on the base of its tail with a paintbrush. A subset of lizards was also tested at 4 months of age to determine the individual consistency of locomotor performance throughout ontogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feiner et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>All behavioural assays were statistically analysed using linear mixed-effect models fit by maximum likelihood in the R package ‘lme4’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bates et al., 2015</xref>). Degrees of freedom for mixed effects models were estimated using the Satterthwaite’s approximation. The cage ID a lizard was reared in was included as random effect in all models to control for shared environmental effects. All models were fitted with the main effect of log-transformed SVL and the first and second principal components of the ‘Plasticity’ and the ‘Evolutionary divergence’ traits (see above). The rationale here is to test if the traits of the locomotor skeleton that are plastic or evolutionary labile predict locomotor performance.

We acknowledge that there is no way to capture all aspects of morphological change, and it seems a good attempt to create a new combined metric including shape measurements in addition to linear measurements. However, the statistical morphometrics specialist among the reviewers (reviewer #1) still raises substantial issues that are outlined in the review. To resolve this, we should like to ask you to work out in more detail of what you had only generally indicated in your response letter. You should properly separate the different types of measurements (size, shape), analyze them individually and not use transformations. Your conclusions will evidently be strengthened by having individual analyses of traits and perhaps can be interpreted more clearly as individual evolved characters that could be linked to functional and developmental processes. Also, it would be more comparable to previous studies. You may in addition want to include the combined metric, but you need to discuss the issues with this that were brought up by the statistical expert.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The response of the reviewers regarding the transformation of the data has not removed my concern. As it stands, the morphological dataset (prior to the &quot;transformation&quot;) includes Procrustes aligned landmark coordinates, centroid size and some linear measurements, that is, a mixture of shape variables (of which 7 are redundant because of the degrees of freedom lost during the Procrustes fit) and various size variables. As such, this is already difficult to expect to be an easily interpretable signal (in particular size and shape signals are confounded and their potential relationships are irretrievable).</p><p>The authors refer to Stuart et al., 2017 as a similar approach to the construction of a morphological dataset. This is indeed a similar approach and Stuart et al., 2017 likewise suffers from the same weaknesses (linear dependency of the shape variables and increased difficultness of biological interpretations).</p><p>Of greater concern is the transformation of the data suggested, which further deteriorates the biological meaningfulness the authors expect to extract from the data: Procrustes shape variables, for instance, are linked by the geometry of the shapes they describe. Centring to zero and dividing each of them by their standard deviation completely destroy the meaningful relationships among these shape variables.</p><p>In summary, this is not a path to obtain a &quot;valid multivariate space&quot; for the analyses envisioned. The multivariate space obtained combines incommensurate variables and therefore lacks meaningful metric and inner product, compromising the valid usage of the notion of angle central to the research question of the paper.</p><p>The authors report that they obtain similar results when working on subsets of the data. They add Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to support this. However, this is not informative since it is a document without its context. They did some separate angle analyses on each subset of their data. Angles in high-dimensional spaces, as they occur particularly in geometric morphometrics, can appear contrary to our intuition from two- or three-dimensional planes and spaces. Therefore, some caution is necessary when interpreting them. In a two-dimensional space, given one vector, there is only one direction that is perpendicular to it. In three dimensions, by contrast, there is a whole plane that is perpendicular to the first vector, and there is thus a greater number of different ways in which the vectors can have different directions. Therefore, even relatively large angles between vectors can suggest that the resemblance between them is unlikely to be of random origin.</p><p>This is what I would then suggest them to do: work and present results for internally coherent subsets of data (size data, shape data) allowing easier interpretations, additional visualisations (shape changes for instance), and avoiding questionable inferences from a mathematically ill-defined morphospace.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfactorily responded to the reviews and updated their manuscript appropriately. Another reviewer should look at the statistical analysis as I'm not an expert. I look forward to seeing the paper published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good, indeed excellent, job in their response. I would welcome publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57468.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study is an important advance providing empirical evidence that developmental plasticity is not biasing options for selection in this widely studied Anolis radiation.

We respond to the criticism that has been raised point-by-point below, but we would like to emphasize here that the ‘signature traits’ have been identified using the Wheatsheaf index in an explicit phylogenetic framework. This approach implements a randomization procedure to specifically test if the observed convergence in traits is stronger than expected by chance. We therefore maintain that the identified ‘signature traits’ are significantly different from noise and are therefore genuine signatures of convergent evolution between ecomorphs. To highlight this point in the manuscript, we modified the Results section:</p><p>“We adopted a methodology using a simple metric of convergence in a phylogenetic framework, the Wheatsheaf index (Arbuckle et al. 2014), to assess if levels of convergence for each ecomorph are higher than expected by chance given the phylogenetic relatedness.”</p><p>“However, convergence was greater than expected by chance for some traits […]”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusions depend very much on a procedure in morphometrics that appears to be problematic, namely the &quot;Transformation of morphological dataset&quot; described in the text and the supplement.

This adds further random signal to the landmark data prior to the Procrustes fit. Hence, there needs to be a clear justification of this procedure.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explaining sufficiently our methodology and its rationale. We followed the logic of phenotypic trajectory analyses (Adams and Collyer, 2009), applying a vector-based analysis on a highly multivariate dataset. It may be helpful to recognize that our approach is effectively the same as a recent analysis of parallel evolution (Stuart et al., 2017). In brief, this study quantified the alignment in morphological divergence between pairs of lake-stream sticklebacks in a multivariate space consisting of a mixture of landmark-based data as well as univariate measurements. Our analyses of island pairs of ecomorphs are thus equivalent.</p><p>Transformation of a multivariate dataset is essential for constructing a valid multivariate space in which the vector analyses can be performed (Adams and Collyer, 2019). Since our data includes both landmarks and univariate measurements, the transformation procedure precludes analyses that are typically the target of geometric morphometrics (e.g., quantification of shape changes associated with diet). However, transformation is crucial for our key question: whether or not evolutionary divergences are aligned with plastic responses. The transformation is not ‘random’, but scales all traits to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. The transformation is applied to Procrustes shape variables, rather than landmark coordinates, and the statement that this ‘adds further random signal to the landmark data prior to Procrustes fit’ is therefore not true.</p><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we failed to clearly point out that our procedure is necessary and follows that of Stuart et al., 2017, and we have therefore added this information to the Results section and Materials and methods section.</p><p>Results section: “This resulted in a morphological dataset consisting of 132 features or traits that were scaled to allow vector-based analyses on combined shape and univariate data following a similar approach by Stuart et al., (2017; see Materials and methods section).”</p><p>Materials and methods section: “This transformation was performed prior to all analyses and follows the approach described by Stuart, et al., (2017) to enable vector-based analyses comparing alignment between ecomorph pairs on different islands and alignment between plastic responses to microhabitat and evolutionary divergence between the corresponding ecomorphs.”</p><p>Importantly, the fact that we arrive at highly similar conclusions when we consider subsets of the data (e.g. only limb lengths, only bone thickness or only shape of girdles; Figure 4—figure supplement 1; Results section) affirms that the results are robust against the transformation procedure. In addition, to fully demonstrate that our vector analysis is robust, we applied an independent method (trajectory analyses using the R package ‘RRPP’; Collyer and Adams, 2007 and Collyer and Adams, 2018) separately for landmark and univariate data. While this approach has limitations in that only parallelism of vectors, but not orthogonality, can be statistically assessed, it delivered the same results: ecomorph divergences between islands are better aligned than random, but rarely indistinguishable. These additional results have been added to the manuscript:</p><p>Results section: “The results were consistent when pectoral girdle, pelvic girdle, limb length and bone thickness were analysed separately (Figure 4—figure supplement 1), and with an alternative method that relies on comparisons of multivariate means instead of t-tests (Collyer and Adams, 2007).”</p><p>Materials and methods section: “The results of this t-test based trajectory analysis were confirmed by an alternative analysis that calculates phenotypic change vectors based on differences in multivariate means using a linear model with randomized residuals in a permutation procedure (Collyer and Adams, 2007). […] We did not apply the phenotypic change vector based approach to test whether ecomorph divergences are aligned with environmentally-induced changes since the groups are different in kind (the plasticity data are within species and ecomorph data between species; see below) and therefore not appropriate for this statistical model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Instead one could do a 2 Block Partial Least Squares analysis to compare 2 sets of variables regardless of the type of data (e.g. Procrustes coordinates of the skull versus diet). This is routinely used in this type of studies in which one wishes to calculate the strength of association (i.e. covariation) between 2 sets of different variables (Rohlf and Corti, 2000) and is a general analysis in squamate studies (Adams and Rohlf, 2000). There is no a priori or some sort of rescaling of the data beforehand.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, the two-block partial least squares is a method for exploring patterns of covariation between two sets of variables. In the context of geometrics morphometrics, the variables are often shape variables but, as correctly pointed out, the method can be applied to other types of data as well. While this makes the method very versatile, it remains restricted to the quantification of covariation. There are no doubt interesting questions one could ask about covariation in our data set. However, the key question of our study is of a different nature, and cannot be addressed using a two-block partial least squares analysis.</p><p>Whether or not evolutionary divergences are aligned with plastic responses is fundamentally about shifts in morphospace and this analyses therefore needs to compare alignment and length of vectors between multivariate means (see Figure 3 and response to the previous comment for details). It is unclear how a two-block partial least squares analysis would be applicable to our specific research question.</p><p>Nevertheless, we recognize the utility in adopting a more widely used methodology, and have therefore validated our findings using the function ‘trajectory.analysis’ in the RRPP package (see above), a method for phenotypic trajectory analyses that should be familiar to researchers in the field of geometric morphometrics (see Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The study includes shape data versus different types of size data with the size data quite possibly being correlated among themselves, but there is no test for this. One would have expected analyses similar to the ones carried out in Dickson et al., 2017. For instance, at P.6 paragraph starting with &quot;To determine…by ANCOVA and PGLS&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The reason why our methodology differs from the one mentioned by the reviewer here (e.g. ANCOVA and PGLS) is that our question is different. There is no doubt that individual bone elements and other aspects of the locomotor skeleton are phenotypically integrated, but this is not an assumption of the method that we are applying. As explained above, the appropriate test of alignment between responses in phenotypic space compares vectors between multivariate means, not covariances between sets of variables (corrected for size, see Materials and methods section).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>There is overall a positive assessment of your revisions, but there remains the central problem around the statistics.

We recognize that our statistical approach may appear unorthodox to parts of the geometric morphometrics community. However, we emphasize that we have carefully considered this statistical issue and follow the best practice advocated by Prof Dean Adams, who has developed both geometric morphometrics and other multivariate data analyses, including the vector-based trajectory analysis adopted here. To maximize the usefulness of our article for researchers facing similar challenges, we have expanded the relevant sections. Since <italic>eLife</italic> cannot accommodate supplementary text, we added the additional detail (including further references) to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The response of the reviewers regarding the transformation of the data has not removed my concern.

However, we acknowledge that the analyses of morphological (and other forms of) data that are not on commensurate scale can be unfamiliar, and that this is an area of active method development (e.g., see Adams and Collyer, 2019, Collyer et al., 2020). To assist others that face similar challenges, we therefore expanded our rationale and procedure in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Materials and methods section: The morphological dataset is comprised of Procrustes shape variables (Rohlf, 1999), linear measurements of bone length and thickness, and centroid size as a proxy for body size, and are therefore not on a commensurate scale. The statistical handling of combined data sets is a topical issue in the analyses of morphological data (e.g., Adams and Collyer 2019; Collyer et al., 2020). To ensure that the analyses of this dataset return biologically meaningful and interpretable results, we followed the approach advocated by Adams and Collyer, (2019). Raw values were scaled such that each column (i.e., trait) was centered to zero and divided by the standard deviation (Adams and Collyer, 2019). This transformation to standard normal deviates was performed prior to all analyses since it generates a phenotypic space in which trajectory analyses (Adams and Collyer, 2009) can be performed (see also Legendre and Legendre, 2012). For a similar approach, see Stuart et al., (2017). One downside of this approach is that the results are not interpretable in terms of changes in morphological shape. However, the focus of this study is to address how parallel ecomorph divergences are on different islands, and how well plastic responses are aligned with these divergences, across the entire morphology of the locomotor skeleton.</p><p>References added:</p><p>Rohlf, 1999.</p><p>Collyer, Davis and Adams, 2020.</p><p>Regarding the lost degrees of freedom, the reviewer is correct that seven dimensions of the Procrustes shape variables of the pelvic and pectoral girdles are redundant. However, it is known that these redundant dimensions do not contribute to the analyses performed in our study (Rohlf, 1999). Relying on principal components would not be an option when the Procrustes shape variables are combined with length measurements, and this is explained in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>Materials and methods section: To obtain Procrustes shape variables, the 18 landmarks recorded per girdle were each subjected to a ‘generalized Procrustes analysis’ that superimposed landmarks and the resulting X-, Y-, and Z-coordinates were extracted (Rohlf, 1999). A statistical feature of this procedure is that seven degrees of freedom are lost in the case of 3D-landmarks (Kendall 1984). A possible operation to remove this redundancy in dimensions is to extract principal components from the Procrustes shape variables. However, when principal components instead of Procrustes shape variables are transformed to standard normal deviates (see section ’Transformation of morphological dataset’ below), their properties change and biological signal would therefore be lost. Ultimately, the seven redundant dimensions in the Procrustes shape variables have no impact on the downstream analyses (e.g., trajectory analyses) and the analyses can therefore proceed on Procrustes shape variables (Rohlf, 1999).</p><p>Reference added:</p><p>Kendall, 1984.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Of greater concern is the transformation of the data suggested, which further deteriorates the biological meaningfulness the authors expect to extract from the data: Procrustes shape variables, for instance, are linked by the geometry of the shapes they describe. Centring to zero and dividing each of them by their standard deviation completely destroy the meaningful relationships among these shape variables.</p><p>In summary, this is not a path to obtain a &quot;valid multivariate space&quot; for the analyses envisioned. The multivariate space obtained combines incommensurate variables and therefore lacks meaningful metric and inner product, compromising the valid usage of the notion of angle central to the research question of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is mistaken that the transformation of data is inappropriate. In fact, the transformation of the data to standard normal deviates is a necessary step in generating a multivariate phenotype space from variables of incommensurate units and scale. This is discussed in detail in Adams and Collyer, 2019. However, as the reviewer correctly points out, it is important to recognize that these data and the results cannot be interpreted in terms of shape; however, it is perfectly valid to interpret them in terms of morphology. We now provide further details on the rationale and considerations of this procedure in the Materials and methods section (see response above) and also emphasize this in the Results section:</p><p>Results section: “While this approach means that differences between, for example, ecomorphs are not interpretable in terms of shape, the data capture the overall morphology of the locomotor skeleton, which is the primary focus of this study. However, for completeness, we also report the main results for girdles and limbs analysed separately.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors report that they obtain similar results when working on subsets of the data. They add Figure 4—figure supplement 1 to support this. However, this is not informative since it is a document without its context. They did some separate angle analyses on each subset of their data. Angles in high-dimensional spaces, as they occur particularly in geometric morphometrics, can appear contrary to our intuition from two- or three-dimensional planes and spaces. Therefore, some caution is necessary when interpreting them. In a two-dimensional space, given one vector, there is only one direction that is perpendicular to it. In three dimensions, by contrast, there is a whole plane that is perpendicular to the first vector, and there is thus a greater number of different ways in which the vectors can have different directions. Therefore, even relatively large angles between vectors can suggest that the resemblance between them is unlikely to be of random origin.</p></disp-quote><p>The rationale for showing the results of the trajectory analyses on subsets of the data (girdles, limb length and bone thickness) is to demonstrate that the observed parallelism is distributed across the locomotor skeleton, rather than being restricted to only girdles or only limbs. To clarify this in the article, we have included an explanation to the Results section (see response above) and added it also to the Materials and methods sections:</p><p>Materials and methods section: We conducted these analyses both on the full data set and separately for the two girdles, limb length and bone (cortical) thickness. The latter makes the results for the girdles directly comparable to standard analyses of geometric morphometric data.</p><p>Further, we have added more detailed explanations to the figure that presents the results of the trajectory analyses on subsets of the data (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). This assures that the figure is embedded in the right context and can be interpreted as a stand-alone result.</p><p>Figure 4 legend: Alignment of the morphological difference between pairs of ecomorphs on the four Greater Antillean islands separately for individual aspects of the locomotor apparatus. Frequency plots of all 53 quartet comparisons (pairs of ecomorphs on island pairs) shows that the vast majority of angles Θ are between 0° and 90°. (…) The four plots are directly comparable to the plot in Figure 4A.</p><p>With respect to vector-based analyses, we reiterate that this is a standard approach in analyses of morphology, including shape in geometric morphometrics (e.g., the ‘trajectory.analysis’ function in the R package RRPP; Collyer and Adams, 2018). The Materials and methods section provides further references that will help readers to explore this methodology.</p><p>Reference added:</p><p>Adams and Collyer, 2007.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is what I would then suggest them to do: work and present results for internally coherent subsets of data (size data, shape data) allowing easier interpretations, additional visualisations (shape changes for instance), and avoiding questionable inferences from a mathematically ill-defined morphospace.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed above, we maintain that analyzing the morphology of the locomotor skeleton in a single dataset is statistically sound and allows for a more comprehensive answer to our specific questions (alignment between ecomorph divergences and environmentally induced changes). Yet, we are sympathetic to the reviewer’s concern that an analysis on a combination of morphological features can be hard to interpret (a criticism valid for virtually any multivariate analysis). Indeed, the results certainly cannot be interpreted in terms of shape. We therefore agree with the reviewer that reporting the results of trajectory analyses for limbs and girdles separately adds value. As was evident from our Supplementary Material, this clearly shows that the observed parallelism is distributed across the locomotor skeleton, rather than being restricted to only girdles or only limbs. In this revised manuscript, we retain the separate analyses as a Supplementary Material, but have ensured that it is clear to the reader that they can find these results there, and explore them in more detail if they so wish. We refer to the changes to the manuscript described above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
