coding and non-coding RNAs that are potential biomarkers for human diseases. Here, we used thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) combined with peak calling to simultaneously profile all RNA biotypes in apheresis-prepared human plasma pooled from healthy individuals. Extending previous TGIRT-seq analysis, we found that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs from &gt; 19,000 protein-coding genes, abundant full-length, mature tRNAs and other structured small non-coding RNAs, and less abundant tRNA fragments and mature and pre-miRNAs. Many of the mRNA fragments identified by peak calling correspond to annotated protein-binding sites and/or have stable predicted secondary structures that could afford protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also identified novel repeat RNAs, miRNA-sized RNAs, and putatively structured intron RNAs of potential biological, evolutionary, and biomarker significance, including a family of full-length excised intron RNAs, subsets of which correspond to mirtron pre-miRNAs or agotrons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomarker</kwd><kwd>cell-free RNA</kwd><kwd>diagnostics</kwd><kwd>miRNA</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding protein</kwd><kwd>tRNA fragment</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM37949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambowitz</surname><given-names>Alan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambowitz</surname><given-names>Alan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F-1607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lambowitz</surname><given-names>Alan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human plasma contains protein-protected mRNA fragments, myriad repeat RNAs, and novel intron RNAs, including a family of structured full-length excised introns, some corresponding to mirtron pre-miRNAs and agotrons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular RNAs in human plasma have been avidly pursued as potential biomarkers for cancer and other human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schwarzenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rapisuwon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cheung et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pardini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sole et al., 2019</xref>). In healthy individuals, plasma RNAs arise largely by cell death or secretion from cells in blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and liver, while in cancer and other diseases, plasma RNAs may arise by necrosis or secretion from tumors or other damaged tissues, potentially providing diagnostic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turchinovich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kishikawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kishikawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraldez et al., 2019</xref>). As plasma contains active RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kamm and Smith, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tsui et al., 2002</xref>), the extracellular RNAs that persist there are thought to be protected from degradation by bound proteins, RNA structure, or encapsulation in extracellular vesicles (EVs). Although high-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has identified virtually all known RNA biotypes in human plasma, studies aimed at identifying disease biomarkers have focused mostly on plasma mRNAs or miRNAs. mRNAs in plasma and blood have been profiled by RNA-seq methods that enrich for or selectively reverse transcribe poly(A)-containing RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Englert et al., 2019</xref>) or by sequencing mRNA fragments with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freedman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yeri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraldez et al., 2019</xref>) or without (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>) size selection, and it remains unclear which methods might be optimal for biomarker identification. miRNAs in plasma are analyzed by methods that enrich for small RNAs and neglect pre-miRNAs or longer transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mitchell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turchinovich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blondal et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Williams et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yeri et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, almost all RNA-seq studies of plasma RNAs have used retroviral reverse transcriptases (RTs) to convert RNAs into cDNAs for sequencing on high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms. Retroviral RTs have inherently low fidelity and processivity and even those that are highly engineered have difficulty reverse transcribing through stable RNA secondary structures or post-transcriptional modifications, resulting in under-representation of 5'-RNA sequences and aborted reads that can be mistaken for RNA fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we still have an incomplete understanding of the biology of plasma RNAs and how to optimize their identification as biomarkers for human diseases.</p><p>As a substitute for retroviral RTs, we have been developing RNA-seq methods using thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptases (TGIRTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to high fidelity, processivity, and strand-displacement activity, group II intron RTs have a proficient template-switching activity that enables efficient, seamless attachment of RNA-seq adapter sequences to target RNAs without RNA tailing or ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lentzsch et al., 2019</xref>). Further, unlike retroviral RTs, which tend to dissociate from RNAs at post-transcriptional modifications that affect base pairing, TGIRT enzymes pause at such modifications but eventually read through by characteristic patterns of mis-incorporation that can be used to identify the modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katibah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Safra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zubradt et al., 2017</xref>). This combination of activities enables TGIRT enzymes to give relatively uniform 5'- and 3'-sequence coverage of mRNAs when initiating conventionally from an annealed oligo(dT) primer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>) and to give full-length, end-to-end reads of tRNAs and other structured small ncRNAs, when initiating by template switching to the 3' end of the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katibah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). In size selected RNA preparations, TGIRT-seq profiles human miRNAs with bias equal to or less than alternative methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The comprehensive TGIRT-seq method used in this work to analyze human plasma RNAs employs TGIRT-template-switching for 3'-RNA-seq adapter addition followed by a single-stranded DNA ligation for 5' RNA-seq adapter addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a validation study using rRNA-depleted, chemically fragmented human reference RNAs with External RNA Control Consortium spike-ins, TGIRT-seq gave better quantitation of mRNAs and spike ins, more uniform 5’ to 3’ coverage of mRNA sequences, detected more splice junctions, particularly near the 5' ends of mRNAs, and had higher strand specificity when compared to benchmark TruSeq-v3 datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>). This study also showed that TGIRT-seq enables the simultaneous sequencing of chemically fragmented mRNAs together with tRNAs and other structured sncRNAs, which were poorly represented in the TruSeq datasets, even after chemical fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>). A subsequent study of chemically fragmented human cellular RNAs with customized spike-ins confirmed these findings and showed that TGIRT-seq enables simultaneous quantitative profiling of mRNA fragments and sncRNAs of &gt; 60 nt, but under-represents smaller RNAs due in part to differential loss during library clean-up to remove adapter dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boivin et al., 2018</xref>). Recent TGIRT-seq profiling of structured RNAs in unfragmented cellular RNA preparations from human cells revealed previously unannotated sncRNAs, including novel snoRNAs, tRNA-like RNAs, and tRNA fragments (tRFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boivin et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TGIRT-seq of nucleic acids in human plasma.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TGIRT-seq workflow. The TGIRT enzyme initiates reverse transcription by template switching from a synthetic RNA template/DNA primer substrate consisting of a 35-nt RNA oligonucleotide containing an Illumina read 2 (R2) sequence annealed to a 36-nt DNA primer. The latter leaves a single nucleotide 3’ overhang (N, an equimolar mix of A, C, G, and T) that directs template switching by base pairing to the 3’ nucleotide (N’) of an RNA or DNA template, which is then reverse transcribed resulting in a DNA copy of the nucleic acid with the reverse complement of an Illumina read two sequence (R2R) seamlessly linked to its 5’ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>). After clean-up, a second adapter (R1R DNA), which contains the reverse complement of an Illumina read one sequence and introduces a 6-nt UMI (denoted UMI-R for the reverse orientation), is ligated to the 3’ end of the cDNA using thermostable 5’ App DNA/RNA ligase, followed by PCR with primers that add capture sites and indices for Illumina sequencing.

In a previous study, TGIRT-seq showed that human plasma from a healthy male individual contained predominantly full-length tRNAs and other structured small ncRNAs, which could not be seen in RNA-seq studies using retroviral RTs, together with RNA fragments derived from large numbers of protein-coding genes and lncRNAs, with higher proportions of intron and antisense RNAs than in cellular RNA datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, TGIRT-seq showed that highly purified EVs and exosomes secreted by cultured human cells also contained predominantly full-length tRNAs, Y RNAs, and Vault RNAs, together with low concentrations of mRNAs, including 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (5' TOP) mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). The same TGIRT-seq workflow using template switching for facile 3'-RNA-seq adapter enabled single-stranded (ss) DNA-seq profiling of human plasma DNA, including analyses of nucleosome positioning and DNA methylation sites that inform tissue-of-origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>), as shown previously for other ssDNA-seq methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrananda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snyder et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Since these earlier studies, TGIRT-seq methods have undergone improvements including: (i) the use of modified RNA-seq adapters that substantially decrease adapter-dimer formation; (ii) computational and biochemical methods for remediating residual end biases, enabling profiling of miRNAs with accuracy equivalent to the least biased current methods; and (iii) modified reaction conditions that increase the efficiency of RNA-seq adapter addition by TGIRT template switching, enabling the more efficient capture of target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lentzsch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used an updated TGIRT-seq method incorporating these improvements together with RNA-seq adapters that add a unique molecular identifier (UMI) to deconvolute duplicate reads to comprehensively profile RNAs present in commercial human plasma from healthy individuals prepared by apheresis, a method used to obtain large volumes of plasma for clinical purposes, including convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, we compared the fragmented mRNAs detected in plasma by TGIRT-seq with the polyadenylated mRNAs detected in the same plasma by ultra-low input SMART-Seq v4 and introduced the use of a peak-calling algorithm for analyzing TGIRT-seq datasets. We thus identified numerous mRNA fragments corresponding to annotated binding sites for ~100 different RNA-binding proteins. We also identified a wide variety of discrete structured RNAs and RNA fragments, including abundant repeat and transposable element RNAs, unannotated miRNA-sized RNAs, and intron RNAs. The latter included a family of putatively structured full-length, excised intron RNAs, some corresponding to mirtron pre-miRNAs and/or agotrons, and putatively structured intron RNA fragments, including a family corresponding to conserved structured segments of retrotransposed mRNAs that inserted within long introns.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TGIRT-seq of human plasma nucleic acids</title><p>The TGIRT-seq datasets in this study were obtained from commercial human plasma pooled from multiple healthy individuals and prepared by apheresis with EDTA as the anticoagulant (IPLA-N-K2E; Innovative Research).

First, the initial TGIRT-template switching reaction was done at a lower salt concentration (200 instead of 450 mM), which increases the efficiency of 3'-RNA-seq adapter addition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lentzsch et al., 2019</xref>). Second, we used a modified R2R adapter that substantially decreases adapter-dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), thereby improving the representation of very small RNAs, such as miRNAs and short tRNA fragments (tRFs). Finally, we used a modified R1R adapter with a 6-nt UMI to deconvolute duplicate reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>). The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument to obtain 10 to 27 million 75-nt paired-end reads, which were mapped to the hg19 human genome reference sequence.

Although, we were concerned that the lower salt concentration used for template switching might increase the frequency of multiple sequential template switches, the percentages of soft-clipped and fusion/discordant read pairs, which include reads from multiple template switches, were relatively low (1.5–2.5% and 0.5–4.1%, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The read-span distributions for the untreated and NaOH-treated plasma DNA samples showed two broad peaks, one at 130–180 nt, corresponding to plasma DNA protected in chromatosomes (nucleosomes plus linker histone) or trimmed mononucleosomes, and the other at 50–100 nt corresponding to nicked DNA strands that are protected by transcription factors or other bound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrananda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snyder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>).

The latter is a highly sensitive method for profiling polyadenylated mRNAs in which an engineered retroviral RT (SMARTScribe) initiates cDNA synthesis from an anchored oligo(dT) primer with an appended PCR primer-binding site and then template switches from the 5’ end of that mRNA to an acceptor oligonucleotide containing a second primer-binding site, enabling PCR amplification of the resulting cDNAs. In our experiments, the resulting dsDNAs were fragmented by Covaris sonication and used to prepare DNA-seq libraries by using an NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep (New England Biolabs). The SMART-Seq libraries (n = 4) were then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 to obtain a total of 2.6 million 2 × 75 nt reads that mapped to &gt; 16,000 protein-coding genes with a transcript per million value (TPM) &gt; 0.1. The larger number of mRNA reads compared to TGIRT-seq (0.28 million) largely reflects that SMART-Seq selectively profiles polyadenylated mRNAs, while TGIRT-seq profiles mRNAs together with other more abundant RNA biotypes. In addition, ultra low input SMART-Seq is not strand-specific, resulting in redundant sense and antisense strand reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Bioanalyzer traces showed that the amplified dsDNAs obtained by SMART-Seq prior to Covaris sonication were substantially shorter than those from the cellular RNA control provided with the kit (peaks at 100–200 and 400–700 bp for plasma RNA compared to 700–7,000 bp for the cellular control RNA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that the poly(A)-containing mRNAs detected in plasma by SMART-Seq are enriched in 3' fragments.</p><p>A scatter plot comparing the relative abundance of transcripts originating from different genes showed that most of the polyadenylated mRNAs detected in DNase I-treated plasma RNA by ultra low input SMART-Seq were also detected by TGIRT-seq at similar TPM values when normalized for protein-coding gene reads (<italic>r</italic> = 0.61), but with some, mostly lower abundance mRNAs undetected either by TGIRT-seq or SMART-Seq, and with SMART-Seq unable to detect non-polyadenylated histone mRNAs, which are relatively abundant in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV) alignments for representative protein-coding genes confirmed the relatively uniform coverage of both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated mRNAs by TGIRT-seq and showed that TGIRT-seq simultaneously detected an intron-encoded snoRNA in a ribosomal protein gene that was invisible to SMART-Seq (<italic>RPL10</italic>; upper right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Notably, although 3'-phosphate removal increased both the proportion of reads mapping to protein-coding genes and the number of mRNAs detected by TGIRT-seq (see above), neither the 5’- to 3’-coverage nor the abundance of most protein-coding transcripts detected in plasma by TGIRT-seq was strongly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B and F</xref>; <italic>r</italic> = 0.93 and 0.84, respectively). This reflects that many of the additional protein-coding gene transcripts detected after 3'-phosphate removal had relatively low read counts and that the abundance of only a small proportion of protein-coding gene transcripts increased significantly after this treatment (0.41% by differential expression analysis using DESeq2; adjusted p-value &lt; 0.01). Because 3’ phosphates inhibit RNA-seq adapter addition by TGIRT template switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mohr et al., 2013</xref>), these findings are consistent with the suggestion from the previous TGIRT-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>) that many mRNA fragments in plasma have 3’ OH termini, as expected for RNA fragments generated by cellular ribonucleases that function in mRNA processing or turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houseley and Tollervey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Use of peak-calling for analysis of plasma RNAs</title><p>As DNA fragments that persist in plasma were found to be packaged in nucleosomes or associated with transcription factors or other DNA binding proteins that afford protection from plasma nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrananda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snyder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>), we wondered whether many of the mRNA fragments in plasma might be similarly protected by bound proteins and whether such protein-protected RNA fragments could be detected by peak calling, as done for ChIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).

Previous TGIRT-seq analysis of plasma RNAs from a healthy male individual showed that human plasma contains largely fragmented mRNAs originating from &gt; 19,000 different protein-coding genes, together with abundant full-length mature tRNAs and other structured sncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). Here, by using an improved TGIRT-seq method with a UMI to deconvolute duplicate reads, we obtained a more quantitative view of the relationship between different classes of plasma RNAs, extended analysis to the plasma microbiome, compared mRNA sequences detected in the same plasma by TGIRT-seq and SMART-Seq, and introduced the use of a peak-calling algorithm for the analysis of TGIRT-seq datasets. The latter revealed that many of the discrete mRNA and intron RNA peaks that persist in plasma correspond to annotated RBP-binding sites and/or are predicted to have stable RNA secondary structures that may provide protection from plasma nucleases. Peak calling also provided new insights into repeat RNAs and showed that they are over-represented in called peaks consisting of uniformly sized RNA fragments. Additionally, we identified a number of unannotated miRNA-sized RNAs, some apparently processed from stem-loop structures, potential RNA/DNA hybrids apparently containing residual DNA that escapes extensive DNase digestion, and novel families of structured intron RNAs and intron RNA fragments that had not been seen previously using other RNA-seq methods. These include a family of short putatively structured full-length excised introns RNAs, subsets of which correspond to agotrons and/or mirtrons, as well as putatively structured intron RNA fragments, including a family mapping to conserved structured segments of retrotransposed mRNAs that had inserted within long introns. Although not originally a focus of our study, we also found that commercial plasma obtained by apheresis from healthy individuals had no detectable reads for pre-screened pathogens (hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV-1, HIV-2, and syphilis), but did contain low levels of reads for bacterial RNAs and other RNA and DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), with possible implications for plasma used for clinical purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>TGIRT-seq with RNA-seq adapters containing a UMI to deconvolute duplicate reads confirmed that full-length mature tRNAs are the most abundant class of sncRNAs in human plasma, followed by Y RNAs and 7SL RNA, with tRNA halves, short tRFs, and mature and pre-miRNAs and passenger strands present in lower concentrations. The full-length, mature tRNAs and other sncRNAs present in plasma may be protected from plasma nucleases by stable RNA secondary or tertiary structure, bound proteins, or encapsulation in EVs, the latter suggested by TGIRT-seq analysis of RNAs present in highly purified EVs and exosomes secreted by cultured human cells, which likewise identified full-length mature tRNAs and Y RNAs as the most abundant RNA species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>). Although the updated TGIRT-seq methods used in this work improved the detection of miRNAs and 5'- and 3'-tRFs, further analysis of these RNAs by RT-qPCR and FirePlex assays indicated that some miRNAs remained substantially underrepresented relative to RNAs &gt;60 nt (manuscript in preparation). Thus, while comprehensive TGIRT-seq of heterogeneously sized RNA preparations can accurately determine the relative abundance of RNAs &gt; 60 nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nottingham et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boivin et al., 2018</xref>), determining the quantitative relationship between very short RNAs and RNAs &gt; 60 nt requires orthogonal methods. Surprisingly, despite the size bias against very short RNAs, we identified 15 novel discrete short RNAs (13–25 nt; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Only one of these short RNAs (non-high-confidence miR-4497; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>) could be found in miRBase, piRNAdb, tRFdb or cross-linked regions in AGO1-4 PAR-CLIP datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>), raising possibility that they represent other classes of short regulatory RNAs, whose protein-partners and functions, if any, remain to be determined.</p><p>The proportion of reads corresponding to mRNAs in plasma prepared by apheresis was relatively low (&lt; 5% of mapped reads), but nevertheless sufficient to identify mRNA fragments originating from &gt; 19,000 different protein-coding genes, with relatively uniform coverage across mRNA exons for highly represented genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The number of different mRNAs detected in plasma by TGIRT-seq was comparable to that detected in parallel assays of the same plasma by ultra low input SMART-Seq v4, which uses oligo(dT) priming, and higher than that in other studies using different methods that sequence mRNA fragments with or without size selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tsang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giraldez et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the size distribution of cDNAs generated by ultra low input SMART-Seq suggested that a substantial proportion of the mRNA fragments present in plasma have a length &gt; 200 nt (36%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), which would be lost by incorporating a size-selection step. As TGIRT-seq is a comprehensive RNA-seq method, the presence of other more abundant RNA biotypes is an inherent limitation for mRNA detection. However, the proportion of TGIRT-seq reads corresponding to plasma mRNAs could be increased by depleting rRNAs, by using a maximally efficient RNA extraction kit, and possibly by using plasma prepared from freshly drawn blood to minimize degradation of more labile mRNA fragments, as was done in the previous TGIRT-seq analysis of human plasma RNAs, which gave substantially higher proportions of mRNA reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The mRNA fragments present in plasma are likely a mixture of transient RNA degradation intermediates and more persistent RNA fragments that are protected from plasma nucleases by bound proteins, RNA structure, encapsulation in EVs, or some combination of these factors. Both the present and previous TGIRT-seq analyses indicated that many of the mRNA present in plasma have 3' OHs, which are required for efficient 3' RNA-seq adapter addition by TGIRT-template-switching, particularly under the high-salt reaction conditions used in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). As most cellular enzymes that function in RNA processing or turnover leave 3' OH groups while extracellular RNases, such as RNase 1, leave 3' phosphates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Houseley and Tollervey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sorrentino, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenberg and Maquat, 2012</xref>), these findings suggest that a high proportion of the mRNA fragments detected in plasma were generated by intracellular RNases that function in mRNA turnover rather than degradation of intact mRNAs that were released into plasma.</p><p>To identify those mRNA fragments in plasma that might be associated with bound proteins, we used a peak-calling algorithm and intersected the called RNA peaks with ENCODE eCLIP annotated RBP-binding site sequences. We thus identified numerous discrete mRNA and lncRNA fragments that are annotated binding sites for ~100 different RBPs, most of which were previously identified as part of the plasma proteome. Notably, we found plasma RNAs are particularly enriched in binding sites for stress granule proteins (including DDX3X, DDX6, DHX30, LARP4, IGF2BP3, PABPC4, PCBP1, RPS3, SERBP1, SND1, and YBX3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with a previously suggested link between RNP granules and RNA loading into secreted extracellular vesicles, a vehicle by which some mRNA fragments may enter plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shurtleff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Temoche-Diaz et al., 2019</xref>).

Although our findings do not directly demonstrate the association of the annotated RBP with the protected RNA fragment, collectively they suggest that many of the mRNA fragments present in plasma are protected from plasma nucleases by bound proteins, similar to the inferred protection of plasma DNA fragments by nucleosomes packaging or by the binding of transcription factors or other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chandrananda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Snyder et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Wu and Lambowitz, 2017</xref>). The number of protein-protected mRNA fragments that we identified in plasma is likely underestimated as our search was restricted to ENCODE eCLIP annotated RBP-binding sites and used plasma prepared with the anti-coagulant EDTA, which destabilizes some RNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhahbi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In addition to bound proteins, many of the mRNA fragments that we detected in plasma with or without annotated RBP-binding site sequences were predicted by RNAfold to form stable RNA secondary structures that might contribute to their protection from plasma nucleases. The predicted RNA secondary structures of some mRNA fragments could be classified by Infernal/Rfam as corresponding to known structural elements (<italic>e.g.</italic>, histone 3' stem-loop structures, iron response elements, selenocysteine insertion sequence, and pre-miRNA stem-loop structure; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but in most cases, the predicted secondary structure could not be classified by Infernal/Rfam, and its functional significance, if any, remains to be evaluated. Some peaks corresponding to structured mRNA fragments had discrete 5' and 3' ends and could be unannotated sncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>), while others consisted of or included discrete miRNA-sized RNA, possibly unannotated short regulatory RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3E–G</xref>).</p><p>A surprisingly high proportion of the discrete RNAs identified by peak calling (23.1%) corresponded to Repbase-annotated short tandem repeat and transposable element RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). TGIRT enzymes have been found to more completely reverse transcribe and better quantitate short tandem repeat RNAs than do retroviral RTs and can also give full-length reads of Alu and other structured SINE element RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Katibah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carrell et al., 2018</xref>). In all, TGIRT-seq detected discrete RNAs containing 37 different types of short tandem repeats, including telomeric and centromeric repeats. The short tandem repeat RNAs had a narrow size distribution (peak at ~80 nt) with most encompassing a high proportion of the genomic repeat unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), possibly reflecting protection of the repeat RNA from plasma nucleases by bound proteins or RNA structural features. Many but not all of the transposable element and endogenous retroviral RNAs were RNA fragments of a size similar to that of the simple repeat RNAs. The ability of TGIRT-seq to profile repeat RNAs in plasma may be useful for liquid biopsy of RNA repeat expansion diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy and some forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p><p>TGIRT-seq peak calling also identified novel intron RNAs, including a family of short, full-length excised intron RNAs that had not been seen previously using other RNA-seq methods. These full-length excised introns ranged in length from 73 to 130 nt, are likely linear RNAs, had RNAfold-predicted secondary structures with ΔGs ≤ −18.7 kcal/mole, and in many cases, corresponded to annotated binding sites of spliceosomal proteins and/or AGO1-4. Twenty three of the 44 full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma corresponded either to annotated or potential mirtrons, intron pre-miRNAs that are processed by DICER to produce mature miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berezikov et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Okamura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ruby et al., 2007</xref>) and/or to annotated or potential agotrons, structured excised intron RNAs that bind AGO proteins and function directly to repress mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen, 2018</xref>). Seven of the full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma were annotated as both an agotron and mirtron, blurring the distinction between these two classes of RNAs. Notably, although we detected mirtron pre-miRNAs in plasma, we did not detect the corresponding mature miRNAs, raising the possibility that mirtron pre-miRNAs are selectively exported or have higher stability in plasma. While extracellular miRNAs have been suggested to function in intercellular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valadi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), mirtron pre-miRNAs and agotrons may be as well or better suited for this role, with the mirtron pre-miRNAs entering cells as precursor RNAs that could be processed by DICER into mature miRNAs, and agotrons bound to AGO proteins entering cells as an RNP that could function directly in regulating gene expression in a miRNA-like manner.</p><p>Surprisingly, almost half (21 of 44) of the structured full-length excised introns that we detected in plasma did not correspond to identified agotrons or mirtrons. These introns could be mirtrons or agotrons that have yet to be annotated, or they could have some other function that remains to be determined. One of the most abundant full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma, <italic>PKD1</italic> intron 29 (ID#333; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), was highly conserved in both the parent gene and six distant pseudogenes (one mismatch at a known SNP position), possibly reflecting selection for a sequence-dependent function of this intron. Nevertheless, only one of the full-length excised intron RNAs that we detected in plasma, a putative mirtron encoding miR-1225, was conserved in sequence across vertebrates and mammals, and only six (not including <italic>PKD1</italic> intron 29) were conserved in sequence across primates (phastCons score ≥ 0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), suggesting that any sequence-dependent function of these intron RNAs would have been recently acquired.</p><p>In addition to full-length excised introns, peak calling identified a variety of intron RNA fragments, with more than half (16 of 31) corresponding to annotated RBP-binding sites and most having stable predicted RNA secondary structures or other structural features (tandem repeats, inverted repeats, or highly AG- or AU-rich sequences) that may afford protection from plasma nucleases. The RBPs potentially associated with these intron RNA fragments were a largely different set than those associated with the full-length excised intron RNAs and in some cases were related to a specific RNA splicing function or structural feature of the intron. Thus, an intron RNA peak containing complementary segments of a long-inverted repeat corresponded to an annotated binding for the dsRNA-binding protein ILF3, and an intron RNA peak containing tandem AGAA repeats corresponded to annotated binding site for the alternative splicing factor TRA2A, which recognizes this motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). Some of the intron RNA peaks that could be folded into stem-loop structures also contained unannotated discrete miRNA-sized RNAs (13–25 nt), which may have been processed out of the stem-loop structure. The latter finding raises the possibility that whatever their origin or original function, if any, structured excised intron RNAs in human cells may be accessible to DICER or other RNase III-like enzymes that cleave double-strand RNAs into discrete small fragments to generate a repository of non-coding short RNAs that could evolve to have miRNA-like functions.</p><p>By analyzing RNA peaks that mapped to both introns and mRNAs, we also identified multiple human introns containing retrotransposed segments of highly expressed mRNAs, conserved, structured portions of which persist in plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1</xref>). In all cases, the retrotransposition event that inserted the mRNA sequence within the intron appears to have been mediated by a LINE 1 RT and was relatively recent, with most occurring in primates and a few occurring earlier in placental mammals. In all cases, the RNA peak detected in plasma matched a putatively structured portion of the mRNA sequence that was highly conserved within the intron, raising the possibility of functional importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Additionally, for several highly expressed mRNAs, including three that were progenitors of processed pseudogenes in the human genome (<italic>TMSBX4</italic>, <italic>RPS29</italic>, and <italic>FTL</italic>), we detected antisense reads that could be cDNAs generated by an endogenous RT, possibly precursors of continuing retrotransposition events in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The ability of TGIRT-seq to simultaneously profile a wide variety of RNA biotypes in human plasma, including structured RNAs that are intractable to retroviral RTs, may be advantageous for identifying optimal combinations of coding and non-coding RNA biomarkers that could then be incorporated in target RNA panels for diagnosis and routine monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment. The finding that some mRNAs fragments persist in discrete called peaks suggests a strategy for identifying relatively stable mRNA regions that may be more reliably detected than other more labile regions in targeted liquid biopsies. Finally, we note that in addition to their biological and evolutionary interest, short full-length excised intron RNAs and intron RNA fragments, such as those identified here, may be uniquely well suited to serve as stable RNA biomarkers, whose expression is linked to that of numerous protein-coding genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Plasma</td><td valign="top">Innovative Research</td><td valign="top">IPLA-N-K2E</td><td valign="top">Human plasma pooled from healthy individuals</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">QIAamp ccfDNA/RNA kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Qiagen 55184</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit</td><td valign="top">Takara Bio</td><td valign="top">R400752</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TGIRT-III reverse transcriptase</td><td valign="top">InGex, LLC</td><td valign="top">TGIRT</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of RNA and DNA from human plasma</title><p>Human plasma pooled from healthy individuals (IPLA-N-K2E) was purchased from Innovative Research.

For the initial template-switching and reverse transcription reactions, 10 µL of plasma RNA or DNA was pre-incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 1 μM TGIRT-III (InGex, LLC) and 100 nM of synthetic RNA template/DNA primer substrate in reaction medium containing 200 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. The synthetic RNA template/DNA primer substrate consisted of a 35-nt RNA oligonucleotide that contains an Illumina read 2 (R2) sequence with a 3'-blocking group (C3 spacer, 3SpC3; IDT) annealed to a complementary 36-nt DNA primer that leaves a single nucleotide 3'-DNA overhang (an equimolar mixture of A, C, G, and T residues), which directs TGIRT-template switching by base pairing to the 3' nucleotide of a target RNA. Reactions were initiated by adding 1 mM dNTPs (an equimolar mix of 1 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP), incubated for 15 min at 60°C, and terminated by adding 0.25 M NaOH and incubating at 95°C for 3 min, followed by neutralization with 0.25 M HCl, with the resulting cDNAs cleaned up by using a MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).

The candidate peaks were then further filtered to remove reads with MAPQ &lt; 30 (to exclude reads that mapped equally well by BOWTIE2 to more than one locus) or had ≥ 5 mismatches from the mapped locus to obtain high confidence peaks with ≥ 5 high quality read alignments at the peak maximum. The remainder were classified as low confidence peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The annotation of peaks was done by BEDTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Quinlan, 2014</xref>) intersect command against genomic features from RefSeq genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/</ext-link>), Ensembl genes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html">https://useast.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>), Repbase repeat regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bao et al., 2015</xref>), RBP-binding site annotations from ENCODE eCLIP datasets (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.encodeproject.org/eclip/">https://www.encodeproject.org/eclip/</ext-link>), and piRNA annotations from piRNAdb (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.pirnadb.org">https://www.pirnadb.org</ext-link>).

An overlap score of 1 (highest possible overlap score) indicates the peak can be explained by the full-length genomic feature. A best feature annotation for each peak was selected by the highest overlap score. In cases of identical overlap scores, a feature was selected with the priority RBP-binding sites, repeat regions (Repbase), and lastly long RNAs. In cases of peaks overlapping with two or more RBP binding sites with same overlap score, all RBPs were reported. A histogram showing the number of overlapping bases between peaks and annotated eCLIP-identified RBP-binding sites is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>RNA homology search and RNA secondary structure prediction</title><p>RNA homology searches and secondary structure predictions were done using the hg19 genomic coordinates of the peak called by MACS2 (narrow peak). For long RNA, antisense, and unannotated peaks, we performed an RNA homology search against the covariance model from Rfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kalvari et al., 2018</xref>) using Infernal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nawrocki and Eddy, 2013</xref>), via: cmscan -o {out_file} –tblout {out_table} –cpu 24 Rfam.cm peak.fa.

RNA secondary structures were predicted and MFEs calculated by RNAfold with default parameters using the ViennaRNA package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Empirical Bayes analysis of strand specificity of repeat regions</title><p>We noticed that peaks for some simple repeat sequences (<italic>e.g.</italic>, (CATTC)n and (TTAGGG)n) were called by MACS2 on both strands, but in different ratios in the datasets for DNase-treated plasma RNA and NaOH-treated plasma DNA. To identify repeat sequences with a significantly higher counts in one orientation over the other and eliminate ambiguous read mappings, we aggregated the strand-specific fragment counts for all unique simple repeat sequences and their reverse-complements (<italic>e.g.</italic>, (ATCCC)n and (GGGTA)n) in the combined DNase-treated plasma RNA (n = 15) and NaOH-treated plasma DNA (n = 4) datasets. To compensate for repeat sequences with low read counts, which could give misleading strand-specificity, we employed an Empirical Bayes method by using repeat sequences with high total counts (&gt; 50 deduplicated reads) regardless of strand from the combined plasma DNA datasets to construct a prior beta distribution of strand specificities for all repeat sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This fitted beta distribution represents the probability distribution of detecting 0–100% (+) orientation reads for each repeat sequence in a pure DNA sample. Using the fitted beta distribution hyperparameters and the count data from either the plasma DNA or plasma RNA datasets, we then computed a posterior beta-binomial distributions of the percentages of (+) orientation reads for each repeat sequences, which represents how likely and to what degree the strand specificities were biased towards the (+) or (-) strand orientation. We then compared the posterior distributions for each unique repeat sequences between plasma RNA and DNA to obtain a distribution of differences in the percentage of (+) strand reads in plasma RNA versus plasma DNA (Δ %(+) in RNA vs DNA). Summary statistics were then extracted from this final distribution, and repeat sequences with Bayes factor &gt; 3 for at least 10% more (+) strand fragments in the plasma RNA compared to the plasma DNA samples were identified as significantly enriched in (+)-strand fragments in plasma RNA. The Bayesian statistical testing framework was implemented using pymc3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salvatier et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Code availability</title><p>All scripts used for data processing are deposited in GitHub: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wckdouglas/cfNA">https://github.com/wckdouglas/cfNA</ext-link>.

in blood. This reverse transcriptase differs from retroviral reverse transcriptases in that it can read through structured regions of RNA. Results presented indicate that the population of RNAs in blood is more complex than previously thought.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of protein-protected mRNA fragments and structured intron RNAs in human plasma by TGIRT-seq peak calling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mariano A Garcia-Blanco (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the work was, in principle, suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, each raised significant concerns that need to be addressed via revision. Specifically, the reviewers felt that the bioinformatic analysis needs to be strengthened. They also requested that you provide some practical application of the work. Please address all of the points raised by the reviewers as thoroughly as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The Lambowitz group has developed thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptases (TGIRTs) that strand switch and also have trans-lesion activity to provide a much wider view of RNA species analyzed by massively parallel RNA sequencing. In this manuscript they use several improvements to their methodology to identify RNA biotypes in human plasma pooled from several healthy individuals. Additionally, they implicate binding by proteins (RBPs) and nuclease-resistant structures to explain a fraction of the RNAs observed in plasma. Generally, I find the study fascinating and argue that the collection of plasma RNAs described is an important tool for those interested in extracellular RNAs. I think the possibility that RNPs are protecting RNA fragments in circulation is exciting and fits with elegant studies of insects and plants where RNAs are protected by this mechanism and are transmitted between species.</p><p>I have one major comment for the authors to consider. In my view the use of pooled plasma samples prevented the important opportunity to provide a glimpse on human variation in plasma RNA biotypes. This significantly limits the use of this information to begin addressing RNA biotypes as biomarkers. While I realize that data from multiple individuals represents a significant undertaking and may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, I urge the authors to do two things: (1) downplay the significance of the current study on the development of biomarkers in the current manuscript (e.g., in the Abstract and Discussion – e.g., &quot;The ability of TGIRT-seq to simultaneously profile a wide variety of RNA biotypes in human plasma, including structured RNAs that are intractable to retroviral RTs, may be advantageous for identifying optimal combinations of coding and non-coding RNA biomarkers for human diseases.&quot;).

TGIRT is a thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase that offers improved fidelity, processivity and strand-displacement activity, as compared to standard retroviral RT, so that it can read through highly structured regions. Similar analysis was performed previously (Qin et al., 2016), but this study incorporated several improvements in library preparation including optimization of template switching condition and modified adapters to reduce primer dimer and introduce UMI. In their analysis, the authors detected a variety of structural RNA biotypes, as well as reads from protein-coding mRNAs, although the latter is in low abundance. Compared to SMART-Seq, TGIRT-seq also achieved more uniform read coverage across gene bodies. One novel aspect of this study is the peak analysis of TGIRT-seq reads, which revealed ~900 peaks over background. The authors found that these peaks frequently overlap with RBP binding sites, while others tend to have stable predicted secondary structures, which explains why these regions are protected from degradation in plasma. Overall, this study provided a robust dataset and expanded picture of RNA biotypes one can detect in human plasma. This is valuable because the findings may have implications in biomarker identification in disease contexts. On the other hand, the manuscript, in the current form, is relatively descriptive, and can be improved with a clearer message of specific knowledge that can be extracted from the data.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Several aspects of bioinformatics analysis can be clarified in more detail. For example, it is unclear how sequencing errors in UMI affect their de-duplication procedure. This is important for their peak analysis, so it should be explained clearly. Also, it is not described how exon junction reads (when mapped to the genome) are handled in peak calling, although the authors did perform complementary analysis by mapping reads to the reference transcriptome.</p><p>2) Overall, the authors provided convincing data that TGIRT-seq has advantages in detecting a wide range of RNA biotypes, especially structured RNAs, compared to other protocols, but these data are more confirmatory, rather than completely new findings (e.g., compared to Qin et al., 2016).</p><p>3) The peak analysis is more novel. The authors observed that 50% of peaks in long RNAs overlap with eCLIP peaks. However, there is no statistical analysis to show whether this overlap is significant or simply due to the pervasive distribution of eCLIP peaks. In fact, it was reported by the original authors that eCLIP peaks cover 20% of the transcriptome. Similarly, the authors found that a high proportion of remaining peaks can fold into stable secondary structures, but this claim is not backed up by statistics either.</p><p>4) Ranking of RBPs depends on the total number of RBP binding sites detected by eCLIP, which is determined by CLIP library complexity and sequencing depth. This issue should be at least discussed.</p><p>5) Enrichment of RBP binding sites and structured RNA in TGIRT-seq data is certainly consistent with one's expectation. However, the paper can be greatly improved if the authors can make a clearer case what is new that can be learned, as compared to eCLIP data or other related techniques that purify and sequence RNA fragments crosslinked to proteins. What is the additional, independent evidence to show the predicted secondary structures are real?</p><p>6) The authors should probably discuss how alignment errors can potentially affect detection of repetitive regions.</p><p>7) Many figures are IGV screenshots, which can be difficult to follow. Some of them can probably be summarized to deliver the message better.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60743.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I have one major comment for the authors to consider. In my view the use of pooled plasma samples prevented the important opportunity to provide a glimpse on human variation in plasma RNA biotypes. This significantly limits the use of this information to begin addressing RNA biotypes as biomarkers. While I realize that data from multiple individuals represents a significant undertaking and may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, I urge the authors to do two things: (1) downplay the significance of the current study on the development of biomarkers in the current manuscript (e.g., in the Abstract and Discussion – e.g., &quot;The ability of TGIRT-seq to simultaneously profile a wide variety of RNA biotypes in human plasma, including structured RNAs that are intractable to retroviral RTs, may be advantageous for identifying optimal combinations of coding and non-coding RNA biomarkers for human diseases.&quot;).

This is valuable because the findings may have implications in biomarker identification in disease contexts.&quot; The present manuscript lays the foundation for such applications, which we have been carrying out in parallel. In one such study in collaboration with Dr. Naoto Ueno (MD Anderson), we used TGIRT-seq to identify combinations of mRNA and non-coding RNA biomarkers in FFPE-tumor slices, PBMCs and plasma from inflammatory breast cancer patients compared to non-IBC breast cancer patients and healthy controls (manuscript in preparation; data presented publicly in seminars), and in another, we explored the potential of using full-length excised intron (FLEXI) RNAs as biomarkers. In the latter study, we identified &gt; 8,000 FLEXI RNAs in different human cell lines and tissues and found that they are expressed in a cell-type specific manner, including hundreds of differences between matched tumor and healthy tissues from breast cancer patients and cell lines.

The normalized 5' to 3' gene body coverage plots for protein-coding gene transcripts show that TGIRT-seq captures mRNA fragments that collectively span the entire mRNA sequence, whereas SMART-Seq is biased for 3' sequences linked to poly(A) (Figure 3F).

Additionally, we used miRNA reference sets for detailed analysis of TGIRT-seq biases, including developing a computer algorithm for bias correction based on a random forest regression model that provides insight into different factors that contribute to these biases (Xu et al., 2019). Overall GC content does not make a significant contribution to TGIRT-seq biases (Figure 9 of Xu et al., 2019). Instead, biases in TGIRT-seq are largely confined to the first three nucleotides at the 5'-end (due to bias of the thermostable 5' App DNA ligase used for 5' RNA-seq adapter addition) and the 3' nucleotide (due to TGIRT-template switching).

As mentioned in comments above, this analysis identified a number of RBP-binding sites that were substantially enriched in plasma RNAs compared to cellular RNAs or vice versa and led to what we think is the important new finding that plasma RNAs are enriched binding sites for a number of stress granule proteins (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figures supplement 1).
