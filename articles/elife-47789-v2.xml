neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which supports the structural integrity of astrocytes. Over 70 GFAP missense mutations cause AxD, but the mechanism linking different mutations to disease-relevant phenotypes remains unknown. We used AxD patient brain tissue and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes to investigate the hypothesis that AxD-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. Our findings reveal selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young, independently of the mutation they carried. AxD iPSC-astrocytes accumulated pSer13-GFAP in cytoplasmic aggregates within deep nuclear invaginations, resembling the hallmark Rosenthal fibers observed in vivo. Ser13 phosphorylation facilitated GFAP aggregation and was associated with increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6. Furthermore, caspase-6 was selectively expressed in young AxD patients, and correlated with the presence of cleaved GFAP. We reveal a novel PTM signature linking different GFAP mutations in infantile AxD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alexander disease is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative condition. It is caused by mutations in a gene that is crucial for the structure of astrocytes, a type of brain cell whose role is to support neurons. The gene codes for a protein called GFAP, which is made almost exclusively in astrocytes. In Alexander disease, mutated versions of the gene make GFAP collect in disordered clumps or aggregates, which interfere with the astrocytes’ normal activities.</p><p>All Alexander disease patients develop GFAP aggregates, but the type of mutation they have in the gene for GFAP does not predict how their illness will progress. The age of onset of disease, for example, can vary between less than one year old to more than 70 years old. Battaglia et al. sought to understand how GFAP aggregates form in the cells of Alexander disease patients. One way that GFAP can be altered in the cell is by a process called phosphorylation. Enzymes called kinases add phosphate groups to GFAP, which can regulate the protein’s activity, stability and interactions with other proteins.</p><p>Battaglia et al. found high levels of phosphorylation at one specific site in the GFAP protein in people who had very early onset of Alexander disease. This phosphorylation was not related to any particular mutation in the gene for GFAP. An added phosphate group at this location in the protein made GFAP more likely to be broken into two pieces by an enzyme called caspase-6. One of the breakdown products is already known to play a role in aggregation. Young patients with Alexander disease had high levels of GFAP breakdown products and caspase-6. The phosphorylated protein and this enzyme were found to accumulate in astrocyte aggregates.</p><p>The findings provide a basis for investigating new strategies to treat Alexander disease that target phosphorylation – as removing or preventing the addition of phosphate groups can be done with drugs. But before exploring how to do this, it will be necessary to find out which enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating GFAP at this particular position. These studies may also give a broader understanding of other GFAP-like proteins (called intermediate filament proteins), which are involved in over 70 human diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>rare disease</kwd><kwd>induced pluripotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>astrocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Elise's Corner Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>Natasha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>United Leukodystrophy Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>Natasha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Battaglia</surname><given-names>Rachel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007890</institution-id><institution>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Department of Cell Biology and Physiology</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Snider</surname><given-names>Natasha T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA016086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Madden</surname><given-names>Victoria J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GFAP protein carries a distinct post-translational modification signature that facilitates its pathogenic accumulation and aggregation in astrocytes of patients who succumb to Alexander Disease very early in life.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alexander disease (AxD) is a rare and invariably fatal neurological disorder that affects primarily infants and small children, but can also manifest later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sosunov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Messing, 2018</xref>). Autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutations in <italic>GFAP</italic>, which encodes glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), cause AxD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Messing, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al., 2001</xref>). GFAP is the major component of the intermediate filament (IF) cytoskeleton in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hol and Pekny, 2015</xref>). The accumulation and incorporation of mutant GFAP within cytoplasmic aggregates called Rosenthal fibers (RFs), causes reactive gliosis, leading to secondary injury to neurons and non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olabarria and Goldman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2018</xref>). Silencing <italic>GFAP</italic> via antisense oligonucleotide intervention in vivo eliminates RFs, reverses the stress responses in astrocytes and other cell types, and improves the clinical phenotype in a mouse model of AxD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hagemann et al., 2018</xref>). While the utility of GFAP as a key therapeutic target in AxD is clear, the molecular mechanisms for how AxD-associated GFAP missense mutations (affecting over 70 different residues on GFAP) lead to defective GFAP proteostasis are not well understood. Deciphering these mechanisms may yield novel interventions, not only for AxD patients, but also for patients with other diseases where IF proteostasis is severely compromised.</p><p>Normal functioning IFs are stress-bearing structures that organize the cytoplasmic space, scaffold organelles, and orchestrate numerous signaling pathways. In contrast, dysfunctional IFs directly cause or predispose to over 70 tissue-specific or systemic diseases, including neuropathies, myopathies, skin fragility, metabolic dysfunctions, and premature aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Omary, 2009</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interfil.org">www.interfil.org</ext-link>). Disease-associated IF proteins share two key molecular features: abnormal post-translational modifications (PTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snider and Omary, 2014</xref>) and pathologic aggregation. The GFAP-rich RF aggregates that are hallmarks of AxD astrocytes bear strong similarities to pathologic aggregates of other IFs, including epidermal keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coulombe et al., 1991</xref>), simple epithelial keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamichi et al., 2005</xref>), desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dalakas et al., 2000</xref>), vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Müller et al., 2009</xref>), neurofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhai et al., 2007</xref>) and the nuclear lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldman et al., 2004</xref>). There are unique advantages to studying IF proteostasis mechanisms in the context of GFAP because of its restricted cellular expression, homopolymeric assembly mechanism, and because GFAP is the sole genetic cause of AxD as a direct result of its toxic gain-of-function accumulation and aggregation.</p><p>Like all IF proteins, GFAP contains three functional domains: amino-terminal ‘head’ domain, central α-helical ‘rod’ domain and carboxy-terminal ‘tail’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eriksson et al., 2009</xref>). The globular head domain is essential for IF assembly and disassembly, which are regulated by various PTMs, in particular phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Omary et al., 2006</xref>). It was shown previously that phosphorylation of multiple sites in the head domain of GFAP (Thr-7, Ser-8, Ser-13, Ser-17 and Ser-34) regulates filament disassembly during mitosis and GFAP turnover in non-mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takemura et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Inagaki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inagaki et al., 1996</xref>). Additionally, phosphorylation of GFAP has been observed after various injuries of the central nervous system (CNS) including kainic acid-induced seizures, cold-injury, and hypoxic-ischemic models, where phosphorylated GFAP is expressed in reactive astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valentim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takemura et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sullivan et al., 2012</xref>). These observations reveal that phosphorylation of GFAP is important for re-organization of the astrocyte IF cytoskeleton and plasticity in response to injury. However, it is not clear if, and how, abnormal GFAP phosphorylation compromises proteostasis and contributes to AxD pathogenesis.</p><p>Here, we identified a critical phosphorylation site in the GFAP head domain that is selectively and strongly upregulated in the brain tissues of AxD patients who died very young, independently of the position of the disease mutation that they carried. Further, we show that this site-specific phosphorylation promotes GFAP aggregation and is a marker of perinuclear GFAP aggregates associated with deep nuclear invaginations in AxD patient astrocytes, but not in isogenic control astrocytes. Finally, we demonstrate a correlation between site-specific GFAP phosphorylation and caspase cleavage in cells and in post-mortem brain tissue from AxD patients. Although our study does not establish a causal relationship between GFAP phosphorylation and caspase cleavage, we show that caspase-6 is a new marker for the most severe form of human AxD.</p><p>Collectively, our results reveal a new PTM signature that is associated with defective GFAP proteostasis in the most severe form of AxD. Future interventional studies targeting these PTMs will determine whether they contribute to, or are the consequence of, disease severity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of Ser13 on GFAP is a marker of the most aggressive form of AxD</title><p>IFs undergo protein synthesis-independent turnover and re-organization to meet cellular demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Robert et al., 2016</xref>). PTMs are key in that process, as they regulate filament polymerization and depolymerization, protein-protein interactions, and oligomerization properties of IF proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Snider and Omary, 2014</xref>). Of all known PTMs that regulate IFs, phosphorylation is the most ubiquitous and can facilitate or antagonize other types of PTMs via complex cross-talk mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Omary et al., 2006</xref>). We hypothesized that AxD-associated GFAP missense mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) promote GFAP accumulation and aggregation by dysregulating site-specific phosphorylation.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, pSer13-GFAP signal was detected strongly within the core of the perinuclear GFAP aggregates of AxD iPSC-astrocytes. Somewhat surprisingly, we also observed pSer13-GFAP signal in the isogenic control cells, possibly triggered by the in vitro culture conditions. Nevertheless, unlike AxD astrocytes, in the isogenic control astrocytes pSer13-GFAP organization was filamentous and paralleled that of total GFAP. Therefore, the in vitro iPSC-astrocyte model revealed that, only in the presence of the AxD disease mutation, pSer13-GFAP is incorporated within the core of perinuclear inclusions. While in all AxD cells pSer13 signal was detected in the aggregates, we also observed cells with pSer13-positive diffuse cytoplasmic staining and filaments, likely reflecting different states of the GFAP network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the pSer13-positive GFAP aggregates appeared adjacent to prominent nuclear invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

To determine whether the perinuclear aggregates compromised the nuclear envelope, we examined the AxD iPSC-astrocytes by electron microscopy. While we observed filamentous bundles on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear invaginations, the nuclear envelope appeared intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, pSer13-GFAP marks cytoplasmic GFAP aggregates adjacent to nuclear invaginations. It should be noted that the perinuclear aggregates containing disorganized GFAP filaments are not identical to the electron-dense RFs that are seen in post-mortem patient brain, but that they may reflect an intermediate state of GFAP accumulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>pSer13 marks perinuclear accumulation of GFAP within nuclear invaginations in AxD iPSC-astrocytes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of total GFAP (magenta), pSer13-GFAP (green) and DAPI (blue) in isogenic control (top panels) and AxD mutant (bottom panels) iPSC-astrocytes.

However, more strikingly, we observed increased levels of a cleaved GFAP fragment (24 kDa) in S13D and S13E, which was significantly lower in WT- and S13A-GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>). Cleavage of GFAP by caspase-6 in vitro generates two fragments of 24 and 26 kDa size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The 24 kDa C-terminal fragment is recognized by the monoclonal GA5 antibody, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) which was used here. Therefore, we tested the effect of a peptide inhibitor of caspase-6 (Ac-VEID-CHO), and found that it significantly reduced the amount of cleaved S13D-GFAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed augmented cleavage of S13D-GFAP when combined with an AxD-causing mutation (S13D/R79H double mutant), and this was also blocked by the caspase-6 inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Further analysis of the AxD mutant R79H in the transfection system revealed phosphorylation not only at S13, but also at nearby Y14, S16, and S17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Of note, mutagenesis of S16 and S17 to non-phosphorylatable alanines reduced both the cleavage and oligomerization of R79H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phospho-motif analysis revealed that S13, S16 and S17 are part of a segment in the GFAP head domain that is a potential target for several kinases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Candidate kinases include casein kinase 2 (CK2), protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, MAP kinase activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAP2), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).

To determine the extent of caspase-6-cleaved GFAP in AxD patient brains, we utilized an antibody that specifically recognizes N-terminally caspase-6-cleaved GFAP (D225) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). We detected cleaved GFAP in extracts from AxD patient brains, and we observed a significant increase in the amount of D225 signal in young AxD patients, which paralleled the increased pSer13 signal in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D–E</xref>). In agreement with the biochemical evidence, brain tissues from young AxD patients stained intensely for cleaved GFAP, while the signal was significantly weaker in AxD patients who were older (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). The signal was particularly strong around perinuclear areas and surrounded circular structures that stained positive for DAPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>, bottom panels), similar to what we observed in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes. Thus, our results show that caspase-6 expression in AxD patient brain tissue parallels the presence of cleaved GFAP, and both are selectively and significantly elevated in patients who succumbed to the disease very early in life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study reveals that missense mutations, affecting discrete domains on the GFAP molecule, share a common PTM signature that is associated with compromised GFAP proteostasis in the severe form of AxD. Using patient brain tissue and human iPSC-derived AxD astrocytes, we show that head domain phosphorylation promotes defective filament assembly and perinuclear accumulation and incorporation of mutant GFAP within nuclear invaginations. By taking an unbiased mass spectrometry proteomic approach, we were able to identify GFAP phospho-peptides that were selectively elevated in human AxD brain tissue, and subsequently validated these results using a phospho-specific antibody against the most abundant epitope (pSer13-GFAP). We demonstrate the importance of the Ser13 site for GFAP assembly in vitro and in cells. Phospho-mimetic mutation S13D completely abolished the ability of GFAP to form filaments in vitro, without leading to aggregation. In transfected SW13vim- cells, phospho mimic S13D-and S13E-GFAP mutants formed highly abnormal perinuclear aggregates that correlated with increased cleavage of GFAP by caspase-6. We detected a dramatic increase in caspase-6 expression, in association with Ser13 phosphorylation and cleavage of GFAP, in the brain tissue of AxD patients who succumbed to the disease very early in life. While the N-terminal caspase-6 fragment of GFAP promotes filament aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), presently we do not have direct evidence of cause and effect between caspase-6 cleavage and GFAP aggregation in AxD patient cells. Nevertheless, our current findings provide a basis for exploring PTM-based diagnostic and potential therapeutic strategies in AxD.</p><p>Our study does not address whether Ser13 phosphorylation directly promotes caspase cleavage of GFAP, or if these two PTMs are independent markers of an increased cellular stress response in AxD. One possibility is that Ser13 phosphorylation destabilizes the filament structure, thereby promoting access of caspase-6 to the rod domain Asp225 residue, where the cleavage occurs. Another likely possibility is that the increased cleavage of GFAP is an indirect result of stress-dependent caspase-6 activation in the more severe form of AxD. This is supported by previous studies showing that AxD mutations promote activation and nuclear accumulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), which can directly induce caspase-6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002</xref>). Future studies in AxD iPSC-astrocytes and animal models will be required to determine the timing of GFAP phosphorylation and caspase-6 activation in relationship to GFAP cleavage and aggregation.</p><p>Given our findings that pSer13-GFAP is enriched in the most aggressive form of AxD, monitoring the levels of this phospho-epitope (in addition to total GFAP) in AxD patient cerebrospinal fluid or blood may provide added sensitivity for disease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jany et al., 2015</xref>). Phosphorylation of Ser13 by protein kinase C and cAMP-dependent protein kinase was initially described in vitro using purified recombinant GFAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 1990</xref>). In the presence of active kinases, Ser-13 phosphorylation occurred in conjunction with phosphorylation at three additional sites (Thr-7, Ser-8, and Ser-34). Phosphorylation of monomeric GFAP at these sites prevented filament assembly, while phosphorylation of in vitro assembled GFAP filaments led to their disassembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Inagaki et al., 1990</xref>). Using the same antibody to pSer13-GFAP that we used in this paper (clone KT13) it was later shown that Aurora-B and Rho-associated kinase phosphorylate GFAP in cultured astrocytoma cells during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inagaki et al., 1996</xref>). This may bear relevance to AxD, since human and mouse AxD astrocytes with RFs display mitotic abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sosunov et al., 2017</xref>). However, it was also shown using knock-in mice with the human GFAP head domain that, in vivo, the distribution of pSer13 localization was not limited to mitotic astrocytes, but that select astrocyte populations within multiple regions were pSer13 positive, such as those in the olfactory bulb, subpial regions, and subventricular zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takemura et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hagemann et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, the regional distribution of pSer13 largely overlaps with areas that are known to be most enriched in RFs in the AxD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hagemann et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, this particular phosphorylation event on GFAP may occur during mitosis, or in phenotypically distinct astrocyte populations. This remains to be addressed in the future using the appropriate model systems, as over-expression studies in cancer cell lines (such as the SW13vim- cells we used here) may not be truly reflective of the signaling that occurs in astrocytes. In particular, it remains to be resolved whether phosphorylation of GFAP on Ser13 is part of a sequentially priming phosphorylation cascade involving nearby Ser16/17 (as predicted by the kinase motif analysis) or if Ser16/17 phosphorylation is unique to the SW13 over-expression system. Importantly, identifying the relevant in vivo kinase(s) that phosphorylate GFAP in human AxD may lead to potential novel interventions via kinase inhibition.</p><p>Caspase-mediated proteolysis of IF proteins is an important mechanism by which the filament networks re-organize during apoptosis. Although multiple effector caspases are capable of cleaving IF proteins, caspase-6 is frequently implicated in cleavage at a conserved motif within the linker L12 region of the rod domain, which results in the generation of two fragments of similar sizes. This was initially demonstrated to be the case for the type I keratins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caulín et al., 1997</xref>), and later shown to also occur on vimentin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byun et al., 2001</xref>), desmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), A-type lamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruchaud et al., 2002</xref>), and GFAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hol and Pekny, 2015</xref>). Caspase-6 cleavage of GFAP at <sub>222</sub>VELD<sub>225 </sub>in vitro generates an N-terminal 26 kDa fragment and a C-terminal 24 kDa fragment. The N-terminal fragment directly impairs assembly of full-length GFAP and promotes aggregation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Using a specific antibody recognizing the N-terminal GFAP fragment (D225), we show here that GFAP cleavage is significantly increased in AxD tissues from patients presenting with an aggressive form of AxD, and that this parallels elevated expression of caspase-6. This could suggest that misregulation of caspase-6 may contribute to the severity of AxD. However, we were not able to demonstrate in cells that inhibition of caspase-6, or mutagenesis of the cleavage site on GFAP, can resolve aggregate formation. These results point to a more complex function for caspase-6, likely involving cytoskeletal remodeling in response to stress.</p><p>Indeed, caspase-6 upregulation has been reported in other neurodegenerative diseases involving protein aggregation, including Huntington’s Disease (HD) and Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graham et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2004</xref>). Similar to GFAP, there is a caspase-6 cleavage site on the aggregation-prone proteins in both AD (amyloid precursor protein) and HD (huntingtin). Furthermore, in caspase-6 cleavage-resistant genetic mouse models of both HD and AD, neuronal dysfunction and degeneration are rescued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Galvan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Saganich et al., 2006</xref>). Caspase-6 can promote neurodegeneration via induction of neuronal apoptosis or axon pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geden et al., 2019</xref>). However, the functions of caspase-6 in astrocytes are not clear. In the context of human AxD it still remains to be determined which astrocyte populations express caspase-6, and whether it promotes apoptosis or performs a non-apoptotic role, such as sculpting the cytoskeletal architecture in reactive astrocytes. Based on our demonstration that caspase-6 localizes within the perinuclear GFAP inclusions in the AxD iPSC-astrocytes, it is intriguing to speculate that, similar to keratin inclusions in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinsdale et al., 2004</xref>), RFs sequester active caspases away from other cellular substrates and may protect reactive astrocytes from apoptosis.</p><p>Recently, iPSC-derived patient astrocyte models have emerged as an important system for dissecting the cellular mechanisms in AxD. For example, these novel tools have revealed that AxD astrocytes have defects in the secretory pathway, impaired ATP release, and attenuated calcium waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jones et al., 2018</xref>); that they inhibit oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2018</xref>), providing a potential mechanistic explanation for the degeneration of white matter observed in patients; and that they have defects in mechanotransduction signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). A novel aspect of the AxD astrocyte cell model that we generated in our study is the perinuclear accumulation of pSer13-GFAP that was associated with prominent nuclear abnormalities. As such, these patient-derived cells replicate a key phenotypic characteristic of RF-bearing AxD astrocytes in vivo, since nuclear invaginations have been described in electron microscopy studies of AxD mouse models and AxD patient cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sosunov et al., 2017</xref>). Another important parallel is that the GFAP inclusions we observe in the AxD patient astrocytes in vitro stain positive for DAPI, and it was shown that DAPI is a reliable and sensitive marker of RFs in human and mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sosunov et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore patient-derived iPSC-astrocytes provide a unique model system to investigate cytoplasmic-nuclear mechanics in AxD.</p><p>Invaginations of the nucleus, such as those we observe here, have been described in physiological and pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malhas et al., 2011</xref>). Control of nuclear shape is critical for regulation of gene expression and response to mechanotransduction signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhler and Shivashankar, 2017</xref>). The effects of impaired nuclear morphology can be very severe, as evidenced by mutations in lamin A that lead to defective nuclear morphology in Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), where patients experience accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eriksson et al., 2003</xref>). An elegant study combining multiple 3D imaging strategies established a direct link between intermediate filaments, actin and the nuclear envelope within nuclear invaginations, and genetic evidence indicates that filamentous actin may play a role in generating these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jorgens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frost et al., 2016</xref>). It is hypothesized that nuclear invaginations provide localized control of gene expression and nuclear-cytoplasmic transport deep within the nucleus, since they have been found to contain calcium receptors and nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malhas et al., 2011</xref>). Our study provides the first link between abnormal cytoplasmic PTM processing and perinuclear accumulation of mutant GFAP with nuclear defects, setting the stage to address how nucleo-cytoskeletal coupling is adversely impacted by defective IF proteostasis in AxD and related human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (human)</td><td><italic>GFAP</italic></td><td>NA</td><td>Gene ID: 2670</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (human)</td><td>R239C-GFAP fibroblasts from AxD patient</td><td>Coriell Institute</td><td>GM16825</td><td valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner et al.

The TaqMan PCR assay combines DNA methylation mapping, gene expression profiling, and transcript counting of lineage marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2011</xref>). Reprogrammed and edited iPSCs were submitted to a standard G-band analysis consisting of 20 metaphase spreads. The analysis (carried out by Karyologic Inc) can identify gender, chromosome number, and detect aberrations that include trisomies, monosomies, deletions, insertions, translocations, duplications, breaks, polyploidy, among others. No abnormalities were found in our cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing</title><p>We used the TrueCut Cas9 Protein V2, sgRNAs and the Neon Transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to edit iPSCs. The recombinant TrueCut Cas9 V2 was diluted in resuspension buffer R provided in the kit and mixed with 900 ng of sgRNA and 2700 ng of single-stranded donor oligonucleotide, incubated 15 min at room temperature and then a total of 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> iPSCs were electroporated with the ribonucleoprotein mix. Seventy-two hours after electroporation, cells were dissociated into single cells, diluted, and seeded on Matrigel-coated 96-well plates. Single-cell colonies were selected after two weeks and tested for gene correction. Genomic DNA of single clones was extracted and the gene of interest amplified by PCR using allele specific primers. Sanger sequencing of positive clones demonstrated single or double allele gene correction. Off-target sites within the exons of genes were predicted via selection of the top candidates using the MIT software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://crispr.mit.edu/">CRISPR.mit.edu</ext-link>). The analysis was performed via PCR of 400 bp fragments, which flanked the predicted off-target cut site followed by Sanger sequencing. The chromatograms for edited clones were compared to sequences from the original AxD patient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>iPSC culture and astrocyte differentiation</title><p>iPSCs were maintained on Matrigel in StemFlex medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and passaged every 3–4 days with 0.5 mM EDTA dissociation solution. iPSCs were differentiated into neural progenitor cells (NPC) using an embryoid body (EB) protocol. Briefly, iPSCs at 80% confluence were collected, resuspended in Neural Induction Medium (NIM, StemCell Technologies) and seeded on one well of an Aggrewell 800 plate (StemCell Technologies) at 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells per well. At day five, EBs were seeded on poly-ornithine and laminin (PLO/LAM)-coated dishes in NIM. Rosette selection was performed after 12 days using Rosette Selection Reagent (StemCell Technologies). NPCs were expanded for 7 days in Neural Progenitor Medium (StemCell Technologies). NPCs were then differentiated into astrocyte precursors by seeding dissociated single cells at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/cm<sup>2</sup> density on PLO/LAM dishes in STEMdiff astrocyte differentiation medium (StemCell Technologies). Astrocyte precursors were maintained for 20 days with medium changes every 48 hr and splitting every week with Accutase (Millipore, Burlington, MA). Astrocytes were expanded for up to 120 days in STEMdiff astrocyte maturation medium (StemCell Technologies).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Transmission electron microscopy</title><p>AxD iPSC-astrocytes grown on a polystyrene dish were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4, for one hour at room temperature and stored at 4°C. The cells were washed 3 times in 0.1M sodium cacodylate buffer followed by post-fixation in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for 1 hr. After three washes in deionized water, the cells were dehydrated in ethanol, infiltrated and embedded in situ in PolyBed 812 epoxy resin (Polysciences, Inc, Warrington, PA). The cell monolayer was sectioned <italic>en face</italic> to the substrate with a diamond knife and Leica UCT Ultramicrotome (Leica Microsystems, Inc, Buffalo Grove, IL). Ultrathin sections (70 nm) were mounted on 200 mesh copper grids and stained with 4% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The sections were observed and digital images were taken using a JEOL JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope operating at 80kV (JEOL USA, Inc, Peabody, MA) equipped with a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD Digital Camera (Gatan, Inc, Pleasanton, CA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from Elise’s Corner Fund and the United Leukodystrophy Foundation (to NTS), the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship (to RAB) and the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology at UNC-Chapel Hill.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>We are particularly excited about the findings that Alexander Disease-causing mutations perturb key post-translational modifications (PTMs) on GFAP. The selective phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 in patients who died young raises the hypothesis that Ser13 phosphorylation and increased GFAP proteolysis by caspase-6 facilitated GFAP aggregation, which leads to disease state.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Phosphorylation-dependent proteolysis perturbs GFAP proteostasis, implicating caspase-6 in early onset Alexander Disease&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: W Christopher Risher (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Battaglia and co-authors have identified a posttranslational modification of the GFAP protein and potential mechanism involving caspase-6 that appear to correlate with disease severity in the rare but lethal disorder Alexander disease (AxD). In this report post-mortem samples from individuals with known GFAP mutations were analyzed for GFAP-PTM by mass spectrometry. Phospho-Ser13 was identified primarily in samples from AxD patients with early onset, regardless of the mutational variant. Subsequent transfection experiments with Ser13 phospho- and de-phospho mimics further suggest that Ser13 phosphorylation promotes protein aggregation. In addition, the authors show that pSer13-GFAP along with caspase-6 localize to aggregates found in astrocytes derived from AxD iPSCs, and that the phospho-mimic S13D leads to caspase-6 cleavage of GFAP, similar to AxD mutations. Finally, they show that pSer13, caspase-6 protein, and caspase-6 cleaved GFAP are present in brains from early onset AxD patients.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the question interesting and the results potentially significant.</p><p>1) The major critique from all three reviewers is that the causality between phosphorylation of GFAP and cleavage of caspase-6 in relation to the pathology of AxD are not explored. For example, does blocking phosphorylation of this site on GFAP in the patient iPSC astrocytes prevent/reverse the GFAP aggregation and perinuclear accumulation of GFAP?

Did the authors try other substitutions, e.g. S13V, S13E (or D225E to prevent caspase-6 cleavage)? Since it is known that over-expression of wild-type GFAP causes aggregation, how are GFAP expression levels controlled between transfections? If phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 promotes caspase-6 cleavage and GFAP aggregation, shouldn't elimination of pSer13 alleviate aggregate formation in the R79H/S13A transfection? Would caspase-6 inhibitors (Ac-VEID-CHO) prevent aggregation in either the SW13vim-cells or iPSC astrocytes?

These include in vitro assembly analysis for the GFAP S13D phospho-mimic, the addition of the S13E phospho-mimic and analysis of GFAP-R79H phosphorylation sites in transfection experiments (SW13vim-), and both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of caspase-6 to assess the effects of GFAP cleavage on protein aggregation in SW13vim- cells. Important controls were also added for the iPS cell and AxD patient experiments. Most of these additions have strengthened the manuscript and support a connection between GFAP phosphorylation and aggregation. However, the new data showing caspase-6 inhibition in itself disrupts GFAP filament organization and fails to rescue S13D aggregation complicate interpretation of the results, and evidence for direct cause and effect between caspase-6 GFAP cleavage and protein aggregation is still lacking. The findings in this report are important in identifying PTMs as new markers of disease severity and should be published, but as noted in the original review, the authors should be more conservative with their conclusions.</p><p>The authors indicate a direct link between GFAP-pSer13, caspase-6 cleavage, and protein aggregation in the title, Introduction and Discussion. A major question is still whether the observed phenomena contribute to disease severity or are downstream in the stress response and simply reflect the more severe pathology in early onset AxD. The following 3 areas contribute to this concern:</p><p>1) In agreement with a more severe phenotype and astrocyte response, GFAP levels are higher in early onset AxD cases compared to those with late onset (Figure 9D). GFAP has been shown to be phosphorylated in reactive gliosis associated with certain injury models (Takemura et al., 2002), and the overall damage response could have a broader effect in activating caspase-6; p53 for example is activated in AxD (Wang et al., 2015) and is known to transactivate caspase-6 (MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002). The authors hypothesize that GFAP phosphorylation directly affects caspase-6 accessibility, but aggregation of GFAP-S13D and S13E in SW13vim- cells likely causes a cellular stress response that could also indirectly activate caspase-6. While I agree with the authors that investigating these mechanisms is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, they should address this possibility in their discussion and conclusions.</p><p>2) New experiments to inhibit caspase-6 cleavage of GFAP produce ambiguous results. Inhibition of caspase-6 alone leads to GFAP bundling in SW13vim- cells and in combination with the S13D phospho-mimic, aggregates are not resolved. Western analysis shows clearance of a 100 kD (hmm) band, but a ~200 kD band remains and no western data is shown to demonstrate the level of WT-GFAP oligomerization induced by caspase-6 inhibition. As the authors suggest in the discussion, the role of caspase-6 activation is complex and may also be involved in cytoskeletal reorganization.</p><p>3) The supplemental data added to Figure 7 introduce important evidence for a link between GFAP phosphorylation, aggregation and caspase-6 cleavage. Immunoblotting shows de-phospho-mimics of serine residues (S to A) within the S13-S17 motif of mutant R79H GFAP eliminate high molecular weight oligomerization and significantly reduce caspase-6 cleavage fragments. However, these data are complicated by the limited contribution of pSer13 in GFAP-R79H aggregation in SW13vim- cells and the more dominant effects of pS16 and pS17, which have not been otherwise explored in this report. Although the SW13vim- cell line is commonly used to test the effects of GFAP mutation, these results demonstrate the limitations of the system for these experiments. Future work should include similar experiments in the iPSC derived astrocytes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47789.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers found the question interesting and the results potentially significant.</p><p>1) The major critique from all three reviewers is that the causality between phosphorylation of GFAP and cleavage of caspase-6 in relation to the pathology of AxD are not explored.

Although we are actively working to identify the critical kinase(s) involved in the phosphorylation of S13 (through candidate and unbiased approaches), we currently do not have strong and conclusive evidence for the specific involvement of a major kinase that we can selectively inhibit to measure the effects. However, we fully agree with the reviewers that this is of key importance and it is an avenue that we are actively exploring, using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to find the most promising target for intervention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments along this line include &quot;The key pieces of evidence suggesting cause and effect are the transfection experiments with phopho-mimetic constructs.

As shown in new Figure 3C, the S13D mutant is unable to assemble into filaments, and it does not aggregate on its own. This is in contrast to the phenotype of the N-terminal caspase-cleaved fragment, which does aggregate on its own (please see Figure 2B of Chen et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors try other substitutions, e.g. S13V, S13E (or D225E to prevent caspase-6 cleavage)?</p></disp-quote><p>We now include new data on the effects of an S13E substitution, which phenocopied S13D with respect to aggregation (Figure 3A-B) and caspase cleavage (Figure 7A-B). We also generated D225E mutant alone, and in combination with S13D. We present new data to show that D225E mutation essentially eliminates S13D-GFAP cleavage, and that this correlates with a decrease in aggregation (Figure 8A-D). We note that D225E on its own interfered with GFAP filament formation, which is not surprising as caspase-cleavage is an important mechanism used to re-organize IFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since it is known that over-expression of wild-type GFAP causes aggregation, how are GFAP expression levels controlled between transfections?</p></disp-quote><p>For all transfection experiments, we initially carried out titration of WT-GFAP cDNA amounts (250ng-1µg) in a 24-well format using three different transfection reagents (Lipofectamine 2000, 3000, and LTX). We combined this with a time-course experiments (24, 48, 72h). Based on these initial optimization experiments, we selected to use Lipofectamine 2000/500ng cDNA/24hr conditions. Under these conditions, there is minimal aggregation of WT-GFAP (based on protein solubility in TritonX-100 buffer and filament organization). In contrast, under these same conditions, AxD-associated GFAP mutants are significantly less soluble and form the expected aggregates. We now show this as a supplement (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If phosphorylation of GFAP-Ser13 promotes caspase-6 cleavage and GFAP aggregation, shouldn't elimination of pSer13 alleviate aggregate formation in the R79H/S13A transfection?</p></disp-quote><p>We present new data that R79H in the over-expression system is highly phosphorylated at nearby serines 16/17 (Figure 7—figure supplement 1; Figure 7—source data 1). Mutagenesis of these residues to non-phosphorylatable alanines decreases GFAP cleavage and oligomerization of the R79H mutant. Therefore, our current hypothesis is that phosphorylation of S13 is a coordinated event that works in tandem with nearby phosphorylation sites. This is also predicted by the kinase motif analysis (Supplementary file 4). Another contributing factor may be that the S13A substitution leads to the formation of abnormal filaments, based on the in vitro assembly assay (Figure 3C). Given these results, it is not surprising that S13A does not alleviate R79H aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would caspase-6 inhibitors (Ac-VEID-CHO) prevent aggregation in either the SW13vim-cells or iPSC astrocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>These data are shown in new Figure 8E-G. In the presence of the caspase-6 inhibitor, S13D aggregates in the SW13vim- cells were reduced in size, but we observed more filament bundles (consistent with previous studies on other IFs showing that caspase cleavage is required for filament re-organization). Additionally, the presence of a high-molecular-mass (100kDa) S13D-GFAP oligomer was significantly reduced by caspase-6 inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors claim in the Discussion that impairment of GFAP assembly by the S13D phospho-mimic is due to caspase-6 cleavage, but this link is not demonstrated by the data shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified this section of the Discussion to include the new results with the recombinant protein and propose a potential mechanism regarding the aggregation mechanism of the S13D mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Western blots in the figures (Figure 3E, Figure 6B, Figure 7B) used Coomassie staining as the loading control, but no details were given.

Although our study does not establish a causal relationship between GFAP phosphorylation and caspase cleavage, we show that caspase-6 is a new marker for the most severe form of human AxD.”</p><p>2) We added the following paragraph to the Discussion: “Our study does not address whether Ser13 phosphorylation directly promotes caspase cleavage of GFAP, or if these two PTMs are independent markers of an increased cellular stress response in AxD. One possibility is that Ser13 phosphorylation destabilizes the filament structure, thereby promoting access of caspase-6 to the rod domain Asp225 residue, where the cleavage occurs. Another likely possibility is that the increased cleavage of GFAP is an indirect result of stress-dependent caspase-6 activation in the more severe form of AxD. This is supported by previous studies showing that AxD mutations promote activation and nuclear accumulation of p53 (Wang et al., 2015), which can directly induce caspase-6 expression (MacLachlan and El-Deiry, 2002). Future studies in AxD iPSC-astrocytes and animal models will be required to determine the timing of GFAP phosphorylation and caspase-6 activation in relationship to GFAP cleavage and aggregation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) New experiments to inhibit caspase-6 cleavage of GFAP produce ambiguous results.

With respect to the hmm GFAP bands, we focused primarily on the 100kDa band in the S13D mutant because of the significant difference in the intensity of this band compared to WT GFAP (Figure 7A), and after caspase-6 inhibition (Figure 8F). We hypothesize that the 200kDa band likely reflects presence of normal GFAP tetramer, but we have not tested that specifically.</p><p>We also added the following statement to the Discussion:“However, we were not able to demonstrate in cells that inhibition of caspase-6, or mutagenesis of the cleavage site on GFAP, can resolve aggregate formation. These results point to a more complex function for caspase-6, likely involving cytoskeletal remodeling in response to stress.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The supplemental data added to Figure 7 introduce important evidence for a link between GFAP phosphorylation, aggregation and caspase-6 cleavage.

In particular, it remains to be resolved whether phosphorylation of GFAP on Ser13 is part of a sequentially priming phosphorylation cascade involving nearby Ser16/17 (as predicted by the kinase motif analysis) or if Ser16/17 phosphorylation is unique to the SW13 over-expression system.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
