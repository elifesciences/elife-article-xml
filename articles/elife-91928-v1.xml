While the role of sensorimotor cortex in motor learning has been well established, how higher-order brain systems interact with sensorimotor cortex to guide learning is less well understood. Using functional MRI, we examined human brain activity during a reward-based motor task where subjects learned to shape their hand trajectories through reinforcement feedback. We projected patterns of cortical and striatal functional connectivity onto a low-dimensional manifold space and examined how regions expanded and contracted along the manifold during learning. During early learning, we found that several sensorimotor areas in the dorsal attention network exhibited increased covariance with areas of the salience/ventral attention network and reduced covariance with areas of the default mode network (DMN). During late learning, these effects reversed, with sensorimotor areas now exhibiting increased covariance with DMN areas. However, areas in posteromedial cortex showed the opposite pattern across learning phases, with its connectivity suggesting a role in coordinating activity across different networks over time. Our results establish the neural changes that support reward-based motor learning and identify distinct transitions in the functional coupling of sensorimotor to transmodal cortex when adapting behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>brain connectivity</kwd><kwd>mainfold</kwd><kwd>reaching</kwd><kwd>human</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT175012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallivan</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2017-04684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gallivan</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dimensionality reduction approaches on functional MRI data reveal that human reward-based motor learning emerges from dynamic changes in functional brain network interactions among sensorimotor, attention, and default mode networks.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organizing our behaviors so that they match the demands of a given situation depends on establishing contingencies between specific features of an action and whether they lead to the desired outcome. In many real-world tasks, this is a challenging endeavor as the brain must learn how to modify its actions based on a single measure of performance feedback that reflects overall task success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berniker and Kording, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Houk et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Wolpert et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, this feedback must be communicated to multiple discrete neural systems distributed across the cortex and striatum, many of which are topographically segregated from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck and O’Doherty, 2022</xref>). Numerous studies have shown that neural systems anchored within the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and striatum are important in evaluating whether the results of behavior are in line with expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck and O’Doherty, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Klein-Flügge et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O’Doherty et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, when discrepancies arise between the expected versus actual results of an action—termed a ‘prediction error’—this information serves as the teaching signal that can be used to update behavior directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">O’Doherty et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Samejima et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). How exactly this information is communicated in a coherent manner across the multiple, distributed neural systems that guide behavior remains poorly understood. Our study addresses this gap in our knowledge using state-of-the-art manifold learning techniques to describe how the landscape of brain activity changes during reward-guided motor learning.</p><p>Contemporary systems and cognitive neuroscience have identified many large-scale neural systems that have each been linked to different components of effective behavior. For example, areas in sensory cortex provide representations of the external environment, whereas areas in motor cortex are involved in generating the final motor commands required for action. At higher levels in the cortical hierarchy, regions within the frontoparietal system, along with those that make up the brain’s attention-orienting systems (dorsal and ventral attention systems), are important in the selection of sensory inputs and the guidance of rule-driven behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corbetta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corbetta and Shulman, 2002</xref>). Yet, how the activity of these various brain systems is coordinated during the learning process is unclear. An emerging literature suggests that this coordination may depend, in part, on functional activity in several key regions of higher-order association cortex, known collectively as the default mode network (DMN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fox and Raichle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Raichle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Initially identified through its tendency to deactivate during cognitively demanding tasks, the DMN has traditionally been implicated in largely introspective, abstract cognitive functions such as autobiographical memory and internal mentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews‐Hanna et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Christoff et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schacter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Spreng et al., 2009</xref>). In recent years, however, this characterization of DMN activity has been difficult to reconcile, with an emerging body of functional MRI (fMRI) and neurophysiological evidence showing that areas of this network are activated during demanding decision-making and working-memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foster et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Hayden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Heilbronner and Platt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vatansever et al., 2017</xref>). One hypothesis concerning this system’s function pertains to its unique topographic positioning on the cortical mantle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>): Each core region of the DMN is located in regions of association cortex that are equidistant between different primary systems; for example, posteromedial cortex, a key node of the DMN, is located precisely at the midpoint between the calcarine (visual) and central (motor) sulci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). This unique topographic location is hypothesized to allow DMN regions broad oversight over distributed brain functions, enabling them to play a role in the coordination of activity across cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with this contemporary perspective, recent work implicates several regions of the DMN in organizing different modes of behavior over time. For instance, DMN areas such as medial frontal cortex and posteromedial cortex appear to play an important role in shifting between information gathering versus information exploitation during reward-guided decision-making tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Foster et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pearson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schuck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Trudel et al., 2021</xref>)—the so-called explore/exploit trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frank et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>). Consistent with this, recent studies have argued that broad features of the DMN’s activity can be explained under the auspices that it supports behavior under conditions in which performance depends on knowledge accrued across several trials rather than by immediate sensory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hayden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vatansever et al., 2017</xref>). Extending these ideas, we recently showed that the DMN plays a role in motor adaptation, showing that connectivity between DMN regions and sensorimotor cortex is altered when normal visual-motor contingencies governing behavior are interrupted over the course of several trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gale et al., 2022</xref>). Given that the DMN is hypothesized to exert influence on functional brain activity via its topographic positioning on cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>), understanding how the DMN supports task behavior likely requires analytical techniques that allow for a characterization of whole-brain changes in functional architecture.</p><p>In the current study, we explored changes in the landscape of cortical and striatal activity during a reward-based motor task in which human participants learned to produce, through purely reinforcement feedback, a specific movement trajectory that was initially unknown to them. To characterize learning-related changes at the neural level, we leveraged advanced manifold learning approaches that provide a low-dimensional description of cortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>). This approach builds on recent electrophysiological studies in macaques, demonstrating that high-dimensional neural population activity can be described along a low-dimensional subspace or manifold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cunningham and Yu, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gallego et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Shenoy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>), reflecting covariance patterns across the entire population. This same organizational structure also appears to govern the macroscale activity of cortex, with this manifold approach having recently provided key insights into the overarching structural and functional architecture of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Paquola et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shine et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Shine et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Vázquez-Rodríguez et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we applied this manifold approach to explore how brain activity across widely distributed cortical and striatal systems is coordinated during reward-based motor learning. We were particularly interested in characterizing how connectivity between regions within the DMN and the rest of the brain changes as participants shift from learning the relationship between motor commands and reward feedback, during early learning, to subsequently using this information, during late learning. We were also interested in exploring whether learning-dependent changes in manifold structure relate to variation in subject motor performance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Prior studies examining the neural processes underlying reward-based learning have typically used tasks requiring simple motor responses, such as button presses or lever movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck and O’Doherty, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Klein-Flügge et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O’Doherty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rushworth et al., 2011</xref>). The simplicity of these motor responses is intended to isolate participants’ choice behavior by eliminating any variability related to movement execution (i.e., motor implementation of the choice) as a potential confounding factor in the learning process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">McDougle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McDougle et al., 2016</xref>). However, recent theories on learning, supported by both human and animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dhawale et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), have highlighted the crucial role of movement variability—and motor exploration in particular—as a key ingredient for effective learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Wilson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). In order to incorporate this aspect to learning, and inspired by recent work in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), we developed an MRI-compatible reward-based motor task in which human participants (N = 36) learned to shape their hand trajectories purely through reinforcement feedback.</p><p>In this task, subjects used their right finger on an MRI-compatible touchpad to trace, without visual feedback of their finger, a rightward-curved path displayed on a screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Participants began the MRI study by performing a <italic>Baseline</italic> block of 70 trials, wherein they did not receive any feedback about their performance. Following this, subjects began a separate <italic>Learning</italic> block of 200 trials in which they were told that they would now receive score feedback (from 0 to 100 points), presented at the end of each trial, based on how accurately they traced the visual path displayed on the screen. However, unbeknownst to subjects, the score they actually received was based on how well they traced a <italic>hidden</italic> mirror-image path (the ‘reward’ path, which was reflected across the vertical axis; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, because subjects received no visual feedback about their actual finger trajectory and could not see their own hand, they could only use the score feedback—and thus only reward-based learning mechanisms—to modify their movements from one trial to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). That is, subjects could not use error-based learning mechanisms to achieve learning in our study as this form of learning requires sensory errors that convey both the change in direction and magnitude needed to correct the movement.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task structure and overview of fMRI analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Subject setup in the MRI scanner.

Clearly, this subject-level clustering could impact the ability to detect task-related effects in the data.

In short, each participant’s covariance matrices were adjusted to share a common mean (equal to the overall mean covariance) to eliminate static individual differences that could potentially conceal task-related differences in functional connectivity. Since the space of covariance matrices is non-Euclidean, this adjustment cannot be achieved by simple subtraction. Instead, it requires calculating the difference between each covariance matrix and the corresponding participant mean (formally, a tangent vector) and then transporting this tangent vector to the overall grand mean to obtain a new covariance matrix that deviates from the grand mean in a comparable manner.

Next, we aligned the manifolds from each participant to a template baseline manifold, which we constructed using the mean of all baseline connectivity matrices across participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Others have argued that this tripartite structure is a fundamental feature of functional brain organization, whereby the transition from unimodal cortex (visual and somatomotor networks) to transmodal cortex (the DMN) reflects a global processing hierarchy from lower- to higher-order brain systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Huntenburg et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to characterize the relative positions of cortical and striatal brain regions along the baseline connectivity-derived manifold space, thus providing a basis to examine future changes in the positioning of these regions during early and late learning. To this aim, and following from previous methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gale et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2021a</xref>), we computed the manifold eccentricity of each region by taking its Euclidean distance from manifold centroid (coordinates (0,0,0); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This eccentricity measure provides a multivariate index of each brain region’s embedding in the three-dimensional manifold space, whereby distal regions located at the extremes of the manifold have greater eccentricity than proximal regions located near the manifold center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Under this framework, regions with higher eccentricity are interpreted as having higher functional segregation from other networks in the rest of the brain, whereas regions with lower eccentricity are interpreted as having higher integration (lower segregation) with other networks in the rest of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Valk et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, we find that our eccentricity measure strongly correlates with various graph theoretical measures of integration and segregation. For instance, we find that baseline eccentricity is positively related to cortical node strength (<italic>r</italic> = 0.88, two-tailed p&lt;0.001) and within-manifold degree z-score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.45, two-tailed p&lt;0.001), consistent with the notion that more eccentric regions are more strongly functionally coupled with other members of the same functional network (i.e., higher segregation; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Likewise, we find that baseline eccentricity is negatively related to a region’s participation coefficient (<italic>r</italic> = −0.74, two-tailed p&lt;0.001), which is a measure of a region’s degree of cross-network integration. Thus, taken together, changes in a brain region’s eccentricity can provide us with a multivariate measure of changes in that region’s functional segregation versus integration during early and late learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Changes in cortical-striatal manifold structure during learning</title><p>To examine which regions exhibited significant changes in manifold eccentricity from (1) baseline to early learning and then from (2) early to late learning, we performed two sets of paired <italic>t</italic>-tests and corrected for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate correction (FDR; q &lt; 0.05). To directly test how regional eccentricity changes at the onset of learning (when subjects begin receiving reward feedback), we performed a contrast of early &gt; baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This contrast primarily revealed a pattern of increasing eccentricity, that is, manifold expansion, across several brain regions, indicating that these regions became segregated from the rest of the brain (red areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This included areas located throughout the cortical sensorimotor system and DAN, including bilateral superior-parietal, somatomotor, supplementary motor, and premotor cortex, as well as regions in lateral visual cortex.

In contrast to this general pattern of expansion-related effects, we also found that a small subset of areas in the posterior medial cortex (PMC) and posterior angular gyrus (AG) instead exhibited a decrease in eccentricity, that is, manifold contraction (regions in blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating that these areas increased their integration with other areas of the brain.

This contrast mainly revealed a reversal in the general pattern of the effects observed in the DMN during early learning. Specifically, during late learning, several regions in bilateral MFG, MPFC, IFG, and MTC now exhibited contraction along the manifold, indicating an increased integration of these areas with other regions of the brain (this reversal can be easily observed by comparing the red areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> to the blue areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). By contrast, areas in PMC and posterior AG now exhibited expansion, indicating an increased segregation of these areas from the brain. In addition, during late learning, we observed manifold expansion in several areas of the salience/ventral attention network (SalVentAttn), including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the anterior insula (AI), as well as higher-order lateral occipital cortical areas, and areas in retrosplenial cortex and medial ventro-temporal cortex (a network-level summary of these effects can be found in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A/B</xref> spider plot). Again, as in the early &gt; baseline contrast, we did not observe any significant changes in striatal regions from early to late learning. The only region that came close to reaching statistical significance in the striatum was the right pallidum (p=0.01), but this region did not pass whole-brain FDR correction (corrected alpha = 0.086; note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> shows the unthresholded maps for this contrast to demonstrate the strong reversal in the pattern of effects during late learning, as well as indicate any trends).</p><p>Finally, for completeness, we also examined the contrast of late &gt; baseline, which solely revealed a pattern of cortical expansion across several regions—in particular in areas of the SalVentAttn and visual network (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates a continuing expansion (and segregation) of these regions as learning progresses.</p><p>Taken together, the above pattern of results suggests that, during early learning, transmodal areas of the DMN, as well as several areas of the sensorimotor system (including areas of the DAN), begin to segregate from other brain networks, whereas a subset of areas—the PMC and posterior AG in particular—begin to integrate with regions outside of their respective networks. By contrast, during late learning, there is a clear reversal in these patterns, with regions within the DMN and DAN beginning to integrate with areas belonging to other brain networks. In the next section, we directly examine these interpretations of manifold expansion and contraction during early and late learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Changes in connectivity that underlie patterns of manifold reconfiguration</title><p>Given that eccentricity provides a multivariate index of a region’s overall profile of connectivity (i.e., its relative positioning on the manifold), we next performed seed connectivity analyses to further characterize the patterns of effects that underlie the expansions and contractions of manifold structure during learning.

By contrast, during late learning, we observed a reversal in this pattern of connectivity changes, with the MPFC now exhibiting increased connectivity with the same regions of the DAN but reduced connectivity with other DMN areas. Together, these results suggest that the manifold expansion of the MPFC during early learning arises from its increased connectivity with other DMN areas (i.e., segregation of the DMN), whereas the manifold contraction of this region during late learning arises from its increased connectivity with areas <italic>outside</italic> of the DMN, such as sensorimotor areas of the DAN.</p><p>Notably, for the left PMd seed region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), associated with the DAN, we observed an inverse pattern of results from that observed for the MPFC region above. Specifically, during early learning, we observed increased connectivity of the left PMd with other areas of the DAN, as well as areas belonging to the SalVentAttn network, such as the anterior insula/IFG, dACC, and inferior parietal cortex. Notably, this was coupled with its decreased connectivity to DMN areas and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). By contrast, during late learning, we observed a reversal in this pattern of effects, whereby connectivity with DMN areas and the hippocampus now increased, whereas connectivity with the DAN and SalVentAttn areas decreased. In this case, the pattern of manifold expansion and contraction of PMd during early and late learning, respectively, likely arises from its increased connectivity with attention networks in brain (the DAN and SalVentAttn) during early learning and an increase in between-network connectivity (i.e., integration) with DMN areas during late learning.</p><p>Finally, for the left PMC seed region, located at the border of the DMN-A and Control-C networks—and that was one of the few regions that exhibited <italic>contraction</italic> during early learning—we found that this region exhibited decreased connectivity during early learning with other DMN-A and Control-C subregions in bilateral PMC, as well as decreased connectivity with bilateral hippocampus and MPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Instead, this PMC region exhibited increased connectivity with DAN areas in superior parietal cortex and premotor cortex, and most prominently, with areas in the anterior insula/IFG, dACC, and inferior parietal cortex (belonging to the SalVentAttn networks). By contrast, during late learning, we again observed a reversal in this pattern of connectivity changes, with the PMC seed region now exhibiting increased connectivity with other bilateral PMC areas, MPFC and the hippocampus, as well as reduced connectivity with the same DAN and SalVentAttn areas. Together, these results suggest that manifold contractions of the PMC during early learning arise from its increased integration with regions outside of the DMN-A and Control-C networks, such as the DAN and SalVentAttn, whereas the manifold expansions of this region during late learning arise from its increased within-network connectivity with other DMN and Control areas (i.e., segregation).</p><p>Taken together, the results of our seed connectivity analyses above are broadly consistent with our interpretation of the patterns of manifold expansion as reflecting increases in <italic>within</italic>-network connectivity (segregation) and the patterns of manifold contraction as reflecting increases in <italic>between</italic>-network connectivity (integration). More generally, however, these findings point to changes in the landscape of communication between regions of the DAN, SalVentAttn, and DMN in particular, as being associated with reward-based motor learning. Specifically, we find that, during early learning, there is increased functional coupling between several sensorimotor areas of the DAN with areas of the SalVentAttn network, whereas during late learning, these DAN sensorimotor areas switch their connectivity to DMN areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Changes in eccentricity relate to learning performance</title><p>In the previous sections, we characterized the patterns of mean changes in manifold structure during learning across all participants. However, it is well established that subjects exhibit significant variation in motor learning ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">de Brouwer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">de Brouwer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Standage et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, while the learning curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that subjects, on average, improved their scores during the task, this group-level result obscures the fact that individuals differed greatly in their rates of learning (see individual subject learning curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To emphasize this fact, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> highlights the learning curves for two example subjects: an individual who learned the hidden shape quite rapidly (a ‘fast learner’ in green) and a second individual who only gradually learned to trace the hidden shape (a ‘slow learner’ in red). To quantify this variation in subject performance in a manner that accounted the auto-correlation in learning performance over time (i.e., subjects who learned more quickly tend to exhibit better performance by the end of learning), we opted for a pure data-driven approach and performed functional principal component analysis (fPCA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shang, 2014</xref>) on subjects’ learning curves. This approach allowed us to isolate the dominant patterns of variability in subject’s learning curves over time (see ‘Materials and methods’ for further details; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Areshenkoff et al., 2022</xref>). Using this fPCA approach, we found that a single component—encoding overall learning—captured the majority (~75%) of the variability in subjects’ learning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We thus used each subjects’ loading on this dominant component as a single scalar measure of subjects’ overall learning performance: Individuals who tended to learn the task more quickly had higher values on this ‘learning score’ component, whereas individuals who tended to learn the task more slowly had lower values on this component (see single data points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> at the right).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Individual differences in subject learning performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Examples of a good learner (bordered in green) and poor learner (bordered in red).

This analysis did not reveal any brain regions that survived FDR corrections for multiple comparisons (q &lt; 0.05). However, the FDR approach is completely agnostic to any topographical patterns of effects across brain areas, which may correspond with known functional networks. Indeed, the full cortex and striatal correlation map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates that many region-level correlations exhibit a high degree of spatial contiguity, with many statistically significant regions (at p&lt;0.05, bordered in black) being situated within much larger clusters of regions that exhibit a similar pattern of effects (i.e., areas in blue, denoting a negative correlation between learning score versus the change in eccentricity from baseline to early learning, tend to lie adjacent to other regions exhibiting a similar negative correlation). This is because topographically adjacent regions are likely to have similar connectivity profiles, and thus project onto similar locations along the manifold, resulting in similar brain–behavior relationships. This spatial topography suggests that the association between the eccentricity of certain brain regions and learning performance are likely to be better characterized at the level of distributed functional networks.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Relationship between learning performance and regional changes in eccentricity.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Whole-brain correlation map between subject learning score and the change in regional eccentricity from baseline to early learning (<bold>A</bold>) and early to late learning (<bold>B</bold>).

(Note that in the spin-test procedure, due to the sign of the correlations, it is possible for some networks to be significantly different from the null distribution, and yet not significantly different from zero.

Right, scatterplots show the relationships between subject learning score and the change in eccentricity from baseline to early learning (top) and early to late learning (bottom) for the DAN-A network (depicted in yellow on the cortical surface at top), the only brain network to satisfy the two constraints of our statistical testing procedure.

We then correlated the change in each brain network’s eccentricity across epochs with subject learning scores. We tested the statistical significance of these network-level correlations by building null models that account for the spatial autocorrelation in the brain maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Markello et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Váša et al., 2018</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’) and corrected for multiple comparisons (across all networks) using an FDR correction (q &lt; 0.05). Using this permutation testing approach, we found that it was only the change in eccentricity of the DAN-A network that correlated with learning score (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), such that the more the DAN-A network <italic>decreased</italic> in eccentricity from baseline to early learning (i.e., contracted along the manifold), the better subjects performed at the task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, scatterplot at the right). Consistent with the notion that changes in the eccentricity of the DAN-A network are linked to learning performance, we also found the inverse pattern of effects during late learning, whereby the more that this same network <italic>increased</italic> in eccentricity from early to late learning (i.e., expanded along the manifold), the better subjects performed at the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). We should note that this pattern of performance effects for the DAN-A—that is, greater contraction during early learning and greater expansion during late learning being associated with better learning—appears at odds with the group-level effects described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, where we generally find the opposite pattern for the entire DAN network (composed of the DAN-A and DAN-B subnetworks). However, this potential discrepancy can be explained when examining the changes in eccentricity using the 17-network parcellation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). At this higher resolution level, we find that these group-level effects for the entire DAN network are being largely driven by eccentricity changes in the DAN-B network (areas in anterior superior parietal cortex and premotor cortex), and not by mean changes in the DAN-A network. By contrast, our present results suggest that it is the contraction and expansion of areas of the DAN-A network (and not DAN-B network) that are selectively associated with subject learning performance.</p><p>To understand the global changes in connectivity that underlie these network eccentricity effects, we performed a network-level seed connectivity analyses (analogous to our single ROI seed connectivity analyses in the previous section) wherein constructed contrast maps, using the DAN-A as the seed network, for both the early vs. baseline epochs (early &gt; baseline) and the late vs. early epochs (late &gt; early). As before, we display the unthresholded voxel-wise contrast maps, along with corresponding spider plots depicting the network-level changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), to allow for a complete visualization of the collective changes in network-level connectivity that underlie the changes in eccentricity of the DAN-A. As can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, we find that, during early learning, DAN-A regions exhibited the largest increases in connectivity with one of the SalVentAttn subnetworks (SalVentAttn-B), whereas, during late learning, the DAN-A regions exhibited the largest increases in connectivity with one of the DMN subnetworks (DMN-B). These findings not only re-constitute the group-level effects reported above at the ROI level (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), but they also suggest that this general transition in functional coupling—between the DAN and SalVentAttn areas during early learning, to DAN and DMN areas during late learning—is associated with differences in subject performance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Complex behavior necessitates the coordinated activity of multiple specialized neural systems distributed across cortex and striatum. During motor learning, these systems must adapt their functional interactions to ensure appropriate behavior in response to changes in sensory feedback. While much research in motor learning has focused on understanding the role of sensorimotor cortex in isolation, our understanding of the contribution of higher-order brain systems, which play a role in the organization of behavior over time, remains incomplete. In the current study, we utilized state-of-the-art analytical methods that reconcile topographic and functional brain organization, enabling us to describe the changes in the landscape of cortical and striatal activity during learning.</p><p>During early learning, when subjects were establishing the relationship between motor commands and reward feedback, we found that regions within both the DAN (e.g., premotor cortex) and DMN (e.g., MPFC) exhibited expansion along the manifold. Our connectivity analyses revealed that this expansion was largely driven by an increase in within-network communication in both the DAN and DMN networks. There were, however, two notable exceptions to this general pattern. First, we found that connectivity between regions of the DAN increased with regions in the SalVentAttn network (e.g., anterior insula/IFG and anterior cingulate cortex). Second, areas within the PMC, part of the posterior core of the DMN, showed a pattern of manifold contraction that was primarily driven by a decrease in covariance with other DMN regions and an increase in covariance with regions of the superior DAN and also with several regions within the SalVentAttn network. Together, these results suggest that functional interactions of the sensorimotor system with the SalVentAttn network are important during initial learning. In other work, areas within the SalVentAttn network have been implicated in several aspects of cognitive control and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Botvinick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Holroyd and Yeung, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Shenhav et al., 2014</xref>), and in studies on reward-based decision-making, these regions are thought to support exploratory behavior. For instance, several neuroimaging studies have shown that SalVentAttn areas are activated in response to novel or salient stimuli in the environment, presumably reflecting the engagement of attentional resources for sampling new information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Corbetta et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Badre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blanchard and Gershman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Daw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hogeveen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Kolling et al., 2016</xref>) implicates several SalVentAttn areas in information gathering functions, so as to optimize reward outcomes. This neural perspective is consistent with both others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dam et al., 2013</xref>) and our own behavioral findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">de Brouwer et al., 2022</xref>) that, during the early phases of reward-guided learning, performance is more variable, presumably as individuals explore the relationship between motor commands and associated sensory feedback.</p><p>During late learning, we observed that many of the changes in manifold architecture observed during early learning reversed. For instance, areas within both the DAN and DMN now exhibited contraction along the manifold, whereas the PMC now exhibited expansion. Connectivity analyses showed that the contraction within the DAN and DMN was driven by increases in connectivity between these two networks—specifically, increases between premotor and superior parietal areas of the DAN with areas of the DMN. This suggests that once the mapping between motor commands and reward feedback have been learned, regions within the DAN and DMN become more integrated with one another. In the context of the current task, the shift in DAN connectivity from the SalVentAttn network during early learning to the DMN during late learning may reflect the hypothesized role of the DMN in supporting behavior using information from memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schacter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>). This interpretation is consistent with prior work showing that connectivity between the DMN and premotor cortex tends to increase once rules have been learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Shamloo and Helie, 2016</xref>), as well as studies from other task domains showing that the DMN contributes to behavior when actions must be guided by information from memory and a knowledge of task structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Murphy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vatansever et al., 2017</xref>). Our analysis, therefore, provides additional evidence, albeit from the domain of human motor learning, that functional interactions between the DMN and brain regions involved in sensorimotor processes support a mode of action in which behavior must be guided by memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Smallwood et al., 2021</xref>)—in this case, the history of reward information accrued across previous movement trajectories. Finally, it is important to note that the reversal pattern of effects noted above suggests that our findings during learning cannot be simply attributed to the introduction of reward feedback and/or the perturbation during early learning, as both of these task-related features are also present during late learning. In addition, these results cannot be simply explained due to the passage of time or increasing subject fatigue as this would predict a consistent directional change in eccentricity across the baseline, early, and Late learning epochs.</p><p>We also observed a relationship between changes in the manifold eccentricity of a subnetwork of the DAN (DAN-A) with subject learning performance. We found that the more this subnetwork contracted, and then subsequently expanded, along the manifold during early and late learning, respectively, the better subjects performed at the task. Our connectivity analysis revealed that this change in DAN-A activity was mainly driven by increases in connectivity with SalVentAttn subnetworks during early learning and by increases in connectivity with DMN subnetworks during late learning. Notably, areas of the DAN are not thought to generate top-down signals for response selection but instead transform the input signals they receive (e.g., related to reward, memory) into motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Luo et al., 2010</xref>). Our analysis thus suggests that this system’s contribution to motor behavior may be facilitated through changes in its functional coupling to both the SalVentAttn and DMN over time. To speculate, this shift in functional coupling may reflect a shift from more exploratory to more exploitative modes of behavior across early to late periods of motor learning, respectively. It is also possible that some of these task-related shifts in connectivity relate to shifts in task-general processes, such as changes in the allocation of attentional resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bédard and Song, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>) or overall cognitive engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aben et al., 2020</xref>), which themselves play critical roles in shaping learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Codol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Holland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Song, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Taylor and Thoroughman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Taylor and Thoroughman, 2007</xref>; for a review of these topics, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tsay et al., 2023</xref>). Such processes are particularly important during the earlier phases of learning when sensorimotor contingencies need to be established. While these remain questions for future work, our data nevertheless suggest that this shift in connectivity may be enabled through the PMC.</p><p>Although traditionally considered a member of the DMN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Thomas Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), studies have established that the PMC contains echoes of neural signals originating from across the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Leech et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, this region initially became more segregated from the rest of the DMN and increased connectivity with the SalVentAttn network during early learning. However, during late learning, the PMC reduced its connectivity with the SalVentAttn network and became more integrated with other members of the DMN. This pattern of changes differed from other areas of the DMN, indicating that the PMC may serve a different function during motor learning than other areas of this system. Prior studies have linked the activity of PMC areas to reward processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Knutson and Bossaerts, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McCoy and Platt, 2005</xref>) and the selection of response strategies that attempt to optimize reward outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Wan et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with this, recent research shows that areas within the PMC are able to integrate information over particularly long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hasson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Heilbronner and Platt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lerner et al., 2011</xref>). This characteristic positions the PMC as an ideal candidate region to orchestrate the neural transition from (1) exploring the relationship between motor commands and sensory feedback during early learning to (2) subsequently exploiting this learned relationship during late learning. Taken together, these distinctive functional properties of PMC activity, coupled with its diverse patterns of whole-brain connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Hagmann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Hutchison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Margulies et al., 2009</xref>), suggest an important role for this region in directing long-term behavioral adaptation in accordance with higher-order task objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Braga et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pearson et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While we identified several changes in the cortical manifold that are associated with reward-based motor learning, it is noteworthy that we did not observe any significant changes in manifold eccentricity within the striatum. While clearly the evidence indicates that this region plays a key role in reward-guided behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Averbeck and O’Doherty, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">O’Doherty et al., 2017</xref>), there are several possible reasons why our manifold approach did not identify this collection of brain areas. First, the relatively small size of the striatum may mean that our analysis approach was too coarse to identify changes in the connectivity of this region. Though we used a 3T scanner and employed a widely used parcellation scheme that divided the striatum into its constituent anatomical regions (e.g., hippocampus, caudate), both of these approaches may have obscured important differences in connectivity that exist <italic>within</italic> each of these regions. For example, areas such the hippocampus and caudate are not homogeneous areas but themselves exhibit gradients of connectivity (e.g., head versus tail) that can only be revealed at the voxel level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tian et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Vos de Wael et al., 2021</xref>). Second, while our dimension reduction approach, by design, aims to identify gradients of functional connectivity that account for the largest amounts of variance, the limited number of striatal regions (compared to cortex) necessitates that their contribution to the total whole-brain variance is relatively small. Consistent with this perspective, we found that the low-dimensional manifold architecture in cortex did not strongly depend on whether or not striatal regions were included in the analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). As such, selective changes in the patterns of functional connectivity at the level of the striatum may be obscured using our cortex × striatum dimension reduction approach. Future work can help address some of these limitations by using both finer parcellations of striatal cortex (perhaps even down to the voxel level) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tian et al., 2020</xref>) and by focusing specifically on the changes in the interactions <italic>between</italic> the striatum and cortex during learning. The latter can be accomplished by selectively performing dimension reduction on the slice of the functional connectivity matrix that corresponds to functional coupling between striatum and cortex.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study set out to characterize changes in the landscape of brain activity that underlies reward-based motor learning. We used dimensionality reduction techniques to build a manifold that describes changes in the functional organization of the cortex and striatum during different phases of learning. During early learning, we found that regions within the DAN and DMN became relatively segregated from each other, with the DAN becoming more integrated with the SalVentAttn network. This pattern reversed during later learning, with regions within the DAN now becoming more integrated with the DMN. Notably, regions of the PMC, within the posterior core of the DMN, showed the reverse pattern, exhibiting coupling with the SalVentAttn early during learning and with other regions of the DMN later during learning. Together, these findings provide a unique cortical perspective into the neural changes that underlie reward-based motor learning and point to marked transitions in the activity of transmodal cortical regions in organizing behavior over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty-six right-handed individuals (27 females, aged 18–28 years) participated in the MRI study.

The Queen’s University Research Ethics Board approved the study (ethics approval number: CNS-019-16), and it was conducted in coherence to the principles outlined in the Canadian Tri-Council Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (1964).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Prior to MRI testing, participants first took part in an MRI training session inside a mock (0T) scanner, made to look and sound like a real MRI scanner. This training session served multiple purposes. First, it introduced participants to the key features of the motor task that was subsequently performed in the MRI scanner. Second, it allowed us to screen for subjects who could obtain baseline performance levels on the task. Third, it allowed us to screen for subjects who could remain still for a long period of time without feeling claustrophobic. With respect to the latter, we monitored subjects’ head movement in the mock scanner while they performed practice task trials and during simulated anatomical scans. This monitoring was done by attaching, via medical tape, a Polhemus sensor to each subject’s forehead (Polhemus, Colchester, Vermont), which allowed a real-time read-out of subject head displacement in each of the three axes of translation and rotation (six dimensions total). Whenever subjects’ head translation and/or rotation reached 0.5 mm or 0.5° rotation (within a prespecified velocity criterion), subjects received an unpleasant auditory tone, delivered through a speaker system located near the head. All subjects learned to constrain their head movement via this auditory feedback. Following this first training session, subjects who met our criteria were invited to subsequently participate in the reward-based motor learning task (see below for details), approximately 1 week later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Apparatus</title><p>During testing in the mock (0T) scanner, subjects performed hand movements that were directed toward a target by applying fingertip pressure on a digitizing touchscreen tablet (Wacom Intuos Pro M tablet). During the actual MRI testing sessions, subjects used an MRI-compatible digitizing tablet (Hybridmojo LLC, CA). In both the mock and real MRI scanner, the visual stimuli were rear-projected with an LCD projector (NEC LT265 DLP projector, 1024 × 768 resolution, 60 Hz refresh rate) onto a screen mounted behind the participant. The stimuli on the screen were viewed through a mirror fixated on the MRI coil directly above the participants’ eyes, thus preventing the participant from being able to see their hand.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Reward-based motor learning task</title><p>In the motor task, participants were trained, through reward-based feedback, to produce finger movement trajectories for an unseen shape. Specifically, subjects were instructed to repeatedly trace, without visual feedback of their actual finger paths, a subtly curved path displayed on the screen (the visible path, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Participants were told that, following each trial, they would receive a score based on how ‘accurately’ they traced the visible path. However, unbeknownst to them, they actually received points based on how well they traced the mirror-image path (the reward path, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Critically, because participants received no visual feedback about their actual finger trajectories or the ‘rewarded’ shape, they could not use error-based learning mechanisms to guide learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>). This task was a modification on the motor tasks developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Wu et al., 2014</xref>.</p><p>Each trial started with the participant moving a cursor (3 mm radius cyan circle), which represented their finger position, into the start position (4 mm radius white circle) at the bottom of the screen (by sliding the index finger on the tablet). The cursor was only visible when it was within 30 mm of the start position. After the cursor was held within the start position for 0.5 s, the cursor disappeared and a rightward-curved path (visible path) and a movement distance marker appeared on the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The movement distance marker was a horizontal red line (30 × 1 mm) that appeared 60 mm above the start position. The visible path connected the start position and movement distance marker, and had the shape of a half sine wave with an amplitude of 0.15 times the marker distance. Participants were instructed to trace the curved path. When the cursor reached the target distance, the target changed color from red to green to indicate that the trial was completed. Importantly, other than this color change in the distance marker, the visible curved path remained constant and participants never received any feedback about the position of their cursor.</p><p>In the baseline block, participants did not receive any feedback about their performance. In the learning block, participants were rewarded 0–100 points after reaching the movement distance marker, and were instructed to do their best to maximize this score across trials (following the movement, the points were displayed as text centrally on the screen). Each trial was terminated after 4.5 s, independent of whether the cursor had reached the target. After a delay of 1.5 s (during which the screen was blanked), allowing time to save the data and the subject to return to the starting location, the next trial started with the presentation of the start position.</p><p>To calculate the reward score on each trial in the learning block, the <italic>x</italic> position of the cursor was interpolated at each cm displacement from the start position in the <italic>y</italic> direction (i.e., at exactly 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 mm). For each of the six <italic>y</italic> positions, the absolute distance between the interpolated <italic>x</italic> position of the cursor and the <italic>x</italic> position of the rewarded path was calculated. The sum of these errors was scaled by dividing it by the sum of errors obtained for a half cycle sine-shaped path with an amplitude of 0.5 times the target distance, and then multiplied by 100 to obtain a score ranging between 0 and 100. The scaling worked out such that a perfectly traced visible path would result in an imperfect score of 40 points. This scaling was chosen on the basis of extensive pilot testing in order to (1) encourage motor exploration across trials (in search of higher scores), (2) achieve variation across subjects in overall performance (i.e., individual differences in learning curves), and (3) ensure that subjects still received informative score feedback when tracing in the vicinity of the visible trajectory.</p><p>During the training session in the mock MRI scanner (i.e., ~1 week prior to the MRI testing session), participants performed only a practice block in which they traced a straight line, first with (40 trials) and then without (40 trials), visual feedback of the position of the cursor during the movement (80 trials total). This training session exposed participants to several key features of the task (e.g., use of the touchscreen tablet, trial timing, removal of cursor feedback) and allowed us to establish adequate performance levels. Importantly, however, subjects did not encounter any reward-based feedback (reward scores) during this initial training session.</p><p>At the beginning of the MRI testing session, but prior to the first scan being collected, participants re-acquainted themselves with the motor task by first performing a practice block in which they traced a straight line with (40 trials) and then without (40 trials) visual feedback of the position of the cursor. Next, we collected an anatomical scan, followed by a DTI scan, followed by a resting-state fMRI scan. During the latter resting-state scan, participants were instructed to rest with their eyes open while fixating on a central cross location presented on the screen. (Note that the DTI and resting-state fMRI data are not the focus on the present study.) Next, participants performed the motor task, which consisted of two separate experimental runs without visual feedback of the cursor: (1) a baseline block of 70 trials in which they attempted to trace the curved path and no score feedback was provided, and (2) a separate learning block of 200 trials in which participants were instructed to maximize their score shown at the end of each trial. Note that, at the end of testing, we did not assess participants’ awareness of the manipulation (i.e., that they were, in fact, being rewarded based on a mirror image path of the visible path). This experiment was only performed once.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Behavioral data analysis</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Data preprocessing</title><p>Each movement trajectory was first re-sampled to 10 equally spaced points along the y (vertical) axis, between the starting position and the target distance marker. We defined subjects’ reaction time (RT) as the time between trial onset and the cursor reaching 10% of the distance from the starting location, and defined subjects’ movement time (MT) as the remaining time until reaching the target distance marker. To quantify the variability of the drawn path as a function of trial number, we used the following method. First, we calculated the average path at each trial by applying a moving average smoother (window size seven trials) to the sequence of paths drawn by each participant. Then, for each trial, path variability was measured by the mean absolute <italic>x</italic> position difference between the actual path drawn and the average path in that trial (across the 10 sample points equally spaced along the <italic>y</italic> direction). Specifically, path variability was quantified in the following manner:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Path trial <italic>t</italic>: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> (<italic>k</italic> = 1, 2, …, 10, i.e., 10 sample points)</p></list-item><list-item><p>For each <italic>t</italic>, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>7</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo stretchy="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (sliding window mean, half window width 3)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Variability of path in trial <italic>t</italic>: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo stretchy="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced open="|" close="|" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula></p></list-item></list><p>Trials in which the cursor did not reach the target within the time limit were excluded from the offline analysis of hand movements (~1% of trials).

We then applied a conservative threshold on the MT and RT, removing the top 0.05% of trials across all subjects. As the motor task did not involve response discrimination, we did not set a lower threshold on these variables.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Functional PCA of subject behavioral data</title><p>All subject behavioral data were averaged over eight trial bins.

Subject anatomicals were acquired using a 32-channel head coil and a T1-weighted ADNI MPRAGE sequence (TR = 1760 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, field of view = 192 mm × 240 mm × 256 mm, matrix size = 192 × 240 × 256, flip angle = 9°, 1 mm isotropic voxels). This was followed by a series of diffusion-weighted scans and a resting-state scan (which are not the focus of the present investigation). Next, we acquired fMRI volumes using a T2*-weighted single-shot gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) acquisition sequence (time to repetition [TR] = 2000 ms, slice thickness = 4 mm, in-plane resolution = 3 mm × 3 mm, time to echo [TE] = 30 ms, field of view = 240 mm × 240 mm, matrix size = 80 × 80, flip angle = 90°, and acceleration factor [integrated parallel acquisition technologies, iPAT] = 2 with generalized auto-calibrating partially parallel acquisitions [GRAPPA] reconstruction). Each volume comprised 34 contiguous (no gap) oblique slices acquired at an ~30° caudal tilt with respect to the plane of the anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC), providing whole-brain coverage of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Note that for the current study we did not examine the changes in cerebellar activity during learning. For the baseline and learning scans, we acquired 222 and 612 imaging volumes, respectively. Each of these task-related scans included an additional six imaging volumes at both the beginning and end of the scan. On average, the total MRI scanning session lasted ~2 hrs (including setup time and image acquisition).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>fMRI preprocessing</title><p>Preprocessing of anatomical and functional MRI data was performed using fMRIPrep 20.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Esteban et al., 2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Esteban et al., 2024</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_016216">SCR_016216</ext-link>) which is based on Nipype 1.5.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Gorgolewski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gorgolewski et al., 2018</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002502">SCR_002502</ext-link>).

For more details of the pipeline, see the section corresponding to workflows in fMRIPrep’s documentation. Below we provide a condensed description of the preprocessing steps.</p><p>T1w images were corrected for intensity non-uniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Tustison et al., 2010</xref>), distributed with ANTs 2.2.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Avants et al., 2008</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_004757">SCR_004757</ext-link>). The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white matter (WM), and gray matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002823">SCR_002823</ext-link>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). A T1w-reference map was computed after registration of the T1w images (after INU-correction) using mri_robust_template (FreeSurfer 6.0.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Reuter et al., 2010</xref>).

Volume-based spatial normalization to standard space (MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.2.0), using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.</p><p>For each BOLD run, the following preprocessing was performed. First, a reference volume and its skull-stripped version were generated using a custom methodology of fMRIPrep. Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference (transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using mcflirt (FSL 5.0.9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Jenkinson et al., 2002</xref>). BOLD runs were slice-time corrected using 3dTshift from AFNI 20160207 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cox and Hyde, 1997</xref>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_005927">SCR_005927</ext-link>). The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using bbregister (FreeSurfer) which implements boundary-based registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Greve and Fischl, 2009</xref>). Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom. The BOLD time series were resampled with a single interpolation step by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion transform matrices, and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces). BOLD time series were resampled onto their original, native space, as well as standard space (MNI152NLin6Asym), using antsApplyTransforms (ANTs), configured with Lanczos interpolation to minimize the smoothing effects of other kernels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lanczos, 1964</xref>). Striatal data in standard space was combined with resampled BOLD time series on the fsaverage surface to produce Grayordinates files (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>) containing 91k samples, using fsaverage as the intermediate standardized surface space. Resampling onto fsaverage was performed using mri_vol2surf (FreeSurfer).</p><p>A set of 34 motion and physiological regressors were extracted in order to mitigate the impact of head motion and physiological noise. The six head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were expanded to include temporal derivatives and quadratic terms of each of the original and derivative regressors, totaling 24 head-motion parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Satterthwaite et al., 2013</xref>).

Region time series were denoised using the above-mentioned confound regressors in conjunction with the discrete cosine regressors (128 s cut-off for high-pass filtering) produced from fMRIprep and low-pass filtering using a Butterworth filter (100 s cut-off) implemented in Nilearn.

This allowed us to estimate functional connectivity from continuous brain activity over the corresponding 70 trials for each epoch; Baseline comprised of the initial 70 trials in which subjects performed the motor task in the absence of any reward feedback, whereas the early and late learning epochs consisted of the first and last 70 trials after the onset of reward feedback, respectively. Then, we separately estimated functional connectivity matrices for each epoch by computing the region-wise covariance matrices using the Ledoit–Wolf estimator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ledoit and Wolf, 2004</xref>). Note that our use of equal-length epochs for the three phases ensured that no biases in covariance estimation were introduced due to differences in time-series length.</p><p>Next, we centered the connectivity matrices using the approach advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>, which leverages the natural geometry of the space of covariance matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Areshenkoff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Areshenkoff et al., 2021</xref>).

First, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gale et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Vos de Wael et al., 2020</xref>), we applied row-wise thresholding to retain the top 10% connections in each row, and then computed cosine similarity between each row to produce an affinity matrix that describes the similarity of each region’s connectivity profiles. Second, we applied PCA to obtain a set of PCs that provide a low-dimensional representation of connectivity structure (i.e., connectivity gradients). We selected PCA as our dimension reduction technique based on recent work demonstrating the improved reliability of PCA over nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., diffusion map embedding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hong et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To provide a basis for comparing changes in functional network architecture that arise during learning specifically, we constructed a template manifold using the same aforementioned manifold construction procedures from a group-average baseline connectivity matrix that was derived from the geometric mean (across participants) of all centered baseline connectivity matrices. We aligned all individual manifolds (36 participants × 3 epochs; 108 total) to this baseline template manifold using Procrustes alignment. All analyses on the aligned manifolds were performed using the top three PCs, which cumulatively explained ~70% of the total variance in the template manifold. Across participants and epochs, the top three PCs, following Procrustes alignment, had an average correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.88 with their respective PCs in the template manifold, thus demonstrating good overall reliability and alignment across participants and epochs. Together, this approach enabled us to uniquely examine the learning-related changes in manifold structure (during early and late learning), and specifically how these deviate from the baseline task functional architecture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Manifold eccentricity and analyses</title><p>Recent work has quantified the embedding of regions and networks in low-dimensional spaces using Euclidean distance as a measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bethlehem et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Valk et al., 2023</xref>). ‘Eccentricity’ refers to the Euclidean distance between a single region and the manifold centroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2021a</xref>), which, in the case of PCA, is equivalent to a region’s magnitude, or vector length. Note that eccentricity provides a scalar index of network integration and segregation, in which distal regions with greater eccentricity are more segregated than proximal regions that integrate more broadly across functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Park et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Park et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Valk et al., 2023</xref>). To validate this interpretation with our own data, we correlated the baseline template manifold eccentricity with three graph theoretical measures of functional integration and segregation. These measures were calculated on the row-wise thresholded template connectivity matrix and included <italic>node strength</italic>, which is the sum of a region’s connectivity weights; <italic>within-module degree z-score</italic>, which measures the degree centrality of a region within its respective network; and <italic>participation coefficien</italic>t, which measures the network diversity of a region’s connectivity distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). Regions were assigned to their respective intrinsic functional networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Thomas Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) for calculations of within-module degree z-score and participation coefficient.</p><p>We computed eccentricity for each brain region for all individual manifolds (each participant and epoch). This allowed us to observe manifold expansions (increases in eccentricity) and contractions (decreases in eccentricity) throughout early and late learning, thereby probing learning-related changes in functional segregation and integration (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We compared region eccentricity between the baseline, early, and late learning epochs by performing a series of region-wise paired <italic>t</italic>-tests between these three key epochs. We applied FDR correction (q &lt; 0.05) across regions for each contrast.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-4"><title>Seed connectivity analyses</title><p>In order to understand the underlying changes in regional covariance that ultimately give rise to the observed changes in manifold eccentricity, we performed seed connectivity contrasts between the different task epochs. To this end, we selected several seed regions that were statistically significant in the early learning &gt; baseline contrast, which included areas in the left MPFC, left premotor cortex (PMd), and left PMC, thereby allowing us to characterize some of the cortical and striatal changes that are associated reward-based learning. For completeness, we also selected homologous regions in the right hemisphere (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). For each seed region, we generated functional connectivity maps for the epochs of interest in every participant and computed region-wise paired <italic>t</italic>-tests for both the early &gt; baseline and late &gt; early contrasts. For all contrasts, we opted to show the unthresholded <italic>t</italic>-maps so as to visualize the complete multivariate pattern of connectivity changes that drive changes in eccentricity (a multivariate measure). In addition, we constructed spider plots further characterizing these changes at the network level by averaging the <italic>t</italic>-values across individual regions according to their network assignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Thomas Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). Note that these analyses are mainly intended to provide characterization (and interpretation) of the connectivity changes of representative regions from our main eccentricity analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-5"><title>Behavioral correlation analyses</title><p>To investigate the relationship between changes in manifold structure and individual differences in learning performance, we computed a correlation, across participants, between learning score and each region’s change in eccentricity from baseline to early learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) and from early to late learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This produced two correlation maps, one for each contrast. We found that the spatial specificity of significant regions in these correlation maps overlapped substantially with the dorsal attention A (DAN-A) network, from the 17-network Schaefer 1000 assignments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>). This was determined by evaluating the mean correlation (across regions) for each of the 17-network assignments against a null distribution generated by projecting each brain region’s correlation onto their respective Schaefer 1000 parcels on the 32k fsLR spherical mesh and performing 1000 iterations of the Váša spin-testing permutation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Markello et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Váša et al., 2018</xref>). This allowed us to generate, for each brain network and pairwise comparison (baseline to early learning and early to late learning), a topographical distribution of correlations that could be expected simply due to chance from spatial autocorrelations in the brain maps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). We then empirically assessed the statistical significance of our real correlation values against this spatial null distribution for each brain network. Because the spin-testing procedure assesses only the probability of having observed a given correlation value, and not whether that correlation value itself differs from zero, we incorporated the additional stipulation that an effect would be deemed significant only if the real correlation value was also statistically different from zero (at p&lt;0.05).</p><p>To explore the underlying changes in functional connectivity that give way to these brain–behavior correlations, we performed seed connectivity contrasts, using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests on the 17-network parcellation, between the different task epochs (early &gt; baseline and late &gt; early). As with the ‘Seed connectivity analyses’ section above, we opted to show the unthresholded <italic>t</italic>-maps so as to visualize the complete multivariate pattern of connectivity that underlies the brain–behavior correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Together, these complementary approaches enabled us to explore how individual differences in performance relate to changes in manifold structure at the region- and network levels.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>is an employee of Voxel AI Inc.

During early learning, the authors found increased covariance between the sensorimotor and dorsal attention networks, coupled with reduced covariance between the sensorimotor and default mode networks. During late learning, they observed the opposite pattern. It remains to be seen whether these changes reflect generic changes in task engagement during learning or are specific to reward-based motor learning.

The concept of quantifying connectivity through changes in extraction and contraction across lower-dimensional manifolds is both novel and interesting and the presented results are clear and well-presented. Overall, the manuscript is a valuable addition to the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This manuscript is written in a clear and comprehensible way. It introduces a rather novel technique of assessing connectivity across lower-dimensional manifold which has hitherto not been applied in this way to the question of reward-based motor learning. Thus, this presents a unique viewpoint on understanding how the brain changes with motor learning. I particularly enjoyed the combination of connectivity-based, followed by further scrutiny of seed-based connectivity analyses, thus providing a more comprehensive viewpoint. Now it also has added a more comprehensive report on the behavioural changes of learning, and the added statistical quantification, which is useful.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript is the lack of direct connection between the reported neural changes and behavioural learning. Namely, most of the results could also be explained by changes in attention allocation during the session, or changes in movement speed (independent of learning). The authors acknowledge some of these potential confounds and argue that factors like attention are important for learning. While this is true, it is nonetheless very limiting if one cannot ascertain whether the observed effects are due to attention (independent of learning) or attention allocated in the pursuit of learning. The only direct analysis linking behavioural changes to neural changes is based on individual differences in learning performance, where the DAN-A shows the opposite trend than group level effects, which they interpret as differences given the used higher-resolution parcellation. However, it could be that these learning effects are indeed much smaller and subtler compared to more dominant group-level attention effects during the task. The lack of a control condition in the task limits the interpretability of results as learning-related.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91928.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gallivan</surname><given-names>Jason P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nick</surname><given-names>Qasem</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen's University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gale</surname><given-names>Daniel J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queens University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Areshenkoff</surname><given-names>Corson</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen's University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Brouwer</surname><given-names>Anouk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nashed</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wammes</surname><given-names>Jeffrey D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Tianyao</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Flanagan</surname><given-names>J Randall</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queen&amp;apos;s University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Smallwood</surname><given-names>Jonathan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Queens University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kingston</named-content></addr-line><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations</bold></p><p>Recommendation #1: Address potential confounds in the experimental design:</p><p>(1a) Confounding factors between baseline to early learning. While the visual display of the curved line remains constant, there are at least three changes between these two phases: (1) the presence of reward feedback (the focus of the paper); (2) a perturbation introduced to draw a hidden, mirror-symmetric curved line; (3) instructions provided to use reward feedback to trace the line on the screen (intentionally deceitful). As such, it remains unclear which of these factors are driving the changes in both behavior and bold signals between the two phases. The absence of a veridical feedback phase in which participants received reward feedback associated with the shown trajectory seems like a major limitation.</p><p>(1b) Confounding Factors Between Early and Late Learning. While the authors have focused on interpreting changes from early to late due to the explore-exploit trade-off, there are three additional factors possibly at play: (1) increasing fatigue, (2) withdrawal of attention, specifically related to individuals who have either successfully learned the perturbation within the first few trials or those who have simply given up, or (3) increasing awareness of the perturbation (not clear if subjective reports about perturbation awareness were measured.). I understand that fMRI research is resource-intensive; however, it is not clear how to rule out these alternatives with their existing data without additional control groups. [Another reviewer added the following: Why did the authors not acquire data during a control condition? How can we be confident that the neural dynamics observed are not due to the simple passage of time? Or if these effects are due to the task, what drives them? The reward component, the movement execution, increased automaticity?]</p></disp-quote><p>We have opted to address both of these points above within a single reply, as together they suggest potential confounding factors across the three phases of the task. We would agree that, if the results of our pairwise comparisons (e.g., Early &gt; Baseline or Late &gt; Early) were considered in isolation from one another, then these critiques of the study would be problematic. However, when considering the pattern of effects across the three task phases, we believe most of these critiques can be dismissed. Below, we first describe our results in this context, and then discuss how they address the reviewers’ various critiques.</p><p>Recall that from Baseline to Early learning, we observe an expansion of several cortical areas (e.g., core regions in the DMN) along the manifold (red areas in Fig. 4A, see manifold shifts in Fig. 4C) that subsequently exhibit contraction during Early to Late learning (blue areas in Fig. 4B, see manifold shifts in Fig. 4D). We show this overlap in brain areas in Author response image 1 below, panel A. Notably, several of these brain areas appear to contract back to their original, Baseline locations along the manifold during Late learning (compare Fig. 4C and D). This is evidenced by the fact that many of these same regions (e.g., DMN regions, in Author response image 1 panel A below) fail to show a significant difference between the Baseline and Late learning epochs (see Author response image 1 panel B below, which is taken from supplementary Fig 6). That is, the regions that show significant expansion and subsequent contraction (in Author response image 1 panel A below) tend not to overlap with the regions that significantly changed over the time course of the task (in Author response image 1 panel B below).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Note that this basic observation above is not only true of our regional manifold eccentricity data, but also in the underlying functional connectivity data associated with individual brain regions. To make this second point clearer, we have modified and annotated our Fig. 5 and included it below. Note the reversal in seed-based functional connectivity from Baseline to Early learning (leftmost brain plots) compared to Early to Late learning (rightmost brain plots). That is, it is generally the case that for each seed-region (A-C) the areas that increase in seed-connectivity with the seed region (in red; leftmost plot) are also the areas that decrease in seed-connectivity with the seed region (in blue; rightmost plot), and vice versa. [Also note that these connectivity reversals are conveyed through the eccentricity data — the horizontal red line in the rightmost plots denote the mean eccentricity of these brain regions during the Baseline phase, helping to highlight the fact that the eccentricity of the Late learning phase reverses back towards this Baseline level].</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Critically, these reversals in brain connectivity noted above directly counter several of the critiques noted by the reviewers. For instance, this reversal pattern of effects argues against the idea that our results during Early Learning can be simply explained due to the (i) presence of reward feedback, (ii) presence of the perturbation or (iii) instructions to use reward feedback to trace the path on the screen. Indeed, all of these factors are also present during Late learning, and yet many of the patterns of brain activity during this time period revert back to the Baseline patterns of connectivity, where these factors are absent. Similarly, this reversal pattern strongly refutes the idea that the effects are simply due to the passage of time, increasing fatigue, or general awareness of the perturbation. Indeed, if any of these factors alone could explain the data, then we would have expected a gradual increase (or decrease) in eccentricity and connectivity from Baseline to Early to Late learning, which we do not observe. We believe these are all important points when interpreting the data, but which we failed to mention in our original manuscript when discussing our findings.</p><p>We have now rectified this in the revised paper, where we now write in our Discussion:</p><p>“Finally, it is important to note that the reversal pattern of effects noted above suggests that our findings during learning cannot be simply attributed to the introduction of reward feedback and/or the perturbation during Early learning, as both of these task-related features are also present during Late learning. In addition, these results cannot be simply explained due to the passage of time or increasing subject fatigue, as this would predict a consistent directional change in eccentricity across the Baseline, Early and Late learning epochs.”</p><p>However, having said the above, we acknowledge that one potential factor that our findings cannot exclude is that they are (at least partially) attributable to changes in subjects’ state of attention throughout the task. Indeed, one can certainly argue that Baseline trials in our study don’t require a great deal of attention (after all, subjects are simply tracing a curved path presented on the screen). Likewise, for subjects that have learned the hidden shape, the Late learning trials are also likely to require limited attentional resources (indeed, many subjects at this point are simply producing the same shape trial after trial). Consequently, the large shift in brain connectivity that we observe from Baseline to Early Learning, and the subsequent reversion back to Baseline-levels of connectivity during Late learning, could actually reflect a heightened allocation of attention as subjects are attempting to learn the (hidden) rewarded shape. However, we do not believe that this would reflect a ‘confound’ of our study per se — indeed, any subject who has participated in a motor learning study would agree that the early learning phase of a task is far more cognitively demanding than Baseline trials and Late learning trials. As such, it is difficult to disentangle this ‘attention’ factor from the learning process itself (and in fact, it is likely central to it).</p><p>Of course, one could have designed a ‘control’ task in which subjects must direct their attention to something other than the learning task itself (e.g., divided attention paradigm, e.g., Taylor &amp; Thoroughman, 2007, 2008), and/or perform a secondary task concurrently (Codol et al., 2018; Holland et al., 2018), but we know that this type of manipulation impairs the learning process itself. Thus, in such a case, it wouldn’t be obvious to the experimenter what they are actually measuring in brain activity during such a task. And, to extend this argument even further, it is true that any sort of brain-based modulation can be argued to reflect some ‘attentional’ process, rather than modulations related to the specific task-based process under consideration (in our case, motor learning). In this regard, we are sympathetic to the views of Richard Andersen and colleagues who have eloquently stated that “The study of how attention interacts with other neural processing systems is a most important endeavor. However, we think that over-generalizing attention to encompass a large variety of different neural processes weakens the concept and undercuts the ability to develop a robust understanding of other cognitive functions.” (Andersen &amp; Cui, 2007, Neuron). In short, it appears that different fields/researchers have alternate views on the usefulness of attention as an explanatory construct (see also articles from Hommel et al., 2019, “No one knows what attention is”, and Wu, 2023, “We know what attention is!”), and we personally don’t have a dog in this fight. We only highlight these issues to draw attention (no pun intended) that it is not trivial to separate these different neural processes during a motor learning study.</p><p>Nevertheless, we do believe these are important points worth flagging for the reader in our paper, as they might have similar questions. To this end, we have now included in our Discussion section the following text:</p><p>“It is also possible that some of these task-related shifts in connectivity relate to shifts in task-general processes, such as changes in the allocation of attentional resources (Bédard and Song, 2013; Rosenberg et al., 2016) or overall cognitive engagement (Aben et al., 2020), which themselves play critical roles in shaping learning (Codol et al., 2018; Holland et al., 2018; Song, 2019; Taylor and Thoroughman, 2008, 2007; for a review of these topics, see Tsay et al., 2023). Such processes are particularly important during the earlier phases of learning when sensorimotor contingencies need to be established. While these remain questions for future work, our data nevertheless suggest that this shift in connectivity may be enabled through the PMC.”</p><p>Finally, we should note that, at the end of testing, we did not assess participants' awareness of the manipulation (i.e., that they were, in fact, being rewarded based on a mirror image path). In hindsight, this would have been a good idea and provided some value to the current project. Nevertheless, it seems clear that, based on several of the learning profiles observed (e.g., subjects who exhibited very rapid learning during the Early Learning phase, more on this below), that many individuals became aware of a shape approximating the rewarded path. Note that we have included new figures (see our responses below) that give a better example of what fast versus slower learning looks like. In addition, we now note in our Methods that we did not probe participants about their subjective awareness re: the perturbation:</p><p>“Note that, at the end of testing, we did not assess participants’ awareness of the manipulation (i.e., that they were, in fact, being rewarded based on a mirror image path of the visible path).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation #2: Provide more behavioral quantification.</p><p>(2a) The authors chose to only plot the average learning score in Figure 1D, without an indication of movement variability. I think this is quite important, to give the reader an impression of how variable the movements were at baseline, during early learning, and over the course of learning. There is evidence that baseline variability influences the 'detectability' of imposed rotations (in the case of adaptation learning), which could be relevant here. Shading the plots by movement variability would also be important to see if there was some refinement of the moment after participants performed at the ceiling (which seems to be the case ~ after trial 150). This is especially worrying given that in Fig 6A there is a clear indication that there is a large difference between subjects' solutions on the task. One subject exhibits almost a one-shot learning curve (reaching a score of 75 after one or two trials), whereas others don't seem to really learn until the near end. What does this between-subject variability mean for the authors' hypothesized neural processes?</p></disp-quote><p>In line with these recommendations, we have now provided much better behavioral quantification of subject-level performance in both the main manuscript and supplementary material. For instance, in a new supplemental Figure 1 (shown below), we now include mean subject (+/- SE) reaction times (RTs), movement times (MTs) and movement path variability (our computing of these measures are now defined in our Methods section).</p><p>As can be seen in the figure, all three of these variables tended to decrease over the course of the study, though we note there was a noticeable uptick in both RTs and MTs from the Baseline to Early learning phase, once subjects started receiving trial-by-trial reward feedback based on their movements. With respect to path variability, it is not obvious that there was a significant refinement of the paths created during late learning (panel D below), though there was certainly a general trend for path variability to decrease over learning.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Behavioral measures of learning across the task.</title><p>(A-D) shows average participant reward scores (A), reaction times (B), movement times (C) and path variability (D) over the course of the task. In each plot, the black line denotes the mean across participants and the gray banding denotes +/- 1 SEM. The three equal-length task epochs for subsequent neural analyses are indicated by the gray shaded boxes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to these above results, we have also created a new Figure 6 in the main manuscript, which now solely focuses on individual differences in subject learning (see below). Hopefully, this figure clarifies key features of the task and its reward structure, and also depicts (in movement trajectory space) what fast versus slow learning looks like in the task. Specifically, we believe that this figure now clearly delineates for the reader the mapping between movement trajectory and the reward score feedback presented to participants, which appeared to be a source of confusion based on the reviewers’ comments below. As can be clearly observed in this figure, trajectories that approximated the ‘visible path’ (black line) resulted in fairly mediocre scores (see score color legend at right), whereas trajectories that approximated the ‘reward path’ (dashed black line, see trials 191-200 of the fast learner) resulted in fairly high scores. This figure also more clearly delineates how fPCA loadings derived from our functional data analysis were used to derive subject-level learning scores (panel C).</p><fig id="sa4fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Individual differences in subject learning performance.</title><p>(A) Examples of a good learner (bordered in green) and poor learner (bordered in red). (B) Individual subject learning curves for the task. Solid black line denotes the mean across all subjects whereas light gray lines denote individual participants. The green and red traces denote the learning curves for the example good and poor learners denoted in A. (C) Derivation of subject learning scores. We performed functional principal component analysis (fPCA) on subjects’ learning curves in order to identify the dominant patterns of variability during learning. The top component, which encodes overall learning, explained the majority of the observed variance (~75%). The green and red bands denote the effect of positive and negative component scores, respectively, relative to mean performance. Thus, subjects who learned more quickly than average have a higher loading (in green) on this ‘Learning score’ component than subjects who learned more slowly (in red) than average. The plot at right denotes the loading for each participant (open circles) onto this Learning score component.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The reviewers note that there are large individual differences in learning performance across the task. This was clearly our hope when designing the reward structure of this task, as it would allow us to further investigate the neural correlates of these individual differences (indeed, during pilot testing, we sought out a reward structure to the task that would allow for these intersubject differences). The subjects who learn early during the task end up having higher fPCA scores than the subjects who learn more gradually (or learn the task late). From our perspective, these differences are a feature, and not a bug, and they do not negate any of our original interpretations. That is, subjects who learn earlier on average tend to contract their DAN-A network during the early learning phase whereas subjects who learn more slowly on average (or learn late) instead tend to contract their DAN-A network during late learning (Fig. 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2b) In the methods, the authors stated that they scaled the score such that even a perfectly traced visible path would always result in an imperfect score of 40 patients. What happens if a subject scores perfectly on the first try (which seemed to have happened for the green highlighted subject in Fig 6A), but is then permanently confronted with a score of 40 or below? Wouldn't this result in an error-clamp-like (error-based motor adaptation) design for this subject and all other high performers, which would vastly differ from the task demands for the other subjects? How did the authors factor in the wide between-subject variability?</p></disp-quote><p>We think the reviewers may have misinterpreted the reward structure of the task, and we apologize for not being clearer in our descriptions. The reward score that subjects received after each trial was based on how well they traced the mirror-image of the visible path. However, all the participant can see on the screen is the visible path. We hope that our inclusion of the new Figure 6 (shown above) makes the reward structure of the task, and its relationship to movement trajectories, much clearer. We should also note that, even for the highest performing subject (denoted in Fig. 6), it still required approximately 20 trials for them to reach asymptote performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2c) The study would benefit from a more detailed description of participants' behavioral performance during the task. Specifically, it is crucial to understand how participants' motor skills evolve over time. Information on changes in movement speed, accuracy, and other relevant behavioral metrics would enhance the understanding of the relationship between behavior and brain activity during the learning process. Additionally, please clarify whether the display on the screen was presented continuously throughout the entire trial or only during active movement periods. Differences in display duration could potentially impact the observed differences in brain activity during learning.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that with our inclusion of the new Supplementary Figure 1 (shown above) this addresses the reviewers’ recommendation. Generally, we find that RTs, MTs and path variability all decrease over the course of the task. We think this relates to the early learning phase being more attentionally demanding and requiring more conscious effort, than the later learning phases.</p><p>Also, yes, the visible path was displayed on the screen continuously throughout the trial, and only disappeared at the 4.5 second mark of each trial (when the screen was blanked and the data was saved off for 1.5 seconds prior to commencement of the next trial; 6 seconds total per trial). Thus, there were no differences in display duration across trials and phases of the task. We have now clarified this in the Methods section, where we now write the following:</p><p>“When the cursor reached the target distance, the target changed color from red to green to indicate that the trial was completed. Importantly, other than this color change in the distance marker, the visible curved path remained constant and participants never received any feedback about the position of their cursor.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2d) It is unclear from plots 6A, 6B, and 1D how the scale of the behavioral data matches with the scaling of the scores. Are these the 'real' scores, meaning 100 on the y-axis would be equivalent to 40 in the task? Why then do all subjects reach an asymptote at 75? Or is 75 equivalent to 40 and the axis labels are wrong?</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, we clearly did a poor job of describing the reward structure of our task in our original paper, and we now hope that our inclusion of Figure 6 makes things clear. A ‘40’ score on the y-axis would indicate that a subject has perfectly traced the visible path whereas a perfect ‘100’ score would indicate that a subject has perfectly traced the (hidden) mirror image path.</p><p>The fact that several of the subjects reach asymptote around 75 is likely a byproduct of two factors. Firstly, the subjects performed their movements in the absence of any visual error feedback (they could not see the position of a cursor that represented their hand position), which had the effect of increasing motor variability in their actions from trial to trial. Secondly, there appears to be an underestimation among subjects regarding the curvature of the concealed, mirror-image path (i.e., that the rewarded path actually had an equal but opposite curvature to that of the visible path). This is particularly evident in the case of the top-performing subject (illustrated in Figure 6A) who, even during late learning, failed to produce a completely arched movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2e) Labeling of Contrasts: There is a consistent issue with the labeling of contrasts in the presented figures, causing confusion. While the text refers to the difference as &quot;baseline to early learning,&quot; the label used in figures, such as Figure 4, reads &quot;baseline &gt; early.&quot; It is essential to clarify whether the presented contrast is indeed &quot;baseline &gt; early&quot; or &quot;early &gt; baseline&quot; to avoid any misinterpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for catching this error. Indeed, the intended label was Early &gt; Baseline, and this has now been corrected throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation #3. Clarify which motor learning mechanism(s) are at play.</p><p>(3a) Participants were performing at a relatively low level, achieving around 50-60 points by the end of learning. This outcome may not be that surprising, given that reward-based learning might have a substantial explicit component and may also heavily depend on reasoning processes, beyond reinforcement learning or contextual recall (Holland et al., 2018; Tsay et al., 2023). Even within our own data, where explicit processes are isolated, average performance is low and many individuals fail to learn (Brudner et al., 2016; Tsay et al., 2022). Given this, many participants in the current study may have simply given up. A potential indicator of giving up could be a subset of participants moving straight ahead in a rote manner (a heuristic to gain moderate points). Consequently, alterations in brain networks may not reflect exploration and exploitation strategies but instead indicate levels of engagement and disengagement. Could the authors plot the average trajectory and the average curvature changes throughout learning? Are individuals indeed defaulting to moving straight ahead in learning, corresponding to an average of 50-60 points? If so, the interpretation of brain activity may need to be tempered.</p></disp-quote><p>We can do one better, and actually give you a sense of the learning trajectories for every subject over time. In the figure below, which we now include as Supplementary Figure 2 in our revision, we have plotted, for each subject, a subset of their movement trajectories across learning trials (every 10 trials). As can be seen in the diversity of these trajectories, the average trajectory and average curvature would do a fairly poor job of describing the pattern of learning-related changes across subjects. Moreover, it is not obvious from looking at these plots the extent to which poor learning subjects (i.e., subjects who never converge on the reward path) actually ‘give up’ in the task — rather, many of these subjects still show some modulation (albeit minor) of their movement trajectories in the later trials (see the purple and pink traces). As an aside, we are also not entirely convinced that straight ahead movements, which we don’t find many of in our dataset, can be taken as direct evidence that the subject has given up.</p><fig id="sa4fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Variability in learning across subjects.</title><p>Plots show representative trajectory data from each subject (n=36) over the course of the 200 learning trials. Coloured traces show individual trials over time (each trace is separated by ten trials, e.g., trial 1, 10, 20, 30, etc.) to give a sense of the trajectory changes throughout the task (20 trials in total are shown for each subject).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We should also note that we are not entirely opposed to the idea of describing aspects of our findings in terms of subject engagement versus disengagement over time, as such processes are related at some level to exploration (i.e., cognitive engagement in finding the best solution) and exploitation (i.e., cognitively disengaging and automating one’s behavior). As noted in our reply to Recommendation #1 above, we now give some consideration of these explanations in our Discussion section, where we now write:</p><p>“It is also possible that these task-related shifts in connectivity relates to shifts in task-general processes, such as changes in the allocation of attentional resources (Bédard and Song, 2013; Rosenberg et al., 2016) or overall cognitive engagement (Aben et al., 2020), which themselves play critical roles in shaping learning (Codol et al., 2018; Holland et al., 2018; Song, 2019; Taylor and Thoroughman, 2008, 2007; for a review of these topics, see Tsay et al., 2023). Such processes are particularly important during the earlier phases of learning when sensorimotor contingencies need to be established. While these remain questions for future work, our data nevertheless suggest that this shift in connectivity may be enabled through the PMC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3b) The authors are mixing two commonly used paradigms, reward-based learning, and motor adaptation, but provide no discussion of the different learning processes at play here. Which processes were they attempting to probe? Making this explicit would help the reader understand which brain regions should be implicated based on previous literature. As it stands, the task is hard to interpret. Relatedly, there is a wealth of literature on explicit vs implicit learning mechanisms in adaptation tasks now. Given that the authors are specifically looking at brain structures in the cerebral cortex that are commonly associated with explicit and strategic learning rather than implicit adaptation, how do the authors relate their findings to this literature? Are the learning processes probed in the task more explicit, more implicit, or is there a change in strategy usage over time? Did the authors acquire data on strategies used by the participants to solve the task? How does the baseline variability come into play here?</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our paper, our task was directly inspired by the reward-based motor learning tasks developed by Dam et al., 2013 (Plos One) and Wu et al., 2014 (Nature Neuroscience). What drew us to these tasks is that they allowed us to study the neural bases of reward-based learning mechanisms in the absence of subjects also being able to exploit error-based mechanisms to achieve learning. Indeed, when first describing the task in the Results section of our paper we wrote the following:</p><p>“Importantly, because subjects received no visual feedback about their actual finger trajectory and could not see their own hand, they could only use the score feedback — and thus only reward-based learning mechanisms — to modify their movements from one trial to the next (Dam et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014).”</p><p>If the reviewers are referring to ‘motor adaptation’ in the context in which that terminology is commonly used — i.e., the use of sensory prediction errors to support error-based learning — then we would argue that motor adaptation is not a feature of the current study. It is true that in our study subjects learn to ‘adapt’ their movements across trials, but this shaping of the movement trajectories must be supported through reinforcement learning mechanisms (and, of course, supplemented by the use of cognitive strategies as discussed in the nice review by Tsay et al., 2023). We apologize for not being clearer in our paper about this key distinction and we have now included new text in the introduction to our Results to directly address this:</p><p>“Importantly, because subjects received no visual feedback about their actual finger trajectory and could not see their own hand, they could only use the score feedback — and thus only reward-based learning mechanisms — to modify their movements from one trial to the next (Dam et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014). That is, subjects could not use error-based learning mechanisms to achieve learning in our study, as this form of learning requires sensory errors that convey both the change in direction and magnitude needed to correct the movement.”</p><p>With this issue aside, we are well aware of the established framework for thinking about sensorimotor adaptation as being composed of a combination of explicit and implicit components (indeed, this has been a central feature of several of our other recent neuroimaging studies that have explored visuomotor rotation learning, e.g., Gale et al., 2022 PNAS, Areshenkoff et al., 2022 elife, Standage et al., 2023 Cerebral Cortex). However, there has been comparably little work done on these parallel components within the domain of reinforcement learning tasks (though see Codol et al., 2018; Holland et al., 2018, van Mastrigt et al., 2023; see also the Tsay et al., 2023 review), and as far as we can tell, nothing has been done to date in the reward-based motor learning area using fMRI. By design, we avoided using descriptors of ‘explicit’ or ‘implicit’ in our study because our experimental paradigm did not allow a separate measurement of those two components to learning during the task. Nevertheless, it seems clear to us from examining the subjects’ learning curves (see supplementary figure 2 above), that individuals who learn very quickly are using strategic processes (such as action exploration to identify the best path) to enhance their learning. As we noted in an above response, we did not query subjects after the fact about their strategy use, which admittedly was a missed opportunity on our part.</p><fig id="sa4fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>With respect to the comment on baseline variability and its relationship to performance, this is an interesting idea and one that was explored in the Wu et al., 2014 Nature Neuroscience paper. Prompted by the reviewers, we have now explored this idea in the current data set by testing for a relationship between movement path variability during baseline trials (all 70 baseline trials, see Supplementary Figure 1D above for reference) and subjects’ fPCA score on our learning task. However, when we performed this analysis, we did not observe a significant positive relationship between baseline variability and subject performance. Rather, we actually found a trend towards a negative relationship (though this was non-significant; r=-0.2916, p=0.0844). Admittedly, we are not sure what conclusions can be drawn from this analysis, and in any case, we believe it to be tangential to our main results. We provide the results (at right) for the reviewers if they are interested. This may be an interesting avenue for exploration in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendation #4: Provide stronger justification for brain imaging methods.</p><p>(4a) Observing how brain activity varies across these different networks is remarkable, especially how sensorimotor regions separate and then contract with other, more cognitive areas. However, does the signal-to-noise ratio in each area/network influence manifold eccentricity and limit the possible changes in eccentricity during learning? Specifically, if a region has a low signal-to-noise ratio, it might exhibit minimal changes during learning (a phenomenon perhaps relevant to null manifold changes in the striatum due to low signal-to-noise); conversely, regions with higher signal-to-noise (e.g., motor cortex in this sensorimotor task) might exhibit changes more easily detected. As such, it is unclear how to interpret manifold changes without considering an area/network's signal-to-noise ratio.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate where these concerns are coming from. First, we should note that the timeseries data used in our analysis were z-transformed (mean zero, 1 std) to allow normalization of the signal both over time and across regions (and thus mitigate the possibility that the changes observed could simply reflect mean overall signal changes across different regions). Nevertheless, differences in signal intensity across brain regions — particularly between cortex and striatum — are well-known, though it is not obvious how these differences may manifest in terms of a task-based modulation of MR signals.</p><p>To examine this issue in the current data set, we extracted, for each subject and time epoch (Baseline, Early and Late learning) the raw scanner data (in MR arbitrary units, a.u.) for the cortical and striatal regions and computed the (1) mean signal intensity, (2) standard deviation of the signal (Std) and (3) temporal signal to noise ratio (tSNR; calculated by mean/Std). Note that in the fMRI connectivity literature tSNR is often the preferred SNR measure as it normalizes the mean signal based on the signal’s variability over time, thus providing a general measure of overall ‘signal quality’. The results of this analysis, averaged across subjects and regions, is shown below.</p><fig id="sa4fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Note that, as expected, the overall signal intensity (left plot) of cortex is higher than in the striatum, reflecting the closer proximity of cortex to the receiver coils in the MR head coil. In fact, the signal intensity in cortex is approximately 38% higher than that in the striatum (~625 - 450/450). However, the signal variation in cortex is also greater than striatum (middle plot), but in this case approximately 100% greater (i.e., (~5 - 2.5)/2.5). The result of this is that the tSNR (mean/std) for our data set and the ROI parcellations we used is actually greater in the striatum than in cortex (right plot). Thus, all else being equal, there seems to have been sufficient tSNR in the striatum for us to have detected motor-learning related effects. As such, we suspect the null effects for the striatum in our study actually stem from two sources.</p><p>The first likely source is the relatively lower number of striatal regions (12) as compared to cortical regions (998) used in our analysis, coupled with our use of PCA on these data (which, by design, identifies the largest sources of variation in connectivity). In future studies, this unbalance could be rectified by using finer parcellations of the striatum (even down to the voxel level) while keeping the same parcellation of cortex (i.e., equate the number of ‘regions’ in each of striatum and cortex). The second likely source is our use of a striatal atlas (the Harvard-Oxford atlas) that divides brain regions based on their neuroanatomy rather than their function. In future work, we plan on addressing this latter concern by using finer, more functionally relevant parcellations of striatum (such as in Tian et al., 2020, Nature Neuroscience). Note that we sought to capture these interrelated possible explanations in our Discussion section, where we wrote the following:</p><p>“While we identified several changes in the cortical manifold that are associated with reward-based motor learning, it is noteworthy that we did not observe any significant changes in manifold eccentricity within the striatum. While clearly the evidence indicates that this region plays a key role in reward-guided behavior (Averbeck and O’Doherty, 2022; O’Doherty et al., 2017), there are several possible reasons why our manifold approach did not identify this collection of brain areas. First, the relatively small size of the striatum may mean that our analysis approach was too coarse to identify changes in the connectivity of this region. Though we used a 3T scanner and employed a widely-used parcellation scheme that divided the striatum into its constituent anatomical regions (e.g., hippocampus, caudate, etc.), both of these approaches may have obscured important differences in connectivity that exist within each of these regions. For example, areas such the hippocampus and caudate are not homogenous areas but themselves exhibit gradients of connectivity (e.g., head versus tail) that can only be revealed at the voxel level (Tian et al., 2020; Vos de Wael et al., 2021). Second, while our dimension reduction approach, by design, aims to identify gradients of functional connectivity that account for the largest amounts of variance, the limited number of striatal regions (as compared to cortex) necessitates that their contribution to the total whole-brain variance is relatively small. Consistent with this perspective, we found that the low-dimensional manifold architecture in cortex did not strongly depend on whether or not striatal regions were included in the analysis (see Supplementary Fig. 6). As such, selective changes in the patterns of functional connectivity at the level of the striatum may be obscured using our cortex x striatum dimension reduction approach. Future work can help address some of these limitations by using both finer parcellations of striatal cortex (perhaps even down to the voxel level)(Tian et al., 2020) and by focusing specifically on changes in the interactions between the striatum and cortex during learning. The latter can be accomplished by selectively performing dimension reduction on the slice of the functional connectivity matrix that corresponds to functional coupling between striatum and cortex.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4b) Could the authors clarify how activity in the dorsal attention network (DAN) changes throughout learning, and how these changes also relate to individual differences in learning performance? Specifically, on average, the DAN seems to expand early and contract late, relative to the baseline. This is interpreted to signify that the DAN exhibits lesser connectivity followed by greater connectivity with other brain regions. However, in terms of how these changes relate to behavior, participants who go against the average trend (DAN exhibits more contraction early in learning, and expansion from early to late) seem to exhibit better learning performance. This finding is quite puzzling. Does this mean that the average trend of expansion and contraction is not facilitative, but rather detrimental, to learning? [Another reviewer added: The authors do not state any explicit hypotheses, but only establish that DMN coordinates activity among several regions. What predictions can we derive from this? What are the authors looking for in the data? The work seems more descriptive than hypothesis-driven. This is fine but should be clarified in the introduction.]</p></disp-quote><p>These are good questions, and we are glad the reviewers appreciated the subtlety here. The reviewers are indeed correct that the relationship of the DAN-A network to behavioral performance appears to go against the grain of the group-level results that we found for the entire DAN network (which we note is composed of both the DAN-A and DAN-B networks). That is, subjects who exhibited greater contraction from Baseline to Early learning and likewise, greater expansion from Early to Late learning, tended to perform better in the task (according to our fPCA scores). However, on this point it is worth noting that it was mainly the DAN-B network which exhibited group-level expansion from Baseline to Early Learning whereas the DAN-A network exhibited negligible expansion. This can be seen in Author response image 8 below, which shows the pattern of expansion and contraction (as in Fig. 4), but instead broken down into the 17-network parcellation. The red asterisk denotes the expansion from Baseline to Early learning for the DAN-B network, which is much greater than that observed for the DAN-A network (which is basically around the zero difference line).</p><fig id="sa4fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91928-sa4-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Thus, it appears that the DAN-A and DAN-B networks are modulated to a different extent during the task, which likely contributes to the perceived discrepancy between the group-level effects (reported using the 7-network parcellation) and the individual differences effects (reported using the finer 17-network parcellation). Based on the reviewers’ comments, this seems like an important distinction to clarify in the manuscript, and we have now described this nuance in our Results section where we now write:</p><p>“...Using this permutation testing approach, we found that it was only the change in eccentricity of the DAN-A network that correlated with Learning score (see Fig. 7C), such that the more the DAN-A network decreased in eccentricity from Baseline to Early learning (i.e., contracted along the manifold), the better subjects performed at the task (see Fig. 7C, scatterplot at right). Consistent with the notion that changes in the eccentricity of the DAN-A network are linked to learning performance, we also found the inverse pattern of effects during Late learning, whereby the more that this same network increased in eccentricity from Early to Late learning (i.e., expanded along the manifold), the better subjects performed at the task (Fig. 7D). We should note that this pattern of performance effects for the DAN-A — i.e., greater contraction during Early learning and greater expansion during Late learning being associated with better learning — appears at odds with the group-level effects described in Fig. 4A and B, where we generally find the opposite pattern for the entire DAN network (composed of the DAN-A and DAN-B subnetworks). However, this potential discrepancy can be explained when examining the changes in eccentricity using the 17-network parcellation (see Supplementary Figure 8). At this higher resolution level we find that these group-level effects for the entire DAN network are being largely driven by eccentricity changes in the DAN-B network (areas in anterior superior parietal cortex and premotor cortex), and not by mean changes in the DAN-A network. By contrast, our present results suggest that it is the contraction and expansion of areas of the DAN-A network (and not DAN-B network) that are selectively associated with differences in subject learning performance.”</p><p>Finally, re: the reviewers’ comments that we do not state any explicit hypotheses etc., we acknowledge that, beyond our general hypothesis stated at the outset about the DMN being involved in reward-based motor learning, our study is quite descriptive and exploratory in nature. Such little work has been done in this research area (i.e., using manifold learning approaches to study motor learning with fMRI) that it would be disingenuous to have any stronger hypotheses than those stated in our Introduction. Thus, to make the exploratory nature of our study clear to the reader, we have added the following text (in red) to our Introduction:</p><p>“Here we applied this manifold approach to explore how brain activity across widely distributed cortical and striatal systems is coordinated during reward-based motor learning. We were particularly interested in characterizing how connectivity between regions within the DMN and the rest of the brain changes as participants shift from learning the relationship between motor commands and reward feedback, during early learning, to subsequently using this information, during late learning. We were also interested in exploring whether learning-dependent changes in manifold structure relate to variation in subject motor performance.”</p><p>We hope these changes now make it obvious the intention of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4c) The paper examines a type of motor adaptation task with a reward-based learning component. This, to me, strongly implicates the cerebellum, given that it has a long-established crucial role in adaptation and has recently been implicated in reward-based learning (see work by Wagner &amp; Galea). Why is there no mention of the cerebellum and why it was left out of this study? Especially given that the authors state in the abstract they examine cortical and subcortical structures. It's evident from the methods that the authors did not acquire data from the cerebellum or had too small a FOV to fully cover it (34 slices at 4 mm thickness 136 mm which is likely a bit short to fully cover the cerebellum in many participants). What was the rationale behind this methodological choice? It would be good to clarify this for the reader. Related to this, the authors need to rephrase their statements on 'whole-brain' connectivity matrices or analyses - it is not whole-brain when it excludes the cerebellum.</p></disp-quote><p>As we noted above, we do not believe this task to be a motor adaptation task, in the sense that subjects are not able to use sensory prediction errors (and thus error-based learning mechanisms) to improve their performance. Rather, by denying subjects this sensory error feedback they are only able to use reinforcement learning processes, along with cognitive strategies (nicely covered in Tsay et al., 2023), to improve performance. Nevertheless, we recognize that the cerebellum has been increasingly implicated in facets of reward-based learning, particularly within the rodent domain (e.g., Wagner et al., 2017; Heffley et al., 2018; Kostadinov et al., 2019, etc.). In our study, we did indeed collect data from the cerebellum but did not include it in our original analyses, as we wanted (1) the current paper to build on prior work in the human and macaque reward-learning domain (which focuses solely on striatum and cortex, and which rarely discusses cerebellum, see Averbeck &amp; O’Doherty, 2022 &amp; Klein-Flugge et al., 2022 for recent reviews), and, (2) allow this to be a more targeted focus of future work (specifically we plan on focusing on striatal-cerebellar interactions during learning, which are hypothesized based on the neuroanatomical tract tracing work of Bostan and Strick, etc.). We hope the reviewers respect our decisions in this regard.</p><p>Nevertheless, we acknowledge that based on our statements about ‘whole-brain’ connectivity and vagueness about what we mean by ‘subcortex,’ that this may be confusing for the reader. We have now removed and/or corrected such references throughout the paper (however, note that in some cases it is difficult to avoid reference to “whole-brain” — e.g., “whole-brain correlation map” or “whole-brain false discovery rate correction”, which is standard terminology in the field).</p><p>In addition, we are now explicit in our Methods section that the cerebellum was not included in our analyses.</p><p>“Each volume comprised 34 contiguous (no gap) oblique slices acquired at a ~30° caudal tilt with respect to the plane of the anterior and posterior commissure (AC-PC), providing whole-brain coverage of the cerebrum and cerebellum. Note that for the current study, we did not examine changes in cerebellar activity during learning.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4d) The authors centered the matrices before further analyses to remove variance associated with the subject. Why not run a PCA on the connectivity matrices and remove the PC that is associated with subject variance? What is the advantage of first centering the connectivity matrices? Is this standard practice in the field?</p></disp-quote><p>Centering in some form has become reasonably common in the functional connectivity literature, as there is considerable evidence that task-related (or cognitive) changes in whole-brain connectivity are dwarfed by static, subject-level differences (e.g., Gratton, et al, 2018, Neuron). If covariance matrices were ordinary scalar values, then isolating task-related changes could be accomplished simply by subtracting a baseline scan or mean score; but because the space of covariance matrices is non-Euclidean, the actual computations involved in this subtraction are more complex (see our Methods). However, fundamentally (and conceptually) our procedure is simply ordinary mean-centering, but adapted to this non-Euclidean space. Despite the added complexity, there is considerable evidence that such computations — adapted directly to the geometry of the space of covariance matrices — outperform simpler methods, which treat covariance matrices as arrays of real numbers (e.g. naive substraction, see Dodero et al. &amp; Ng et al., references below). Moreover, our previous work has found that this procedure works quite well to isolate changes associated with different task conditions (Areshenkoff et al., 2021, Neuroimage; Areshenkoff et al., 2022, elife).</p><p>Although PCA can be adapted to work well with covariance matrix valued data, it would at best be a less direct solution than simply subtracting subjects' mean connectivity. This is because the top components from applying PCA would be dominated by both subject-specific effects (not of interest here), and by the large-scale connectivity structure typically observed in component based analyses of whole-brain connectivity (i.e. the principal gradient), whereas changes associated with task-condition (the thing of interest here) would be buried among the less reliable components. By contrast, our procedure directly isolates these task changes.</p><p>References cited above:</p><p>Dodero, L., Minh, H. Q., San Biagio, M., Murino, V., &amp; Sona, D. (2015, April).

It is unclear why the authors designed a task that was this novel and interesting, drawing on several psychological concepts, but then chose to ignore these concepts in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We were disappointed to hear that the reviewers did not appreciate our functional PCA-derived measure to quantify subject learning. This is a novel data-driven analysis approach that we have previously used with success in recent work (e.g., Areshenkoff et al., 2022, elife) and, from our perspective, we thought it was quite elegant that we were able to describe the entire trajectory of learning across all participants along a single axis that explained the majority (~75%) of the variance in the patterns of behavioral learning data. Moreover, the creation of a single behavioral measure per participant (what we call a ‘Learning score’, see Fig. 6C) helped simplify our brain-behavior correlation analyses considerably, as it provided a single measure that accounts for the natural auto-correlation in subjects’ learning curves (i.e., that subjects who learn quickly also tend to be better overall learners by the end of the learning phase). It also avoids the difficulty (and sometimes arbitrariness) of having to select specific trial bins for behavioral analysis (e.g., choosing the first 5, 10, 20 or 25 trials as a measure of ‘early learning’, and so on). Of course, one of the major alternatives to our approach would have involved fitting an exponential to each subject’s learning curves and taking measures like learning rate etc., but in our experience we have found that these types of models don’t always fit well, or derive robust/reliable parameters at the individual subject level. To strengthen the motivation for our approach, we have now included the following text in our Results:</p><p>“To quantify this variation in subject performance in a manner that accounted the auto-correlation in learning performance over time (i.e., subjects who learned more quickly tend to exhibit better performance by the end of learning), we opted for a pure data-driven approach and performed functional principal component analysis (fPCA; (Shang, 2014)) on subjects’ learning curves. This approach allowed us to isolate the dominant patterns of variability in subject’s learning curves over time (see Methods for further details; see also Areshenkoff et al., 2022).”</p><p>In any case, the reviewers may be pleased to hear that in current work in the lab we are using more model-based approaches to attempt to derive sets of parameters (per participant) that relate to some of the variables of interest described by the reviewers, but that we relate to much more dynamical (shorter-term) changes in brain activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4f) Overall Changes in Activity: The manuscript should delve into the potential influence of overall changes in brain activity on the results. The choice of using Euclidean distance as a metric for quantifying changes in connectivity is sensitive to scaling in overall activity. Therefore, it is crucial to discuss whether activity in task-relevant areas increases from baseline to early learning and decreases from early to late learning, or if other patterns emerge. A comprehensive analysis of overall activity changes will provide a more complete understanding of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>These are good questions and we are happy to explore this in the data. However, as mentioned in our response to query 4a above, it is important to note that the timeseries data for each brain region was z-scored prior to analysis, with the aim of removing any mean changes in activity levels (note that this is a standard preprocessing step when performing functional connectivity analysis, given that mean signal changes are not the focus of interest in functional connectivity analyses).</p><p>To further emphasize these points, we have taken our z-scored timeseries data and calculated the mean signal for each region within each task epoch (Baseline, Early and Late learning, see panel A in figure below). The point of showing this data (where each z-score map looks near identical across the top, middle and bottom plots) is to demonstrate just how miniscule the mean signal changes are in the z-scored timeseries data. This point can also be observed when plotting the mean z-score signal across regions for each epoch (see panel B in figure below). Here we find that Baseline and Early learning have a near identical mean activation level across regions (albeit with slightly different variability across subjects), whereas there is a slight increase during late learning — though it should be noted that our y-axis, which measures in the thousandths, really magnifies this effect.</p><p>To more directly address the reviewers’ comments, using the z-score signal per region we have also performed the same statistical pairwise comparisons (Early &gt; Baseline and Late&gt;Early) as we performed in the main manuscript Fig. 4 (see panel C in Author response image 9 below). In this plot, areas in red denote an increase in activity from Baseline to Early learning (top plot) and from Early to Late learning (bottom plot), whereas areas in blue denote a decrease for those same comparisons. The important thing to emphasize here is that the spatial maps resulting from this analysis are generally quite different from the maps of eccentricity that we report in Fig. 4 in our paper. For instance, in the figure below, we see significant changes in the activity of visual cortex between epochs but this is not found in our eccentricity results (compare with Fig. 4). Likewise, in our eccentricity results (Fig. 4), we find significant changes in the manifold positioning of areas in medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), but this is not observed in the activation levels of these regions (panel C below). Again, we are hesitant to make too much of these results, as the activation differences denoted as significant in the figure below are likely to be an effect on the order of thousandths of a z-score (e.g., 0.002 &gt; 0.001), but this hopefully assuages reviewers’ concerns that our manifold results are solely attributable to changes in overall activity levels.</p><p>We are hesitant to include the results below in our paper as we feel that they don’t add much to the interpretation (as the purpose of z-scoring was to remove large activation differences).
