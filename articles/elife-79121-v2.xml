<italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> homing gene drives that disrupt female fertility genes, thereby eventually inducing population collapse. Such drives may be highly effective tools to combat malaria. One such homing drive, based on the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter driving CRISPR/Cas9, was able to eliminate a cage population of mosquitoes. A second version, purportedly improved upon the first by incorporating an X-shredder element (which biases inheritance towards male offspring), was similarly successful. Here, we analyze experimental data from each of these gene drives to extract their characteristics and performance parameters and compare these to previous interpretations of their experimental performance. We assess each suppression drive within an individual-based simulation framework that models mosquito population dynamics in continuous space. We find that the combined homing/X-shredder drive is actually less effective at population suppression within the context of our mosquito population model. In particular, the combined drive often fails to completely suppress the population, instead resulting in an unstable equilibrium between drive and wild-type alleles. By contrast, otherwise similar drives based on the <italic>nos</italic> promoter may prove to be more promising candidates for future development than originally thought.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene drive</kwd><kwd>modeling</kwd><kwd>suppression</kwd><kwd>anopheles mosquitoes</kwd><kwd>chasing</kwd><kwd>Cas9 promoter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI138476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Champer</surname><given-names>Jackson</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Messer</surname><given-names>Philipp W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Continuous space models indicate that current homing suppression drives may have difficulty eliminating wild mosquito populations, but building a successful drive may still be possible with current tools.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria reduction strategies based on gene drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hay et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quinn and Nolan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dhole et al., 2020</xref>) in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes have made substantial advances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>), with several population suppression drives targeting female fertility genes recently proving successful in laboratory settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the possibility that such drives may soon be considered for field deployment. There is thus considerable incentive to engineer the optimal drive for a maximally successful test, which could potentially lead to a more wide-scale field deployment. Because malaria kills over 400,000 people every year while infecting over 200 million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">World Health Organization, 2019</xref>), even a modest increase in the efficiency of a gene drive could correspond to a substantial decrease in new cases per year.</p><p>Despite considerable progress in the field, we still lack an in-depth understanding of how various drive and population characteristics could affect the outcome of a drive release into a natural population. Initial modeling studies assuming a panmictic population indicated that if a homing suppression drive targeting a female fertility gene can avoid the development of resistance alleles that preserve the function of the gene, it can eliminate or at least reduce the population. The exact level of suppression is a function of both species-specific ecological factors and the suppressive power of the drive. Suppressive power is often characterized in terms of the drive’s ‘genetic load’, which for <italic>Anopheles</italic> female-fertility homing drives is typically defined as the fractional reduction in average fertility of a population in which the drive has reached its equilibrium frequency as compared to an otherwise identical wild-type population. In general, if the genetic load is high enough, panmictic models predict complete population elimination, and any increase in genetic load beyond that threshold can at most provide a decrease in the time to elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deredec et al., 2011</xref>). This suggests that the differences between existing drive candidates that meet this threshold should be minimal.</p><p>However, spatially explicit models have indicated that outcomes of a suppression drive release can be substantially more complicated than those predicted by panmictic population models. In particular, it has been shown that population structure can substantially delay or prevent complete population suppression even by drives with a sufficient genetic load to reliably induce population collapse in a panmictic population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">North et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">North et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Champer et al., 2021b</xref>). One mechanism that can prevent population collapse is ‘chasing’, a phenomenon where wild-type individuals recolonize regions where the drive has eliminated the population. In this situation, the recolonizing individuals can benefit from the reduced competition due to the low population density in these areas and can substantially increase in number before the drive once again spreads into the area and causes local suppression to reoccur. In this manner, drive and wild-type alleles can persist indefinitely, following an irregular pattern of local suppression and recolonization. This chasing phenomenon seems to be a common feature of spatial models for many types of suppression drive, regardless of whether the model is implemented using abstract spatial patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2019</xref>), networks of linked demes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">North et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">North et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Birand et al., 2022</xref>), or continuous space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Champer et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faber et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu and Champer, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paril and Phillips, 2022</xref>). Unlike panmictic models, these spatial models predict that even modest differences in efficiency between drives can potentially have large effects on the outcome of a drive release, meriting careful consideration of drive candidates to identify those with the greatest potential for success in realistic conditions.</p><p>Thus far, several candidates for female-fertility homing suppression drives have been tested in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>. Early drives with the <italic>vasa</italic> promoter offered high germline drive conversion efficiency, but they are not viable candidates due to high levels of somatic Cas9 activity and high rates of embryo resistance allele formation from maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hammond et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>). Use of the <italic>zpg</italic> and <italic>nos</italic> promoters was shown to greatly reduce both embryo resistance allele formation and female fitness costs from somatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). A drive that combined the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter for Cas9 with a highly conserved gRNA target site in the <italic>dsx</italic> gene (thus preventing the formation of functional resistance alleles) was able to successfully suppress a cage population of mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). A follow-up study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>) included a previously developed X-shredder in this drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galizi et al., 2014</xref>) to create a male-biased population and was similarly successful in a cage study. Overall, these studies brought forward multiple potential drive candidates that have either already succeeded at suppressing cage populations or which could be expected to do so were they to be implemented with <italic>dsx</italic> as a target.</p><p>Here, we assess which of these drive candidates may be most successful at suppressing natural populations of <italic>A. gambiae</italic>. We build upon previous work, obtaining multiple possible parameterizations of these drives based on a new analysis of available experimental data. We then analyze the drives in the context of our previously established individual-based simulation model with continuous space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>), as well as a new <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model with weekly time steps.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Parameterization of <italic>Anopheles</italic> suppression gene drives</title><p>Several suppression drives have been constructed by the Crisanti lab in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). By examining experimental data collected in these studies, particularly drive inheritance and viable larvae per female, we calculated drive conversion rates (the rate at which drive alleles are converted to wild-type alleles in the germline) in female and male drive/wild-type heterozygotes, and we similarly obtained estimates of the germline resistance allele formation rates (distinctly in females and males), embryo resistance allele rates from parental deposition of Cas9 and gRNAs (both maternal and paternal), and additional fitness costs (see Supplemental Results for details). Note that these data is subject to various levels of uncertainty due to data type and sample size. We assumed that fitness costs were from somatic expression of Cas9 and gRNA in drive/wild-type heterozygotes, with no intrinsic fitness cost of the drive itself (such costs appear to be small based on previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolfi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oberhofer et al., 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> contains parameterizations of each modeled drive, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates how each parameter and drive mechanism operates.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Drive mechanisms and effect of drive parameters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Germline resistance allele formation occurs first in drive heterozygotes during reproduction.

According to their data, 93% of X-chromosomes are effectively shredded in the germline.

A second possible alternative interpretation assumes reduced somatic effects in females (nosF2), and a third highly optimistic interpretation assumes no somatic effects at all (nosF3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Drive performance in the panmictic discrete-generation model</title><p>We first simulated the drives in our panmictic discrete-generation model to assess their basic properties, starting with genetic load. Genetic load describes the reduction in reproductive capacity of the population compared to a population that is identical except for being composed entirely of wild-type individuals. In panmictic populations, this measurement often reaches an early peak as the drive allele reaches its maximum frequency, but then slightly declines to a steady value once the drive allele and nonfunctional resistance alleles reach their equilibrium frequency. The rate at which wild-type alleles are converted to drive alleles in the germline of drive heterozygotes is a primary determinant of genetic load. Negative fitness effects associated with the drive can reduce the genetic load, as can the rate at which nonfunctional resistance alleles are formed in both the germline and embryo, though the effect of such alleles is usually not large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaghton et al., 2019</xref>). To eliminate a panmictic population, the drive must induce a sufficiently high genetic load in order to overpower the increased population growth rate at low density. All of the implementations of the <italic>nos</italic> drive were found to have a higher genetic load than the <italic>zpg</italic> drives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), although zpg2 performed well compared to the other <italic>zpg</italic> drives. Notably, the addition of an X-shredder was detrimental to zpg2, with zpg2X’s genetic load reduced by 0.16. Even the highest fitness cost interpretation of <italic>nos</italic> showed a genetic load of 0.96, with the lower fitness cost interpretations scoring even higher. Three of the drives with low equilibrium genetic loads (zpg, zpgX, and zpg2X) actually had higher peak genetic loads shortly after their release, with the genetic load eventually declining to a lower equilibrium due to increased formation of nonfunctional resistance alleles.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Drive allele frequency trajectories in the panmictic discrete-generation model.</title><p>Using default parameters, each drive was released into a panmictic population at 0.5% initial frequency (1% heterozygote release). The average allele frequency as estimated over 100 replicates per drive is plotted per generation. Offspring were artificially generated from fertile individuals at high rates to prevent complete population suppression even at high drive frequencies and genetic loads. For a description of this method for measuring genetic load, see the Supplemental Methods.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79121-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Next, we measured the rate at which the drive spread through the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The addition of the X-shredder substantially improved the speed of both <italic>zpg</italic> drives, with the zpg2 interpretation resulting in considerably higher performance than zpg. This is because the X-shredder was mostly present in males, allowing it to avoid somatic fitness costs in females. The nos drive, with its high fitness cost in both males and females, performed far worse than all the other drives in this regard, seemingly belying its high genetic load; the somatic fitness costs had so great an impact on fertility that the drive could make little headway given a low starting frequency (though the drive still eventually reaches a high equilibrium frequency, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). However, the other <italic>nos</italic> drives performed well, with even nosF outperforming zpg2, although both <italic>zpg</italic> drives with X-shredders spread faster initially.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spatial discrete-generation model</title><p>Previously, we found that drive outcomes in a model with continuous space can substantially differ from those in panmictic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>). In our spatial discrete-generation model, the migration value controls the radius in which a female can find a mate as well as the displacement between a mother and her offspring. The low-density growth rate is a multiplier on female fecundity in the absence of competition. To examine how each drive would behave under various ecological assumptions, we varied these two parameters and recorded whether the simulations resulted in (a) complete suppression without any period of chasing, (b) suppression after a period of chasing, (c) long-term chasing (defined as ongoing chasing when the simulation ends after 1000 generations), (d) drive loss after a period of chasing, or (e) drive loss without chasing (in both drive loss outcomes, the population would be quickly restored to its equilibrium after several generations). In all situations in which chasing occurred, the population size was reduced, though the magnitude of this reduction varied significantly from drive to drive. To this end, we also report the relative average number of fertile females (based on their genotype) starting from the beginning of the period of chasing for each parameter set, with each replicate weighted by the duration of the chase. By ‘relative’, we refer to the absolute number of fertile females during chasing compared to the absolute number of wild-type females present before release of the drive (the number of sterile females plays no role in this consideration). As in a previous study on chasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>), the release of certain drives can cause as much as an order of magnitude decrease to this number.</p><p>As observed in our earlier study on suppression gene drives in continuous space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>), the low-density growth rate had a large impact on drive performance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> display the result of 200 simulations at realistic parameter values for each drive (with a low-density growth rate of 10 and 6, respectively). Under both parametrizations, the zpg drive was unable to fully eliminate the population; instead, long-term chasing occurred in 100% of simulations. However, our alternative parameterization of the drive, zpg2, achieved suppression 28% of the time when the low-density growth rate was 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and 63% of the time when the low-density growth rate was reduced to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). Similar to zpg, the zpgX drive resulted in long-term chasing in almost all simulations, though the average number of fertile females was substantially reduced. However, the alternative parametrization, zpg2X, was less likely to result in long-term chasing, and suppression was observed in 12% of outcomes when the low-density growth rate was 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and 23% of outcomes when it was reduced to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2A</xref>). This is a substantially lower rate than the zpg2 drive, but the average number of fertile females during chases was also somewhat lower.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Outcomes in the spatial models.</title><p>Using default parameters, a low-density growth rate of 10, and with 200 replicates per drive, each drive was released into the middle of a wild-type population.

The panmictic version of this model was used to calculate the genetic load of each drive as well as the speed at which it was able to spread, in the same manner as the discrete-generation model. The genetic load values in the discrete-generation model and the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model were within 1% of one another for each drive parameterization; thus, only a single value is reported for each drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The allele frequency trajectories varied slightly between the two models, but only for drives with X-shredders that biased the sex ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). This occurred because the drive was mostly present in males, which have a shorter adult-stage lifespan than females, thus reducing the overall drive-allele frequency even though frequencies in emerging adults were the same.</p><p>The drives were next assessed in the spatial version of the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Generally, long-term chasing outcomes were more frequent in these simulations than in the discrete-generation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This came with an accompanying decrease in suppression outcomes as well as drive-loss outcomes. For example, in the discrete-generation model with a low-density growth rate of 10, zpg2 was able to suppress the population in 28% of simulations, while the drive suppressed in only 0.5% of simulations in the mosquito model. The average number of fertile females during chasing increased from 2567–4760. In the case of nosF, performance was similarly decreased from suppression in 54% of simulations to only 0.5% of simulations when the low-density growth rate was set to 10, with the average number of fertile females during chasing increasing from 2498–4101. In both models, nosF2 and nosF3 retained the ability to suppress the population. However, in the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model, suppression often occurred only after an initial chase, and only nosF3 could reliably suppress the population in almost every simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The zpg2X drive also performed more poorly in this model. In the discrete-generation model, the drive was able to suppress the population in 10% of simulations, but in the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model, the drive was only able to suppress 0.5% of the time. The reduction in the number of fertile females achieved by both X-shredder drives in this model was also less pronounced and, notably, was inferior for zpg2X as compared to zpg2. This was perhaps because the reduced genetic load of zpg2X outweighed the advantage of the male-bias. All the drives had similarly increased performance when the low-density growth rate was adjusted to 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2B</xref>). This allowed nosF2 to more reliably suppress the population, and the average number of fertile females was lower for all drives.</p><p>We next varied the low-density growth rate from 2 to 12 in steps of 1.0, while varying the migration value from 0.008 to 0.046 in steps of 0.0038 (thus corresponding to the same range that was examined in the discrete-generation model, see methods). The above tendencies mostly held true in this analysis as well (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figures 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig14">14</xref>). Chasing outcomes tended to replace suppression outcomes and dominate large portions of the parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig9">Appendix 1—figures 9</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig11">11</xref>, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">5</xref>).

Various parameter sets for each of these drives were considered, representing alternative explanations for fertility measurements previously conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). We found that the drive that combined a homing drive and X-shredder may actually be less capable of suppressing a population than the original <italic>dsx</italic> drive with the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter alone, particularly in a spatially continuous population. Further, we found that the <italic>nos</italic> promoter may be a preferable alternative for Cas9 expression compared to the <italic>zpg</italic> promoter, depending on which interpretation of the experimental data proves to be the most accurate.</p><p>A series of additional experiments could help ascertain which of our parameter sets most closely reflects the real-world dynamics of these drives. For example, the rate of paternal Cas9 deposition for a given Cas9 promoter could be assessed using a split-drive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Champer et al., 2019</xref>), sequencing, or conducting a fertility assessment of offspring that have a drive-carrier father but that do not themselves inherit a drive allele. Though the exact rate may be somewhat different due to differences in expression at distant genomic loci, such an experiment should still serve to confirm the presence and magnitude of this phenomenon. Batch effects could also have a large impact on fertility measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>), which we have also noticed in our <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Champer et al., 2020c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Champer et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Metzloff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2022</xref>). To address this, fertility experiments should, when possible, be performed with individuals that were raised in the same container (and then subsequently separated by fluorescence, ideally for multiple generations) and preferably even from the same parent (though this is only a readily available option for split-drive systems, especially when drive conversion efficiency is very high, as achieved by most <italic>Anopheles</italic> drives). Such experiments could potentially reveal that the negative fitness effects of the <italic>nos</italic>-Cas9 drive are smaller than initial results indicated. The <italic>nos</italic> promoter still needs to be assessed at the <italic>dsx</italic> target site, but this may prove to be an excellent combination if drive conversion remains high and resistance rates low. In general, further experimental work could also reduce uncertainty regarding these drives, even after the basic mechanisms are resolved.</p><p>Based on our modeling results, it appears that a combined X-shredder system may not represent an improvement to the standard homing suppression drive for a couple of reasons. First, with the alternate parameter set, the genetic load of this drive is lower (even with perfect homing, the 93% shredding rate would yield a genetic load of only 0.87) and is perhaps not high enough to reliably suppress a robust wild population. X-shredders fundamentally induce lower genetic load than female fertility homing drives when at the same germline efficiency, and a combined system can be expected to generally have the characteristics and genetic load of an X-shredder rather than a homing suppression drive, at least when the X-shredding efficiency is fairly high. Second, the drives including the X-shredder do not seem to perform well in spatial simulations, even with higher shredding rates due to drive wave dynamics and stochastic factors at high drive frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>). This held true in our <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific simulations, where the release of these drives usually resulted in long-term chasing with a high average number of fertile females. However, combined X-shredder systems are not without advantages. They can provide a way to support some continued suppression even in the presence of functional resistance alleles (although the rate that such alleles form at <italic>dsx</italic> is unknown and may already be sufficiently low due to the highly conserved nature of the target site, which is essential at the sequence level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>, and it could likely be further reduced by the use of a drive with multiplexed gRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>). Also, because X-shredders bias the population toward males, such systems may effectively reduce biting females (and therefore reduce disease transmission) more quickly than standard homing suppression drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>), although female <italic>dsx</italic> drive homozygotes also cannot bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Among the other drives we considered, the original zpg interpretation does not perform well due to paternal mosaic Cas9 deposition. This tends to greatly reduce genetic load because at high frequencies, female drive carriers (who suffer from paternal deposition) more often inherit their drive allele from a male drive parent because female homozygotes are also sterile. This reduces the maximum frequency that the drive can achieve, and thus its genetic load. Fortunately, the high rate of paternal deposition used to parameterize this variant is not likely to be an accurate interpretation of the data, especially considering the excellent performance of this drive in cage populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). Between the <italic>nos</italic> drives, the increased performance presumably comes from the reduction of somatic fitness costs between nos, nosF, nosF2, and nosF3. Though this does not affect the ultimate genetic load, it substantially affects the rate that these drives increase in frequency. In a spatial scenario, this factor allows the drive to more rapidly convert wild-type alleles into drive alleles, reducing the opportunities for a chasing dynamic to emerge, and allowing the drive to catch up more quickly if chasing does occur. The reasons for the slightly superior performance of nosF compared to zpg2 is less clear. Most likely the slightly increased genetic load and drive rate of increase account for this based on the slightly higher drive conversion and slightly lower germline resistance and fitness cost, despite the higher embryo resistance allele formation rate. Small variation in these parameters, perhaps even within the bounds of experimental error, could result in one or the other of these two drives coming out as superior to the other.</p><p>In general, the results of our <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific continuous space model mirror the outcomes of our earlier generic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>) of suppression gene drives in continuous space, but the drives have substantially greater difficulty eliminating the population. Indeed, in the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model, chasing outcomes were substantially more common, suggesting that chasing may be difficult to avoid when using a gene drive in natural populations unless the drive meets stringent efficiency criteria. These differences between models were likely at least partially due to the fact that competition in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model affects offspring viability rather than female fecundity. Thus, fertile <italic>Anopheles</italic> individuals are not inhibited in reproduction due to competition by sterile individuals, as opposed to fertile females in the discrete-generation model. This ensures a more robust population even under pressure from a drive with a high genetic load when many sterile or otherwise non-contributing individuals (such as excess males due to an X-shredder) are present. The ability of the drive allele to migrate into wild-type populations is also reduced by way of females only mating once, and such reduced migration also tends to promote chasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>). Finally, the higher number of larvae generated by identical adult populations in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model can reduce the chance of stochastic elimination as compared to the discrete-generation model, even in panmictic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>). Future studies could more precisely assess how different fundamental design decisions in continuous space models (e.g. the type of spatial competition and what stages of life competition occurs at) can impact the predicted outcome of different types of suppression drive releases.</p><p>It should be noted that while our <italic>Anopheles</italic> model represents a step toward increased realism compared to a discrete-generation model, our study still has various limitations. For example, distances were unitless (although see Materials and methods for possible comparison to previous field studies), and higher relative dispersal rates in real populations may enable easier suppression. We did not consider the possibility of long-distance migration, which could make chasing more likely by bringing distant wild-type individuals directly into empty areas cleared by the drive, or functional resistance, which can evolve more readily during lengthy chases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>). We also did not take into account other factors that may be important in real-world populations, such as seasonality, interspecies competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2022</xref>), variation in survival rates due to climate or predation, heterogeneous landscapes, nonrandom movement, genetic variation, or the possibility of various types of evolutionary responses to the spread of a suppression drive in the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Champer et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gomulkiewicz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cook et al., 2022</xref>). Our parameterization of the drives was limited by our input data, with small sample sizes in particular causing high error in our estimates of nonfunctional resistance allele formation rates. In general, any modeling study is limited in the level of detail it can provide for predicting the outcome in any particular real-word scenario, especially a scenario as complex as a gene drive release. However, increasing the level of detail present in a model can potentially allow for more accurate predictions. At the very least, modeling studies can identify a possible range of outcomes, which can then provide a useful framework from which to consider possible gene drive deployment options.</p><p>One potentially important implication of these models is that many of the gene drive designs currently under consideration may be quite close to the boundary between drives capable of successful suppression and drives that could be expected to fail due to chasing. For such borderline drives, the outcome of a drive release could be very sensitive to the precise ecological characteristics of the targeted population. Small parameter differences in drive performance could therefore be critical in ensuring drive success, suggesting that currently ambiguous drive characteristics should be thoroughly considered, and all drive parameters should be measured with as much accuracy as possible. At the same time, computational models must be further refined in order to improve their predictive accuracy, such that we can more reliably assess whether a candidate suppression drive indeed meets any specific requirements for success, or to at least understand the most likely outcome.</p><p>In conclusion, our modeling indicates that several promising candidates for suppression gene drives could have substantially different overall effectiveness in spatial mosquito populations than predicted by panmictic population models. Specifically, we believe that a standard homing suppression drive using the <italic>nos</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carballar-Lejarazú et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>) for Cas9 (possibly a high fidelity variant to avoid off-target cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langmüller et al., 2022</xref>) and targeting <italic>dsx (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>) with two or more closely spaced gRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>) may be the optimal combination of currently available tools for population suppression of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Gene drive mechanisms</title><p>All of the gene drives modeled in this study are designed to target a female fertility gene that is essential but haplosufficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Cas9 is directed by a guide RNA (gRNA) to cleave a specific target site located within this gene. Through homology-directed repair, the drive allele then can copy and paste itself into the fertility gene in a manner that effectively inactivates the gene. Since this target gene is haplosufficient, female drive heterozygotes would be fully fertile if Cas9 activity is restricted to the germline (yet most variants we model also have somatic expression that can reduce fertility, see below). However, once the drive allele has spread to a high frequency in the population, an accumulation of sterile drive-homozygous females will cause the population to be reduced or to completely collapse.</p><p>If the cleaved target site does not undergo homology-directed repair but instead is repaired by the error-prone process of end-joining, the resulting mutations may render the site unrecognizable to future Cas9 cleavage. Most of the time, such resistance alleles do not preserve the function of the target gene (these are known as ‘r2 alleles’) and thus generally do little more than slow the spread of the gene drive. A more severe problem is posed by ‘r1’ resistance alleles, which preserve the function of the target gene and can thereby prevent the suppressive effects of the drive. These r1 alleles were not observed in a cage study of a drive that targeted a highly conserved site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>), and the use of multiplexed gRNAs could also limit the formation of such alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>). We assume that one or both of these methods will be effective and therefore only model ‘r2’ resistance alleles in our simulations.</p><p>One of our drives is motivated by a recent study in which a female fertility homing drive and an X-shredder were combined at the same genomic locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simoni et al., 2020</xref>). The X-shredder is designed to cleave multiple sites on the X-chromosome in gametes, rendering them nonviable. This biases the sex ratio towards males because most viable gametes will carry a Y-chromosome. Female gametes that escape destruction may still be sterile since the homing drive disrupts a female fertility gene target as before. Overall, the X-shredder reduces the number of drive females, thereby reducing the influence of drive-based somatic fitness costs in females. Unlike a Driving-Y design, this autosomal X-shredder cannot increase its own inheritance. It relies on the linked homing drive element for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Modeling of gene drive</title><p>In our model, gene drive processes occur independently in each gametocyte of each reproducing individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). A wild-type allele in a drive heterozygote is converted into a resistance allele with a probability equal to the germline resistance allele formation rate, which differs by sex of the individual. We assume that all resistance alleles are ‘r2’ alleles that disrupt the function of the target gene. If the allele remains wild-type, it is converted to a drive allele at a rate equal to the drive conversion rate, which also differs by sex.</p><p>We next model the further potential for resistance to form due to maternal Cas9 deposition into the embryo. This process converts a wild-type allele inherited from a drive-heterozygous parent into a resistance allele with a probability equal to the maternal embryo resistance allele formation rate. In two drive parameterizations, we model paternal Cas9 deposition as well. In the case of paternal deposition, we assume the effects are mosaic based on experimental interpretation (thus only reducing female fertility), rather than affecting all cells in the new offspring. In this case, germline drive conversion still occurs, assuming the individual is drive-heterozygous, but females that receive paternally deposited Cas9 are rendered sterile.</p><p>In this study, we considered drives based on the <italic>nos</italic> and <italic>zpg</italic> promoters for Cas9. The drive could also have an X-shredder (zpgX and zpg2X). However, due to diverging interpretations of existing experimental data, we modeled four possible variations of <italic>nos</italic> drives and two possible interpretations of <italic>zpg</italic> drives. We term these variations nos (without italics), nosF, nosF2, nosF3 (with the latter versions having a lower somatic fitness costs) and zpg (without italics), zpg2, zpgX, and zpg2X (with zpg2 and zpg2X interpreted as not having paternal deposition of Cas9, and instead having a higher somatic fitness cost in females). See the results and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for explanations and parameterizations of each of these drives.</p><p>If the gene drive includes an X-shredder and the father has a drive allele, then the probability that a given offspring will be male is equal to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">X</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> .

The presence of an X-shredder only serves to bias the sex ratio of the offspring, and is not considered to reduce the number of offspring that an individual is expected to leave.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Discrete-generation panmictic simulation model</title><p>See <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for a list of key parameters of all models.

When a suppression drive is first released from the center of the landscape, the population is suppressed radially outward, such that surviving wild-type individuals cluster near the boundaries. This causes Green’s coefficient to increase. However, wild-type individuals that escape into areas previously cleared by the drive are able to produce more offspring as a result of the lack of competition in these areas. If a wild-type population grows into a previously empty area, then Green’s coefficient once again decreases as these individuals occupy more territory. We aimed to capture this inflection point by finding the first local maximum in Green’s coefficient and the first local minimum in the number of wild-type alleles. These events tend to occur within 5 generations of one another. To define the generation when chasing begins in a simulation, we chose the earlier of these two time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title><italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model</title><p>In addition to the discrete-generation models, we implemented refined versions of the models that more explicitly simulate the life-cycle, demography, and ecology of <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitos.

This 5% weekly re-mating value is based on estimates from <italic>A. gambiae</italic> experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomulski, 1990</xref>) and field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tripet et al., 2003</xref>) studies, assuming lower field survival rates.</p><p>After reaching adulthood, females have a 50% probability to successfully produce offspring during any given week if they have previously mated (which takes place before offspring production).

The measured male survival rate in the field was measured as approximately 30% per week in one recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yao et al., 2022</xref>), and often higher in females and closer to 50% in males for older studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González Jiménez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matthews et al., 2020</xref>).

One generation in the discrete model is then equivalent to ~3167 weeks in this model (thus, we ran these simulations for 3167 weeks to represent 1,000 generations).</p><p>Mosquito larvae often face fierce competition for resources in the small bodies of water in which they develop while adults do not directly compete with one another for food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arifin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, population density does not regulate adult fecundity in our <italic>Anopheles</italic> model; instead, it affects juvenile survival. In our model, individuals are considered to be in juvenile stages (egg, larvae, and pupae) during their first two weeks of life and reach adulthood when they enter their third week. The larger week-old larvae do not compete with new eggs, and they cease to compete completely once they reach the pupal stage. However, these larger larvae consume more resources compared to smaller larvae and are thus estimated to exert competition at fivefold strength compared to new juveniles. In the panmictic version of this model, newly generated individuals survive until adulthood with a probability that depends on the global sum of new juveniles <italic>n</italic>, the global sum of week-old larvae <italic>o</italic>, the low-density growth rate <italic>β</italic>, as well as the expected competition within the system, which is in turn a function of the number of adult females in

Note that while juvenile mosquitoes experience continuous mortality in real populations, our model approximates this by determining total juvenile mortality immediately after new juveniles are all generated, representing mortality in both 1-week-old and older juveniles (all juveniles that survive this stage will survive to adulthood). This allows more individuals to be culled immediately, thus reducing the computational burden of evaluating the large number of spatial interactions determining competition, thereby allowing for the simulation of larger populations. This approximation is supported by the fact that larvae in their second week are much larger than newly hatched larvae, thus preventing younger larvae from substantially reducing the resources available to older larvae. Later in their second week, the juveniles are pupae, which do not require additional resources. Thus, new juveniles are not likely to affect the mortality of juveniles that are at least a week older, supporting our approximation of determining mortality only in the first week.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title><italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific spatial model</title><p>In the spatial version of this model, the survival rate of new offspring is affected by the local density of other larvae, rather than global counts thereof. The amount of competition experienced is determined by other new offspring and week-old larvae nearby. The maximum amount of competition contributed by other new offspring is 1.0, which linearly declines to 0.0 at a distance of 0.01 (the average competition contributed by another individual within range is therefore 1/3). Week-old larvae contribute five times as much competition. The expected competition again corresponds to the number of females when the population is at capacity, as well as the expected number of offspring per female:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>25000</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>25</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.285714</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>After determining the amount of competition being faced by a new offspring as compared to the expected competition, the survival rate of that new offspring is set in the same way as in the panmictic version of the model.</p><p>In the <italic>Anopheles</italic> spatial model, surviving adults migrate in the same manner that new offspring are dispersed from their mothers, which is implemented identically to the discrete spatial model except that the migration value now represents the average displacement per week, with the default of 0.0307 creating an equal displacement per generation (males and females together averaging 2.67 displacements in a generation) as well as an equal “drive wave advance speed” to the discrete generation model default of 0.04 (with an average displacement of 0.05).</p><p>Comparing our default dispersal rate of 0.307 to a recent study that found a mean dispersal of 171 m over 20 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yao et al., 2022</xref>), we can potentially state that our mean dispersal corresponds to 101 m per week and that our simulation area length is therefore 3.3 km. A population density of 430 mosquitoes per hectare would thus yield a total population of 470,000 adults, compared to our default of 40,000 (of which 25,000 are females). However, the effective population (more akin to what is generally analyzed in population genetic models) would be substantially below 470,000, and there is substantial density variation between wild mosquito populations. Thus, our modeled population density could be considered reasonable when modeling <italic>Anopheles</italic>, based on length scales from our migration rate. However, it is unclear what parameter value for the density interaction radius would best represent actual mosquito populations, given the varying size and distribution of larval habitat, as well as larval movement. Thus, our value of 0.01 stands in as an estimate, chosen as a low value that is still large enough to avoid extreme variation in individual larval competition when the population is at equilibrium before a drive release.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data generation</title><p>Simulations were run on the computing cluster at the Department of Computational Biology at Cornell University.

Further, it is not always possible to simply average the genetic load measurements from several time steps in a row because the population can cease to exist under the pressure of the drive before sufficient measurement can be made. To remedy this, in simulations specifically seeking to determine genetic load, fertile females had a multiplier applied to the number of offspring they generated in order to approximately maintain the population at capacity given the number of infertile individuals in the system at any given time. Specifically, the number of offspring produced by fertile females was divided by the following population factor:<disp-formula id="equ9"><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Similarly, the numerator term of the measured genetic load was multiplied by this factor in order to account for the excess individuals beyond the number that would normally be present in the next time step.</p><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—table 1.</label><caption><title>Model Demographical/Ecological Parameters.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>All models</bold><break/>Low density growth rate = 6 or 10 (or varies from 2 to 12)<break/>Release amount = 500 new adult male heterozygotes<break/>Competition distance = 0.01<break/>Drive release radius = 0.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Discrete generation model</bold><break/>Time step = one generation<break/>Capacity = 50,000<break/>Maximum offspring = 50<break/>Migration and mating distance = 0.04 (or varies from 0.01 to 0.06)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold><italic>Anopheles</italic> model</bold><break/>Time step = one week<break/>Adult female capacity = 25,000<break/>Female remate chance = 0.05<break/>Fraction of females that reproduce per week = 0.5<break/>Average offspring in one batch = 50<break/>Old larva relative competition contribution = 5<break/>Migration and mating distance = 0.0307 (or varies from 0.008 to 0.046)<break/>Adult female mortality rates (listed by age) = [5/6, 4/5, 3/4, 2/3, 1/2, 0]<break/>Adult male mortality rates (listed by age) = [2/3, 1/2, 0]</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2"><title>Supplemental Results</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s8-2-1"><title>Parameterization of drive candidates</title><p>We first examined drive inheritance from <italic>zpg</italic> promoter drive heterozygous individuals from two studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). Discounting males that did not show biased inheritance (it is likely that resistance formed in such males while they were embryos due to maternally deposited Cas9), the drive conversion rate appears to be 96% for male heterozygotes and 99% for female heterozygotes. We set the germline resistance allele formation rate to be 2% for males and 1% for females so that approximately half of the alleles that fail to undergo drive conversion remain wild-type (these estimates don’t substantially impact our results since we assume that all resistance alleles disrupt the function of the drive). Males with drive mothers (who therefore receive maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNA) that failed to show substantial drive conversion in the germline likely had embryo resistance alleles, as would sterile females with drives mothers. We therefore posit an embryo resistance allele formation rate of approximately 8% based on these frequencies. The authors hypothesized that reductions in female fertility could also be due to paternal deposition leading to resistance allele formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). Based on the rate of sterile female drive carriers with male drive parents, we calculated the paternal resistance allele formation rate as 69%. However, unlike maternal resistance alleles, we consider these paternal resistance alleles to be mosaic at a sufficient level to cause complete female sterility, but not present at sufficient level in the germline to prevent efficient drive conversion (thus, these resistance alleles have no effect on male progeny, in line with experimental data). We then applied a 30% fitness cost in all drive/wild-type heterozygous females to account for the remainder of the reduced fertility of drive females compared to wild-type females, though this reduction could also be interpreted as additional mosaic parental deposition from both drive mothers and fathers.</p><p>However, alternative explanations exist for the reduced fertility in female drive heterozygotes with male drive parents as compared to those with female drive parents. These reduced fertility measurements could be the result of batch effects or simply be random variations. If interpreted in this manner, these fertility reductions can be explained by somatic Cas9 expression and cleavage, with no significant paternal deposition. This is supported by another data set with a different target gene but identical drive components, wherein female heterozygotes had similar fertility regardless of which parent provided the drive allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). Fundamentally, it seems unlikely that paternal deposition causes more embryo resistance allele formation than maternal deposition, considering the relative size of the sperm and the egg. The fact that the zpg drive targeting <italic>dsx</italic> completely suppressed a cage population is also indirect evidence against the drive being so negatively impacted by paternal deposition, as we found that this interpretation of the drive has a relatively low genetic load, which would perhaps be insufficient to suppress a cage population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Specifically, a single fully fertile female mosquito appeared to be able to generate 130 viable larval progeny based on individual crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>). This could mean that 650 eggs (the number used for each generation of the cage) could potentially be generated by as few as five fully fertile females. Even conservatively assuming that 650 eggs yields only 150 adult females, a genetic load of at least 0.97 in a deterministic model is needed to reduce the viable egg count of the next generation to below 650 on average. Though stochastic effects could certainly result in a cage population being suppressed by a drive with a somewhat lower genetic load, stochastic variation represents an increasingly unlikely explanation at lower genetic loads. Finally, previous studies have found no indication of paternal Cas9 deposition in <italic>Drosophila (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Champer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Champer et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Champer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Champer et al., 2017</xref>) and nothing conclusive in <italic>Anopheles</italic>. Evidence of the phenomenon found in <italic>Anopheles</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galizi et al., 2016</xref>) could also potentially be similarly explained as effects caused by leaky somatic Cas9 expression (though significant paternal deposition has been clearly observed with a different nuclease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galizi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Windbichler et al., 2008</xref>). In our models, zpg2 is parameterized to match this alternative explanation. Instead of a 69% paternal embryo resistance allele formation rate, this implementation has a 50% fitness cost from somatic cleavage in female heterozygotes (increased from 30%, thus matching the average fertility reported in two studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>nos</italic> promoter represents a potential alternative to <italic>zpg</italic>’s germline-restricted expression of Cas9. We parameterize this drive based on a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>) that involved targeting the <italic>nudel</italic> gene. Thus, a <italic>nos</italic>-based drive at <italic>dsx</italic> may actually have somewhat different performance parameters (<italic>zpg</italic> based drives were slightly more effective at <italic>dsx</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kyrou et al., 2018</xref> than at <italic>nudel</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we parameterize this drive with a 99% drive conversion in female drive/wild-type heterozygotes, 98% drive conversion in males, 1% germline resistance allele formation for both sexes, and a 14% embryo resistance allele formation rate in the progeny of female drive heterozygotes. In the previous study, the <italic>nos</italic> promoter was less favored than <italic>zpg</italic> because fertility was reduced by 45% in crosses between drive heterozygous females and wild type males as well as in crosses between drive heterozygous males and wild type females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hammond et al., 2021</xref>; ). We model this as a fitness cost from leaky somatic expression and cleavage of Cas9 in both male and female heterozygotes. However, batch effects may have influenced fertility determination in this study, because the wild-type controls for each promoter themselves had substantial differences, Further, there is no clear explanation for somatic cleavage negatively affecting male heterozygotes. We therefore also model an alternative interpretation of the nos drive in which there is no somatic fitness cost in males (which we term nosF), which we consider is likely a more accurate representation of this drive. If we further assume that <italic>nos</italic> male drive heterozygotes do not have a fitness cost from somatic expression and can serve as a control for female drive heterozygotes, then only a 15% fitness reduction from somatic expression in the females (together with the same 14% embryo resistance allele formation rate in the progeny of female drive heterozygotes) can explain their relative fertility. We consider this as another alternative possible parameter set (nosF2). We also model a fourth drive in which there are no somatic fitness costs in either sex, which is within the margin of error of the fertility experiment, though we consider this a highly optimistic parameter set (nosF3).</p><p>We note that all performance parameters for the nosF drive are very similar to the zpg2 drive parameterization. While sample sizes for drive conversion and for fitness calculations are fairly high, our estimate of germline resistance allele formation is based on common modeling convention rather than robust experimental evidence, and our estimate for the embryo cut rate are based on modest sample sizes. Thus, the exact difference between these drives is somewhat uncertain and would require additional experimentation to confirm. Other differences between our drives’ parameter sets are based on qualitative assumptions that provide a clearer contrast for interpretation of results.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Drive allele frequency trajectories in the <italic>Anopheles</italic>-specific model.</title><p>Using default parameters and with 20 replicates per drive, each drive was released into a panmictic population.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and George Perry as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sebald A.N.R Verkuijl (Reviewer #1); Jim Bull (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers are positive overall about your paper. As you will note from the full reviews further below, consistent comments included that model parameter value changes could lead to different quantitative results and the desire for a more explicit discussion of what is leading to the results. In our consultation discussion, there was a clear consensus that these and other points could be addressed with thoughtful text revision rather than major new analyses. In summary:</p><p>1. Expand the justification of your chosen parameters.</p><p>2. Expand discussion of the limitations of your study. Consider both of these points in the context of the perspective of the developers of the zpg drive.</p><p>3. Add a summary of what fundamental drive biology differences may be leading to your results in terms of the drive efficacy differences between the Anopheles-specific and general model. And is the seemingly detrimental effect of adding an X-shredder due to suppressing female abundances or to something else?</p><p>4. Given that gene drives are being evaluated for potential release suitability, the specific focus of this paper may cause it to attract considerable interest from a non-domain expert audience. As such, consider how you might make the writing more accessible to such an audience (including but not limited to explicitly discussing potential limitations of the study as mentioned above, and maybe even modeling in general).</p><p>5. Please also consider each individual item noted in the below reviews, and include how you addressed each comment in your point-by-point responses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Sharing the model code is appreciated. I am unfamiliar with PhP and SLIM and was not able to evaluate the model code in the time I had (a limitation of my review, not a reflection of the paper/model).</p><p>The authors have gone through considerable effort to get parameter estimates from experimental data. This is very much appreciated. Table 1 gives an overview of the parameters used in the model and may give the impression that the distinction between the nos and zpg drives is substantial.</p><p>However, if it is reasonable to explore interpretations of drive data with a 0.45 difference in fitness, I don't think it is meaningful to make a distinction between the common core parameters of the nos and zpg drives (0.02 difference in male HDR, 0.01 difference in male germline resistance, 0.06 difference in maternal embryo resistance rates). It suggests those parameters are known to a far higher certainty than the parameters you vary from drive to drive.</p><p>In my opinion, this difference in core parameters needlessly obscures the comparisons between the nos and zpg drives. For example, I would suggest that zpg2 and nosF are practically equivalent conditions with regard to the accuracy of the parameter estimates and the limitations of any computational model. When there is a substantial difference between these conditions it says more about the sensitivity of the model outputs to the starting conditions than any meaningfully accurate estimate of how nos and zpg would differ under those conditions.</p><p>Another example: I understand that based on a certain interpretation of the experimental data it may be more reasonable to assume the nos drive has no fitness costs than that the zpg drive has no fitness cost. But simulating the no fitness cost scenario only for nos needlessly obscures the fact that is a practically identical approximation (again, in regards to the accuracy of the parameters and limitations of modelling) of how the zpg drive would perform with no fitness costs.</p><p>The authors may consider using the same core parameters for both drives making it easier for the reader to understand what truly underlies the differences between conditions. Allowing comparisons between all 8 conditions, instead of only within 2 groups of 4. Alternatively, the authors can make clear in the text that the difference between the zpg, and nos drives will mostly be due to the fitness/deposition/x-shredding parameters. That realisation also made it much easier for me to understand the results.</p><p>The above point may be superseded by this one: The parameters for the nos drive are taken at the nudel locus. The estimates for zpg-Cas9 are taken at the <italic>dsx</italic> locus. This is despite the fact that the zpg-Cas9 was also tested at the nudel locus and I think performed better there than at the <italic>dsx</italic> locus (the benefit of the <italic>dsx</italic> locus being the reduced possibility of functional resistance alleles). As such, I don't think this is a fair comparison, as the nos drive may well show the same reduction in fitness if moved to the <italic>dsx</italic> locus. And it would not be viable at the nudel locus due to the possibility of functional resistance alleles. The fact that the nos promoter has not been tested at the <italic>dsx</italic> locus is mentioned, but I think it has not been justified why the more 'fair' comparison at the nudel locus has not been used. Even if both nos and zpg would not perform well at the nudel locus in any real-world test, this study draws conclusions about their relative strength. So it still seems that is a more relevant condition.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My major concern is the Anopheles-specific model, including</p><p>1) The robusticity of the parameter estimates informed by literature (e.g., what are their likely confidence intervals), and</p><p>2) The sensitivity of the model to the different parameters chosen. A well-designed table can address point #1, as noted in the Public Review. For point #2, essentially what I would like to know is what is driving the difference between the outcomes of the discrete generation model and Anopheles model (Figure 1)? By rerunning the simulation with intermediate parameters between the two models, can you tell what is predisposing the Anopheles model to long-term chasing? You note that &quot;[t]hese differences between models were likely at least partially due to the high reproductive capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes,&quot; but can this be shown by rerunning the Anopheles model with lower reproductive capacity? Given the stark differences between the outcomes of the two models and the centrality of this difference to your study, I feel such an addition would be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Assuming I did not miss it, the paper lacks overviews of WHY the different constructs give rise to different outcomes. I think the authors should consider providing some kind of heuristic explanation of the main differences. For example, the inclusion of X-shredding with female sterility seems to hurt drive success. Is that for an ecological reason (e.g., the drive's greater efficacy on a local scale provides stronger group selection)? Alternatively, it might be something about drive specifics that is responsible for the effects described.</p><p>Since drive properties may change from lab to lab, it is worth telling the reader whether the important effects observed here are due to properties that may change with subtle improvements in engineering, or are instead due to basic ecological properties that have little to do with construction nuances.</p><p>trivia:</p><p>page 2 of the manuscript: 'we still lack a complete understanding of the effects …' can be said no matter what. The claim could be modified to have some meaning.</p><p>'chaotic' has a specific meaning in analysis. Is that what is meant here, or is the word chosen just to mean irregular?</p><p>page 3: 'Since this target gene is haplosufficient, female drive heterozygotes are potentially fully fertile' I imagine the model assumes full fertility, not potential full fertility.</p><p>page 4: first full paragraph. More detail could be used here. And I am guessing that the point of the dual strategy is that the drive causes an increase in the shredder, but the paragraph seems to omit this basic point.</p><p>'In the zpg and zpgX drives (but not the zpg2 and zpg2X drives)' -- I didn't easily find a description of what those are.</p><p>page 5: I'd like a bit more detail about how the model operates. Maybe a figure or table?</p><p>page 11: 'the drive must induce a sufficiently high genetic load in order to overpower the growth of wild-type populations at low density' Overpowering the growth of wild-type POPULATIONS? This is the panmictic model, so I would expect there are only wild-type genotypes. If my comment does not make sense, it's because I don't know what is being said.</p><p>Figure 1 legend: 'Offspring were artificially generated from fertile individuals at high rates to prevent complete population suppression ' I'm guessing this means that the population would have disappeared if fecundity hadn't been massively boosted. There might be a more direct way to say it. But why not let the population go extinct?</p><p>Page 12, top paragraph. Explain what (a) – (d) mean in population terms.</p><p>Page 15: 'The genetic load values measured by both models was within 1% for all of the drives (Figure 1)' Not clear -- what does 1% for all of the drives mean?

We have added this to our parameterization section. We now also state in the discussion that “parameterization of the drives was limited by our input data, with low sample sizes in particular causing high error in our estimates of nonfunctional resistance allele formation rates.” and that, “further experimental work could also reduce uncertainty regarding these drives, even after the basic mechanisms are resolved.” Finally, we now also tie this aspect more closely to the last part of our discussion in which we call for more experimental work to reduce measurement uncertainty due to the fact that small differences can produce large changes in ultimate outcomes. We have modified one sentence to read as follows, “Small parameter differences in drive performance could therefore be critical in ensuring drive success, suggesting that currently ambiguous drive characteristics should be thoroughly considered, and all drive parameters should be measured with as much accuracy as possible.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In my opinion, this difference in core parameters needlessly obscures the comparisons between the nos and zpg drives.

It is for this reason that male deposition and somatic fitness costs are varied in the <italic>zpg</italic> drives but not the <italic>nos</italic> drives, and that somatic fitness cost in both sexes is varied in the <italic>nos</italic> drives but not the <italic>zpg</italic> drives. The eight resultant variants are thus not just intended as eight well distributed points from a parameter space, but as eight actually possible drives that could be selected from, pending a more complete determination of which parameterizations are most accurate</p><p>If the focus of this manuscript were a full exploration of the parameter space, we would certainly simulate all of the combinations mentioned in this comment, likely producing more heatmaps to allow more parameters to vary. Yet, we believe a core appeal of this project is in relating back to the specific set of drive constructs that have actually been engineered or could be engineered by combining elements that have actually been engineered. In a previous study, we put more effort into continuously varying drive performance parameters (Champer, Kim, et al., in Molecular Ecology, 2021).</p><p>That said, we agree that readers should be directed toward considering these points. In addition to the above listed changes, we now include a full paragraph at the end of our supplemental parameterization set that reads:</p><p>“We note that all performance parameters for the nosF drive are very similar to the zpg2 drive parameterization. While sample sizes for drive conversion and for fitness calculations are fairly high, our estimate of germline resistance allele formation is based on common modeling convention rather than robust experimental evidence, and our estimate for the embryo cut rate are based on modest sample sizes. Thus, the exact differences between these drives are somewhat uncertain and would require additional experimentation to confirm. Other differences between our drives’ parameter sets are based on qualitative assumptions that provide a clearer contrast for interpretation of results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors may consider using the same core parameters for both drives making it easier for the reader to understand what truly underlies the differences between conditions. Allowing comparisons between all 8 conditions, instead of only within 2 groups of 4. Alternatively, the authors can make clear in the text that the difference between the zpg, and nos drives will mostly be due to the fitness/deposition/x-shredding parameters. That realisation also made it much easier for me to understand the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Another way to think about this is that are eight are not exclusively meant to be compared together. They are presented together, but this presentation is the foreground to a set of separate stories. One of these stories is that of determining which interpretation of the zpg drive is most realistic (male deposition versus somatic fitness costs). Another is whether supplementation with an X-shredder is helpful (admittedly, this does depend somewhat on zpg mechanism, so even though we find the male deposition interpretation less plausible, we still combine it with the Xshredder to discuss how this would change things). This thread of our work ends with us favoring the interpretation of zpg with somatic fitness as the more, realistic and determining that a drive without the X-shredder would have superior performance.</p><p>In parallel, we reject male somatic fitness for nos and identify two reasonable parameter sets. One of these is highly similar to zpg (perhaps within the bounds of uncertainty of the parameters) as the reviewer suggests (the drive conversion difference may be a little more reliable, but the germline resistance is just an estimate based on common modeling convention, and the embryo resistance estimate is based on low sample sizes). This difference is still worth some discussion because it shows that some parameters seem to be more important than others. Another element of this goal of the paper is the comparison to the interpretation of the nos drive with reduced female somatic fitness cost, which helps the drive quite a bit. The final nos drive without fitness costs is within the realm of possibility and extends the investigation of somatic fitness cost, but it is also partially included simply because we also wish to show how a drive with near-optimum characteristics can perform!</p><p>A restructuring of the modeling to use the same core parameters might slightly reduce the complexity and total amount of data, but it would also remove a potentially interesting zpg vs nos comparison and perhaps move us slightly further away from a paradigm in which we are attempting to strongly base our paper on experimental results. We believe our choice to base the paper on experimental results will be of greater general interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The above point may be superseded by this one: The parameters for the nos drive are taken at the nudel locus. The estimates for zpg-Cas9 are taken at the dsx locus. This is despite the fact that the zpg-Cas9 was also tested at the nudel locus and I think performed better there than at the dsx locus (the benefit of the dsx locus being the reduced possibility of functional resistance alleles). As such, I don't think this is a fair comparison, as the nos drive may well show the same reduction in fitness if moved to the dsx locus. And it would not be viable at the nudel locus due to the possibility of functional resistance alleles. The fact that the nos promoter has not been tested at the dsx locus is mentioned, but I think it has not been justified why the more 'fair' comparison at the nudel locus has not been used. Even if both nos and zpg would not perform well at the nudel locus in any real-world test, this study draws conclusions about their relative strength. So it still seems that is a more relevant condition.</p></disp-quote><p>Many performance parameters are largely functions of the Cas9 promoter, though target sequence, target gene, and genomic location can certainly be quite important too. We now make it explicit in our main text that <italic>nos</italic> is parameterized based on a different target gene. In fact, at this other target gene, the <italic>zpg</italic> drives performed worse than at <italic>dsx</italic>, so it is possible that <italic>nos</italic> would also actually perform better if designed to target <italic>dsx</italic>.</p><p>We have expanded our discussion of this in the supplemental section about drive parameterization. It now reads:</p><p>“The <italic>nos</italic> promoter represents a potential alternative to <italic>zpg</italic>’s germline-restricted expression of Cas9. We parameterize this drive based on a previous study<sup>18</sup> that involved targeting the <italic>nudel</italic> gene. Thus, a <italic>nos</italic>-based drive at <italic>dsx</italic> may actually have somewhat different performance parameters (<italic>zpg</italic> based drives were slightly more effective at <italic>dsx</italic><sup>6</sup> than at <italic>nudel</italic><sup>18</sup>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>My major concern is the Anopheles-specific model, including</p><p>1) The robusticity of the parameter estimates informed by literature (e.g., what are their likely confidence intervals), and</p><p>2) The sensitivity of the model to the different parameters chosen. A well-designed table can address point #1, as noted in the Public Review.</p></disp-quote><p>For some ecological parameters, confidence intervals don’t exist. Even for our drive parameters, we often could not access the raw data we would need to estimate confidence intervals. However, we have added additional discussion of certain drive performance estimates (see responses to reviewer 1 and accompanying manuscript text changes). We have also added Table S1 to provide an overview of our model parameters.</p><p>For sensitivity of some ecological parameters, we did conduct an analysis varying migration rates and low-density growth rates. For some drive parameters, these can be found in our earlier study using the discrete-generation model (Champer, Kim, et al., in Molecular Ecology, 2021 – the exact numbers would be different in the mosquito model, but the parameter effects themselves would likely be similar).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For point #2, essentially what I would like to know is what is driving the difference between the outcomes of the discrete generation model and Anopheles model (Figure 1)? By rerunning the simulation with intermediate parameters between the two models, can you tell what is predisposing the Anopheles model to long-term chasing? You note that &quot;[t]hese differences between models were likely at least partially due to the high reproductive capacity of Anopheles mosquitoes,&quot; but can this be shown by rerunning the Anopheles model with lower reproductive capacity? Given the stark differences between the outcomes of the two models and the centrality of this difference to your study, I feel such an addition would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>There are three major differences between these models. One of them is the overlapping generations in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model. Another is inclusion of a lifecycle in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model. We suspect that these two differences are not likely to have a large effect on simulation outcomes. The third difference is in the details of density-dependent reproduction. In the discrete-generation model, density affects female fecundity. In the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model, density affects larval viability. We believe that this likely accounts for the main differences between the model outcomes and was what we were alluding to when discussing the high reproductive capacity of mosquitoes (the fundamental reproductive capacity as a function of density is actually similar between the models with the same density curve). In retrospect, this was not the clearest way to explain this, and we have adjusted the text, which now reads:</p><p>“These differences between models were likely at least partially due to the fact that competition in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model affects offspring viability rather than female fecundity. Thus, fertile <italic>Anopheles</italic> individuals are not inhibited in reproduction by sterile individuals like fertile females are in the discrete-generation model. This ensures a more robust population even under pressure from a drive with a high genetic load when many sterile or otherwise non-contributing individuals (such as excess males due to an X-shredder) are present.”</p><p>We have also added (later in the same paragraph):</p><p>“Finally, the higher number of larvae generated by identical adult populations in the <italic>Anopheles</italic> model can reduce the chance of stochastic elimination compared to the discrete-generation model, even in panmictic populations<sup>19</sup>.”</p><p>We hope this gives some additional flavor of a possible explanation for readers interested in the “why” behind differences in model outcomes.</p><p>As for really getting to the bottom of this, we could potentially relax combinations of these three differences between the models, but this would be very computationally intensive and likely requires a sophisticated analysis. It would certainly be quite interesting and likely a worthy topic for a future “fundamentals” manuscript about spatial suppression outcomes. However, in the current manuscript, we are more focused on skipping straight to a continuous space model that is our best attempt at a realistic mosquito population in which we can analyze our specific drive candidates. We have added the following text to the discussion:</p><p>“Future studies could more precisely assess how different fundamental design decisions in continuous space models (e.g., the type of spatial competition and what stages of life competition occurs at) can impact the predicted outcome of different types of suppression drive releases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Assuming I did not miss it, the paper lacks overviews of WHY the different constructs give rise to different outcomes. I think the authors should consider providing some kind of heuristic explanation of the main differences. For example, the inclusion of X-shredding with female sterility seems to hurt drive success. Is that for an ecological reason (e.g., the drive's greater efficacy on a local scale provides stronger group selection)? Alternatively, it might be something about drive specifics that is responsible for the effects described.</p><p>Since drive properties may change from lab to lab, it is worth telling the reader whether the important effects observed here are due to properties that may change with subtle improvements in engineering, or are instead due to basic ecological properties that have little to do with construction nuances.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a complicated question, with potentially different explanations for each comparison. We discussed several aspects of these, but not necessarily in a central location in the manuscript (some of it was scattered in the results). We want to emphasize that for basic comparisons between fundamentally different types of drives, we cover this in much more detail in Champer, Kim, et al., in Molecular Ecology 2021. For this study, there are three important points that we believe account for performance differences:</p><p>1. Genetic load.</p><p>2. Presence of an X-shredder.</p><p>3.
