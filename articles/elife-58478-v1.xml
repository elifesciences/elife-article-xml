processes but their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here, we map circRNA inventories of mouse embryonic stem cells, neuronal progenitor cells and differentiated neurons and identify hundreds of highly expressed circRNAs. By screening several candidate circRNAs for a potential function in neuronal differentiation, we find that <italic>circZNF827</italic> represses expression of key neuronal markers, suggesting that this molecule negatively regulates neuronal differentiation. Among 760 tested genes linked to known neuronal pathways, knockdown of <italic>circZNF827</italic> deregulates expression of numerous genes including nerve growth factor receptor (<italic>NGFR</italic>), which becomes transcriptionally upregulated to enhance NGF signaling. We identify a <italic>circZNF827</italic>-nucleated transcription-repressive complex containing hnRNP-K/L proteins and show that knockdown of these factors strongly augments NGFR regulation. Finally, we show that the ZNF827 protein is part of the mRNP complex, suggesting a functional co-evolution of a circRNA and the protein encoded by its linear pre-mRNA host.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circular RNA</kwd><kwd>neuronal differentiation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>RNA-binding proteins</kwd><kwd>transcriptional regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17OC0028804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollensen</surname><given-names>Anne Kruse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF15OC0017598</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollensen</surname><given-names>Anne Kruse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R140-2013-13425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hollensen</surname><given-names>Anne Kruse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R289-2018-1504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damgaard</surname><given-names>Christian Kroun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008363</institution-id><institution>Danish Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R167-A11105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kamstrup</surname><given-names>Andreas Bjerregaard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002739</institution-id><institution>Aarhus Universitets Forskningsfond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NOVA grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomsen</surname><given-names>Henriette Sylvain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A neuron-specific circular RNA keeps neuronal differentiation in check by lowering transcription rates from key neuronal marker genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian non-coding transcriptome, which includes long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), plays pivotal roles in biological decisions during differentiation and normal cell maintenance (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chekulaeva and Rajewsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deveson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kopp and Mendell, 2018</xref>). Even though circRNAs were already identified several decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capel et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kos et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nigro et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanger et al., 1976</xref>), they only recently have emerged as a large class of abundant noncoding RNAs that exhibit cell-type- and tissue-specific expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Salzman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzman et al., 2012</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chekulaeva and Rajewsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebbesen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salzman, 2016</xref>). CircRNAs are generated by the canonical spliceosome in a non-linear backsplicing fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cocquerelle et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pasman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzman et al., 2012</xref>). During circRNA biogenesis, flanking intronic sequences are thought to bring splice sites within critically close proximity, either by direct basepairing between inverted repeats (e.g. Alu-repeats) or facilitated by interactions between flanking intron-bound RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Conn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebbesen et al., 2017</xref>). Most circRNAs are primarily localized to the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Salzman et al., 2012</xref>), and recent evidence suggests that nuclear export of circRNAs in human cells is influenced by the size of the given molecules, where larger circRNAs (&gt;800 nucleotides) are dependent on DExH/D-box helicase UAP56 (DDX39B), whereas smaller species are dependent on URH49 (DDX39A)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Several reports have provided evidence that circRNAs play important roles in various fundamental cellular processes. Well-described examples are the <italic>CDR1as/ciRS-7</italic> and <italic>Sry</italic> circRNAs that function to negatively regulate <italic>Mir7-1</italic> and <italic>Mir138-1</italic> activity, respectively, by sequestration (miRNA sponging), leading to increased mRNA expression of their respective miRNA-targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hansen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>). However, it has also been suggested that the majority of circRNAs are likely not bonaÂ fide miRNA sponges, simply due to relatively low copy numbers and a low number of miRNA-binding sites per molecule, leaving efficient miRNA regulation ambigous in many cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chekulaeva and Rajewsky, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebbesen et al., 2017</xref>). Examples of circRNAs acting as binding scaffolds for RBPs, or RBP sponges, which in turn affect their canonical function in forÂ example pre-mRNA splicing and protein translation, have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelmohsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>). Nuclear variants coined exon-intron circular RNAs (EIciRNAs), have, due to their retention of intronic sequences, been shown to promote transcription by recruitment of U1 snRNP to transcription units by a not fully clarified mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Many abundant circRNAs originate from the 5â end of their precursor transcripts, often giving rise to backsplicing into parts of the 5âUTR of their linear relative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). The prevalence af these AUG circRNAs suggests that at least a subset of circRNAs could have protein-coding potential via a cap-independent translation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stagsted et al., 2019</xref>). This is consistent with both early studies of Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRES) placed in a circRNA context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Sarnow, 1995</xref>), as well as more recent studies reporting examples of translation-competent circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AbouHaidar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Legnini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pamudurti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). However, global analyses of hundreds of ribosome profiling and mass-spec datasets, suggests that these few examples are specialized events, and not a generally applicable function of circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stagsted et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>RNA-sequencing of RNA isolated from mouse and human tissues along with various cell lines suggests that circRNAs are most abundantly expressed in the brain, compared to other tissues and that circRNAs are particular enriched in neuronal synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). In line with this, cells derived from both embryonal carcinoma (P19) and neuroblastoma (SHSY-5Y) subjected to neuronal/glial differentiation show tightly regulated circRNA expression profiles during neuronal development, that include upregulation of numerous common circRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Piwecka et al., demonstrated that a <italic>ciRS-7</italic> knockout mouse displayed downregulated <italic>Mir7-1</italic> levels, alterations in sensorimotor gating associated with neuropsychiatric disease and abnormal synaptic transmission, suggesting that <italic>ciRS-7</italic> and <italic>Mir7-1</italic> are important for normal brain function in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Piwecka et al., 2017</xref>). Adding to the complexity of this regulatory network, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), <italic>Oip5os1</italic> (also coined <italic>Cyrano)</italic>, promotes the destruction of <italic>Mir7-1</italic>, which in turn upregulates <italic>ciRS-7</italic> by a still unidentified mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kleaveland et al., 2018</xref>). One circRNA, <italic>circSlc45a4</italic>, which is very abundant in the cortex of the mouse and human brain, has recently been shown to negatively regulate neuronal differentiation, both in cell cultures and in developing mice, where its knockdown dysregulates the balance between specialized cortex neurons by unknown molecular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suenkel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite these intricate molecular interactions between circRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA, many important questions regarding neuronal differentiation and function remain unanswered. For example, it is largely unknown how the tightly controlled expression of circRNAs potentially affects neuronal development. Here, we present the circRNA inventory of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), neuronal progenitor cells (NPC) and differentiated glutamatergic neurons, which represents a well-established model for CNS-type neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bibel et al., 2007</xref>). We report thousands of RNase R-resistant circRNAs of which many are differentially regulated during neuronal development. In a screen for circRNA function using an established human model for neuronal differentiation, we identify <italic>circZNF827</italic> as a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation. Although being almost exclusively localized to the cell cytoplasm, the nuclear population of this circRNA impacts several genes of relevance in neuronal differentiation, at the level of transcription, including nerve growth factor receptor (<italic>NGFR</italic>), which becomes robustly upregulated upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown. Mechanistically, our evidence suggests that <italic>circZNF827</italic> is a necessary scaffold for a transcription-repressive complex containing its own host-encoded protein; ZNF827, together with hnRNP K and hnRNP L.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The circRNA profile of mESCs changes markedly upon neuronal differentiation</title><p>To determine whether circRNAs can influence neuronal differentiation, we initially mapped the circRNA inventories at different stages of neuronal differentiation and compared these to other available circRNA datasets of neuronal origin from mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>). Identification of circRNAs from RNA-seq experiments has often been based on quantification of relatively few reads across the circRNA backsplicing junction (circBase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">GlaÅ¾ar et al., 2014</xref>), and current circRNA prediction algorithms inevitably lead to the calling of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeck and Sharpless, 2014</xref>). Hence, to immediately validate the circular nature of <italic>to-be</italic> called circRNAs, we first performed standard rRNA depletion and subsequently either included or excluded RNase R treatment step prior to RNA-sequencing. Specifically, we used an established differentiation model for CNS-type glutamatergic neurons, based on E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) that reportedly yields a purity of glutamatergic neurons ofÂ &gt;90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bibel et al., 2007</xref>). RNA was isolated from three stages of differentiation, mESCs, neuronal progenitor cells (mNPCs) or neuronal differentiation day 8 (mN8) and rRNA depleted (+/-Â RNase R) prior to library preparation and RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Successful differentiation at the mNPC and mN8 stages was confirmed by the appearance of elongated intercellular dendritic extensions (mN8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and robust upregulation of several classical neuronal markers including, <italic>Ntrk2</italic>, <italic>Map2</italic>, and <italic>Tubb3</italic> (mNPC and mN8), while stem cell pluripotency marker <italic>Nanog</italic> became significantly reduced upon differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Using available circRNA prediction tools CIRI2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), find_circ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>) and CIRCexplorer2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) on the non-RNase R-treated RNA, we identified between 792â1167 circRNAs in mESC, 2230â2893 circRNAs in NPC and 1902â2316 circRNAs in differentiated neurons at mN8 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Upon RNase R treatment most circRNAs either remained unchanged or became enriched, but a considerable fraction of the predicted circRNAs in mESC, mNPC, and mN8 preparations, became depleted by the 3ââ5â exonuclease (CIRCexplorer2: 19.5â36.5%; CIRI2: 7.2â16.6%; find_circ: 38.7â52.3% depleted) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). All prediction algorithms showed a correlation between expression level and RNase R resistance, suggesting that mostly low-count circRNAs candidates are likely false positives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). From a total of 3581 enriched circRNAs after RNase R treatment (all stages), 1449 circRNAs overlapped between all three circRNA prediction algorithms, and this subset represents a high-confidence circRNA inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We next assessed the <italic>circular-to-linear</italic> ratio of identified circRNAs (find_circ), by comparing splice site usage in circular vs. linear splicing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Memczak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rybak-Wolf et al., 2015</xref>).

As expected for these highly expressed RNA-binding proteins, both proteins associate with <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA, but in the case of hnRNP L, the IP/input ratios wereÂ ~18 fold higher for <italic>circZNF827</italic>, whereas hnRNP K displayed a similar enrichment of <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA as of <italic>circZNF827</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Scrutinizing the <italic>circZNF827</italic> sequence for putative-binding sites for hnRNP K and -L using eCLIP datasets (ENCODE consortium), proved unfeasible due to low expression levels of the <italic>ZNF827</italic> gene in the K562 and HepG2 cells used by ENCODE. Using RBPmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Paz et al., 2014</xref>), which is based on established RBP consensus binding sequences, revealed a potential high-affinity cluster for primarily hnRNP L binding and one site for hnRNP K in the most 3â part of the circle-encoding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). According to <italic>circZNF827</italic> secondary RNA structures predicted by Mfold, these binding sites are located into mostly single-stranded regions within the circRNA, consistent with the binding preferences of most hnRNP proteins toward single-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). To further characterize these interactions, we prepared a stable HEK293 Flp-In T-rex cell-line expressing <italic>circZNF827</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1EâF</xref>) under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (tet-on), based on the laccase vector system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kramer et al., 2015</xref>). We then performed RIP by immunoprecipitation of endogenous hnRNP K or -L and observed a remarkable enrichment of exogenous <italic>circZNF827</italic>, compared to control IgG or <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). hnRNP L gave a particularly high IP/Input ratio (&gt;200 fold enrichment over IgG), consistent with the results from: (1) the L-AN-5 RIP, (2) the pull-down LC-MS/MS experiment and (3) the prediction of several hnRNP L binding site clusters in <italic>circZNF827</italic>.

To this end, publicly available ChIP-seq data (ENCODE consortium) in K562 and HepG2 cells demonstrate that hnRNP K indeed interacts with transcription regulatory regions (promoter proximal) of the <italic>NGFR</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). To determine the <italic>circZNF827</italic>-dependence of a hnRNP K-containing complex that docks at the promoter region of <italic>NGFR</italic> gene in L-AN-5 cells, we next performed hnRNP K ChIP in the presence or absence of <italic>circZNF827</italic> and assayed for the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter region by qPCR. Our results show that hnRNP K engagement at the NGFR promoter is decreased upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown compared to the <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), which displayed constant transcription rates in our previous BrU pulse labeling assay. We next wondered how this circRNP complex can interact with chromatin. It was recently demonstrated that hnRNP K partakes in a complex with chromatin-bound KRAB-domain zinc finger proteins (KRAB-ZNFs), and that hnRNP K is necessary for recruitment of a transcription inhibitory SETDB1/KAP1 complex, which catalyzes H3K27 trimethylation and heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that ZNF827 protein, which does not harbor a discernible KRAB domain, could interact with either hnRNP K and/or its encoded circRNA and perhaps link this transcription repressive complex to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter. To test this hypothesis, we first conducted a ZNF827 ChIP experiment and probed for an interaction with the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter region in the presence or absence of <italic>circZNF827</italic>. Indeed, our results suggest that ZNF827 interacts with the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter and that the signal was significantly diminished upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a similar reduction in signal at the <italic>RARA</italic> promoter region, which we had previously found to be moderately, yet significantly, upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). To address whether ZNF827 and hnRNP K interact, we next performed ZNF827 immunoprecipitation and found it to strongly associate with hnRNP K and to a lesser extent with hnRNP L in nucleoplasmic extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, left). Upon sonication of the remainder from the Triton X-100 extracted cleared lysates (chromatin enriched), we observed an even stronger association of hnRNP K with ZNF827, further suggesting that the complex is chromatin bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, right). When assessing the ability of ZNF827 to interact with <italic>circZNF827</italic>, we observed a strong enrichment over IgG (~18 fold), and ZNF827 protein co-immunoprecipitated <italic>circZNF827</italic> more efficiently than <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA (~19 fold more enriched) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Finally, we performed ZNF827 knockdown to test whether this would also augment expression of <italic>NGFR</italic> as observed upon hnRNP K/-Â L knockdown. Indeed, we observed a strong upregulation of <italic>NGFR</italic> upon ZNF827 knockdown, an effect that was further augmented in a <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6GâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our results are consistent with a model where <italic>circZNF827</italic> represses <italic>NGFR</italic> transcription (and likely many other genes, including <italic>RARA</italic>) by bridging a hnRNP K/L-contaning inhibitory complex with their genomic loci, facilitated by the ZNF827 protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>circZNF827 is part of the chromatin-bound hnRNP-ZNF827 complex</title><p>Mechanistically, an important outstanding question is whether <italic>circZNF827</italic> nucleates the hnRNP-ZNF827 complex to potentially prepare/activate it for engagement with chromatin, or whether <italic>circZNF827</italic> itself, is part of the chromatin-bound complex. To address this question, we first cloned a <italic>circZNF827</italic> expression construct, which includes a sequence encoding 2 X MS2 hairpins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and established stable inducible HEK293 cells (HEK293-<italic>circZNF827</italic>-MS2). Next, we transfected these cells, HEK293 control cells (Empty) or HEK293-<italic>circZNF827</italic>-WT (lacking MS2 hairpins) with a plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged MS2 coat protein (FLAG-MS2cp) and subsequently performed anti-FLAG ChIP analysis, to test whether the FLAG-tagged MS2cp becomes crosslinked to the NGFR promoter via <italic>circZNF287</italic>-2XMS2.

Among 3581 RNase R-resistant circRNAs, only 1449 were called by all three algorithms, suggesting that caution should be taken when predicting circRNAs from RNA-seq data and that including multiple prediction algorithms and/or an RNase R step prior to RNA-seq is beneficial.</p><p>Analyzing circRNA expression over the three neuronal developmental stages, we identified 116 differentially expressed circRNAs (&gt;2 fold change).

NGFR is a member of the TNF superfamily of receptors and relays, along with three paralogous receptor tyrosine kinases (NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3), signals from the four mammalian neurotrophins (Nerve Growth Factor (NGF)), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NTF3) and neurotrophin 4 (NTF4)Â [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bothwell, 2016</xref>].

However, we did observe strongly augmented <italic>FOS</italic> expression (immediate early gene) upon treatment of L-AN-5 cells with NGF, when circZNF827 was downregulated, which suggests that NTRK1-mediated NGF response becomes enhanced by increased <italic>NGFR</italic> expression. It is possible that <italic>NGFR</italic> is induced to increase death-signaling, as a result of skewed and sub-optimal stoichiometry between key neuronal markers/effectors (e.g. <italic>NTRK2</italic>, <italic>NEFL</italic>, <italic>TUBB3</italic>, and <italic>MAP2</italic>). Such a scenario might be part of a normal surveillance system that monitors a strict and sequential appearance of differentiation factors; however, this awaits further disclosure in more physiologically relevant cell- and animal models.</p><p>Mechanistically, several lines of evidence support a model in which <italic>circZNF827</italic> plays a direct role in the transcriptional repression of the <italic>NGFR</italic> and <italic>RARA</italic> loci, potentially as a scaffolding-RNA for a hnRNP K/-L-ZNF827 containing complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). <italic>NGFR</italic> mRNA decay rates remain unchanged upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown, while stready-state levels increase three-Â toÂ fourfold. Knockdown of <italic>circZNF287</italic> resulted in significantly higher BrU incorporation rates in <italic>NGFR</italic> pre-mRNA and an increased association of PolII at the NGFR promoter. Importantly, hnRNP K and ZNF287 association with the NGFR promoter was decreased upon <italic>circZNF287</italic> knockdown. In addition, depletion of either hnRNP K, -L, or ZNF827, which all interact robustly with <italic>circZNF827</italic>, strongly augmented the transcriptional induction by <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown. We observed strong focal nuclear condensates containing endogenous hnRNP K and -L proteins in HEK293 Flp-in T-Rex cells stably expressing <italic>circZNF827</italic>. Although such condensates may be non-physiological entities (phase-separated hnRNPs), induced by high local concentrations of <italic>circZNF827</italic>, these results suggest that the circRNA could function as a scaffold that nucleates hnRNP K and -L, although not readily visible in the microscope when <italic>circZNF827</italic> levels are significantly lower.</p><p>It is well established that hnRNP K participates in transcriptional repression. hnRNP K can bridge classical DNA-binding KRAB-ZNF proteins and a KAP1/SETDB1-containing complex, which in turn facilitates heterochromatin formation â also in the <italic>NGFR</italic> gene of ES cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thompson et al., 2015</xref>). A similar mechanism was described by Huarte and collegues, where a p53-induced <italic>lincRNA-p21</italic> interacts with hnRNPK, which facilitates silencing of several downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, transcriptional stimulation, rather than repression, has been reported for intron-containing circRNAs (ElciRNAs), via recruitment of U1 snRNP to the transcriptional complex on their parental genes, which by definition requires exon-intron boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>CircZNF827</italic> is a regular exonic circRNA, without intronic sequences (data not shown), perhaps explaining why it represses transcription as opposed to ElciRNAs. Another circRNA, <italic>circSlc45a4</italic>, was recently also shown to negatively regulate neuronal differentiation, both in cell cultures and in developing mice, where its knockdown dysregulates the balance between specialized cortex neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suenkel et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, our ChIP, RIP and co-IP results all suggest that the protein-product originating from the <italic>circZNF827</italic>-encoding pre-mRNA host, ZNF827, links hnRNP K/-Â L-<italic>circZNF827</italic> to chromatin, via its DNA-binding capacity, similar to known roles of KRAB-ZNF proteins. If so, <italic>circZNF827</italic> co-regulates target genes along with its precursor-encoded protein, which argues for co-evolutionary selection pressure to preserve both circRNA-generating and protein-coding sequences. <italic>circMBNL1</italic> has also been shown to regulate the activity of its cognate protein product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashwal-Fluss et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that this phenomenon could be a common theme that awaits further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Sequences of all primers and probes used in the study are specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2c-e</xref>.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Hollensen and coworkers identified the circRNA at different various neuronal differentiation stages using three different circRNA prediction tools and found circZFP827 together with other circRNAs have temporal expression patterns during differentiation. The authors decided to focus on circZFP827 and showed that downregulation of <italic>circZNF827</italic> increases the expression of several neuronal genes and reduces the S-phase fraction. Later, the authors found that circ-FP827 controls the expression of two retinoid receptors (RARa and RARg) posttranscriptionally. Using Nanostring, the authors showed that <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown increases the expression of several neuronal genes (<italic>NGFR</italic>, etc.) and subsequently a known downstream gene of <italic>NGFR</italic>, c-fos. To understand how <italic>circZNF827</italic> regulates the expression of downstream genes transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally, the authors performed pull-down followed by LC-MS/MS and identified hnRNP K and L as its main interactors. Next, the authors found out that knocking down of circZFP827 increases the cytoplasmic level of hnRNP K and overexpressing of circZFP827, in contrast, generates multiple distinct nuclear foci. Finally, the authors showed that circZNF287 downregulates <italic>NGFR</italic> transcription by interacting with hnRNP k inhibitory complex and the ZNF827 protein.</p><p>While the reviewers find the paper to be of interest, there are several points that require clarification with additional data before the paper can be considered for publication. The key points relate to the copy number of nuclear <italic>circZNF827</italic> and its mechanism of action through affecting nuclear RNA binding proteins hnRNPK and hnRNPL.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' model is that the small (10%) amount of the circRNA that is present in the nucleus has a functional role via interacting with hnRNP K and L. This is possible but more direct functional experiments should be included to justify the model. For example, the authors should express dishRNA-resistant versions of <italic>circZNF827</italic> and show that the wildtype circRNA rescues the <italic>NGFR</italic> expression phenotypes but a circRNA with mutated K and L binding sites does not. The authors should also use a technique like ChIRP to show direct binding of the circRNA to the <italic>NGFR</italic> locus.</p><p>2) The retinoic acid receptor data (Figure 3) is poorly integrated into the rest of the manuscript and the data quality is weak. The supplemental figure shows that RARalpha has a slight (20%) increase in transcription that is insufficient to explain the mRNA effect sizes in the main figure. There is no significant change in RARgamma transcription or decay rates, yet the mRNA expression is increased. Most critically, the authors have failed to connect the proposed hnRNP K/L based mechanism (Figures 5-7) to RAR transcriptional regulation.</p><p>3) The biochemical data supporting a complex comprising hnRNP K and L is weak and confusing. hnRNP K can pull down a little bit of L, but hnRNP L pull down does not appear to pull down K (Figure 5E, 6D). This is relevant to the author's main model as the circRNA can efficiently bind L, but hnRNP K is the one that seems to be having the transcriptional control role.</p><p>4) Some circRNAs in group 4 (Figure 1E) do not have the same expression pattern upon validation in qPCR (Figure 1G) (see circEZH2, circZFP827). If <italic>circZNF827</italic> represses neuronal genes and knocking down <italic>circZNF827</italic> upregulates pan neuronal genes (<italic>Tubb3</italic>, <italic>Map2</italic>, <italic>Nefl</italic> and <italic>TrkB</italic>, Figure 2B), it is counterintuitive to see the circ expression level upregulated during differentiation by RT-qPCR (Figure 1G, the color scale should be replaced to allow proper visualization)?</p><p>5) The authors showed that there are putative hnRNP-L or K binding sites in <italic>circZNF827</italic> (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Would the deletions or mutations of hnRNP-L or K binding sites in <italic>circZNF827</italic> disrupt its interactions with hnRNP-L or K and later the <italic>circZNF827</italic>-hnRNPK/L-ZNF827 binding to the promoter of <italic>NGFR</italic>?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58478.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors' model is that the small (10%) amount of the circRNA that is present in the nucleus has a functional role via interacting with hnRNP K and L.

Our model is based on the finding that <italic>circZNF827</italic> is regulating <italic>NGFR</italic> at the transcriptional level, which could potentially be an indirect effect, although hnRNPK (and now also ZNF827) binding to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter is decreased upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown, and although we observe nucleation/phase separation of endogenous hnRNPK and -L upon overexpression of <italic>circZNF827</italic>.</p><p>Previously, we had already conducted experiments with overexpression of <italic>circZNF827</italic> (on top of the endogenous level) from a lentiviral Laccase2-driven circRNA expression system in differentiated L-AN-5 cells. Curiously, this did not alter expression from <italic>NGFR</italic>, <italic>NEFL</italic>, <italic>TrkB</italic>, <italic>MAP2</italic> or <italic>TUBB3</italic>, suggesting either of three scenarios (not necessarily mutually exclusive): 1) that the level of <italic>circZNF827</italic> is already saturated, 2) that high expression will lead to non-physiological titration effects, or 3) that the backsplicing junction found only in the endogenous circRNA is important for its structure, regulation and function.</p><p>Rescue experiments are inherently difficult to conduct for circRNAs compared to protein-coding mRNAs, for 2 main reasons: 1) It is difficult to control exogenous circRNA expression levels due to its ultra-high stability, and 2) Since efficient circRNA expression vectors that generate high-levels of circRNA (relative to undesired linear precursor RNA or concatemer RNAs) often have predesigned splice sites (e.g. the Laccase2 system), which will produce a circRNA with a different backsplicing junction, this structure may be important for the function of the endogenous circRNA. Thus, with current circRNA expression vector technologies, there is a <italic>case-by-case</italic> trade-off between efficiently producing a significantly different circRNA with potentially altered structure and function and a more subtle mutant with low circularization efficiency.</p><p>With these limitations in mind, and to directly address the reviewerâs point, we conducted a series of knockdowns using dishRNAs and attempted to rescue upregulation of <italic>NGFR</italic> by expressing two newly cloned variants of dishRNA-resistent (changed backsplicing junction) circRNAs from a laccase2-driven lentiviral vector: Full-length <italic>circZNF827</italic> or a hnRNPK/L binding site deletion mutant (very poorly bound by hnRNPK/L in RNA-immunoprecipitation experiments â see below in comments to point 5). High expression (using 3 different MOIâs) of the full-length laccase2-driven <italic>circZNF827</italic>, left <italic>NGFR</italic> expression unaltered, at best only marginally lowered as judged by western blotting analysis (no significant change in biological triplicates). Similarly, at the level of RT-qPCR, we did not observe a normalization of the upregulation of <italic>NGFR</italic> expression. However, the hnRNP K/-L binding site mutant circRNA was, as would be expected, unable to change <italic>NGFR</italic> expression levels back to the normal.</p><p>As stated above, we conclude that there are likely sequences, or structures, surrounding the backsplicing junction, that are important for the function of the produced dishRNA-resistant circRNA. Also, expression levels might still be too high and difficult to decrease without leaving a large proportion of cells untransduced, which is not a feasible option, when re-introducing expression and assaying biochemically from bulk culture. Additionally, we predict that the timing of re-expression relative to knockdown could also be important not to exceed a âpoint of commitmentâ of <italic>NGFR</italic> upregulation, leaving additional time-consuming optimizations of MOIâs and timings of superinfections very unfeasible.</p><p>Still, to further solidify our model, we have now performed knockdown of both <italic>circZNF827</italic> and ZNF827 itself, since the circRNA host-encoded protein is an integral part of the circRNA-hnRNPK/L complex. In support of our model, the double knockdown further increases the output from <italic>NGFR</italic> significantly, as was also the case for hnRNPK/L and <italic>circZNF827</italic> co-depletions. In addition, we have now performed biological triplicate ChIP assays using both hnRNP K and ZNF827 antibodies to show that these factors are indeed recruited to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter, and that this recruitment is significantly lowered upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown. We believe that these new results, and further results below, support our model and strengthen our conclusions considerably. The results have been integrated into Figure 6C-D, F-H and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should also use a technique like ChIRP to show direct binding of the circRNA to the NGFR locus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the evidence for a direct (or hnRNPK/L/ZNF827 complex-mediated) interaction of <italic>circZNF827</italic> with the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter (and potentially other promoters) is circumstantial and could be strengthened. In order to address this issue, we find the suggested ChIRP-DNA strategy unsuitable, in this particular case, for two main reasons: First, the circRNA of interest is only 402 nt long and is predicted to be bound along almost the entire one side of its suggested structure by hnRNPK/L at presumably single-stranded and accessible regions â this is now confirmed by our new RIP analyses using the hnRNPK/L binding site mutant of <italic>circZNF827</italic> (see below in comments to point 5). This leaves very little room for design of a suitable number of appropriate tiling probes and control probes (probes that have been shifted to control for direct probe binding and off-target effects). We have previously performed ChIRP to capture another short circRNA for subsequent mass spectrometry analyses without positive results. In comparison, the Chang lab, who carefully developed the procedure, used 48 probes to map genomic interactions sites for HOTAIR lncRNA, which is 2200 nt in length (Chu et al., 2011). In addition, 43 probes were used to the interacting proteome for the 17000 nt long XIST lncRNA and a prominent ChIRP-MS study conducted on circRNA targets (Chen et al., 2017), used 8 and 15 probes, respectively, to pull-down two exogenously expressed circRNAs of approximately 1500 nt each. We therefore predict a poor pull-down efficiency given the limited ability of designing a suitable number of probes. Second, another caveat using this strategy, is that any probes designed to target the short <italic>circZNF827</italic>, will also target its linear host pre-mRNA and its fully processed mRNA, potentially giving rise to false positive signals or out-titration of the probes. Thus, we anticipate that ChIRP will be inefficient and take much optimization and therefore remains unfeasible.</p><p>As alternative approaches, we conducted two independent experiments: First, we cloned a 2 x MS2 hairpintagged version of <italic>circZNF827</italic>, which retains its putative hnRNPK/L binding sites (Figure 7A). We established inducible stable HEK293S Flp-In T-Rex cell lines expressing these constructs. Using these cells for transfections with FLAG-MS2 coat protein expression constructs, we performed anti-FLAG ChIP RT-qPCR with amplicons for the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter region. By this setup, we observed an enriched <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter signal for the MS2tagged <italic>circZNF827</italic> cell line as compared to non-MS2 tagged or non-circRNA controls, while the low control GAPDH promoter-signal remained constant in all cases (Figure 7B). We conclude that the MS2-tagged circZNF287 is also localized to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter region in accordance with our model. Importantly, hnRNPK and -L both interact with MS2-tagged circRNA in RNA immunoprecipitation assays (similar to <italic>circZNF827</italic> WT affinity) (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1). Second, since ZNF827 interacts with hnRNPK/L and <italic>circZNF827</italic>, we performed ChIP of endogenous ZNF827 in L-AN-5 cells to address whether the host protein also interacts with the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter. Indeed, our results showed an enrichment of ZNF827 at the promoter when <italic>circZNF827</italic> is present in cells, while its knockdown significantly diminishes the occupancy of ZNF827 at the promoter (Figure 6D). This places hnRNPK, ZNF827 and importantly, <italic>circZNF827</italic> at the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter, consistent with a likely nucleation-mechanism and repression of transcription. Most importantly, the recruitment of both ZNF827 and hnRNP K/L to the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter is dependent on <italic>circZNF827</italic>. These results have considerably strengthened our model and have been integrated into Figure 6 and 7, along with a discussion in the main text as indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The retinoic acid receptor data (Figure 3) is poorly integrated into the rest of the manuscript and the data quality is weak. The supplemental figure shows that RARalpha has a slight (20%) increase in transcription that is insufficient to explain the mRNA effect sizes in the main figure. There is no significant change in RARgamma transcription or decay rates, yet the mRNA expression is increased. Most critically, the authors have failed to connect the proposed hnRNP K/L based mechanism (Figures 5-7) to RAR transcriptional regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the effects on Retinoic Acid Receptor Î± (RARa) and Î³ (RARg) expression are only moderate and in the latter case not significant in terms of BrU pulse-measured transcription. To strengthen these data and to integrate them better into the hnRNP K/L-ZNF827 regulatory model as suggested, we have performed ChIP-qPCR of hnRNPK and ZNF827 on the promoter of the RARa gene (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D). Importantly, and as observed with the <italic>NGFR</italic> promoter, we detect less docking of hnRNPK and ZNF827 during <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown, indicating that the hnRNPK/L-regulatory model is likely not limited to the <italic>NGFR</italic> locus. The reason for the small, yet significant, increase in BrU incorporation (RARa) upon <italic>circZNF827</italic> knockdown (compared to steady-state level) might be a temporal issue, when comparing steadystate levels (5-6 days in the making â knockdown/differentiation) to short-pulse-measured transcription rates at that given point in time. This discrepancy is now discussed in the manuscript as indicated by track-changes. We believe that we have now integrated the observed, albeit moderate, effects on the RARa expression with the hnRNPK/L-ZNF827 model, and that this justifies its inclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The biochemical data supporting a complex comprising hnRNP K and L is weak and confusing. hnRNP K can pull down a little bit of L, but hnRNP L pull down does not appear to pull down K (Figure 5E, 6D). This is relevant to the author's main model as the circRNA can efficiently bind L, but hnRNP K is the one that seems to be having the transcriptional control role.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the results of the co-immunoprecipitations were not entirely clear. Of note, several previous studies have detected a direct interaction between hnRNPK and -L in different cellular settings (e.g. Kim et al., 2000 or Li et al., 2015). Regarding the co-IPs using FLAG-tagged versions shown in Figure 5D, we do observe that the longer isoform of hnRNP L pulls down hnRNP K. Longer exposures of the other mentioned co-IPs (Figure 5E and 6E) indeed show that hnRNP L can co-immunoprecipitate hnRNP K well above IgG control. New and extra panels with longer exposures have been included in Figures 5E and 6E. The reason for less hnRNP K pulldown by hnRNP L, than the other way around, is probably due to the fact that the anti-hnRNP L antibody is less efficient as an IP-grade antibody than the anti-hnRNP K antibody. This will inevitably produce lower signal in the hnRNP K westerns. In addition, both proteins are very abundant with multiple functions and many other interaction partners, which explains that not all of either protein population will interact with the other hnRNP-protein (i.e. stoichiometrically uneven ratio between the proteins depending on the antibody used for immunoprecipitation). In addition, this type of regulation at the transcriptional level, likely does not require many of such hnRNP-circRNA complexes per cell, so the observed âseemingly weakâ interactions in these biochemical assays are likely physiologically relevant. Our additional biochemical data using RIP and ChIP also supports this interaction. We believe that the new figures now demonstrate a <italic>bona fide</italic> interaction between hnRNP K and -L, as documented by others before us.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some circRNAs in group 4 (Figure 1E) do not have the same expression pattern upon validation in qPCR (Figure 1G) (see circEZH2, circZFP827). If circZNF827 represses neuronal genes and knocking down circZNF827 upregulates pan neuronal genes (Tubb3, Map2, Nefl and TrkB, Figure 2B), it is counterintuitive to see the circ expression level upregulated during differentiation by RT-qPCR (Figure 1G, the color scale should be replaced to allow proper visualization)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the color scaling is poor and this has now been changed. We also agree that the expression patterns are not identical based on RNA-seq and RT-qPCR analyses, respectively (e.g. circEZH2 and circZFP827), which is likely due differences in data normalization. While in the RT-qPCR transformed Ct-values are normalized to GAPDH the heatmap displays RPM-normalized reads (based on CIRI2 algorithm, Materials and methods). These two profiles will become different and as GAPDH also changes slightly upon differentiation (likely slightly changed metabolism in cells starting to exit the cell cycle), resulting in a somewhat skewed picture. Assessing both methods, it is clear that both circZFP827 and circEZH2 become upregulated from mESCs to neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) and then expression either flattens or goes slightly down at the neuron stage. We do not believe that it is necessarily counterintuitive that an apparent inhibitor of differentiation initially becomes upregulated upon differentiation only to be reduced at the latest stage of this process. <italic>circZNF827</italic> might function to âtap on the brakesâ in the beginning of differentiation until certain processes have been correctly initiated and then at a later stage, after commitment to differentiation, become downregulated again. This issue is now included in the discussion. To align the RTqPCR results better with the RNA-seq data, we have chosen another normalization gene, Vinculin, which is more constant. These data are now included and the color scale has been modified for a clearer distinction between circRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors showed that there are putative hnRNP-L or K binding sites in circZNF827 (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). Would the deletions or mutations of hnRNP-L or K binding sites in circZNF827 disrupt its interactions with hnRNP-L or K and later the circZNF827-hnRNPK/L-ZNF827 binding to the promoter of NGFR?</p></disp-quote><p>Corroborating our models, we have now conducted RNA-immunoprecipitations with hnRNP K/L deletion mutant and found that they no longer efficiently interact with neither hnRNP K nor hnRNP L. Likewise, the rescue experiments described in 1) show that this mutant cannot inhibit the <italic>NGFR</italic> upregulation by knockdown of the endogenous <italic>circZNF827</italic> as expected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
