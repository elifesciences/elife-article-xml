autosomal recessive retinopathy caused by mutations of the NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis enzyme NMNAT1. Despite the ubiquitous expression of NMNAT1, patients do not manifest pathologies other than retinal degeneration. Here we demonstrate that widespread NMNAT1 depletion in adult mice mirrors the human pathology, with selective loss of photoreceptors highlighting the exquisite vulnerability of these cells to NMNAT1 loss. Conditional deletion demonstrates that NMNAT1 is required within the photoreceptor. Mechanistically, loss of NMNAT1 activates the NADase SARM1, the central executioner of axon degeneration, to trigger photoreceptor death and vision loss. Hence, the essential function of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors is to inhibit SARM1, highlighting an unexpected shared mechanism between axonal degeneration and photoreceptor neurodegeneration. These results define a novel SARM1-dependent photoreceptor cell death pathway and identifies SARM1 as a therapeutic candidate for retinopathies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal degenerations</kwd><kwd>NAD+</kwd><kwd>SARM1</kwd><kwd>NMNAT1</kwd><kwd>LCA9</kwd><kwd>axonal degeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG013730</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS087632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiAntonio</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA219866</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiAntonio</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY019287-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Apte</surname><given-names>Rajendra S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Needleman Center for Neurometabolism and Axonal therapeutics</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DiAntonio</surname><given-names>Aaron</given-names></name><name><surname>Milbrandt</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward N. &amp; Della L.

LCA is the most common cause of blindness in children and about 70% of LCA cases are associated with mutations in genes related to the visual cycle, cGMP production, ciliogenesis, or transcription. Recently, more than thirty mutations in the nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 were identified in patients with autosomal recessive LCA type 9Â (LCA9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perrault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koenekoop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppieters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the ubiquitous expression of this key NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis enzyme, LCA9 patients have no other systemic deficits outside the retina. In many cases, LCA9 associated mutant NMNAT1 proteins retain enzymatic activity and other biochemical functions, but appear to be less stable under conditions associated with cell stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref>). While it is clear that NAD<sup>+</sup> deficiency in the retina is an early feature of retinal degenerative disorders in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zabka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>), it is not known which cell types and biological pathways are primarily affected in LCA9.</p><p>NMNAT1 plays important roles in diverse retinal functions. Overexpression of NMNAT1 in mouse retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) robustly protects against ischemic and glaucomatous loss of the axon and soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>), while conditional ablation in the developing mouse retina causes severe retinal dystrophy and loss of retinal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eblimit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). Mice harboring <italic>Nmnat1</italic> mutations (V9M and D243G) exhibit severe retinal degeneration while the most common LCA9 mutation (E257K), which is not fully penetrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siemiatkowska et al., 2014</xref>), induces a milder retinal degeneration phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eblimit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Greenwald et al., 2016</xref>). In retinal explants, NMNAT1 promotes the survival of mouse retinal progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuribayashi et al., 2018</xref>). The requirement for NMNAT in retina is evolutionarily conserved, as the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMNAT isoform, dNMNAT, is required for the survival of photoreceptor cells after exposure to intense light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhai et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The selective loss of photoreceptor cells in LCA9 suggests the survival and function of these cells are extremely sensitive to deranged NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism. Indeed, many of the enzymes involved in photoreceptor function are dependent on NAD<sup>+</sup> as a cofactor, and for some of these proteins mutations in their corresponding genes lead to blindness. These include variants in the NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADPH dependent retinal dehydrogenases like RDH12 that cause LCA13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuster et al., 2007</xref>) and the GTP synthesis enzyme IMPDH1 that causes retinitis pigmentosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kennan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bowne et al., 2002</xref>). SIRT3, the mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylase is also important for photoreceptor homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin et al., 2019</xref>). Together, these observations highlight the importance of cytosolic NAD<sup>+</sup> dependent pathways in retinal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin and Apte, 2018</xref>); however, the molecular roles of nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> and NMNAT1 in the retina are largely unknown.</p><p>Multiple enzymatic pathways utilizing distinct metabolic precursors participate in NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Verdin, 2015</xref>). However, in each case, these pathways converge at an NMNAT-dependent step that generates either NAD<sup>+</sup> or its deamidated form NaAD from the precursor NMN or NaMN. Among the three mammalian NMNAT isoforms, NMNAT1 is the only enzyme localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berger et al., 2005</xref>). However, in photoreceptors NMNAT1 is present in photoreceptor outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with an additional, extra-nuclear role of NMNAT1 in photoreceptor cells. This is of particular interest because engineered non-nuclear variants of enzymatically-active NMNAT1 can potently inhibit pathological axon degeneration, which is commonly observed in the early stages of many neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Babetto et al., 2010</xref>). When NMNAT1 is present in the axon, it can compensate for the injury-induced rapid loss of NMNAT2, the endogenous axonal NMNAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>). NMNAT2 in turn, inhibits SARM1, an inducible NAD<sup>+</sup> cleavage enzyme (NADase) that is the central executioner of axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figley and DiAntonio, 2020</xref>). Hence, mutations in NMNAT1 may promote retinal degeneration through the direct impact on NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis and/or through the regulation of the SARM1-dependent degenerative program.</p><p>In this study, we determined the cell types and molecular mechanisms that cause retinal degeneration in LCA9. Using NMNAT1 conditional mutant mice, we showed that photoreceptors degenerate rapidly after the loss of NMNAT1 and that depletion of NMNAT1 in rod or cone cells is necessary and sufficient for the retinal degeneration. The AAV-mediated gene replacement of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors partially rescues the visual impairment caused by loss of NMNAT1. Finally, we determined the mechanism by which loss of NMNAT1 leads to photoreceptor degeneration. Loss of NMNAT1 leads to activation of SARM1 in photoreceptors, much as loss of NMNAT2 leads to SARM1 activation in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>). Moreover, photoreceptor degeneration is mediated by SARM1 in the absence of NMNAT1, much as axon degeneration and perinatal lethality is mediated by SARM1 in the absence of NMNAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, photoreceptor neurodegeneration in LCA9 shares a deep mechanistic similarity to the pathological axon degeneration pathway. Since the SARM1 pathway is likely druggable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiAntonio, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krauss et al., 2020</xref>), these findings provide a framework for developing new therapeutic strategies for treating patients with LCA9 and potentially other retinal disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>NMNAT1 is a nuclear enzyme that synthesizes NAD<sup>+</sup>, an essential metabolite that is central to all aspects of cellular metabolism. NMNAT1 is indispensable for mouse development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conforti et al., 2011</xref>) and recent studies identified causative mutations in <italic>NMNAT1</italic> in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis type 9 (LCA9), a disorder associated with severe, early-onset retinal degeneration and vision loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Falk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perrault et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koenekoop et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppieters et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). Patients with LCA9 have no systemic involvement outside the eye, suggesting that certain cells within the retina are particularly vulnerable to the loss of NMNAT1 function. Since no specific antibodies exist for immunocytochemical analysis of NMNAT1 localization, we determined its expression pattern in the retina using mice expressing an NMNAT1-lacZ fusion protein without the nuclear localization signal. Mice heterozygous for this mutant allele were viable and were used to map NMNAT1 expression by staining retinal sections with X-gal. LacZ staining was detected in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), photoreceptor outer segments (OS), inner segments (IS), outer nuclear layer (ONL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), and ganglion cell layer (GCL) suggesting the ubiquitous expression of NMNAT1 in retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>LCA9 patients are mutant for NMNAT1 throughout the body, yet their defects are limited to the eye. In an effort to model this, we generated a global knockout using <italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>: CAG-CreERT2</italic> mice harboring homozygous <italic>Nmnat1</italic> floxed alleles (<italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) and <italic>CAG-CreERT2</italic>, which expresses a tamoxifen-activated Cre recombinase from the ubiquitous actin promoter. We chose a conditional approach because NMNAT1 knockout embryos are lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conforti et al., 2011</xref>). We treated 2-month-old <italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>: CAG-CreERT2</italic> and control mice with tamoxifen. We first used RT-PCR to measure <italic>Nmnat1</italic> mRNA in the retina at 21 days after tamoxifen and found that it was significantly decreased in NMNAT1 cKO (<italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>: CAG-CreERT2</italic> + tamoxifen) compared with wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). To investigate the metabolic consequence of NMNAT1 deletion, we measured the levels of NMN, the substrate for NMNAT1, and NAD<sup>+</sup>, the product of NMNAT1, in the retina at 25 days after tamoxifen injection. There is a significant increase in levels of NMN, presumably because it cannot be consumed by NMNAT1. There is also a mild decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup> in NMNAT1 cKO mice, although this is not statistically significant, suggesting that other NMNAT enzymes are an additional source of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We next evaluated retinal pathology at 4 weeks after <italic>Nmnat1</italic> excision using biomicroscopy. Fundus images showed abnormalities including attenuation of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> arrowhead) and the appearance of a honeycomb structure, suggesting exposure of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> arrow) in the mutant animals. Histopathological examination of the retina with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained sections showed severe retinal degeneration as evidenced by the reduction of the retina thickness and the thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at 4 weeks post tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Quantitative analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of retinal thickness, especially of the ONL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>).

While previous reports show that <italic>Nmnat1</italic> is necessary for appropriate retinal development, our pathological and functional analyses of conditional deletion of NMNAT1 in two-month-old mice demonstrates that NMNAT1 is also necessary for photoreceptor cell maintenance and mature retinal functions.</p><p>In addition to NMNAT1, mammalian cells encode two other NMNAT isoforms; NMNAT2 that is localized in the Golgi and cytosol, and NMNAT3 that is localized inside the mitochondria. Since the loss of NMNAT1 induced retinal degeneration, we wished to determine the role of NMNAT2 and 3 in the retinal structure/function. A previous study showed that NMNAT2 knockout mice are perinatally lethal and have truncated optic nerves as well as peripheral axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Slivicki et al., 2016</xref>). We could not assess the role of NMNAT2 in retinal function due to the lack of conditional knockout mice. On the other hand, NMNAT3 deficient mice (NMNAT3 KO) are viable with splenomegaly and hemolytic anemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>). We generated NMNAT3 KO mice and investigated their retinal function using ERG. Consistent with the previous report, NMNAT3 KO mice showed splenomegaly (data not shown), however, there were no defects in ERG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that NMNAT3 is dispensable for retinal function, suggesting NMNAT1 is the functionally dominant isoform controlling retinal phenotype.</p><p>Identifying the cells that are vulnerable to NMNAT1 loss is key to understanding LCA9 pathogenesis. The severe loss of the ONL nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) induced by NMNAT1 deletion prompted us to test whether loss of NMNAT1 specifically in photoreceptors would result in their death and recapitulate the phenotype observed using the widely expressed <italic>CAG-CreERT2</italic>.

At 6-weeks-of-age we examined these mutant mice histologically, but did not detect any gross abnormalities, presumably due to the low number of cones (only 3% of total photoreceptors) in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C,E</xref>). However, ERG analysis showed a complete loss of the photopicÂ b-wave, which is derived from cone photoreceptors. This functional result demonstrates that NMNAT1 activity is vital for cone function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). In summary, these genetic ablation experiments demonstrate the importance of NMNAT1 for proper function and survival of both rods and cones, and indicate that LCA9-associated retinal degeneration is likely due to the direct cell-autonomous effects of <italic>NMNAT1</italic> mutations in photoreceptors.</p><p>The loss-of-function studies above demonstrate that NMNAT1 is necessary in photoreceptors for proper retinal function. Next we assessed whether viral-mediated expression of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors in an otherwise NMNAT1 deficient animal is sufficient to promote retinal function. First, we developed a system for retinal expression of transgenes. We subretinally delivered AAV8(Y733F) containing the photoreceptor-specific human rhodopsin kinase (hGRK1) promoter driving GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boye et al., 2013</xref>). Virus was injected into the subretinal space of two-month-old wildÂ type mice. Transgene expression was evaluated 4â6 weeks post-injection. AAV-mediated GFP expression was observed in a subset of rhodopsin-positive cells but was weak in the inner nuclear layer (INL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). These results confirm earlier reports that the hGRK1 promoter restricts transgene expression primarily to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kay et al., 2013</xref>). We next asked whether AAV-mediated expression of HA-tagged human NMNAT1 could prevent retinal degeneration caused by <italic>Nmnat1</italic> excision. Two-month-old <italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>; CAG-CreERT2 mice</italic> received subretinal injections of AAV-NMNAT1 in one eye, and control vector (AAV-GFP) in the contralateral eye. We confirmed the expression of NMNAT1-HA in a subset of outer nuclear cells and a minor population of inner nuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Mice that received AAV-NMNAT1 and AAV-GFP were then treated with tamoxifen to deplete endogenous NMNAT1. One month after tamoxifen treatment, we examined retinal function. Despite the expression of NMNAT1 in only a subset of photoreceptors, we observed significantly increased scotopic a-wave amplitudes in AAV-NMNAT1 treated retinas compared with retinas injected with AAV-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Hence, NMNAT1 gene delivery to photoreceptor cells significantly improved their function in this LCA9 model.</p><p>We next sought to determine the molecular mechanisms required for retinal degeneration in the NMNAT1-deficient retina. In injured peripheral nerves, the loss of NMNAT2 induces an increase in NMN that is hypothesized to activate SARM1-dependent axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Our metabolomic analysis revealed that NMN is increased in the NMNAT1-deficient retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and previous studies have detected SARM1 in mouse and bovine photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Datta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Menon et al., 2019</xref>). These results raised the possibility that the increased retinal NMN activates SARM1 NADase activity, inducing NAD<sup>+</sup> loss and cellular degeneration in the retina. To test this hypothesis, we crossed <italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>:CAG-CreERT2</italic> mice with SARM1 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Szretter et al., 2009</xref>) to generate <italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>: CAG-CreERT2:Sarm1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Nmnat1</italic> was excised in these mice via tamoxifen administration at 2 months of age (NMNAT1 cKO: SARM1 KO). First, we assessed SARM1 activation via measurement of cADPR, a product of the SARM1 NAD<sup>+</sup> cleavage enzyme and a biomarker of SARM1 activity as well as NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sasaki et al., 2020</xref>). While the loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> was not statistically significant at 25 days post tamoxifen injection in NMNAT1 cKO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), there was significant loss of NAD<sup>+</sup> at 29 to 32 days post tamoxifen in NMNAT1 cKO but not in NMNAT1Â cKO:Â SARM1 KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These data suggest activation of the SARM1 NADase in NMNAT1-deficient retina. Consistent with this idea, we also observed a significant increase of cADPR in NMNAT1 cKO retina in a SARM1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hence, SARM1 is activated by the loss of NMNAT1. Next, we assessed retinal degeneration. While there is a dramatic loss of ONL nuclei 32 days post tamoxifen injection in NMNAT1 cKO retina, there was no obvious loss of ONL cells in NMNAT1 cKO: SARM1 KO retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâE</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed no reduction of retinal and ONL thickness in NMNAT1 cKO:SARM1 KO retina compared with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>) in sharp contrast to the dramatic loss of retinal and ONL thickness in the NMNAT1 cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Moreover, there was no detectable loss of ONL nuclei in NMNAT1 cKO:SARM1 KO compared with WT, demonstrating that SARM1 is necessary for photoreceptor cell death induced by the loss of NMNAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We next examined the functional consequences of NMNAT1 depletion in the presence or absence of SARM1 using ERGs, and again found that loss of SARM1 prevented the severe loss of both scotopic and photopic responses due to NMNAT1Â deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4IâK</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that loss of NMNAT1 leads to the activation of SARM1, and that SARM1 is required for the subsequent photoreceptor degeneration and loss of visual function. Therefore, the essential function of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors is to inhibit SARM1, and inhibition of SARM1 is a candidate therapeutic strategy for the treatment of LCA9.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Depletion of SARM1 rescues retinal degeneration in the NMNAT1-deficient retina.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Metabolite analysis by LC-MSMS in retinal tissues from WT, NMNAT1 conditional knockout (<italic>Nmnat1<sup>fl/fl</sup>: CAG-CreERT2</italic> + tamoxifen at 29 to 32 days post tamoxifen injection: NMNAT1 cKO), or NMNAT1 cKO:SARM1 KO mice were shown.

In addition, cell-type specific deletion of NMNAT1 in early postnatal photoreceptors is sufficient to induce retinal degeneration. Hence, NMNAT1 is required for the survival and function of both developing and mature photoreceptors. Using a modified AAV8 vector and the human rhodopsin kinase promoter to express NMNAT1, we demonstrated that a gene replacement strategy can improve retinal function in this model of LCA9. Finally, we defined the molecular mechanism by which NMNAT1 promotes photoreceptor function and survival. In photoreceptors, loss of NMNAT1 leads to activation of the inducible NADase SARM1 and the SARM1-dependent degeneration of photoreceptors. This finding defines a common mechanism operant in both photoreceptor degeneration and pathological axon degeneration. Loss of NMNAT1 in photoreceptors or NMNAT2 in axons leads to the SARM1-induced death of photoreceptors or axons, respectively. This surprising result extends our understanding of both the mechanisms causing retinal degeneration and the potential role of SARM1 in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Figley and DiAntonio, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman and HÃ¶ke, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Retinal NAD<sup>+</sup> homeostasis is crucial for visual function and NAD<sup>+</sup> decline is a hallmark of many retinal degenerative disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Reduced NAD<sup>+</sup> induces mitochondrial dysfunction in photoreceptor cells and affects activity of SIRT3, which protects the retina from light-induced and other forms of neurodegeneration. In addition, NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent enzymes play crucial roles in phototransduction including the regeneration of the photosensitive element, 11-cis-retinal, and the regulation of photoreceptor membrane potential. Moreover, mutations in the genes encoding some of these enzymes cause retinal degenerative disease. For example, mutations in all-trans-retinal dehydrogenase (RDH12) that is localized to photoreceptor cells are associated with LCA13. Combined deletion of retinal dehydrogenases, RDH12 and RDH8, results in mouse retinal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maeda et al., 2009</xref>). NAD<sup>+</sup> is also a cofactor for inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH1), which is the rate limiting enzyme for GTP synthesis and, in turn, is required for cGMP production. cGMP is indispensable for the regulation of photoreceptor membrane potential and calcium concentration upon light stimulation. IMPDH1 mutations cause both a dominant form of retinitis pigmentosa (RP10) and LCA11. These results highlight the central role of NAD<sup>+</sup> metabolism in the photoreceptor.</p><p>NMNAT1 is the only NMNAT enzyme localized to the nucleus in mammals and is crucial for nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. Despite the broad functions of nuclear NAD<sup>+</sup> in all cell types, the sole consequence of LCA9-associated <italic>NMNAT1</italic> mutations is retinal dysfunction/degeneration without systemic abnormalities. Previous studies, and our results, show early loss of photoreceptor cells in NMNAT1-deficient retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eblimit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In photoreceptors NMNAT1 may localize not only in the nucleus but also outside the nucleus, since a subcellular proteomics study showed the existence and enrichment of NMNAT1 in the photoreceptor outer segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Single-cell transcriptomic RNA analysis also found <italic>Nmnat1</italic> in rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Menon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lukowski et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with an extranuclear role for NMNAT1 in photoreceptors, in these studies cytosolic NMNAT2 was either not identified or was found at much lower levels than NMNAT1. NMNAT3 is the mitochondrial NMNAT, and we show here that it is dispensable for retinal homeostasis and function, further highlighting the central requirement for NMNAT1 in photoreceptors.</p><p>Having demonstrated that NMNAT1 is required in photoreceptors in this model of LCA9, we showed that viral-mediated gene replacement in photoreceptors is capable of improving retinal function. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a naturally occurring, non-pathogenic virus used in gene therapy studies to restore structure and function to diseased cells. Recently, the U.S. FDA approved an AAV-RPE65 vector as a therapeutic reagent for LCA2 and other biallelic RPE65 mutation associated retinal dystrophies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apte, 2018</xref>). Theoretically, LCA9 caused by the loss of NMNAT1 function is a reasonable target for AAV-mediated gene therapy. To achieve expression in photoreceptors, we used an AAV8 variant that is a highly efficient for transducing photoreceptors following subretinal injection as well as the hGRK1 promoter that has activity exclusively in rods and cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kay et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boye et al., 2013</xref>). Delivery of AAV8(Y733F)-hGRK1-NMNAT1 prior to deletion of NMNAT1 resulted in partial improvement of the retinal phenotype, in particular the scotopic a-wave, of mice deficient for NMNAT1.Â Future studies will assess the efficacy of gene replacement after deletion of NMNAT1 to more closely mimic the human condition.</p><p>Since NAD<sup>+</sup> plays such a central role in photoreceptors, the identification of the NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthetic enzyme NMNAT1 as the cause of LCA9 suggests that photoreceptor degeneration in LCA9 is due the reduction in NAD<sup>+</sup> synthesis. Surprisingly, we demonstrate here that this is not the essential function for NMNAT1 in photoreceptors. Instead, NMNAT1 is required to restrain the activity of the prodegenerative NADase SARM1. When NMNAT1 is deleted from SARM1 KO photoreceptors, the photoreceptors do not die and but instead maintain their physiological function, demonstrating that these cells do not require NMNAT1 as long as SARM1 is not present. This finding is perfectly analogous to the relationship between NMNAT2 and SARM1 in the axon. NMNAT2 KO mice are perinatal lethal and have dramatic axonal defects, but NMNAT2, SARM1 double KO mice are viable and have a normal lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>). NMNAT enzymes inhibit the activation of SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>), potentially by consuming the NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor NMN, which is postulated to activate SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Prior to our current study, loss of NMNAT2 was the only known trigger of SARM1 activation. Our current work suggests that SARM1 is activated by the loss of any NMNAT enzyme whose activity is not redundant with another NMNAT isoform. NMNAT2 is the only cytosolic NMNAT in the axon, and so loss of axonal NMNAT2 leads to localized activation of SARM1 and axon degeneration. In photoreceptors, NMNAT1 is not only nuclear but also likely extranuclear, and NMNAT2 is apparently present at very low levels. Hence, in photoreceptors loss of NMNAT1 triggers activation of SARM1 which consumes NAD<sup>+</sup> and triggers cell death. As NAD<sup>+</sup> loss is a common pathology of many retinal diseases, this raises the possibility that SARM1 activation may contribute to a wide range of retinal disorders. In support of this conjecture, recent studies found that SARM1 promotes retinal degeneration in X-linked retinoschisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molday et al., 2007</xref>) and rhodopsin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ozaki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our identification of SARM1 as the executioner of photoreceptor death in this model of LCA9 opens up new therapeutic possibilities. We previously developed a potent dominant negative SARM1 variant and demonstrated that AAV-mediated expression of dominant negative SARM1 strongly protects injured axons from degeneration in the peripheral nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geisler et al., 2019</xref>) and is also effective in a neuroinflammatory model of glaucoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). While NMNAT1 gene replacement is a potential treatment option for LCA9, if SARM1 plays a more general role in retinal degeneration, then using gene therapy to express this dominant negative SARM1 could not only treat LCA9, but also multiple retinal neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, SARM1 is an enzyme and so small molecule enzyme inhibitors would be another attractive treatment modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DiAntonio, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krauss et al., 2020</xref>). These findings demonstrate the utility of dissecting the molecular mechanism of degeneration in diseases of retinal neurodegeneration. In the case of LCA9, these studies identified a SARM1-dependent photoreceptor cell death pathway and discovered the heretofore unknown commonality between the mechanism of retinal neurodegeneration and pathological axon degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (mouse, male and female)</td><td valign="top">Nmnat1 <sup>FRTgeo;loxP</sup></td><td valign="top">EUCOMM</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5782147">MGI:5782147</ext-link></td><td valign="top">C57BL/6J to generate NMNAT1 knockout mouse</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (mouse, male and female)</td><td valign="top">CAG-CreERT2</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">004682, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:004682">IMSR_JAX:004682</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Whole body Cre transgenic mouse:C57BL/6J</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (mouse, male and female)</td><td valign="top">Rho-Cre</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2005</xref></td><td valign="top">Rhodopsin- iCre75</td><td valign="top">Rod-specific Cre transgenic mouse:C57BL/6J</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (mouse, male and female)</td><td valign="top">OPN1LW-Cre</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Le et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top">human red/green pigment-Cre, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:032911">IMSR_JAX:032911</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Cone-specific Cre transgenic mouse:C57BL/6J</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">NMNAT1</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sasaki et al., 2015</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Rhodopsin (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat# ab3267, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_303655">AB_303655</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# 3724, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1549585">AB_1549585</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">GAPDH mouse</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TGCCCCCATGTTTGTGATG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">GAPDH mouse</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TGTGGTCATGAGCCCTTCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">NMNAT1 mouse</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">AGAACTCACACTGGGTGGAAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">NMNAT1 mouse</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top">PCR primers</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CAGGCTTTTCCAGTGCAGGTG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">AAV8(Y733F)</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zolotukhin et al., 2002</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">CRL-1573 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0045">CVCL_0045</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Used for AAV virus production</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse</title><p>Animal studies were carried out under approved protocols from animal studies committee at Washington University.

Vectors were then concentrated and buffer exchanged into Alcon BSS (sodium-155.7 mM, potassium- 10.1 mM, calcium- 3.3 mM, m- 1.5 mM, chloride- 128.9 mM, citrate- 5.8 mM, acetate- 28.6 mM, osmolality- 298 mOsm) supplemented with Tween 20 (0.014%). Virus was titered by qPCR relative to a standard and stored at â80CÂ° as previously describedÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacobson et al., 2006</xref>). HEK293 cells used for producing AAV were purchased directly from ATCC who applies appropriate quality controls for maintaining and confirming identification of these lines. HEK293 cells were used more than two years ago for viral production and thus could not be authenticated now. HEK293 cells are passaged 50 times before discarding culture and thawing new vial. Short tandem repeat profiling is performed annually to authenticate the cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Subretinal injections</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (70â80 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally. The pupil was dilated with 1% tropicamide and topical anesthesia (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution) was also applied to the eye. A self-sealing scleral incision was made by using the tip of a 31 G needle with the bevel pointed down. Then a 33G needle on a Hamilton syringe was inserted into the scleral incision and 1 Âµl of AAV containing solutions were injected in the subretinal space inducing a transient retinal detachment. The needle was slowly removed to prevent reflux and an ophthalmic ointment of neomycin/polymyxin B sulfate/bacitracin zinc was applied to the injected eye.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fundus microscopy and fluorescent angiographyÂ </title><p>Digital color fundus photography was performed using the Micron III retinal imaging system (Phoenix Research Laboratories). Prior to fundus imaging, mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of 86.9 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine and administered 1.0% tropicamide eye drops (Bausch and Lomb) to dilate the pupils.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Electroretinography (ERG)Â </title><p>ERG was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hennig et al., 2013</xref>) by using the UTAS-E3000 Visual Electrodiagnostic System running EM for Windows (LKC Technologies). Mice were anesthetized by intra peritoneal injection of a mixture of 86.9 mg/kg ketamine and 13.4 mg/kg xylazine. The recording electrode was a platinum loop placed in a drop of methylcellulose on the surface of the cornea; a reference electrode was placed sub-dermally at the vertex of the skull and a ground electrode under the skin of the back or tail. Stimuli were brief white flashes delivered via a Ganzfeld integrating sphere, and signals were recorded with bandpass settings of 0.3 Hz to 500 Hz. After a 10 min stabilization period, a 9-step scotopic intensity series was recorded that included rod-specific/scotopic bright flash responses. After a 5 min light adaptation period on a steady white background, a 7-step cone-specific/photopic intensity series was recorded. Scotopic and photopic b-wave amplitudes and scotopic a-wave amplitudes were recorded for all flash intensities. We extracted quantitative measurements from the ERG waveforms using an existing Microsoft Excel macro that defines the a-wave amplitude as the difference between the average pre-trial baseline and the most negative point of the average trace and defines the b-wave amplitude as the difference between this most negative point to the highest positive point, without subtracting oscillatory potentials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Mice were euthanized and eyeballs were enucleated and retinas were dissected and immediately freeze in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. On the day of preparation, Trizol was directly added to the frozen retina and tissues were homogenized with Polytron and RNA was extracted using Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and chloroform (Sigma) phase separation. Quantitative RT-PCR reaction was performed with primers (<italic>Nmnat1</italic>-forward: <named-content content-type="sequence">AGAACTCACACTGGGTGGAAG</named-content>, <italic>Nmnat1</italic>-reverse: <named-content content-type="sequence">CAGGCTTTTCCAGTGCAGGTG</named-content>, Gapdh-forward: <named-content content-type="sequence">TGCCCCCATGTTTGTGATG</named-content>, Gapdh-reverse: <named-content content-type="sequence">TGTGGTCATGAGCCCTTCC</named-content>) with reaction mixture (ThermoFisher, SYBR Green PCR Master Mix) and monitored with Prism 7900HT (ABI) and analyzed with delta-CT method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Histology</title><p>Mice were euthanized and eyeballs were enucleated and fixed in 4% formalin for 8 hr then washed with PBS and then embedded in paraffin. The thickness of the retinal layers or outer nuclear layers was measured using HE stained sections and plotted against the distance from the optic nerve head. The numbers of nuclei in the outer nuclear layer were analyzed using HE stained retinal sections. Outer nuclear layer was visually determined and the number of nucleus in each layer was counted and normalized by the length parallel to each layer of the retina. Data were expressed relative to the total number of nuclei in the WT. For immunostaining of the HA epitope tag, paraffin embedded eye sections were deparaffinized and treated with formic acid (70% in water) for 15 min at room temperature. Sections were rinsed and treated with blocking solution (goat IgG). Primary antibody against HA (Cell Signaling Technology, 3724, 1:400, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1549585">AB_1549585</ext-link>) and secondary antibody Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories, AlexaFluo@568, 111-585-003 were used to visualize the HA-tagged NMNAT1.

Slides were analyzed under the microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 80i) after the nuclear staining with DAPI and mounting (Vector Laboratories, VECTASHIELD with DAPI, H-1200â10). For X-Gal staining, retina were dissected and fixed in the cold fixation buffer (0.2% Glutaraldehyde, 5 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.1M K-phoshate buffer pH7.2) for 1 hr, wash with detergent rinse (0.02% Igepal, 0.01% Sodium Deoxycholate, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.3), and incubated with X-Gal solution (1 mg/ml X-Gal, 0.02% Igepal, 0.01% Sodium Deoxycholate, 5 mM Potassium Ferricyanide, 5 mM Pottassium Ferrocyanide, and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>,0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.3) for 10 hr in the dark at room temperature.

On the day of extraction, retinal tissues were homogenized in 160 Î¼l of cold 50% MeOH solution in water using homogenizer (Branson) and then centrifuged (15,000 g, 4Â°C, 10 min). Clear supernatant was transferred to new tube containing 100 Î¼l chloroform and vigorously shake then centrifuged (15,000 g, 4Â°C, 10 min). The chloroform extraction was repeated three times. Clear aqueous phase (120 Î¼l) was transferred to new tube and then lyophilized and stored at â80Â°C until measurement. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted with 60 Âµl of 5 mM ammonium formate (Sigma) and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Cleared supernatant was transferred to the sample tray. Serial dilutions of standards for each metabolite in 5 mM ammonium formate were used for calibration. Liquid chromatography was performed by HPLC (1290; Agilent) with Atlantis T3 (LC 2.1 Ã 150 mm, 3 Âµm; Waters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>). For steady-state metabolite analysis, 20 Î¼l of samples were injected at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with 5 mM ammonium formate for mobile phase A and 100% methanol for mobile phase B. Metabolites were eluted with gradients of 0â10 min, 0â70% B; 10â15 min, 70% B; 16â20 min, 0% B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hikosaka et al., 2014</xref>). The metabolites were detected with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (6460, Agilent) under positive ESI multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using m/z for NAD<sup>+</sup>:664Â &gt;Â 428, NMN:335Â &gt;Â 123, cADPR: 542Â &gt;Â 428, and Nam:123Â &gt;Â 80. Metabolites were quantified by MassHunter quantitative analysis tool (Agilent) with standard curves and normalized by the protein amount in the sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample number (n) was defined as a number of mice or replicates and indicated in the figure legend.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;SARM1 depletion rescues NMNAT1 dependent photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rui Chen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> at this time.</p><p>Your paper on the underpinnings of Leber congenital amaurosis type 9 (LCA9), an early onset retinal neurodegenerative disease due to loss of function mutations in the nuclear NAD+ synthesis enzyme NMNAT1, was reviewed by three reviewers and me. Your study, involving a careful series of loss- and gain-of-function studies on NMNAT1 using conditional or tissue-specific NMNAT1 knockout mice, presents a new angle on mechanism of this disease in that you connect photoreceptor degeneration with the long known link between loss of NMNAT and activation of SARM1, the &quot;executioner&quot; of axon degeneration.</p><p>As you can see in the attached reviews, there are a number of concerns raised by the reviewers. Most notably, reviewers #1 and #2 are concerned about low sample sizes for your statistical analyses. In the consultation session with the reviewers, reviewer #3 agrees that in many cases, the number of mice is low, but finds this acceptable given the large number of different conditional knock out mice reported in this paper and that actCre, iCre, HGRPCre, and Vmd2Cre show consistent results. However, the <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines for proper rigor stand for addressing the sample size in your work.</p><p>Another concern is on the value of the therapeutic experiments on partial rescue by AAV-NMNAT1: You show proof-of-principle that AAV supplementation with NMNAT1 may help, but you would need to address timing in testing with regard to disease onset in order to make claims about its efficacy as a therapeutic. The therapeutic approach could be downplayed and placed with a more cogent explication of the pros and cons in the Discussion section.</p><p>Finally, reviewer #1 cites a recent paper on a Sarm1 KO promoting rod and cone photoreceptor cell survival in a model of retinal degeneration (Ozaki et al., 2020). This paper does offset the novelty of your study, but your study, if amended, has the potential to elucidate additional mechanistic aspects.</p><p>While it may be difficult to perform more experiments to increase your n in this time of lab closing and ramp-up, at the very least you may be able to address other major issues on your quantitative analysis and minor points (on histology, effect on vasculature and other retinal cells, for example) for which you may already have data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study by Sasaki et al., examine the role of NMNAT1 and SARM1 in retinal degeneration.</p><p>In my view there are two aspects to the study, the first is more pre-clinical and the second explore the basis for retinal degeneration in Nmnat1 mutations. I personally find the paper somehow disappointing on both.</p><p>Following extensive characterization of the Nmnat1 cKO, the authors turn to rescue experiments by AAV infection to &quot;test the therapeutic potential of AAV-mediated gene</p><p>replacement&quot; as they claim. There are two problems with these experiments:</p><p>1) The authors use the conditional KO and ablate Nmnat1 two months after birth, but this a genetic disease, the complete KO is much more appropriate.</p><p>2) The AAV is injected before the ablation of Nmnat1 (Results section), this does not mimic any therapeutic approach.</p><p>The rescue is not impressive, I would like to see the wild type in the graphs of Figure 6C-E.</p><p>There is not much new on basis for retinal degeneration here as well, which pool of Nmnat1 is the protecting, nucleus or cilia is highly interesting but this is not studied. What is the type of cell death? The authors point that it is apoptotic (Results section), but Sarm induce non-apoptotic cell death.</p><p>Data rigorously</p><p>In some cases, the N is too low see Figure 1C and Figure 7F-H, this leads to conflicting results is there NAD+ depletion in the Nmnat1 cKO? In Figure 7F there is in Figure 1C maybe with more samples. The authors claim that SARM1 is not protecting through elevation of NAD+ levels, but according to Figure 7F this is exactly what is happing in the Double KO.</p><p>Current literature</p><p>Recent paper demonstrated that sarm1 KO promotes rod and cone photoreceptor cell survival in a model of retinal degeneration (Ozaki et al., 2020). It is up to <italic>eLife</italic> to decide if this is affecting the novelty of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Mutations in the NAD+ synthesis enzyme NMNAT1 are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 9 (LCA9). However, little is known about the role of NMNAT1 in the retina and in regards to retinal degeneration. The authors examine retina morphology and physiology in mice after knockout: ubiquitous, in the rods, cones or RPE cells. They find that retinal degeneration occurs strongly with the loss of NMNAT1 in the rod cells, and that AAV supplementation with NMNAT1, or SARM1 knockout, protects against the retinal degenerative phenotype. This work has high significance and the authors utilize multiple model systems to support their hypothesis. The possible targeting of SARM1 as a therapeutic is highly intriguing. However, there is some clarification needed in the manuscript and low sample sizes are concerning to fully support the suggested results.</p><p>1) The authors make a point of discussing the vascular phenotype after tamoxifen induced knockout of NMNAT1 by a ubiquitous cre-driver. However, there is no mention of this vascular phenotype in any of their conditional model systems, and it is not a phenotype typically associated with LCA. The authors should mention this within their discussion and touch upon the potential reasons for lack of this phenotype when loss of NMNAT1 occurs in the rods, cones, or RPE cells alone as opposed to ubiquitously lost within the retina.</p><p>2) As the rod and cone conditional loss of NMNAT1 displayed different phenotypic outcomes, it would be interesting to see staining of the rod and cone photoreceptors in each model system to see if they were preferentially affected. The authors provide H and E images within the manuscript and should have sections from their mutant mouse lines available.</p><p>3) The authors mention that NMNAT2 interacts with SARM1 and that NMNAT1 may be compensating for this action in the photoreceptor cell. Can the authors examine NMNAT2 levels (via western blot or immunostaining) after tamoxifen-induced loss of NMNAT1? It would be interesting to see if NMNAT2 levels change in the retina, and if NMNAT1 levels are altered in other retinal cells when lost in their conditional knockout models.</p><p>4) It would be interesting to see if NMNAT1 levels are altered in other retinal cells when lost in their conditional knockout models. Can the authors examine NMNAT1 levels (via western blot or immunostaining) in these mice?</p><p>5) LCA is an early-onset retinal degenerative disease. The conditional knockout models that were used in this study did not express cre until after one week of age in the mouse. The authors should include a small discussion on this point in their paper.</p><p>6) AAV restoration of NMNAT1 was provided before disease onset, and not delivered after tamoxifen injection. It still supports the author's hypothesis that NMNAT1 plays a key role in retinal degeneration, but the authors over-state the therapeutic effect in their paper. It would also be interesting to test the effects of the AAV on the retinal cells and not just the photoreceptors, the authors could include that in their discussion. They should make sure that they do not over-state the therapeutic benefit of the AAV injections.</p><p>7) The sample sizes provided in the figure legends do not designate whether they refer to the number of mice or number of retinas/eyes examined. Please correct.</p><p>8) The photopic ERG results in the RPE conditional knockout are lower than wild-type controls without any error bars rising above WT levels. This is one of the cases where the authors note an N = 2 for statistical analysis. The authors should consider whether an increased sample size or a later timepoint tested might provide a significant ERG phenotype in this mouse line, and that their conclusion that the RPE does not play a role may be incorrect.</p><p>9) There appear to be error bars missing from some of the ERG figures. Please check and make sure all error bars are present in the graphical results.</p><p>10) The authors should mention sample sizes for the histological analyses (H and E staining) in the figure legend or Results section. It would also be helpful to discuss whether the degeneration phenotype was variable between mice or followed a similar degeneration pattern in all mice in each of their conditional knockout models.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors have generated multiple knock out mice lines to systematically investigate the function of Nmnat1 in the retina. Compared to previously published studies of Nmnat1 knock out mice, this study combines cell type-specific knock out and rescue experiment to illustrate that Nmnat1 play important function primarily in photoreceptor cells, not RPEs. In addition, as the Sram1 mutant rescues the Nmnat1 knock out phenotype along with increasing NMN level and cADPR expression in the Nmnat1 knock out, the author provides convincing evidence that degeneration induced in Nmnat1 mutation is mediated through activation of Sram1. The overall data quality is high and the result is convincing. My specific comments and suggestions are:</p><p>1) As the thickness of ONL and INL change across the retina, the reduction can be better measured by measuring the thickness at multiple positions across the retina and representing the results in a spider graph.</p><p>2) Relative minor degeneration of INL neurons is observed. I am wondering if all cell types in the INL are affected. Staining of the cell types in INL can be conducted to better characterize the degeneration.</p><p>3) It seems that there is a theme that NMNAT1 is required only for retinal neurons. If this is the hypothesis, I am wondering why RGCs are not affected in the mutant.</p><p>4) The authors should fix the gene nomenclature convention. For mouse, the gene symbols are italicized, with only the first letter in upper-case.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;SARM1 depletion rescues NMNAT1 dependent photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your study examines mutations in the NAD+ synthesis enzyme NMNAT1 that are associated with Leber congenital amaurosis type 9 (LCA9). You follow the role of NMNAT1 in the retina with regards to retinal degeneration, determining retinal morphology and physiology in mice after ubiquitous, rod- and cone-specific knockout. You show that retinal degeneration occurs with the loss of NMNAT1 in rod cells, and that a loss of SARM1, usually studied in the context of axon degeneration, protects against the retinal degenerative phenotype. This work points to an important pathway underlying retinal degeneration and possible targeting of SARM1 as a therapeutic. The reviewers have appreciated your revisions, in particular, the increase in n, and the deletion of the pre-clinical portion of the manuscript. Your study provides insight into the basis for retinal degeneration in mutation of Nmnat1. There are a few remaining amendments requested by the reviewers.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You provide AAV restoration of NMNAT1 before disease onset in your mouse model. Although you acknowledge that you did not test the AAV supplementation after disease onset at a clinically relevant time point, you indicate in both the Results section and Discussion section that AAV gene therapy had a significant rescue of the ERG, implying that the b-wave was also rescued. However, the scotopic b-wave was not significantly different between the treated and control eyes, nor was the photopic ERG, beyond the ERG a-wave response. Please correct these statements.</p><p>The level of NMN, NAD+ and cADPR is measured in the whole retina. Given that severe degeneration of photoreceptor cell is observed at the time of measurement, it is difficult to tell how much of the change is due to cell degeneration and cell type composition change. To this end, while it is clear that survival of photoreceptor cell depends on NMNAT1, you might check if subtle defects are observed in other cell types in the retina since NMNAT1 is ubiquitously expressed in all retinal cell types, by staining with cell type specific markers.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;SARM1 depletion rescues NMNAT1 dependent photoreceptor cell death and retinal degeneration&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

What follows is the authorsâ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>There are two problems with these experiments:</p><p>1) The authors use the conditional KO and ablate Nmnat1 two months after birth, but this a genetic disease, the complete KO is much more appropriate.</p></disp-quote><p>The NMNAT1 whole body knockout mouse is embryonic lethal and so we could not perform the suggested experiment. Instead, we performed a conditional deletion in adult mice and found that NMNAT1 is required for the maintenance of photoreceptors and also performed both rod and cone specific knockouts that occur much earlier, at about one week postnatally. Despite the very different pattern and timing of knockouts, we got quite consistent results from these experiments, suggesting that our findings reflect a fundamental role for NMNAT1 in photoreceptors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The AAV is injected before the ablation of Nmnat1 (Results section), this does not mimic any therapeutic approach.</p><p>The rescue is not impressive, I would like to see the wild type in the graphs of Figure 6C-E.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this approach does not mimic gene therapy, and in response to this comment and the editorâs comments we have dramatically toned down any discussion of this as a model of therapy. We have moved these rescue data from the main figures to the supplemental data and, instead of discussing this as a candidate therapy, now emphasize that this is a genetic rescue experiment useful for demonstrating that NMNAT1 is required in photoreceptor cells. We now explicitly describe the limitations of our experiment as a model of gene therapy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is not much new on basis for retinal degeneration here as well, which pool of Nmnat1 is the protecting, nucleus or cilia is highly interesting but this is not studied. What is the type of cell death? The authors point that it is apoptotic (Results section), but Sarm induce non-apoptotic cell death.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. Our finding that loss of NMNAT1 induces retinal degeneration via activation of SARM1 is novel and quite unexpected. In the retina field the belief based on published literature was that NMNAT1 was required for photoreceptor survival due to its role in NAD biosynthesis to supply NAD+ to photoreceptors.</p><p>Here, we show that its essential function in photoreceptor survival is to inhibit SARM1. In the axon degeneration field, it is well known that NMNAT2 inhibits SARM1 activity in the axon, but no one had previously suggested that NMNAT1 would play an analogous role in a neuronal cell body. Our findings are surprising, not intuitive, and important for both our understanding of retinal neurodegeneration and axon degeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] However, there is some clarification needed in the manuscript and low sample sizes are concerning to fully support the suggested results.</p><p>1) The authors make a point of discussing the vascular phenotype after tamoxifen induced knockout of NMNAT1 by a ubiquitous cre-driver. However, there is no mention of this vascular phenotype in any of their conditional model systems, and it is not a phenotype typically associated with LCA. The authors should mention this within their discussion and touch upon the potential reasons for lack of this phenotype when loss of NMNAT1 occurs in the rods, cones, or RPE cells alone as opposed to ubiquitously lost within the retina.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these data were ancillary to the point of the manuscript and so we removed the angiogram data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As the rod and cone conditional loss of NMNAT1 displayed different phenotypic outcomes, it would be interesting to see staining of the rod and cone photoreceptors in each model system to see if they were preferentially affected. The authors provide H and E images within the manuscript and should have sections from their mutant mouse lines available.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that rods and cones are preferentially affected in the corresponding KO mice for a number of reasons. First, both the Rod and HGRP Cre driver mice have been previously characterized and show specificity. Second, both our anatomical and ERG data support the selective nature of the KOs. For example, the contributions of rods and cones to the various components of the ERG are well known in the literature, and our results are consistent with selective disruption of rods and cones in the respective KO lines.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mention that NMNAT2 interacts with SARM1 and that NMNAT1 may be compensating for this action in the photoreceptor cell. Can the authors examine NMNAT2 levels (via western blot or immunostaining) after tamoxifen-induced loss of NMNAT1? It would be interesting to see if NMNAT2 levels change in the retina, and if NMNAT1 levels are altered in other retinal cells when lost in their conditional knockout models.</p><p>4) It would be interesting to see if NMNAT1 levels are altered in other retinal cells when lost in their conditional knockout models. Can the authors examine NMNAT1 levels (via western blot or immunostaining) in these mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Despite extensive efforts on our part, we have not found reliable antibodies for NMNAT1 or NMNAT2 for immunocytochemical analysis. We would point out, however, that even if there were a compensatory increase in NMNAT2 levels in photoreceptors after NMNAT1 depletion, this is not sufficient to block SARM1 activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) LCA is an early-onset retinal degenerative disease. The conditional knockout models that were used in this study did not express cre until after one week of age in the mouse. The authors should include a small discussion on this point in their paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We added this discussion point as requested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) AAV restoration of NMNAT1 was provided before disease onset, and not delivered after tamoxifen injection. It still supports the author's hypothesis that NMNAT1 plays a key role in retinal degeneration, but the authors over-state the therapeutic effect in their paper. It would also be interesting to test the effects of the AAV on the retinal cells and not just the photoreceptors, the authors could include that in their discussion. They should make sure that they do not over-state the therapeutic benefit of the AAV injections.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment and agree. As such, we moved these data to the supplement and have dramatically toned down any claims about therapy, focusing instead on the study as a proof of genetic rescue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The sample sizes provided in the figure legends do not designate whether they refer to the number of mice or number of retinas/eyes examined. Please correct.</p></disp-quote><p>The sample number is the number of mice and this is now stated clearly in the methods and figure legends. We also now provide all source data that shows color coded data for individual mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The photopic ERG results in the RPE conditional knockout are lower than wild-type controls without any error bars rising above WT levels. This is one of the cases where the authors note an N = 2 for statistical analysis. The authors should consider whether an increased sample size or a later timepoint tested might provide a significant ERG phenotype in this mouse line, and that their conclusion that the RPE does not play a role may be incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we would not be able to generate more mice in a timely manner, we have removed these data from the paper. As this was a negative result and we have positive results with two other tissue specific Cre lines, we feel that this has no significant impact on the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) There appear to be error bars missing from some of the ERG figures. Please check and make sure all error bars are present in the graphical results.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the error bars were included, but for some data the error bars were smaller than the size of symbols. We have now increased the size of the error bars to ensure that they are visible for all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The authors should mention sample sizes for the histological analyses (H and E staining) in the figure legend or Results section. It would also be helpful to discuss whether the degeneration phenotype was variable between mice or followed a similar degeneration pattern in all mice in each of their conditional knockout models.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in the Figure 3B and its legends, we analyzed the conditional knockout retinal structure using 3 mice at each of 7 different time points (total 21 mice/genotype) and obtained the retinal degeneration time course. All mice analyzed showed a consistent retinal degeneration time course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>1) As the thickness of ONL and INL change across the retina, the reduction can be better measured by measuring the thickness at multiple positions across the retina and representing the results in a spider graph.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now provide a spider graph showing retinal and ONL thickness and agree that this is an excellent way to represent the data. We also provide representative whole eye images that clearly show the consistent loss of ONL and INL nucleus across the entire retina.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Relative minor degeneration of INL neurons is observed. I am wondering if all cell types in the INL are affected. Staining of the cell types in INL can be conducted to better characterize the degeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is an interesting question, we think that this is beyond the scope of this paper which is focused on photoreceptor degeneration and function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It seems that there is a theme that NMNAT1 is required only for retinal neurons. If this is the hypothesis, I am wondering why RGCs are not affected in the mutant.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do not know the answer, we speculate that NMNAT2 is likely a major NMNAT in RGCs and so the loss of NMNAT1 is not sufficient to activate SARM1. Unfortunately, there are no available NMNAT2 conditional knockout mice or antibodies to test retinal expression of NMNAT2. This will be an interesting future project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should fix the gene nomenclature convention. For mouse, the gene symbols are italicized, with only the first letter in upper-case.</p></disp-quote><p>We fixed the nomenclature as requested.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You provide AAV restoration of NMNAT1 before disease onset in your mouse model. Although you acknowledge that you did not test the AAV supplementation after disease onset at a clinically relevant time point, you indicate in both the Results section and Discussion section that AAV gene therapy had a significant rescue of the ERG, implying that the b-wave was also rescued. However, the scotopic b-wave was not significantly different between the treated and control eyes, nor was the photopic ERG, beyond the ERG a-wave response. Please correct these statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our statements are not sufficient to point out that ERG recovery is partial. We corrected the statements as below.</p><p>1) Results section</p><p>Original statement</p><p>âwe observed significantly increased scotopic a-wave amplitudes in AAV-NMNAT1 treated retinas compared with retinas injected with AAV-GFP (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D) accompanied by a small increase in the scotopic and photopic b-wave amplitudes between AAV-NMNAT1 and AAV-GFP treated retinas (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E, F).â</p><p>Revised statement</p><p>âwe observed significantly increased scotopic a-wave amplitudes in AAV-NMNAT1 treated retinas compared with retinas injected with AAV-GFP (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D).

Given that severe degeneration of photoreceptor cell is observed at the time of measurement, it is difficult to tell how much of the change is due to cell degeneration and cell type composition change. To this end, while it is clear that survival of photoreceptor cell depends on NMNAT1, you might check if subtle defects are observed in other cell types in the retina since NMNAT1 is ubiquitously expressed in all retinal cell types, by staining with cell type specific markers.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the whole retinal metabolite changes could be due not only to photoreceptor degeneration but also to changes in cells other than photoreceptors. As the reviewer suggests, immunocytochemistry to shed light on the state of other cell types in the degenerating retina will provide valuable information.
