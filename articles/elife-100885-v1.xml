Elucidating the strategies by which stem cells achieve this balance is critical for understanding homeostasis and for addressing pathogenesis associated with the disruption of this balance (e.g. cancer). Planarians, highly regenerative flatworms, use pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts to maintain and regrow organs. A single neoblast can rescue an entire animal depleted from stem cells and regenerate all cell lineages. How neoblast differentiation and clonal expansion are governed to produce all the required cell types remains unclear. Here, we integrated experimental and computational approaches to develop a quantitative model revealing basic principles of clonal growth of individual neoblasts. By experimentally suppressing differentiation to major lineages, we elucidated the interplay between colony growth and lineage decisions. Our findings suggest that neoblasts select their progenitor lineage based on a cell-intrinsic fate distribution. Arresting differentiation into specific lineages disrupts neoblast proliferative capacity without inducing compensatory expression of other lineages. Our analysis of neoblast colonies is consistent with a cell-intrinsic decision model that can operate without memory or communication between neoblasts. This simple cell fate decision process breaks down in homeostasis, likely because of the activity of feedback mechanisms. Our findings uncover essential principles of stem cell regulation in planarians, which are distinct from those observed in many vertebrate models. These mechanisms enable robust production of diverse cell types and facilitate regeneration of missing tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>neoblast</kwd><kwd>cell fate decision</kwd><kwd><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic></kwd><kwd>systems modeling</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Planarian</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/853640</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cherian</surname><given-names>Prakash Varkey</given-names></name><name><surname>Yesharim</surname><given-names>Yarden</given-names></name><name><surname>Wurtzel</surname><given-names>Omri</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2038/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankovits</surname><given-names>Tamar</given-names></name><name><surname>Yesharim</surname><given-names>Yarden</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Stochastic intrinsic fate decisions by planarian stem cells drive clonal expansion and reveal a straightforward, feedback‐independent mechanism for robust cell identity selection.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells are crucial for achieving and maintaining homeostasis. Paradoxically, they contribute to an organism’s equilibrium through highly dynamic behavior, continuously balancing their population size by regulating rates of self-renewal and differentiation. Understanding the strategies used to accomplish this balance can provide the key to elucidating organismal homeostasis, as well as to modeling pathogenesis associated with disruption to this balance (e.g. cancer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Passegué et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singh et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Valuable insights into stem cell behavior can be derived from studying systems that rely on principles differing significantly from those characterizing vertebrate stem cells. Neoblasts, the pluripotent stem cells in planarians, function in tissue regeneration and maintenance, providing an intriguing platform in this regard. Neoblasts avoid quiescence and quickly adapt to changes in organismal requirements by adjusting the quantities and types of cells they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">González-Estévez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). These strategies challenge fundamental concepts of vertebrate stem cells. For example, in adult vertebrates, hematopoietic stem cells typically divide slowly, giving rise to rapidly dividing transit amplifying cells forming tissue-specific progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abkowitz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2006</xref>). These progenitors bear the primary responsibility for maintaining homeostasis. Planarian neoblasts, by contrast, divide rapidly and do not employ transit amplifying cells for progeny production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearson, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, neoblasts do not seem to retain substantial memory of the progeny cell types they generate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, despite being essentially ageless and immortal, neoblasts do not display cancerous-like states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Van Roten et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, elucidating how neoblasts balance self-renewal and differentiation can contribute to understanding fundamental strategies that facilitate tissue homeostasis and regeneration of lost or damaged tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Prior modeling of neoblast dynamics in planarians has produced a valuable analytical framework for studying the dynamics of the entire neoblast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mangel et al., 2016</xref>). However, analyzing isolated neoblasts and their progeny can be instrumental for understanding how decisions are made at a single-cell resolution, as well as for deriving physiological parameter values (e.g. corresponding to proliferation and differentiation) that are relevant to the larger system. <italic>In vivo</italic> analysis of individual neoblasts and their progeny is often achieved by applying subtotal irradiation to whole planarians, which results in near-complete neoblast ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Surviving neoblasts proliferate to form distinct colonies, allowing analysis of growth dynamics and progeny identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). Though such analysis has been instrumental in uncovering regulators of proliferation and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>), a quantitative analysis of neoblast colony growth that integrates these principles has yet to be established and experimentally validated.</p><p>Several open questions need to be addressed in the development of such a model. For example, it is unclear whether neoblasts select their lineage identity in a synchronous manner or function independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddien, 2018</xref>). Moreover, as indicated above, it is unclear whether neoblasts maintain memory of their decisions over successive rounds of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pearson, 2022</xref>). In addition, as discussed in what follows, critical knowledge is lacking regarding the ability of neoblasts to switch from producing differentiating lineage to contributing to neoblast colony growth; an understanding of this switch is fundamental for analyzing the overall development of a colony, and for describing new tissue production in regeneration.</p><p>Herein, we begin to address these gaps, integrating experimental and computational approaches to analyze neoblast colony growth. Our analysis does not assume communication between neoblasts or memory of cell fate decisions; rather, it explores whether a straightforward stochastic selection of division outcome can adequately describe the growth of a neoblast colony. Based on <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis of neoblast clone growth, neoblast division can result in three potential outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>): (1) symmetric renewal, which generates two neoblasts; (2) symmetric differentiation, which generates two post-mitotic cells; and (3) asymmetric division, which produces a neoblast and a post-mitotic cell.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Potential outcomes of neoblast division and the effect on colony size.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100885-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In what follows, we study and analyze colony growth based on these principles. We derive key parameter values from experimental data and show that these values predict colony growth with high accuracy. Next, in a series of experiments, we seek to uncover whether the core principles that drive neoblast colony growth (as proposed in our model) are further shaped by individual neoblasts’ decisions regarding progeny lineage commitment. In particular, many S/G2/M neoblasts express fate-specifying transcription factors (FSTFs), which direct the differentiation of their progeny into specific lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Reddien, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Scimone et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, a neoblast can express different FSTFs in successive rounds of division, which results in the production of post-mitotic progenitors of different lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the growth potential of the colony is not compromised by FSTF expression. Yet, it remains unclear how the growth of a colony might be affected when the expression of a particular FSTF (and thus the corresponding cell lineage) is blocked: e.g., does colony growth remain stable, with other lineages being overexpressed to compensate for the blocked lineage? Notably, our experimental perturbation analysis shows that blocking the expression of an FSTF incapacitates a proportion of neoblasts equivalent to the size of the lineage affected. This observation reveals a critical dependency: once a neoblast commits to a specific lineage, it retains this identity until cell division concludes. By contrast, inhibiting FSTFs during homeostasis resulted in an increase in the number of cycling cells, consistent with an activity of feedback mechanisms that regulate cell proliferation in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Together, our findings imply that simple design principles govern cell fate choices in neoblast colonies, and that accurate prediction of colony growth does not require assumptions of fate specification memory or coordination of cell fate choices between neoblasts. Moreover, our findings suggest that all neoblasts in a colony are functionally equivalent (i.e. able to self-renew and to divide to all cell types) and elucidate the contribution of decisions in individual planarian stem cells to achieving systemic homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Analysis of neoblast colony growth</title><p>Following subtotal irradiation, a surviving neoblast may proliferate to form a colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

In those experiments, BrdU was incorporated into DNA during both symmetric and asymmetric divisions using a pulse (4 hr) significantly shorter than the cell cycle time, followed by a chase of up to 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We predicted that the BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number would grow linearly until the entire population doubled. Then, completion of successive cell divisions would lead to exponential growth in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cell number. Indeed, the colony growth was initially linear (Pearson r=0.997), and using linear regression, we estimated that the colony doubling time, and hence the average cell cycle length, was 29.7 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The symmetric renewal probability (<italic>p</italic>) is a vital factor in colony growth, and even slight variations in <italic>p</italic> have large cumulative effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We imaged pairs of adjacent <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cells in the colony and classified the <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell pairs based on their <italic>smedwi-1</italic> expression levels: high-level pairs indicated symmetric renewal, while pairs with one high and one low <italic>smedwi-1</italic><sup>+</sup> cell were categorized as asymmetric division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). By analyzing 40 dividing pairs, we estimated that 50% of divisions that produce at least one neoblast are symmetric renewal divisions, in agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The value of q, representing symmetric differentiation and neoblast loss probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>), also plays a role in colony dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Yet the value of this parameter is more difficult to estimate experimentally (e.g. naïve measurement of cell death using TUNEL in irradiated planarians would be insufficient, because cell death is not limited to neoblasts). We analyzed the effect of different neoblast elimination probabilities on colony size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>) and compared the estimates of the analysis with colony size in our experimental data and by extracting colony size measurements from published literature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>; Methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Considering an average cell cycle length of 29.7 hr, we calculated the value of <italic>q</italic> using the following approach: the probabilities of all cell division outcomes must sum to 1. Our experimental data showed that symmetric renewal (<italic>p</italic>) and asymmetric division (<italic>a</italic>) occur at equal rates (i.e. <italic>p</italic>=<italic>a</italic>). By fitting these parameters to the experimental data, we determined that the difference between the probabilities of symmetric renewal and symmetric differentiation (i.e. <italic>p – q</italic>) was = 0.345 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Therefore, with these criteria, we estimated the probabilities of cell division outcomes in the colony as <italic>p</italic>=0.45, <italic>a</italic>=0.45, and <italic>q</italic>=0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; Methods). <italic>In vivo</italic>, we observed a large variation in the size of colonies at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This could be a consequence of an altered delay between irradiation and the onset of colony growth, or from a stochastic decision to undergo symmetrical or asymmetrical division in the early colony.

More specifically, we investigated how inhibiting differentiation into specific lineages, by suppressing FSTF expression, influences colony size.

Neoblasts form a simple yet powerful system, which has features of both adult stem cells and their transit-amplifying cell progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler and Sánchez Alvarado, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguñà, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reddien, 2018</xref>). Functionally, neoblasts can repopulate stem cell-depleted planarians, produce a diversity of cell types, and adjust their growth rate according to organism requirements and nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Salvetti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steele and Lange, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Herein, we sought to test whether growth in a neoblast colony is consistent with a model that does not assume communication between neoblasts or memory of cell fate decisions, but instead relies on stochastic selection of division outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We further sought to enrich this model by understanding the interplay between neoblast lineage decisions and colony growth.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model summarizing neoblast colony growth principles.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100885-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><sec id="s3-1"><title>Analysis of neoblast colony expansion</title><p>The initial model we developed was grounded in simple principles of colony growth (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), in which cell fate decisions are made stochastically and independently of one another, as a function of the following parameters: average cell cycle length, symmetric renewal rate, and symmetric differentiation and neoblast elimination rate. We experimentally derived parameter values and compared the model’s predictions to experimental data. Our findings suggested that the reliance on minimal assumptions provides a good description of neoblast colony growth following subtotal irradiation. The model captured the average colony growth within the tested time range, despite notable variability in observed colony sizes at a given time point. Based on these results, we suggest that if slow cycling neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Molinaro et al., 2021</xref>) emerge in colonies, their contribution to colony growth is likely negligible, allowing their exclusion from the model without sacrificing accuracy.</p><p>To better understand the potential consequences of random neoblast loss or excessive symmetric differentiation at early stages of colony growth, we used colony growth simulations, where each cell selected independently the outcome of its division. These simulations predicted that a fraction of colonies would fail to develop because of these random effects, a prediction that was corroborated by experimental results. This alignment demonstrates the utility of neoblasts as a system for studying stem cell colony formation and exploring concepts of stem cell behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Consequences of lineage-specific differentiation inhibition</title><p>Moving from the fundamental aspects of neoblast colony growth, we next tested how limiting lineage identity selection affected neoblasts. We suppressed the expression of key fate-specifying genes to dissect how stem cells respond to inhibition of their differentiation trajectory. The transition from measuring general colony growth to specific lineage perturbations allowed us to examine the association of proliferation and lineage specification. In particular, suppressing the master epidermal regulator <italic>zfp-1</italic>, corresponding to the most abundant planarian cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>), drastically reduced neoblast colony growth. Interestingly, suppression of <italic>Smed-p53</italic>, a TF expressed in neoblasts and required for epidermal cell production, has resulted in a similar reduction in colony size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wagner et al., 2012</xref>). These findings led us to consider how stem cells in a colony balance self-renewal and differentiation, and why both processes were disrupted by blocking differentiation to a single lineage. We suggest several interpretations for this observation: First, if we assume that a neoblast can alternate between self-renewal and production of differentiated progeny in each cell cycle, then a decision to produce a blocked progeny may preclude further divisions of the neoblast. A second possibility is that the presence of a specific lineage, epidermal progenitors in this case, is required for other neoblasts to proliferate; in this case, suppression of differentiation could indirectly limit colony growth. The first interpretation is more likely relevant for understanding colony growth given our observation that combined suppression of several smaller lineages produced a similar inhibition to colony growth and establishment.</p><p>The progressive reduction in colony size indicated that inhibition of a specific lineage reduced the fraction of neoblasts that contributed to colony growth, possibly due to their failure to produce the blocked lineage and to alter their progeny identity. Interestingly, in unirradiated animals with abundant neoblasts, <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition led to increased cell proliferation – a response also noted after suppressing other regulatory genes like <italic>Smed-p53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pearson and Sánchez Alvarado, 2010</xref>). This proliferation increase appeared before a rise in cell death, suggesting that cell death did not induce excessive proliferation in early stages. The difference in the consequence of lineage suppression in a neoblast colony and in unirradiated animals indicates that differential activity of feedback mechanisms regulates neoblast proliferation. We speculate that following subtotal irradiation, the near-complete depletion of neoblasts and their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eisenhoffer et al., 2008</xref>) alters the regulation of surviving neoblasts and leads to their rapid proliferation, which is not typical for neoblasts in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>).

It posits that division outcomes are guided by an innate distribution of cell fates encoded within the neoblasts. We hypothesize that this distribution is modifiable by regional signals (e.g. Wnt, BMP), which indicate the neoblast location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gaviño and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wurtzel et al., 2017</xref>), and by injury signals (e.g. ERK), that modulate division rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bohr et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fan et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tasaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>).

Cell cycle duration represents the average time required for a single cell division. The model assumes universal probabilities for stem cells in the colony and does not incorporate environmental, niche, or intercellular effects. Additionally, no memory of previous cell divisions is assumed. While Raz et al. reported the potential of minor memory effects in neoblast divisions, these have been determined to have a negligible impact on the colony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>) and, therefore, on the model predictions. Symmetric renewal and elimination probabilities remain constant throughout the simulation, and fate specification is guided by predefined fate distributions derived from prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scimone et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scimone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van Wolfswinkel et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Estimation of the fraction of symmetric renewal divisions</title><p>Estimation of the fraction of symmetric renewal divisions was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Raz et al., 2021</xref>).

The authors estimate growth equation parameters for expanding neoblast clones based on new and prior experimental observations. These results indicate neoblast likely undergo much more symmetric self-amplifying division than loss of the population through symmetric differentiation, in the case of clone expansion assays after sublethal irradiation. Neoblasts take on multiple distinct transcriptional fates related to their terminally differentiated cell types, and prior work indicated neoblasts have a high plasticity to switch fates in way linked to cell cycle progression and possibly through a random process. Here, the authors explore the impact of inhibition of key transcription factors defining such states (ie &quot;fate specifying transcription factors&quot;, FSTFs) plus measurement and modeling in the clone expansion assay, to find that inhibition of factors like zfp1 likely cause otherwise zfp1-fated neoblasts to fail to proliferate and differentiation, without causing compensatory gains in other lineages. A mathematical model of this process assuming that neoblasts do not retain a memory of prior states while they proliferate and transition across specified states can mimic the experimentally determined decreased sizes of clones following inhibition of zfp1. Complementary approaches to inhibit more than one lineage (muscle plus intestine) supports the idea that this is a more general process in planarian stem cells. These results provide an important advance for understanding the fate-switching process and its relationship to neoblast growth.</p><p>Overall I find the evidence very well presented and the study compelling, and offers an important new perspective on the key properties of neoblasts.

We added a description of the model assumptions in the methods section “Assumptions underlying neoblast colony growth model”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) All known types of specialized neoblasts cycle at the same rate (see points from Reviewer 1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The current data used to estimate τ (Lei et al., <italic>Dev Cell</italic>, 2016) does not allow the direct estimation of individual cycling behaviors. Consequently, we assume that all specialized neoblasts cycle at the same average rate, a simplification supported by the model's accurate prediction of colony growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The assumption that any FSTF-like gene would behave like zfp1 or foxF and hnfA genes. The manuscript does not mention that there may be fundamental differences among these different FSTFs that could be uncovered by future work. A strong addition to the paper would be to test other epithelial genes (e.g. p53, chd4, egr5) to show reproducible behavior within a single lineage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. Colony size reduction following inhibition of <italic>Smed-p53</italic> and failure to produce epidermal progenitors is strongly supported by previous analysis (Wagner et al., <italic>Cell Stem Cell, 2012</italic>). We refer to this observation in the paper in the section titled: “Inhibition of <italic>zfp-1</italic> does not induce overexpression of other lineages in homeostasis”. We added the following sentence to the discussion (Line 460-462): Interestingly, suppression of <italic>Smed-p53</italic>, a TF expressed in neoblasts and required for epidermal cell production, has resulted in a similar reduction in colony size (Wagner et al., <italic>Cell Stem Cell,</italic> 2012).</p><p>Of note, <italic>Chd4</italic> expression is not limited to specialized neoblasts or to a specific lineage (Scinome et al., <italic>Development</italic>, 2010), and therefore its inhibition likely has a more complex outcome than an effect on a single lineage. Furthermore, <italic>egr-5</italic> is not expressed in neoblasts (Tu et al, <italic>eLife</italic>, 2015), making this experimental condition more challenging to examine in the context of neoblast colonies at the time points assessed in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The fact that the data used to feed the model relies on radiated animals which are likely to have altered cell cycle rates compared to unirradiated animals (see comment by Reviewer 1). Of note, the model predicts a steady increase in colony size, but colony size does not change between 9dpi and 12dpi.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The colony size in control animals increased between 9 and 12 dpi (Fig 3B), as predicted by the model. In <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals, the median colony size has also increased over this period, at a slower rate, which we attribute to the increase in <italic>q</italic>. We attribute the unchanged average colony size to an increase in the frequency of cells failing to proliferate, because of selection of a fate they cannot fully differentiate into.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) In light of both reviewers' comments about colony expansion vs. feedback, the authors should discuss how predicted changes to division frequencies might change as homeostasis is reached, or explain how their model accounts for the predicted rate differences under homeostatic conditions in which overall neoblast numbers do not change. Can the model estimate when this transition might occur?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. Our colony assays are constrained by the animals survival following sub-total irradiation (16 to 20 days). In this timeframe, the neoblast population is overwhelmingly smaller in comparison to non-irradiated animals. Therefore, the animals do not reach homeostasis during the experiment, and the model does not allow to estimate the time the system would need to return to homeostasis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 2D, the assumption is that these adjacent smedwi-1+ cells are sisters. Previous data analyzing this relied on EdU or H3P staining to show a shared division history. When these images were collected is therefore extremely critical to include (the methods suggest 7, 9, or 12 days). The authors should justify why they believe that these adjacent cells are derived from a single neoblast that has divided only once.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The images were collected at 7 dpi. We modified the figure legend and the associated methods to include this information. At this early time point, <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ cell dyads are spatially separated from other neighboring cells, suggesting that they are the product of a single cell division. Importantly, our data is in complete agreement with previous estimates of symmetric renewal division rate (Raz et al., <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>, 2021; Lei et al, <italic>Developmental Cell</italic>, 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Clarify the wording 'pre-selected' in the abstract as described by Reviewer 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment, and for clarity we replaced the wording “pre-select” with “select”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Experimental details that are important to the interpretation should be added. For example, how is belonging to a colony defined? This is important because some of the data (e.g. Figure S1A: similar numbers of smedwi-1+ cells are observed at 2dpi and 4dpi, but 4dpi is considered a colony whereas 2dpi is not). The timing of quantification should be included in each figure (it is missing in Figure S2, and Figure 3C and 3D). How the authors distinguish biological vs technical replicates is not mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. Subtotal irradiation may result in formation of a spatially-isolated cluster of neoblasts that is not distributed throughout the animal (Wagner et al., <italic>Science</italic>, 2011). This localized cluster of neoblasts is defined as a neoblast colony (Wagner et al., <italic>Science</italic>, 2011; Wagner et al., <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>, 2012). The small number of high <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ cells observed at 4 dpi in our experiments aligns with this definition (Fig S1A). By contrast, the low <italic>smedwi-1</italic> expression detected across the animal 2 dpi does not fit this definition and likely reflects remnants of dying neoblasts resulting from irradiation. The following text was added to the figure legend: “isolated cells expressing low levels of <italic>smedwi-1</italic>+ were scattered in the planarian parenchyma, likely reflecting remnants of dying neoblasts”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 5F appears to use SMEDWI-1 antibody (based on capital letters and increased signal in the brain). Is this the case? The methods do not mention the use of a SMEDWI-1 antibody, and the text indicates that these are progenitors, but SMEDWI-1 protein is well known to not mark neoblasts. If the antibody was used, the authors should not claim that these are neoblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The SMEDWI-1 antibody used in the experiments described in Figure 5F indeed labels neoblasts and their progeny (Guo et al., <italic>Developmental cell</italic>, 2006). The methods section “Immunofluorescence combined with FISH” details the labeling procedure, which combines FISH and IF using this antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All microscopy images are difficult to see. Perhaps this is because they are formatted as CMYK images. They should be converted to RGB format to make them appear less dull.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.

For example, I believe that determining tau requires assuming that all different types of specialized neoblasts cycle at the same rates. Also there is the assumption that any FSTF-like gene would behave like zfp1 or foxF and hnfA genes. It seems to remain possible that a future study could find that a subset of FSTFs might indeed exert &quot;either/or&quot; decisions in fating, just not the particular genes under investigation here.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We added a description of the model assumptions in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract, the wording &quot;pre-selected&quot; is somewhat puzzling to me. I would interpret a preselection as a process that defines the next specified state prior to its manifestation. Instead, and as I understand the authors argue this as well, the study provides good evidence that the determination mechanism is random in that subsequent neoblast choices do not likely depend on prior states. So I would suggest changing that wording.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We replaced “pre-select” with “select”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it possible to determine the uncertainty in measuring tau the cell cycle time and would this have an impact on subsequent modeling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. The current data that was used to estimate tau (Lei et al., <italic>Dev Cell</italic>, 2016) does not allow us to directly estimate the uncertainty in measuring τ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For lines 154-164 I would suggest doing a little more to explicitly write out the logic of determining the growth constants within the main text and not just in methods, for ease of reading.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment, and added explanations for how we determined the growth constant in the text. The text now reads (lines 160-166): “Considering an average cell cycle length of 29.7 hours, we calculated the value of <italic>q</italic> using the following approach: the probabilities of all cell division outcomes must sum to 1. Our experimental data showed that symmetric renewal (<italic>p</italic>) and asymmetric division (<italic>a</italic>) occur at equal rates (i.e., <italic>p</italic> = <italic>a</italic>). By fitting these parameters to the experimental data, we determined that the difference between the probabilities of symmetric renewal and symmetric differentiation (i.e., <italic>p</italic> - <italic>q</italic>) was = 0.345 (Fig 2E, S1D-E). Therefore, with these criteria, we estimated the probabilities of cell division outcomes in the colony as <italic>p</italic> = 0.45, <italic>a</italic> = 0.45, and <italic>q</italic> = 0.1 (Fig 2G; Methods).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 192 why does post-mitotic progeny number linearly relate to neoblast number? In clones, a change in <italic>q</italic> has an exponential effect. I feel like I am missing something.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. In colonies, 50% of cell divisions result in the production of post-mitotic progeny (asymmetric division). Therefore, the number of produced progenitors in a given cell cycle is linearly correlated with the number of neoblasts. This statement is in line with previous analysis of planarian colony size (Wagner et al., <italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>, 2012).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line103 it also seems possible, although less likely, that the specified state is not fixed within a given cell cycle and could be that cells that try to switch into zeta-neoblasts mid-cell cycle arrest in proliferation etc just for that time.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and agree that this is a possibility. However, our observations suggest that incorporating this factor into the model is unnecessary for accurately predicting colony size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the feedback mechanism proposed to operate in homeostasis, I think in the case of zfp-1 it is quite likely that loss of epidermal differentiation results in wound responses (this phenomenon has been documented in egr-5 RNAi in Tu et al 2015 I believe). This could play out differently in the clone assay because the effects of sublethal irradiation on this process would predominate in both control versus zfp1(RNAi) conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Our RNA-seq analysis following <italic>zfp-1</italic> inhibition did not show overexpression of injury-induced genes at an early time point (6 days; Fig. 5B-C). However, an increase in cycling cells was detected much earlier via EdU labeling (3 days; Fig. 5D). In the case of <italic>egr-5</italic> suppression, Tu et al. analyzed injury-induced gene expression at a later stage (21 days of RNAi), where they found significant epidermal defects (see Fig. 5C in Tu et al.). We agree that sublethal irradiation effects likely predominate in colony analysis for both control and <italic>zfp-1</italic> (RNAi) animals. In homeostasis, additional factors likely influence cell proliferation and differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems likely that some of the differences noted between homeostasis versus clone growth could ultimately arise from the different growth parameters under each setting. Could the rate parameters be estimated from prior data in homeostasis as well? It seems to me that with the framework the authors use, homeostasis must involve a net zero change to neoblast abundance (also shown by Wagner 2011 by the sigmoidal curve of neoblast abundance at the endpoint of clone expansion). Therefore, in these conditions p=q by definition. Experimental evidence from Lei 2016 (Figure S7M) suggests asymmetric divisions and symmetric renewing divisions are about equally abundant (5/12 41% sym renewing vs 7/12 69% asymmetric renewing). Therefore, under homeostasis, there would be an estimated p=q=0.3 and a=0.4. Compared to clone growth conditions then, in homeostasis, it seems that roughly the rate of symmetric renewal decreases and the rate of symmetric differentiation also increases. I wonder, could this kind of difference potentially account for the differences between homeostasis versus clone expansion settings? It is also worth noting that the clone expansion context has been used as a sensitized genetic background for identifying effects of gene inhibition on neoblast self-renewal, so perhaps the reason this works is that the rates of selfrenewal are relatively less in homeostasis so that clone expansion represents a case where there is greater demand for self-renewal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. We agree that under homeostatic conditions, where the population size remains stable, the average probability of symmetric renewal matches the average probability of symmetric differentiation or elimination. By contrast, during colony expansion, the probability of symmetric renewal exceeds that of symmetric differentiation or elimination. The differences in response to a lineage block between homeostasis and colony expansion can have multiple interpretations. However, data from homeostatic animals does not permit the analysis of individual neoblasts or their specific responses to a lineage block. Consequently, we cannot determine whether the proliferative response following the lineage block during homeostasis is a direct response to the lineage block or an indirect effect resulting from changes in other neoblasts. We discuss these possibilities further in lines 472 - 484.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of the memory effect, I recall some arguments presented in the Raz 2021 study that were consistent with a slight memory for neoblast specification being retained. I believe this was a minor point from detecting a slightly higher likelihood of identifying 2-cell clones that both took on prog1+ identity compared to the population average. If this is the case, it may be worth the authors commenting on reconciling those observations with their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. Raz et al. (<italic>Cell Stem Cell</italic>, 2021) reported that in the asymmetric division of a zeta-neoblast, which generates a <italic>prog-2+</italic> cell and a neoblast, there was a slightly higher observed frequency of <italic>zfp-1</italic> expression in the neoblast compared to the expected rate (Expected: 32%, Observed: 44%). This small increase may reflect a mild memory effect, experimental variability, or both. However, statistical analysis using Fisher's exact test yielded a non-significant p-value (p = 0.1), suggesting that this difference could be attributed to experimental variability. Other data from Raz et al., such as lineage representation in early colonies, also did not show significant memory effects, indicating that any such effects, if present, are minimal and difficult to detect. Therefore, while we do not, and cannot, rule out the presence of minor memory effects, we expect that effects of this magnitude will have minimal impact on our model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 2C and 2D:</p><p>Please provide the specific time points for the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.
