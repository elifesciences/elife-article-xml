<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. These transcription factors coordinate nutrient sensing with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism across the evolutionary spectrum. While most studies have focused on the downstream outputs, little is known about the upstream inputs that regulate these transcription factors in a live organism. Here, we found that knockdown of various glucose metabolic enzymes decreases MML-1 localization in the nucleus and identified two hexokinase isozymes, <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2,</italic> as the most vigorous regulators of MML-1 function. Upon hexokinase knockdown, MML-1 redistributes to mitochondria and lipid droplets (LDs), and concomitantly, transcriptional targets are downregulated and germline longevity is abolished. Further, we found that <italic>hxk-1</italic> regulates MML-1 through mitochondrial β-oxidation, while <italic>hxk-2</italic> regulates MML-1 by modulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its coordinated association with LDs. Similarly, inhibition of the PPP rescues mammalian MondoA nuclear translocation and transcriptional function upon starvation. These studies reveal how metabolic signals and organellar communication regulate a key convergent metabolic transcription factor to promote longevity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MondoA</kwd><kwd>MML-1</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>hexokinase</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Shamsh Tabrez</given-names></name><name><surname>Vonolfen</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name><name><surname>Loehrke</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><name><surname>Droth</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><name><surname>Atanassov</surname><given-names>Ilian</given-names></name><name><surname>Antebi</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cologne Graduate School of Ageing Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laboy</surname><given-names>Raymond</given-names></name><name><surname>Ballhysa</surname><given-names>Eugen</given-names></name><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Klara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EU Erasmus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ndoci</surname><given-names>Marjana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

One key aspect of aging is the dysregulation of gene expression and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2022</xref>). Many transcription factors that regulate metabolic pathways have been shown to control lifespan in the evolutionary spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clancy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Green et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lapierre et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Selman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Changes in the activity of specific transcription factors have been shown to impact gene expression patterns and alter metabolic processes, leading to a decline in cellular function and an increased risk of age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benhamed et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carroll et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Denechaud et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Du and Zheng, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tong et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, understanding the interplay between metabolism and transcriptional regulation is crucial for gaining insight into the mechanisms underlying aging and developing novel strategies for promoting healthy aging and reducing the risk of age-related diseases.</p><p>MondoA and the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP) are paralogous transcription factors that work in heterodimeric complexes with Max-like protein X (Mlx) and have been identified as key regulators of glucose metabolism and energy homeostasis. These transcription factors recognize and bind hexanucleotide tandem sequences (CANNTG) in the promoter regions called Enhancer box (E-box) sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Massari and Murre, 2000</xref>) of various genes involved in glucose uptake, utilization, and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Billin et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cha-Molstad et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stoltzman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2001</xref>). In addition to their role in glucose metabolism, MondoA/ChREBP has also been shown to regulate lipid metabolism and cellular stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iizuka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). Studies have suggested that changes in MondoA/ChREBP activity with age may contribute to age-related metabolic dysfunction, leading to a decline in glucose tolerance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghasemi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iizuka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamamoto-Imoto et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> the transcriptional complex formed by MML-1 (MondoA/ChREBP homolog) and MXL-2 (Mlx homolog) is part of an integrated helix-loop-helix network required for lifespan extension in diverse longevity pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). However, how these transcription factors integrate multiple upstream signals to regulate lifespan remains unknown. This work describes how metabolic inputs regulate MML-1 subcellular localization and function. We found that HXK-1 and HXK-2 regulate MML-1 cellular distribution and are required for germline longevity by regulating mitochondrial β-oxidation and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), respectively. Moreover, inhibition of MML-1 nuclear translocation results in the relocalization of this transcription factor to mitochondria associated with lipid droplets (LDs). This study provides key insights into how glucose and lipid metabolism directly impact transcriptional regulation and aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hexokinases are required for MML-1 subcellular localization and longevity</title><p>MondoA reportedly responds to glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) and other hexose phosphate sugars in cultured cells by translocating to the nucleus and regulating the expression of its downstream targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stoltzman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stoltzman et al., 2011</xref>). Nevertheless, little is known about MondoA regulation in an organism-wide setting, and most subsequent work has focused on the molecular mechanisms downstream of this transcription factor. Hence, we decided to investigate how MML-1 is regulated by upstream glucose metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To address this, we performed a targeted RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen on genes encoding enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. Overall, we found a preponderance of decreased intestinal MML-1 nuclear localization when knocking down such genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Knockdown of most of the enzymes involved in glycolysis, as well as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which links glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via acetyl-CoA, decreased MML-1 nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Interestingly, whereas most enzymes in the TCA cycle also decreased nuclear MML-1, inhibition of the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) subunits <italic>ogdh-1</italic> and <italic>dld-1</italic> and the succinyl-CoA synthase (SCS) <italic>suca-1</italic> and <italic>sucg-1</italic> subunits increased MML-1 nuclear localization. We also observed that knockdown of enzymes involved in the oxidative and nonoxidative branches of the PPP, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH) <italic>T25B9.9</italic> and transketolase (TKT) <italic>tkt-1</italic> genes, respectively, triggered a strong increase in MML-1 nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). These data suggest that overall changes in glucose metabolism regulate MML-1 and that this transcription factor may sense the divergence of G6P to different branches of this network.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hexokinases are required for germline longevity by regulating MML-1 localization and function.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Screening for MML-1 regulators upon knockdown of glucose metabolism enzymes.

This enzyme is involved in the first step of glucose metabolism, phosphorylating glucose to G6P and is a critical mediator of cellular metabolism. Among the three <italic>C. elegans</italic> hexokinase genes, <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> more strongly affected MML-1 nuclear localization in two independent MML-1::GFP reporter strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), while <italic>hxk-3</italic> had just a small effect on MML-1 nuclear localization, probably due to its low expression in adult worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutter and Suh, 2016</xref>). To test whether the phosphotransferase activity of hexokinase is responsible for regulating MML-1 nuclear localization, we used two drugs to inhibit hexokinases pharmacologically. 3-Bromopyruvate (3-BrP) is an alkylating agent and HKII inhibitor, and 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) is an analog of glucose phosphorylated to 2-DG6P, which cannot be further metabolized, thus inhibiting hexokinase function. Supplementation of both drugs significantly decreased MML-1 nuclear localization compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), indicating that hexokinase activity drives MML-1 nuclear translocation. We also tested the specificity of RNAi knockdown by using strains where the three endogenous hexokinase loci were tagged with mKate2. We used these strains to evaluate the protein levels by western blot (WB) and found that each RNAi was specific to each isozyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). As glycolysis is essential during development, we measured the size (area and length) of worms fed with hexokinase RNAi egg-on. <italic>hxk-1i</italic> and <italic>hxk-2i</italic> displayed no significant change in worm growth, while <italic>hxk-3i</italic>-treated animals were somewhat smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F and G</xref>). To determine if our observations were due to a change in food intake, we counted pharyngeal pumping rate but found no significant difference compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), nor did we see an effect on worm motility compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Moreover, hexokinase knockdown did not affect the steady-state levels of <italic>mml-1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Taken together, these data indicate no RNAi cross-reactivity among the hexokinase isozymes and that the effects on MML-1 nuclear localization are not due to a decrease in food consumption or developmental phenotype.</p><p>MML-1 works in a transcriptional complex with MXL-2, and previous studies have demonstrated that MML-1 and MXL-2 are required for lifespan extension in multiple longevity pathways, including germline-less <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, we tested whether hexokinases influenced MML-1 subcellular localization in this longevity model. As expected, MML-1 nuclear localization was increased in <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>), and upon <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown, MML-1 nuclear localization was abolished in <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Changes in MML-1 nuclear localization would be expected to modulate its transcriptional activity. To test this idea, we next analyzed the expression of downstream targets reportedly linked to gonadal longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). We observed decreased expression of <italic>mdl-1</italic>, <italic>lgg-2</italic>, <italic>swt-1</italic>, and <italic>fat-5</italic> under <italic>hxk-1i</italic> and <italic>hxk-2i,</italic> but not under <italic>hxk-3i</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>), consistent with decreased MML-1 transcriptional activity. Since hexokinase knockdown decreases MML-1 nuclear localization in the <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) longevity model, we reasoned that the lifespan might also be abolished. Accordingly, <italic>hxk-1i</italic> and <italic>hxk-2i</italic> significantly decreased <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) but did not affect wild-type lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data indicate that hexokinases are upstream regulators of MML-1 nuclear localization and transcriptional function in germline-mediated longevity.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the effect of hexokinase knockdown on MML-1 nuclear localization and longevity was shared by other longevity pathways. On the one hand, we observed that in <italic>isp-1(qm150</italic>) mutants, a model for mitochondrial longevity, <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown decreased MML-1 nuclear localization and abolished lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>). On the other hand, while <italic>mml-1</italic> was required for the insulin signaling <italic>daf-2(e1370</italic>) mutant longevity, <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown did not alter MML-1 nuclear localization nor suppress the lifespan in this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L–M</xref>). Further, we found that MML-1 nuclear localization was increased in <italic>raga-1(ok701</italic>) mutants, a model for mTORC1 longevity, and <italic>mml-1</italic> was required for lifespan extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N and O</xref>). However, <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown did not suppress <italic>raga-1(ok701</italic>) longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1P</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that while MML-1 acts as a convergent factor in these four longevity pathways, it only requires HXK-1 and HXK-2 for germline and mitochondrial longevity, but not for insulin and mTOR longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> hexokinases are differentially expressed</title><p>Mammals harbor four hexokinases that differ in tissue expression, subcellular localization, and affinity to glucose and G6P.

First, we crossed the MML-1::GFP reporter strain with two compartmental markers and examined co-localization by confocal microscopy. We looked at the lysosome/endosome reporter strain LMP-1::mKate2 but saw no evident co-localization in intestinal cells upon <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown or control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). We had previously shown that MML-1 localizes with mitochondria in the hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>); however, mitochondrial subcellular localization in other tissues had not been examined. Hence, we crossed the MML-1::GFP strain with the mitochondrial reporter TOMM-20::mCherry under the intestinal promoter <italic>ges-1</italic> and confirmed that MML-1 localized with mitochondria in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>).

Mitochondrial β-oxidation is an important pathway that generates acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle through the catabolism of fatty acids to produce reductants and energy. Hence, we sought to investigate whether decreasing fatty acid oxidation could affect MML-1 nuclear localization upon hexokinase knockdown. First, we measured the neutral lipid content by feeding the worms with the labeled fatty acid C1-BODIPY-C12 and found increased total lipid storage under hexokinase knockdown in the wild-type and <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Next, we measured the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) upon hexokinase knockdown under basal conditions and with etomoxir supplementation, a mitochondrial β-oxidation inhibitor that acts on the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT). Inhibition of the CPT decreases acyl-CoA import to mitochondria, and changes in OCR are a correlative measure of mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramachandran et al., 2019</xref>). We found no difference in basal OCR under <italic>hxk-1</italic>, <italic>hxk-2</italic>, and <italic>mml-1</italic> knockdown in the wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) animals showed decreased basal OCR compared to wild type, whereas <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>mml-1</italic> knockdown significantly increased the basal OCR compared to <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).

Although much work has focused on identifying mediators of these processes, we still know little about how organisms coordinate feedback loops of metabolic pathways and transcriptional responses to establish such states. Here, we present novel carbohydrate and lipid metabolism mechanisms regulating the transcription factor MML-1/Mondo. We observed that MML-1 senses multiple steps of glucose metabolism and found that hexokinases regulate MML-1 function through different mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. On the one hand, we found that under <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown, MML-1 re-localizes to mitochondria and LD, abolishing the longevity of germline-less worms and mutants with reduced mitochondrial function. Moreover, we could rescue MML-1 function by decreasing the PPP independent of the G6P levels. On the other hand, we found that <italic>hxk-1</italic> knockdown decreased MML-1 function by upregulating mitochondrial β-oxidation. Thus, we found two metabolic branches that converge on MML-1 to trigger a transcriptional response and regulate longevity. We note that while MML-1 is required in four different longevity models, namely <italic>glp-1, isp-1, daf-2,</italic> and <italic>raga-1, hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> were required only for <italic>glp-1</italic> and <italic>isp-1</italic> mediated longevity. Presumably, the signal transduction wiring is different in <italic>raga-1</italic> and <italic>daf-2</italic>, or their inputs into MML-1 work downstream or in parallel to the hexokinases.</p><p>MondoA and ChREBP transcription factors have well-established central roles in glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sans et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stoltzman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamashita et al., 2001</xref>), but whether and how glucose metabolic circuits affect Mondo regulation in a whole animal model is little explored. By performing a systematic RNAi-based targeted screen of enzymes involved in glucose anabolism and catabolism, we found that MML-1 senses multiple steps of glucose metabolism in the worm. Among the genes tested, we found MML-1 nuclear localization to be broadly sensitive to the downregulation of glycolytic enzymes, and the knockdown of hexokinase had the most profound effect. Hexokinase carries out the first step in glucose metabolism, the phosphorylation of glucose to form G6P, which can be shunted to multiple metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the PPP, glycogenesis, and trehalose production. Our findings are consistent with previous work in cultured cells showing that MondoA localization is regulated by HKII, which is thought to stimulate nuclear localization via the production of G6P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sans et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, MondoA senses other phosphorylated hexoses, including allose and 3-<italic>O</italic>-methylglucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stoltzman et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with our genetic findings above, pharmacological inhibition of glycolysis by supplementation with 3-BrP and 2-DG suppressed MML-1 nuclear localization. In contrast to MML-1, MondoA has been shown to accumulate in the nucleus upon 2-DG in rat L6 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stoltzman et al., 2008</xref>). A possible explanation for this difference is that our treatment represents a chronic exposure to 2-DG from development until adulthood, while the experiments in cell culture may reflect an acute response. Overall, 2-DG has been used as a glycolytic inhibitor because it can be phosphorylated by hexokinase to 2-DG 6-phosphate; however, it cannot be further metabolized in glycolysis. Further evidence shows that 2-DG not only functions as a catabolic inhibitor but can also be directed to the PPP or other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ralser et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, low concentrations of 2-DG have been shown to extend lifespan by restricting glucose metabolism, while higher concentrations of 2-DG and glucose shortened the lifespan in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), suggesting a threshold for the benefits of glucose metabolism inhibition in lifespan.</p><p>Additionally, we found an important link between glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism regulating MML-1 localization. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is imported into the mitochondria and converted to acetyl-CoA to generate ATP and other reducing molecules. Downregulation of the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier <italic>mpc-1</italic> and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) also decreased MML-1 nuclear localization and function. Further, we found MPC-1 enriched in the MML-1 interactome. Interestingly, loss of <italic>MPC1</italic> in yeast has been shown to accumulate pyruvate, lower TCA cycle intermediates, and reduce chronological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orlandi et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>MPC1</italic> similarly regulates the disposition of glycolytic and TCA intermediates in flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bricker et al., 2012</xref>). Pyruvate can also enter the TCA cycle through pyruvate carboxylase PYC-1, which converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate. However, knockdown of <italic>pyc-1</italic> did not affect MML-1 localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), suggesting that MML-1 may sense pyruvate metabolism mainly through oxidative decarboxylation of acetyl-CoA.</p><p>We also found that MML-1 responds strongly to alterations in the TCA cycle. The TCA cycle allows organisms to oxidize carbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids to provide energy and intermediates for the biosynthesis of macromolecules. Interestingly, the knockdown of two subunits of the OGDC, <italic>ogdh-1</italic> and <italic>dld-1</italic>, increased MML-1 nuclear localization. The OGDC is a rate-limiting enzyme within the mitochondrial TCA cycle that decarboxylates 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA. It has been shown that supplementation of 2-oxoglutarate and knockdown of <italic>ogdh-1</italic> extends lifespan through inhibition of ATP synthase, decreasing oxygen consumption, and increasing autophagy in an mTOR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2014</xref>). Whether MML-1 is required for this lifespan extension has yet to be explored. Conceivably, the mitochondrial localization of MML-1 could help sense 2-oxoglutarate levels, and the accumulation of this metabolite could signal translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, glutamine can be converted to glutamate and subsequently to 2-oxoglutarate during glutaminolysis and represents an important mechanism to replenish the TCA cycle under different metabolic challenges. In this case, OGDC plays a pivotal role in channeling anaplerotic reactions into the TCA cycle from glutamine and glutamate and other amino acids that can ultimately be converted to 2-oxoglutarate (i.e. histidine, proline, and arginine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Owen et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, increased glutamine-dependent anaplerosis has been shown to regulate MondoA activity in BxPC-3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaadige et al., 2009</xref>), though the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Whether glutamine, glutamate supplementation, or knockdown of glutamate dehydrogenase can regulate MML-1 nuclear localization remains to be determined.</p><p>On the other hand, the TCA cycle can operate in reverse to restore TCA intermediate levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalziel and Londesborough, 1968</xref>). Increased levels of 2-oxoglutarate due to inhibition of OGDC or glutamine anaplerosis can undergo reductive carboxylation by isocitrate dehydrogenase to produce isocitrate. After that, aconitase can convert isocitrate to citrate, which can be exported from the mitochondria for de novo lipogenesis. MML-1 could help orchestrate the metabolic rewiring of the TCA cycle with the fatty acid metabolism transcriptional response. Notably, ChREBP has been shown to regulate many lipogenic enzymes, including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, the fatty acid synthase, and ATP-citrate lyase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ishii et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Postic et al., 2007</xref>). Accordingly, the MML-1 transcriptome shows clear regulation of several fatty acid metabolic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We observed that PPP enzymes strongly influenced MML-1 nuclear localization and function. The PPP is a cytosolic pathway involved in the interconversion of sugars to generate precursors for the biosynthesis of lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides and maintain redox homeostasis. We found that knockdown of PPP components, PGDH <italic>T25B9.9</italic> and transketolase <italic>tkt-1</italic>, enhanced MML-1 nuclear localization, increased the transcription of MML-1 target genes, and restored longevity to <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) animals under <italic>hxk-2i</italic>. The PPP is the primary source of NADPH, which plays a vital role in many cellular processes, including fatty acid, nucleotide, neurotransmitter, and cholesterol metabolism, and is an essential reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ju et al., 2020</xref>). We found that pharmacological inhibition with 6-AN of the two enzymes producing NADPH in the PPP increased MML-1 nuclear localization. We also found increased levels of NADPH and lower levels of G6P under <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown. Importantly, these observations suggest that residual G6P may be diverted to the PPP under low mitochondrial hexokinase and further imply that metabolites other than G6P could regulate MML-1 nuclear localization. What this other metabolite could be remains elusive, but a simplifying notion is that MML-1 nuclear localization is promoted by glycolysis or PPP intermediates. Blocking entry into the PPP or TCA might be expected to accumulate such metabolites and promote Mondo nuclear localization. Conversely, depletion of these metabolites would disrupt Mondo nuclear localization and activity.</p><p>Another possibility is that Mondo organellar distribution is regulated at another scale. Notably, a major output of the PPP and NADPH metabolism is the production of lipids. Interestingly, we found that under <italic>tkt-1</italic> knockdown, fat levels decreased, and LDs were smaller in diameter, suggesting that a reduction in LDs could signal MML-1 to translocate to the nucleus. Consistently, transaldolase <italic>tald-1</italic> knockdown has been shown to increase lifespan and decrease intestinal fat levels in the worm through increased activity of adipose triglyceride lipase ATGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bennett et al., 2017</xref>). This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of LD under starvation to mobilize stored fats for energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although both HXK-1 and HXK-2 positively regulate MML-1 function, they do so through different mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We observed that decreasing the PPP rescued MML-1 nuclear localization and <italic>glp-1</italic> longevity under <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown, independent of the G6P levels, but not under <italic>hxk-1</italic> knockdown. Conversely, inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is sufficient to rescue MML-1 nuclear localization under <italic>hxk-1</italic> knockdown, but not under <italic>hxk-2</italic> knockdown. Interestingly, <italic>acs-2</italic> knockdown abolished <italic>glp-1</italic> longevity (data not shown)<italic>,</italic> consistent with previous work showing that NHR-49, a transcription factor that drives <italic>acs-2</italic> expression, is required for <italic>glp-1</italic> longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ratnappan et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, inhibiting fatty acid β-oxidation promotes MML-1 nuclear localization under <italic>hxk-1i</italic> but abolishes lifespan extension, potentially due to epistatic effects on other transcription factors or processes.</p><p>How both hexokinases activate different metabolic pathways to regulate MML-1 remains unknown and could work at multiple levels. First, there is evidence that differences in the subcellular location of hexokinases may result in the compartmentalization of glucose metabolism, with the channeling of G6P to different pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">John et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilson, 2003</xref>). Mitochondrial hexokinase has preferential access to ATP generated in the mitochondria and provides efficient glycolysis coupling with further pyruvate oxidation by the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, mammalian HKI and HKII have a dynamic localization, shuttling between the mitochondrial outer membrane and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">John et al., 2011</xref>). Both mammalian hexokinases have been reported to reversibly bind to mitochondria through their N-terminal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>) and via their interaction with VDAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lindén et al., 1982</xref>). This dual localization allows the cell to adapt to different metabolic requirements and maintain energetic balance. Under high levels of G6P, HKII shuttles from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, causing cells to use glycogen as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">John et al., 2011</xref>). The subcellular localization also plays other significant roles in different signaling pathways. For example, mitochondria-bound hexokinase has anti-apoptotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gottlob et al., 2001</xref>), and increased <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine upon pathogen exposure releases hexokinase from the mitochondria and activates innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolf et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we found that <italic>C. elegans</italic> HXK-2 is associated with mitochondria and that this localization is abolished by deleting the first 10 amino acids. However, we saw no effect upon <italic>vdac-1</italic> knockdown nor dynamic localization of HXK-2 between mitochondria and cytosol (data not shown). Taken together, these observations suggest that the nematode has dedicated mitochondrial (HXK-2) and cytosolic (HXK-1 and HXK-3) hexokinases.</p><p>We also found differences in the tissue expression of the different hexokinase isozymes of the nematode: HXK-1 was mainly found in the pharynx, neurons, gonadal sheath, and coelomocytes, while HXK-2 was present in the hypodermis, body wall muscle, and intestine. Consistently, RNAseq data from different tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> shows that <italic>hxk-2</italic> is the main isozyme in the body wall muscle and intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hutter and Suh, 2016</xref>). At the same time, <italic>hxk-1</italic> is the main one expressed in pharyngeal muscle and neurons. This differential distribution could explain how <italic>hxk-1</italic> and <italic>hxk-2</italic> differentially regulate MML-1 through β-oxidation and PPP pathways. Notably, we scored MML-1 nuclear localization in the intestine in our experiments, where <italic>hxk-2</italic> but not <italic>hxk-1</italic> is expressed. In the future, it will be important to see whether <italic>hxk-1</italic> cell autonomously impacts <italic>mml-1</italic> nuclear localization within the same tissue, such as the pharynx.</p><p>In any case, our observation that HXK-1 affects intestinal MML-1 nuclear localization suggests cell non-autonomous signaling. What might be the nature of such cell non-autonomous signaling? One possibility is the sterol hormone signaling pathway, which acts in somatic reproductive tissue to regulate <italic>glp-1(e2141</italic>) longevity. Decreasing the activity of the nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, or its ligands dafachronic acids, abolishes the longevity of germline-less worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gerisch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yamawaki et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, carbohydrate metabolism directly impacts the production of dafachronic acids as NADPH is required for the last step of dafachronic acid biosynthesis by DAF-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Motola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Penkov et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, DAF-9 is expressed in the somatic gonad (spermatheca) and XXX neurons in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gerisch and Antebi, 2004</xref>). Conceivably, hexokinase downregulation could affect the production of NADPH and dafachronic acids regulating DAF-12 activity, thereby affecting MML-1 function. It will be interesting to see whether dafachronic acid supplementation can rescue MML-1 nuclear localization upon <italic>hxk-1i</italic> or <italic>hxk-2i</italic>.</p><p>The nervous system also plays a crucial role in integrating metabolic status and systemic responses in a cell non-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mutlu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Inhibition of the mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to extend lifespan across the evolutionary spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kennedy and Lamming, 2016</xref>), and recent work has shown that restoring <italic>raga-1/</italic>RagA or <italic>rsks-1</italic>/S6K in the nervous system is enough to entirely suppress the lifespan extension conferred by mutation of these mTOR signaling factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In cells, HKII has been shown to shuttle from the mitochondria and directly interact with mTOR under glucose deprivation and inhibit its function, resulting in an induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roberts et al., 2014</xref>). This interaction is dependent on the mTOR signaling (TOS) motif present in HKII required for binding to Raptor. Interestingly, this TOS motif (KDIDI) is conserved in the nematode HXK-1; however, HXK-2 and HXK-3 lack this sequence. Our finding that <italic>raga-1</italic> mutants are epistatic to hexokinase knockdown for lifespan extension is consistent with a role of mTOR signaling downstream of hexokinase. It would be interesting to study whether the interaction between hexokinase and mTOR is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and whether decreasing the main neuronal hexokinase (HXK-1) would result in mTOR-dependent inhibition of MML-1.</p><p>Proteins tend to co-localize near their substrates to maximize specificity and regulate signaling pathways. In particular, MondoA was first reported to be associated with the mitochondria outer membrane in primary human SkMC cells through protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sans et al., 2006</xref>). We have previously shown that this localization is conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). Mitochondria-bound MondoA has been proposed to have preferential access to newly synthesized G6P from HKII to coordinate metabolism and transcriptional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). However, the identity of the mitochondrial factor tethering MondoA at the mitochondria remains unknown.</p><p>Interestingly, our proteomics analysis of MML-1 IP showed enrichment with proteins from different cellular compartments, including mitochondria, ER, LD, and nucleolus, suggesting an important role of Mondo in integrating diverse organellar signals. Localization to mitochondria was particularly conspicuous. Multiple nuclear transcription factors are localized in the mitochondria, although dissecting their nuclear and mitochondrial function is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Leigh-Brown et al., 2010</xref>). On the one hand, nuclear transcription factors have been shown to directly bind the mitochondrial genome to regulate transcription, such as the cAMP response element-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marinov et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>mml-1(ok849</italic>) loss-of-function mutants showed a decrease in all 12 mitochondrial-encoded genes compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nakamura et al., 2016</xref>). However, this could be indirect by regulating the mitochondrial transcription factor TFAM or mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, transcription factors like p53 have been shown to translocate to the mitochondrial outer membrane under apoptotic signals to interact with Bcl-2 and promote membrane permeabilization and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marchenko et al., 2007</xref>). Future studies will help elucidate whether MML-1/MondoA mitochondrial localization regulates other cellular processes independent of its nuclear transcription function.</p><p>LD represents the main lipid storage in cells to balance metabolism and energy demands. These organelles are essential for many signaling pathways and are required for survival during fasting by mobilizing lipids for energy production. In <italic>C. elegans,</italic> LDs are mainly localized in the intestine and hypodermis and are composed almost exclusively of TAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vrablik et al., 2015</xref>). We found PLIN-1, one of the most abundant LD proteins, enriched in the MML-1 interactome. Interestingly, we found that MML-1 co-localizes with LD in vivo in the intestine. MondoA was previously seen in large-scale proteomics associated with LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krahmer et al., 2018</xref>). It was shown that MondoA and Mlx localized with LD through amphipathic helices in the C-terminus in SUM159 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mejhert et al., 2020</xref>). The researchers proposed a model in which MondoA/Mlx co-localization with LD inhibits its transcriptional activity, limiting glucose-dependent transcription. Work by Brunet and colleagues suggests that MUFA intercalation into LD and peroxisomes somehow promotes longevity, though downstream transcription factors are little explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Papsdorf et al., 2023</xref>). Mitochondria and LDs physically interact with one another to regulate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boutant et al., 2017</xref>). As MondoA has also been shown to localize with mitochondria, it would be interesting to understand the role of this organelle in regulating MondoA’s association with LD. Although the proteins involved in these contact sites are just beginning to be uncovered, both PLIN1/PLIN-1 and ACSL1/ACS-13 have been proposed to tether mitochondria and LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gordaliza-Alaguero et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria bound to LDs facilitate the coordination of TAG metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. For example, lipases (e.g. ATGL) in the LDs break down TAG to release free fatty acids that can be activated in the mitochondria’s outer membrane by ACSL1 to fatty acyl-CoA. This acyl-CoA can be imported into the mitochondria for β-oxidation. We propose a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) in which MML-1 interacts with specific mitochondria associated with LD to orchestrate a transcriptional response depending on fuel utilization. Under normal conditions, glucose stimulates MML-1 translocation to the nucleus to activate the transcription of glycolytic enzymes. In contrast, upon blockage of glycolysis (e.g<italic>.</italic> hexokinase knockdown), the cell utilizes fatty acids to produce ATP, re-localizing and inhibiting MML-1 at the mitochondria associated with LD.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm growth and RNAi treatment</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> worm strains were grown and maintained on nematode growth medium (NGM) plates seeded with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 strain as the primary food source.

Peptides were stored at –20°C until purification.</p><p>The peptides were cleaned and purified with StageTip. A 30 μg C18-SD tip was hydrated with 200 μL of methanol, followed by 200 μL of 40% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% FA. 200 μL of 0.1% FA was added to equilibrate the C18-SD. The digested peptides were dissolved in 0.1% FA and added to the C18-SD and washed once with 0.1% FA. To elute the peptides, 80 μL of 40% ACN/0.1% FA was added, and elutes were collected in 0.5 μL tubes and dried in a centrifugal vacuum Concentrator Plus (Eppendorf) for 45 min at 45°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>LC-MS/MS analysis</title><p>Peptides were separated on a 25 cm, 75 μm internal diameter PicoFrit analytical column (New Objective) packed with 1.9 μm ReproSil-Pur 120 C18-AQ media (Dr. Maisch) using an EASY-nLC 1200 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column was maintained at 50°C. Buffer A and B were 0.1% FA in water and 0.1% FA in 80% CAN, respectively. Peptides were separated on a segmented gradient from 6% to 31% buffer B for 57 min and from 31% to 44% buffer B for 5 min at 250 nL/min. Eluting peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptide precursor m/z measurements were carried out at 60,000 resolution in the 350–1500 m/z range. The most intense precursors with charge states from 2 to 7 were selected for HCD fragmentation using 27% normalized collision energy. The cycle time was set to 1 s. The m/z values of the peptide fragments were measured at a resolution of 50,000 using an AGC target of 2e5 and 86 ms maximum injection time. Upon fragmentation, precursors were put on a dynamic exclusion list for 45 s.</p><p>The raw data were analyzed with MaxQuant v.1.6.1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>). Peptide fragmentation spectra were searched against the canonical and isoform sequences of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reference proteome (proteome ID UP000001940, downloaded December 2018 from UniProt). Methionine oxidation and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications; cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as fixed modification. The digestion parameters were set to ‘specific’ and ‘Trypsin/P’. The minimum number of peptides and razor peptides for protein identification was 1; the minimum number of unique peptides was 0. Protein identification was performed at a peptide spectrum match and protein false discovery rate of 0.01. The ‘second peptide’ option was on. Successful identification was transferred between the different raw files using the ‘Match between runs’ option. Label-free quantification (LFQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2014</xref>) was performed using an LFQ minimum ratio count of 2. LFQ intensities were filtered for at least two valid values in at least one group and imputed from a normal distribution with a width of 0.3 and a downshift of 1.8.

The standard curve was made using the G6P Standard solution provided by diluting with ddH<sub>2</sub>O to generate 0 (blank), 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 nmol/well standards. Samples were combined with the reaction mix in each well and mixed for 30 min at RT, protecting the plate from the light. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm using the POLARstar OMEGA Plate Reader with Luminescence (BGM Labtech). For the analysis, all samples were corrected for the background. The standard curve was generated with the appropriate values obtained by the standards mentioned previously, and the amount of G6P in each sample was calculated with the standard curve. Values were normalized to protein levels.</p><p>For the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH bioluminescent assay, samples were run in technical duplicates in a 96-well plate. 50 µL of worm lysis in M9 buffer was incubated with 50 µL base solution with 1% DTAB. Samples were split into two: one to measure NADP<sup>+</sup> and the other to measure NADPH. Samples were incubated with or without 25 µL 0.4 N of HCl to measure NADP<sup>+</sup> or NADPH, respectively, at 60°C for 15 min, and then the plate was equilibrated for 10 min at RT. Next, 25 µL of Trizma base was added to each well of acid-treated samples to neutralize the acid, and 50 µL of HCl/Trizma solution was added to each well of base-treated samples. An equal amount of the NADP/NADPH-Glo Detection Reagent was added to each well and mixed at RT for 30 min by protecting the plate from the light. The luminescence was recorded using the POLARstar OMEGA Plate Reader with Luminescence (BGM Labtech). Samples were corrected for background luminescence. The relative luminescent units were standardized to the protein concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Bright-field and fluorescent imaging</title><p>Bright-field and fluorescent images with higher resolution were acquired using the Zeiss Axio Imager Z1 Fluorescent Microscope equipped with the Digital Microscope Camera Axio Cam Mono 506 and the IcC5 true color camera. For fluorescent microscopy, the microscope used a Colibri 7 LED Light Source and the filter sets GFP (Set 38 HE), TR (Set 45), and TL. The software used was Zeiss Zen v2.3.69.1017. Bright-field and fluorescent images were also acquired with the Leica stereo microscope MDG41 equipped with Leica DFC3000G monochrome camera. The microscope was equipped with the Leica EL6000 external light source. The software used was the Leica Application Suite X v3.7.5.24914.</p><p>All dyes were added to the bacterial lawn, incubated egg-on, and protected from the light until the day of imaging. Final solutions were made by diluting in M9 buffer. LipiBlue (Dojindo) was resuspended in 100 µL of DMSO to make a 100 µM stock. The final concentration used was 1 µM. C1-BODIPY-C12 500/510 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO to make a 5 mM stock. The final concentration used was 1 µM. Worms were mounted on a slide with a 5% agarose pad using sodium azide 50 mM. Levamisole 2 mM was used as an anesthetic to image mitochondria.</p><p>Nuclear localization of MML-1::GFP was quantified in intestinal cells from day 1 adult worms. Worms were anesthetized with sodium azide 40 mM. At least 20 worms were imaged per genotype/condition. Quantification of the transcription factor nuclear localization was performed by manually selecting each nucleus and calculating the pixel intensity per area. The same area was used to calculate the cytosolic and background signal. Values were corrected by background subtraction. Nuclear localization was calculated by dividing the nuclear signal from the cytosolic signal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Confocal imaging</title><p>Confocal images were acquired with Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope equipped with a white light laser and a ×63 1.4 NA oil objective. The microscope was also equipped with HyD detectors for fluorescent images and a PMT detector for the bright field. The LAS X Life Science software was used to acquire images and 3D reconstruction. When multiple fluorescent proteins or dyes were imaged, sequential scanning was used to reduce the bleed-through of the signal from one channel to another. All images used for co-localization analysis were deconvoluted with the installed LIGHTNING package to optimize the images and reduce background noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis and software</title><p>The results are presented as mean ± SD or SEM, as indicated in the figure legends. The number of biological replicates is shown in the figure legends as ‘N’, while the number of worms is presented as ‘n’.

By performing a targeted RNAi screen for genes encoding enzymes in glucose metabolism, the authors found that two hexokinases, HXK-1 and HXK-2, regulate nuclear localization of MML-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The authors showed that knockdown of hxk-1 and hxk-2 suppressed longevity caused by germline-deficient glp-1 mutations. The authors demonstrated that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of hexokinases decreased nuclear localization of MML-1, via promoting mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids. They found that genetic inhibition of hxk-2 changed the localization of MML-1 from the nucleus to mitochondria and lipid droplets by activating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). The authors further showed that the inhibition of PPP increased the nuclear localization of mammalian MondoA in cultured human cells under starvation conditions, suggesting the underlying mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. This paper provides compelling evidence for the mechanisms by which novel upstream metabolic pathways regulate MML-1/Mondo, a key transcription factor for longevity and glucose homeostasis, through altering organelle communications, using two different experimental systems, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian cells. This paper will be of interest to a broad range of biologists who work on aging, metabolism, and transcriptional regulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89225.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Raymond Laboy et.al explored how transcriptional Mondo/Max-like complex (MML-1/MXL-2) is regulated by glucose metabolic signals using germ-line removal longevity model. They believed that MML-1/MXL-2 integrated multiple longevity pathways through nutrient sensing and therefore screened the glucose metabolic enzymes that regulated MML-1 nuclear localization. Hexokinase 1 and 2 were identified as the most vigorous regulators, which function through mitochondrial beta-oxidation and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), respectively. MML-1 localized to mitochondria associated with lipid droplets (LD), and MML-1 nuclear localization was correlated with LD size and metabolism. Their findings are interesting and may help us to further explore the mechanisms in multiple longevity models. The data support their proposed working model.</p><p>Comments on Revised Version (from the Reviewing Editor):</p><p>The authors have addressed the remaining concerns from both reviewers, adding textual information for reviewer 1 and testing the roles of hxk-1 and lipid oxidation in regulating lipid droplets for reviewer 2. Specifically, they find that knockdown of acs-2 and hxk-1 acs-2 double knockdown each result in a mild but significant increase in LD size. This result supports that the two hexokinases regulate MML-1 via distinct mechanisms, and is reflected in the updated model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89225.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Laboy</surname><given-names>Raymond</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ndoci</surname><given-names>Marjana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Syed</surname><given-names>Shamsh Tabrez</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vonolfen</surname><given-names>Maximilian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ballhysa</surname><given-names>Eugen</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Droth</surname><given-names>Tim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Klara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Loehrke</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Atanassov</surname><given-names>Ilian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Antebi</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cologne</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>The authors addressed my previous concerns successfully.

However, I have one remaining minor concern regarding the link between lipid metabolism and MML-1 regulation. As proposed by the authors, HXKs modulate MML-1 localization between LD/mito and the nucleus. They have provided evidence supporting the roles of hxk-2 and the PPP in this regulatory process. Nonetheless, the involvement of hxk-1 and fatty acid oxidation (FAO) within this proposed framework remains unclear. Although FAO is generally believed to affect LD size, the potential effects of hxk-1 and FAO on LD should be investigated within the current study to further substantiate their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment.
