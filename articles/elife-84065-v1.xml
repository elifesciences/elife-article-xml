<italic>RHO</italic> is the most frequent genetic cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we developed an allele-specific gene editing therapeutic drug to selectively target the human T17M <italic>RHO</italic> mutant allele while leaving the wild-type <italic>RHO</italic> allele intact for the first time. We identified a <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> Cas9 (SaCas9) guide RNA that was highly active and specific to the human T17M <italic>RHO</italic> allele. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments using HEK293T cells and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) demonstrated active nuclease activity and high specificity. Subretinal delivery of a single adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 packaging SaCas9 and sgRNA to the retinas of the <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mice showed that this therapeutic drug targeted the mutant allele selectively, thereby downregulating the mutant <italic>RHO</italic> mRNA expression. Administration of this therapeutic drug resulted in a long-term (up to 11 months after treatment) improvement of retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in the mutant humanized heterozygous mice. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Unwanted off-target effects were not observed at the whole-genome sequencing level. Our study provides strong support for the further development of this effective therapeutic drug to treat <italic>RHO</italic>-T17M associated autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), also offers a generalizable framework for developing gene editing medicine. Furthermore, our success in restoring the vision loss in the suffering <italic>RHO</italic> humanized mice verifies the feasibility of allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based medicines for other autosomal dominant inherited retinal dystrophies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770966</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Beijing Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19JCZDJC64000(Z)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Liping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf2"><p>Jing Qiao, is an employee of Beijing Chinagene Co.,LTD and was employeed by Beijing Chinagene Co.,LTD at the time this work was conducted.
