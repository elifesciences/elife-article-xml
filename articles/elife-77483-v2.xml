partner proteins can synthesize, scan, and repair the genome. DNA with nicks or small single-stranded gaps are common clamp-loading targets in DNA repair, yet these substrates would be sterically blocked given the known mechanism for binding of primer-template DNA. Here, we report the discovery of a second DNA binding site in the yeast clamp loader replication factor C (RFC) that aids in binding to nicked or gapped DNA. This DNA binding site is on the external surface and is only accessible in the open conformation of RFC. Initial DNA binding at this site thus provides access to the primary DNA binding site in the central chamber. Furthermore, we identify that this site can partially unwind DNA to create an extended single-stranded gap for DNA binding in RFC’s central chamber and subsequent ATPase activation. Finally, we show that deletion of the BRCT domain, a major component of the external DNA binding site, results in defective yeast growth in the presence of DNA damage where nicked or gapped DNA intermediates occur. We propose that RFC’s external DNA binding site acts to enhance DNA binding and clamp loading, particularly at DNA architectures typically found in DNA repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sliding clamp</kwd><kwd>DNA replication &amp; repair</kwd><kwd>AAA+</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd><kwd>clamp loader</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM127776-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kelch</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>177859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaubitz</surname><given-names>Christl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural, biochemical, and cellular data reveal the mechanism by which the clamp loader attaches sliding clamps at gapped and nicked DNA to support DNA damage repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sliding clamps are ring-shaped proteins that surround DNA to tether DNA polymerases and other factors onto DNA. The sliding clamp of eukaryotes, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), can bind to scores of different partners and facilitates numerous pathways such as DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control, and chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Choe and Moldovan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moldovan et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, PCNA is a highly adaptable protein because it can interact with a diverse array of protein partners and DNA substrates.</p><p>Because sliding clamps are closed in solution, they must be loaded onto DNA by clamp loader ATPase complexes. Clamp loaders, like sliding clamps, are conserved throughout all life and are necessary for proper replication and regulation of the genome. Clamp loaders are members of the <italic>A</italic>TPases <italic>A</italic>ssociated with various cellular <italic>A</italic>ctivities (AAA+) family of ATPases and are related to many other important macromolecular machines that regulate DNA replication, such as DNA replication initiators, helicases, and helicase loaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erzberger and Berger, 2006</xref>). Unlike typical AAA+ machines that function as hexamers, clamp loaders are all pentameric ATPases. Each subunit is termed A through E and consists of a AAA+ module connected to a C-terminal collar domain that oligomerizes the complex.</p><p>Because clamp loaders function in numerous pathways, they can utilize diverse nucleic acid substrates. The classical DNA substrate that clamp loaders use for DNA replication is primer-template DNA (p/t-DNA), a duplex region with a 5′ single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhang and a recessed 3′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ason et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsurimoto and Stillman, 1991</xref>). By loading a clamp onto p/t-DNA, clamp loaders position the sliding clamp to be subsequently utilized by a DNA polymerase to extend the primer strand 3′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Naktinis et al., 1996</xref>). Structures of p/t-DNA-bound clamp loaders from archaea, bacteria, viruses, and eukaryotes have revealed that the mechanism of p/t-DNA recognition is broadly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miyata et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>). The duplex region of p/t-DNA is bound within the central chamber of the clamp loader with the 3′ recessed end capped by the collar region. We recently reported that the eukaryotic clamp loaders have a ‘separation pin’ that can melt the 3′ base pair of the primer strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). The ssDNA overhang of the template strand exits the central chamber through a gap in between the A and A′ domains that is termed the ‘A-gate.’ The A-gate plays a pivotal role in clamp loader function because it allows entry and egress of DNA from the clamp loader central chamber. We recently showed that the opening of the A-gate requires a massive conformational change from a closed, autoinhibited state into an open, active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, the A-gate provides specificity for a ssDNA region because the gap at the top of the central chamber is too kinked and narrow for dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>However, clamp loaders also utilize many DNA architectures other than p/t-DNA, including small ssDNA gaps and even nicked DNA with no ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uhlmann et al., 1997</xref>). These substrates are more commonly seen in DNA repair pathways such as long patch base excision repair (lp-BER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto, 2001</xref>). Our recent structures of the yeast clamp loader replication factor C (RFC) bound to p/t-DNA revealed that a ‘separation pin’ in RFC melts the 3′ end of primer. Although the function of this activity remains obscure, we hypothesize that the separation may be involved in binding different DNA architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, nonclassical clamp loaders called RFC-like complexes (RLCs), such as Rad24-RLC and Elg1-RLC, utilize DNA structures with recessed 5′ ends or fully dsDNA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubota et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majka and Burgers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Majka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>). Recent structures of Rad24-RLC show that the 5′ recessed DNA is surprisingly accommodated on a second DNA binding site on the ‘shoulder’ of Rad24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castaneda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>). However, the structures of RFC and Rad24-RLC do not indicate how gapped or nicked DNA can bind to RFC. Moreover, it is not known how clamp loaders evolved different DNA binding specificity.</p><p>Here, we describe a series of structures that reveal that RFC has a second binding site for DNA on the external surface of RFC. This external DNA binding site is composite, consisting of three domains of Rfc1: the (BRCA1 C-Terminus) BRCT, AAA+, and collar domains. Furthermore, we observe that this site is used to bind gapped or nicked DNA. Cryo-EM structures of RFC:PCNA bound to these DNA architectures reveal that the external DNA binding site is positioned to interact with the 5′ duplex region of gapped or nicked DNA. To bind nicked DNA, the clamp loader must melt DNA at both the interior and exterior DNA binding sites, indicating that RFC has two separation pins. Finally, we show that yeast specifically lacking the BRCT region of the external binding site exhibit a phenotype consistent with disrupted BER. Our results reveal a region of RFC used for binding DNA architectures that commonly appear during DNA repair, and we link the evolution of altered DNA binding in Rad24-RLC to the classical clamp loader RFC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of RFC:PCNA:p/tDNA reveals a second DNA binding site</title><p>We previously described a series of structures of yeast RFC bound to PCNA, ATPγS, and p/t- DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we describe a class at 3.4 Å overall resolution from one of these datasets that contains a second DNA bound at a previously undescribed site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The primary p/t-DNA binding site is filled normally, with the nucleotide at the 3′ end of the primer flipped by the previously described internal separation pin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). A second p/t-DNA molecule fortuitously binds to RFC on the outside of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The second DNA binding site is just outside the exit channel for the single-stranded template overhang at the A-gate. The second DNA binding site is comprised entirely by the A subunit (Rfc1) at the ‘shoulder region,’ which is at the top of AAA+ module and next to the collar domain. We observe nine base pairs of duplex DNA, and a melted base pair in between the collar and BRCT domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). From the density alone, it is difficult to assign the orientation of the bound DNA at the external site (i.e., which end of the construct is melted). While we cannot assign the exact sequence of the externally bound DNA, we can unambiguously assign the polarity of the strands using the major and minor grooves of DNA. Nevertheless, we establish that there are two DNA binding sites: one internal site that has been recognized since the first RFC structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>), and one external site that we describe here.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of replication factor C:proliferating cell nuclear antigen (RFC:PCNA) bound to two p/t-DNA molecules.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the complex of RFC:PCNA bound to two p/t-DNAs.

The BRCT was not visible in any previous structures of RFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>). The BRCT domain docks on the shoulder of Rfc1 where the collar and AAA+ module meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and is connected to the AAA+ module through a long bridging helix. Although BRCT domains are primarily known for acting as protein–protein interaction modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leung and Glover, 2011</xref>), the Rfc1 BRCT domain binds DNA using a surface that has been shown to bind nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>). A series of positively charged and polar residues grip the phosphate backbone of both strands of the DNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because there are no interactions with individual bases, the binding mode is consistent with a lack of sequence specificity.</p><p>The second DNA binding site has major contributions from the shoulder and collar regions of Rfc1. In this sense, the external DNA binding site is a composite site consisting of interactions from three separate domains. The shoulder of the AAA+ domain exhibits a series of conserved polar and basic residues that grip the duplex, particularly Asn459, Gln474, Arg476, Arg477, Asn481, and Gln508 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In particular, Gln474 and Arg476 situate into the minor groove of the duplex, potentially setting the register of the bound DNA. Additionally, one of the strands is placed in between two helix dipoles that have their positive (N-terminal) ends pointed at the backbone of DNA.</p><p>This external DNA binding site is only accessible once RFC undergoes the crab-claw opening motion. In RFC’s autoinhibited conformation, this region is blocked by the A′ domain and the collar domain of the E subunit (Rfc5), which would sterically block six of the nine base pairs of duplex DNA that we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Moreover, the site where the BRCT domain docks onto the shoulder of Rfc1 is blocked by the collar domains of Rfc1 and the Rfc5. These sites only become accessible after the fold-switching event in Rfc1 that underlies the crab-claw motion for RFC opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the second DNA binding site and docking of the BRCT domain are coupled to the binding and opening of PCNA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of replication factor C (RFC) utilization of gapped DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The external DNA binding site is incompatible with autoinhibited forms of RFC.

The 2AP probe was placed at the 3′ end of the primer or the 5′ end of the template strand, respectively. In the presence of RFC and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), we observe an ATP-analog dependent increase in 2AP fluorescence that is comparable to the increase seen with the well-characterized p/t-DNA substrate with 2AP at the 3′ end of the primer strand. This result indicates that 5′ recessed DNA can bind RFC and suggests that the 5′ base is being melted. Because this increase is ATP-dependent and 5′ recessed DNA does not stimulate ATP hydrolysis, this suggests that the melting does not occur at the internal separation pin, but occurs externally in the ATP-dependent BRCT-docked state. Error bars reflect the standard deviation from three replicates.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77483-fig2-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>While the BRCT and AAA+ shoulder regions grip the DNA backbone, the collar domain has several residues that are dedicated to melting and stabilizing the end of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Upon melting, one strand is directed towards a channel between the collar and BRCT domain, while the other strand is directed towards the A-gate. Several residues stabilize the melted bases: Phe552, His556, and Ile664 stack against the duplex DNA and replace the melted bases, and His659 stacks against the melted base directed towards the BRCT domain. Thus, Rfc1 has two separation pins, one in the central chamber and a newly discovered one on the external DNA binding site. This external separation pin is remarkably similar to that used by Rad24-RLC when it binds DNA with a recessed 5′ end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castaneda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2021</xref>) (see ‘Discussion’ for more details).</p><p>To test the hypothesis that this external site can bind and melt 5′ recessed ends, we used 2-aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence studies to report on base-flipping. 2AP is an adenine analog whose fluorescence is quenched when it is base-paired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frey et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jean and Hall, 2001</xref>). We previously showed that 2AP fluorescence detects base-flipping at the internal separation pin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>), and here we employ the same assay to probe the external separation pin. To specifically probe melting at the external separation pin, we used 5′ recessed DNA that does not bind the central chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellison and Stillman, 2003</xref>), and thus would not be flipped by the internal separation pin. We observe a strong enhancement of 2AP fluorescence when this DNA is mixed with RFC, PCNA, and ATPγS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result indicates that the DNA binds and the terminal base of the 5′ recessed end is flipped. This fluorescence enhancement is dependent on ATP analog. Because the external DNA binding site is only formed upon ATP-dependent crab-claw opening, this suggests that the melting occurs at this site. Therefore, we confirm that this melting occurs in solution.</p><p>The second DNA binding site is intriguingly close to the A-gate, which serves as the exit channel for the template overhang of the internally bound p/t-DNA. The template strand of the internally bound DNA is positioned in similar fashion as we observed in our other structures of yeast RFC bound to p/t-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>), and the last visible nucleotide of overhang is proximal to the flipped base of the second DNA that is positioned in the A-gate. Moreover, these two strands are in the same polarity (3′ to 5′). This led us to hypothesize that the second DNA binding site represents a mechanism for RFC to bind to DNA with single-stranded gaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RFC binding to gapped DNA</title><p>We hypothesized that the second DNA binding site promotes RFC binding of duplex DNA with single-stranded gaps. To test this hypothesis, we measured RFC’s ATPase rate in the presence of PCNA and various potential DNA substrates. ATPase activity is a reasonable proxy for clamp loading because ATP hydrolysis is triggered in the final stages of the loading reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marzahn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trakselis et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>We observed stimulation of ATPase activity with DNA constructs containing ssDNA gaps ranging from 10 to 1 nucleotide in length, clearly indicating binding of gapped DNA into the central chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the stimulation across all the gapped substrates is lower than observed for p/t-DNA and is not uniform across all gap sizes. ATPase activity decreases with smaller gap size until it reaches a minimum activity at a 4-nucleotide gap, then increases again at very small gaps and nicked DNA. The ATPase versus gap size profile is remarkably smooth with one glaring exception: the activity from 6-nucleotide gapped DNA is approximately twice as high as one would expect based on the trend. We noted that a 6-nucleotide gap is predicted to be the ideal length to bridge between the internal and external DNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We wondered about the relationship between gap size and DNA melting, and whether smaller gap sizes require more melting than larger gap sizes. Therefore, we probed melting activity with gapped DNA labeled with 2AP on the primer strand. We used 2AP adjacent to the 3′ end of the primer strand (i.e., the ‘<italic>P</italic> = 2’ position) to probe gapped DNA because we hypothesized that melting of multiple base pairs might be necessary to generate enough ssDNA to span the distance between the internal and external DNA sites. Indeed, we observe significant ATP-dependent fluorescence changes in substrates with ssDNA gaps of 4, 5, and 6 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Intriguingly, the fluorescence change is greatest for the 4-nucleotide gapped DNA, suggesting that the construct with the shortest ssDNA segment required the most base-flipping.</p><p>To elucidate how RFC binds to gapped DNA, we determined the structures of RFC:PCNA bound to DNA constructs with 6- and 5-nucleotide ssDNA gaps. We chose these gap sizes because we predicted that the 6-nucleotide gap will bind without the need to melt much duplex, while the 5-nucleotide gap should be too short to bind without melting DNA or altering the clamp loader structure to accommodate the shorter linker. We determined the structures of RFC:PCNA bound to 5- and 6-nucleotide gapped DNAs to 3.0- and 3.3 Å overall resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structures of replication factor C:proliferating cell nuclear antigen (RFC:PCNA) bound to gapped DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Cryo-EM reconstruction of the complex of RFC:PCNA bound to DNA with a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gap of 6 or 5 nucleotides (6-gap or 5-gap structures).

We examined nicked DNA because it is the smallest gap possible. We tested binding of RFC:PCNA to fully duplex DNA containing a single nick using 2AP fluorescence. We placed the 2AP probe at the 3′ end of the primer strand (‘<italic>P</italic> = 1’ position) to monitor DNA binding and base-flipping in the internal DNA binding site. We observe a large increase in 2AP fluorescence in the presence of RFC:PCNA, greater than the fluorescence increase we observe with standard p/t-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This fluorescence increase is dependent on the presence of ATP analog, indicating that it requires binding to RFC. Therefore, we observe that the RFC:PCNA:ATPγS complex can stably bind to nicked DNA and melt the 3′ end of the primer strand. This effect is not dependent on the presence of a 5′ phosphate in the nonprimer strand, indicating that this moiety is not necessary for the base-flipping at the 3′ end of the primer strand, despite its importance in binding to the BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Replication factor C:proliferating cell nuclear antigen (RFC:PCNA) binding to nicked DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RFC melts the primer 3′ end in nicked DNA. 2-Aminopurine (2AP) fluorescence at the primer = 2 position (probe adjacent to the flipped base) showing that the primer strand exhibits even more melting than observed in p/t-DNA.

Despite the ambiguity about exactly how much DNA each site can melt, we unambiguously show that the external DNA binding site can also unwind DNA to allow RFC to bind nicked DNA.</p><p>The melted region of the nonprimer strand is in a channel formed between the BRCT domain, the AAA+ module, and the collar. This channel is lined with electropositive residues (R174, K190, K209, R511, H556, K557, R600, and H659), most of these residues presumably interact favorably with the backbone of the displaced strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Like in our 2 p/t-DNA reconstruction, His659’s role is for stacking with the base of a melted nucleotide. This residue is conserved as aromatic and most of the other residues are highly conserved as basic in eukaryotes, indicating that both this stacking and electropositive channel are important for function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The melted nucleotide of the nonprimer strand contacts the BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, the 5′ nucleotide of the nonprimer strand was not resolved well enough to allow for modeling, indicating that the 5′ phosphate does not play a major role in the interaction between the DNA bound at the external site and the BRCT domain in the RFC-docked state.</p><p>Because the BRCT domain is known to prefer DNA with a 5′ phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>), we tested whether the addition of a 5′ phosphate on the nonprimer strand affects RFC’s base-flipping and ATPase activities for nicked or different-sized gapped DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We placed the 2AP probe at the 5′ end of the nonprimer strand (‘np = 1’ position) to monitor base-flipping in the external DNA binding site. The increase in 2AP fluorescence due to RFC binding is similar when comparing DNA with or without a 5′ phosphate. This result indicates that DNA melting at the external site is unaffected by a 5′ phosphate.</p><p>We also compared the effect of a 5′ phosphate on RFC’s steady-state ATPase activity using nicked DNA or DNA constructs containing 1–10 nucleotide ssDNA gaps. Overall, the presence of the 5′ phosphate on the DNA substrate results in a modest increase to RFC’s ATPase activity. The extent of increase in RFC’s ATPase activity is not uniform across DNA gap sizes; the increase is more pronounced with larger gaps and less apparent with smaller gaps or nicked DNA. Exactly which steps of the clamp loading process are affected by the addition of the 5′ phosphate is still unclear from our steady-state ATPase activity measurement. Future pre-steady state experiments will investigate this.</p><p>We observe no ATP hydrolysis in any of the active sites of the nicked DNA structure, establishing that ATP hydrolysis is not necessary for melting at either the internal or external separation pins. Moreover, the conformation of RFC bound to nicked DNA resembles those bound to 6-gapped and 5-gapped DNA in all other major respects. Because ATP hydrolysis is typically coupled to a conformational change in AAA+ ATPases, this further supports that the melting does not require ATPase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Deletion of the BRCT domain disrupts response to DNA damage</title><p>We hypothesized that the external DNA binding site is used for loading PCNA at gapped or nicked DNA structures in the cell, which typically arise as lp-BER intermediates. These intermediates are structures with either a nick or a small (2–12 nucleotide) gap of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sattler et al., 2003</xref>), and they require RFC to load PCNA for efficient repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pascucci et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sattler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woodrick et al., 2017</xref>). To interrogate how the BRCT domain affects cellular function, we used an RFC complementation system, where the only copy of RFC1 is supplied on a plasmid. We used a series of mutagen challenges to examine if lp-BER is likely affected and if other DNA metabolic pathways are also affected. We used methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; an alkylating reagent that causes damage most commonly repaired by base excision repair), hydroxyurea (HU; which inhibits DNA synthesis by lowering supplies of deoxyribonucleotides), and ultraviolet radiation and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (UV, 4NQO; which cause DNA damage that is usually repaired through nucleotide excision repair) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinha and Häder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu and Lee, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ikenaga et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 1989</xref>). We found that the RFC1-∆BRCT construct exhibits a growth defect when in combination with application of the mutagen MMS, where the RFC1-∆BRCT strain grows approximately 100-fold less well. However, the RFC1-∆BRCT strain is as sensitive as the wild type to the application of HU, 4NQO, or UV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This site expands RFC’s repertoire of targets by facilitating binding to DNA that is either nicked or contains small ssDNA gaps. The external site is composite, consisting of three different domains of Rfc1. This composite nature allows more flexibility in binding to substrates. Furthermore, the binding site is only found in the open conformation of RFC and is sterically blocked in the autoinhibited conformation, thereby coupling DNA binding to RFC conformation.

The classical clamp loader RFC is the likely progenitor of Rad24-RLC. Because Rfc1 already had the ability to bind DNA with a recessed 5′ end, the evolution of Rad24’s ability to specifically recognize and load clamps at this DNA architecture is trivial. The DNA binding site of Rad24-RLC also has a region that resembles the external separation pin of Rfc1, although Rad24-RLC has not been observed to melt DNA.

Both separation pins in Rfc1 are conserved across eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that these DNA melting activities are broadly used. Melting at the external site allows for nicked DNA (and perhaps small ssDNA gaps) to bind by creating and/or extending a ssDNA gap that can fit through the A-gate. The external separation pin relies on a channel to funnel the extruded strand. This channel consists of residues from the BRCT domain (K190, K209), the AAA+ module (R511), and the collar domain (H556, K557, R600, and H659) of Rfc1. This composite nature of the external DNA binding site likely makes it more pliable than the internal site, which may allow for novel means of regulation.</p><p>Neither separation pin appears to require ATP hydrolysis in order to melt DNA. We previously established that the internal site melts a single base pair without hydrolyzing ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). While formally possible that melting more than 1 nucleotide requires ATP hydrolysis, our data would argue that this is likely not the case. First, we observe no ATP hydrolysis in the structure of RFC bound to nicked DNA, where five bases are melted. Second, ATP hydrolysis resets the clamp loader structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hingorani and O’Donnell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Turner et al., 1999</xref>), and the open ATP-bound conformation is the only one capable of forming the external DNA binding site. While the idea of an ATPase melting DNA without hydrolyzing ATP might seem unusual, there are numerous examples in the literature of other proteins with this ability. For example, non-NTPase proteins such as CRISPR nucleases and ssDNA binding protein can melt far longer stretches of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jore et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szczelkun et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, ATP-dependent helicases can melt substantial amounts of DNA in the absence of ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lohman and Fazio, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reynolds et al., 2015</xref>). In all of these cases, the energy for melting DNA comes from binding energy. Thus, we propose that RFC also uses binding energy to melt DNA at both separation pins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role for the BRCT domain</title><p>Our structures provide the first visualizations of the RFC BRCT domain in the context of an intact clamp loader. We find that the BRCT domain plays an important role in binding DNA at the external DNA binding site. The BRCT domain is docked on top of the AAA+ module of the Rfc1, and is tethered through a long helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The density for the BRCT domain is not as strong as for the other domains of RFC, suggesting that the BRCT domain may sample different orientations. This could provide the external binding site greater pliability in DNA docking, which may provide novel means of regulation. Although it is tempting to claim that this means that the BRCT binds DNA weakly, the isolated BRCT domain binds DNA very tightly, with a K<sub>d</sub> of ~10 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, the BRCT domain could act as a flexible tether to initially bind DNA with high affinity before docking onto the core of the clamp loader.</p><p>The BRCT domain binds DNA in a different orientation when docked onto RFC than in isolation. Generally, the BRCT domain prefers DNA with a 5′ phosphate end, particularly if there is a 3′ ssDNA overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>). A structural model of the isolated BRCT domain bound to DNA was determined using a combination of NMR restraints and modeling in HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2010</xref>). The 5′ phosphate end binds to the isolated BRCT domain in a deep groove. This phosphate-binding groove is mostly obscured when the BRCT domain is docked onto the shoulder of RFC, and the BRCT domain primarily uses a different face for interacting with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Therefore, the DNA binding mode in isolation is incompatible with the conformation of RFC that we observe in our structures as the DNA would clash with the collar domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, the DNA binding mode of the isolated BRCT domain is likely to be only used when the BRCT domain is loosely tethered to the core clamp loader complex. This could provide the BRCT domain the ability to capture DNA at early stages of the loading reaction, possibly before PCNA has bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To avoid clashing with the collar domain, the BRCT domain must change its grip on DNA upon docking to the AAA+ module. This may play a role in DNA melting and subsequent binding in the central chamber. In support of this hypothesis, the isolated BRCT domain inhibits RFC’s loading of PCNA at gapped DNA sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>We find that a 5′ phosphate does not affect RFC’s base-flipping activity with 5′ recessed, gapped, or nicked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Therefore, the interaction of the BRCT domain with 5′ phosphate is not important for DNA melting at either RFC’s internal or external DNA binding sites. Because both assays stall RFC with ATPγS, our 2AP experiments report on a similar intermediate as observed in our cryo-EM structures: a state with PCNA and DNA fully engaged to RFC, but prior to ATP hydrolysis. Therefore, our fluorescence experiments validate that our structures report on physiologically relevant conformations, regardless of whether the DNA has a 5′ phosphate (nicked DNA structure) or does not (5- or 6-gap structures).</p><p>In contrast, we observe that the 5′ phosphate has a modest effect on RFC’s ATPase activity in the presence of gapped or nicked DNA. Our steady-state ATPase measurements report on multiple states throughout the clamp loading cycle. Previous work has shown that the rate-limiting step in the clamp loading reaction is the release of RFC from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakato et al., 2012</xref>). Taken through this lens, it would appear that our results indicate that the 5′-phosphate accelerates RFC release, while certain sized gaps might decelerate RFC release. However, the study from Sakato et al. focused on clamp loading onto p/t-DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sakato et al., 2012</xref>), and it remains unknown what the rate-limiting steps are for gapped or nicked DNA. It is quite likely that other steps could be rate-limiting for gapped or nicked DNA, in which DNA recognition and/or melting of DNA is especially challenging. We propose that 5′ phosphate recognition by the BRCT domain is important for rapidly binding DNA substrates with gaps or nicks. Furthermore, we hypothesize that melting of DNA becomes a rate-limiting step for DNA with a nick or small gaps. These hypotheses will be tested by future pre-steady-state experiments.</p><p>The BRCT domain is also likely to function as a protein–protein interaction hub, as do most BRCT domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leung and Glover, 2011</xref>). There is evidence that at least two proteins, DNA ligase I and the protease FAM111A, bind to RFC using the BRCT domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levin et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the coupling of BRCT docking and clamp opening provides a potential mechanism for controlling interactions with RFC partner proteins.</p><p>We observe that deletion of the BRCT domain causes a growth defect in yeast grown in the presence of the DNA-alkylating agent MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Previous work showed that deletion of the entire N-terminal 273 amino acids resulted in sensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomes et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McAlear et al., 1996</xref>). This deleted region encompasses the BRCT domain, but also includes several other regions as well. We extend that previous analysis to show that this defect can be specifically localized to the BRCT domain. Furthermore, we observe no growth defect when Rfc1-∆BRCT yeast are treated with UV or HU.</p><p>Based on our nicked and gapped DNA structures along with this phenotype, we propose that the loss of the BRCT domain perturbs lp-BER by disrupting PCNA loading at nicks or small gaps. The damage induced by MMS is primarily repaired by BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lindahl and Wood, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wyatt and Pittman, 2006</xref>), whereas the damage caused by HU and UV is primarily repaired by other pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petermann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sinha and Häder, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu and Lee, 2017</xref>). During S phase, the cell primarily relies on the lp-BER subpathway, which requires RFC to load PCNA at nicks and small ssDNA gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matsumoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsumoto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pascucci et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sattler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woodrick et al., 2017</xref>). Because the BRCT domain assists in binding to gapped or nicked DNA, we speculate that the loss of the BRCT domain results in less effective lp-BER. Future experiments will test this hypothesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A speculative model for binding of nicks and small ssDNA gaps</title><p>We have synthesized the available biochemical and structural data to derive a mechanistic model for how nicked or gapped DNA structures bind to the clamp loader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The flexibly tethered BRCT domain increases the collision radius of RFC, thereby increasing the likelihood that RFC contacts DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, step 1). Furthermore, the BRCT domain’s intrinsic specificity for the 5′ end of DNA gives it preference in orienting gapped or nicked DNA correctly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotedar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kobayashi et al., 2006</xref>). Binding DNA at the BRCT domain anchors DNA close to the RFC core machinery, thereby increasing the local concentration dramatically. Because the external binding site on the shoulder of Rfc1 is sterically blocked in the autoinhibited conformations, the AAA+ module must bind the sliding clamp prior to the BRCT domain docking onto the shoulder region of RFC (step 2). When the AAA+ module binds PCNA, the complex undergoes the crab-claw opening that both opens the sliding clamp for DNA entry as well as exposes the second DNA binding site on the shoulder of Rfc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>) (step 3). In this way, the clamp loader maintains ordered clamp binding, opening, and loading despite binding to DNA prior to the sliding clamp. After RFC opens, the DNA-bound BRCT domain can now dock onto the shoulder region. The steric clash between the BRCT-bound DNA and the external separation pin necessitates an alteration in the manner in which the BRCT engages DNA (step 4). Thus, docking of DNA-bound BRCT to the shoulder may facilitate unwinding at the external separation pin. Once DNA is fully engaged to the newly formed external DNA binding site, RFC becomes locked into the open conformation and the DNA is co-localized near the A-gate. In this sense, the duplex DNA bound at the external site can act as an allosteric regulator of RFC. Once sufficient DNA is melted at the external site to create a long enough ssDNA linker, duplex DNA then traverses the A-gate into the central chamber. As DNA enters the central chamber, DNA reorients and the 3′ end of the primer melts at the internal separation pin of Rfc1 (step 5). Duplex DNA binding in the chamber activates ATPase activity (step 6), possibly through the flipping of the ‘arginine switch.’ This conserved arginine holds the catalytic glutamate in an inactive conformation; once DNA binds, the arginine grips DNA and releases the glutamate into an active conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelch et al., 2011</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, we observe that the arginine switch residue is flipped into the active conformation in most of our structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The DNA also rigidifies the AAA+ spiral, which is likely a key factor in ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Subramanian et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, ATP hydrolysis and P<sub>i</sub> release triggers clamp closure and ejection of the clamp loader, which can then recycle to load another clamp (step 7). Our model makes numerous predictions for the clamp loading reaction that will need to be tested in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

Briefly, pET(11a)–RFC[2+3+4] and pLANT-2/RIL–RFC[1+5] were transformed into BL21(DE3) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells (Millipore). For protein expression, transformants were grown in 4 L of prewarmed terrific broth medium with 50 μg/mL kanamycin and 100 μg/mL ampicillin at 37°C and induced with IPTG at an optical density of 0.8. Expression was continued at 18°C for 16–18 hr. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 300 mL lysis buffer (30 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.25 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2 mM DTT, 2 μg/mL aprotinin, 0.2 μg/mL pepstatin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, 1 mM PMSF). RFC was purified by chromatography over 10 mL SP-Sepharose (80 mL gradient of 300–600 mM NaCl) and 10 mL Q-Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 40 mL gradient of 150–500 mM NaCl). Fractions of RFC were pooled and dialyzed overnight into 30 mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 2 mM DTT.</p><p>PCNA was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaubitz et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, BL21 (DE3) <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were transformed with a 6xHis-PPX-PCNA-expressing pET-28 vector (PPX = Precission protease). For protein expression, 1 L of induced cells was grown overnight at 18°C in terrific broth medium with 50 μg/mL kanamycin. Cells were pelleted and resuspended 30 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, and 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Upon cell lysis, centrifugation, and lysate filtration, the lysate was applied to a 5 mL HisTrap FF column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with a 1 M NaCl buffer and subsequently with a 50 mM NaCl buffer. PCNA was eluted with 500 mM imidazole. The eluted protein was cleaved with Precission protease. The cleaved protein was applied to a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare), from which it was eluted with 2 M NaCl in a 100 mL gradient. RFC-containing fractions were dialyzed against 30 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 2 mM DTT. Purified RFC was concentrated, aliquoted, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at –80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Crosslinking</title><p>RFC and PCNA were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio and buffer exchanged into 1 mM TCEP, 200 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES–NaOH, pH 7.5, and 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Data processing of the datasets with nicked or gapped DNA was performed with minor modifications as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Micrograph frames were aligned in IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>) with 2× binning, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å/pixel. Particle picking was performed using cisTEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 2018</xref>). Following particle picking, particles were extracted with a box size of 240 pixels (dataset with p/t DNA) or 320 pixels (all other datasets) and subjected to 2D classification. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Particles from classes with well-defined features were selected for processing in Relion 3.1. Coordinates and micrographs were imported into Relion 3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>), CTF parameters were re-estimated with CtfFind-4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>), and particles were subjected to several rounds of 3D classification. For 3D classification of the dataset with the 6-gapped DNA, the down-filtered RFC:PCNA:2p/tDNA cryo-EM reconstruction was used as reference, for 3D classification of the datasets with the 5-gapped and nicked DNA, the downfiltered reconstructions of RFC:PCNA:6-gapped DNA and RFC:PCNA:5-gapped DNA, respectively, were used as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All references were downfiltered to 50 Å. In the dataset of RFC:PCNA bound to 6-gapped DNA, we observe classes of RFC bound to opened or closed PCNA. However, for further refinement we focused on classes that represented the highest number of particles and also had the highest resolution. In these classes, PCNA is always in the closed conformation across the different datasets. The cryo-EM density was postprocessed in Relion for estimating the resolution and autosharpened (for RFC:PCNA:2p/tDNA) or density modified with PHENIX for model building and refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Terwilliger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Model information was not used for density modification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>The structure of yeast RFC bound to closed PCNA and p/t DNA (PDB ID: 7TID) was used for initial fitting of the cryo-EM reconstruction of RFC:PCNA bound to 6-gapped DNA. All subunits were split into globular domains and fitted into the cryo-EM density with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). For building the BRCT domain and the adjacent alpha-helix, the AlphaFold model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Varadi et al., 2022</xref>) corresponding to these residues was fitted into the cryo-EM density. The model was adjusted in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>), and the DNA was built in manually. The manually adjusted model of RFC:PCNA:6-gapped DNA was used to rigid body fit the cryo-EM density of RFC:PCNA bound to 5-gapped DNA and the density of RFC:PCNA bound to nicked DNA. The fitted models were adjusted and the DNA was built in manually in Coot. The adjusted models were real-space refined in PHENIX1.19 and PHENIX1.20.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liebschner et al., 2019</xref>).

The DNA was replaced by p/t DNA and an ideal B-form DNA molecule for the externally bound DNA. The flipped bases in proximity to the external separation pin were added manually with Coot. The density did not allow the unambiguous assignment of the exact sequence of the externally bound DNA. Moreover, the PCNA density in proximity to RFC-E is highly distorted, likely owing to a structural heterogeneity of particles in this class with PCNA being bound to RFC in the open and closed form. Therefore, the model was not further refined.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ATPase assays</title><p>0.12 μM RFC was incubated with a master mix (3 U/mL pyruvate kinase, 3 U/mL lactate dehydrogenase, 1 mM ATP, 670 μM phosphoenol pyruvate, 170 μM NADH, 50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 0.5 mM TCEP, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 mM potassium glutamate, 40 mM NaCl), 1 µM PCNA, and 1 µM annealed DNA substrates, whose sequences are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Bruce Stillman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Jeruzalmi (Reviewer #2); Peter Burgers (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern with this study is the choice of DNA substrate. Previous biochemical studies from several labs have shown that binding of 5'-junction DNA to an isolated BRCT domain strongly depends on the presence of the 5'-phosphate. Other single BRCT domains that bind DNA, e.g. from Rev1, also show a strong dependence on the 5'-phosphate. DNA repair intermediates, such as base excision repair products after incision by Apn1/2, carry 5'-phosphates. Very surprisingly, the DNA substrates used in this study lack the physiologically relevant 5'-phosphate. The only experiment in the paper that indirectly addresses the issue is in Figure 4A; it shows that the melting of the 5'-nucleotide occurs independently of the presence of the phosphate. There is no discussion on why the authors chose the unphosphorylated DNA substrate. If the phosphate indeed is an important feature, it would benefit the authors to determine cryoEM studies with the proper DNA.</p><p>1. Page 2 in the introduction, left paragraph. The authors cite papers showing that Rad24-RLC binds to ssDNA/dsDNA with a 5'-recessed ssDNA/dsDNA junction and cite Kubota et al. 2015, and two papers from Majka and Burgers.

The authors show that mutations that alter the amino-terminus of Rfc1 create sensitivity to MMS. They should cite the following paper that has reported genetic evidence that mutations in RFC1 cause sensitivity to MMS. These are not the same mutations, but nevertheless, confirm the new finding:</p><p>McAlear, M. A., Tuffo, K. M. and Holm, C.

We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we did not report this clearly in our manuscript. Actually, the nicked DNA substrate we used for our cryo-EM study has a 5’-phosphate on its non-primer strand (Table 2). To clarify this better, we adjusted the text in the Results section and in Figure 4B to indicate that the 5’-phosphate is present on the non-primer strand. All changes in the text of the manuscript are highlighted in blue.</p><p>In the density map of RFC:PCNA bound to nicked DNA, the 5’ nucleotide of the non-primer strand was not resolved well, so we did not model it in our final structure. The 5-gap and 6-gap DNA substrates do not have the 5’-phosphate, and their 5’ end is not poised to interact with BRCT domain in the structures with RFC similar to what we observed in the nicked DNA structure.</p><p>Nevertheless, we wanted to explore whether the 5’-phosphate is important for DNA melting and PCNA loading. Therefore, we measured 2AP fluorescence using DNA with or without 5’phosphate (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We placed the 2AP in the non-primer strand to report on base-flipping activity of RFC at the external DNA binding site. The addition of 5’ phosphate did not significantly change the base flipping activity of RFC on 5’-recessed, 5- or 6-nucleotide gapped DNA, and nicked DNA. This base-flipped state that the 2AP experiments report on is presumably the same state as that of our cryoEM structures. With a gap of ideal length (6nt), the DNA is capped on each end and fits the clamp loader without the need for melting in either the internal nor the external DNA binding site. With a 5nt gap, one nucleotide melts and we observe in the structure that this is occurring primarily on the interior site. We do not observe melting at the exterior site, in line with the results of our 2AP experiments (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Taken together, we conclude that the 5’ phosphate is not important for melting activity.</p><p>We further probed the importance of the 5’-phosphate using steady state ATPase measurements. The addition of the 5’ phosphate triggers a modest increase in ATPase activity of RFC for some of the gapped DNA substrates, but not nicked DNA. However, we cannot conclude which step of the clamp loading reaction is affected by the 5’ phosphate from our steady state ATPase measurements. Future pre-steady state experiments will investigate this further, as these experiments are beyond the scope of this study. Taken together, our 2AP and ATPase measurements indicate that the gapped DNA structures that we captured by cryo-EM are not significantly perturbed by the lack of a 5’-phosphate. The new results are shown in Figure 4— figure supplement 2 as well as described in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

We have updated the Results and Discussion sections to provide a more thorough description of the ATPase results and their interpretation. We agree with the reviewers that RFC’s lower ATP hydrolysis rate with 5-nt gap DNA could be explained by a slower RFC release from the DNA. Indeed, release of RFC from primer-template DNA is thought to be the rate-limiting step under steady-state conditions (Sakato et al. 2012). However, all of the prior pre-steady state measurements were performed using p/t-DNA, but not with nicked or gapped DNA. Therefore it is also possible that other steps in the clamp loading mechanism prior to RFC release (initial DNA binding, DNA melting etc.) become rate-limiting when RFC loads at gapped or nicked DNA. Future pre-steady state experiments will investigate this hypothesis in more detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

In that regard, it is of interest to note that Apn2 has a PCNA binding motif.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the specific role of the BRCT domain warrants further investigation. We now report that rfc1-∆BRCT yeast cells grow equally well as WT when challenged with the DNA damaging reagent 4NQO (Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These results support the notion that deletion of the BRCT domain causes yeast to have defective base excision repair, because 4NQO damage is primarily repaired by NER. Therefore, our new data strengthen our hypothesis that the Rfc1 BRCT domain primarily facilitates RFC’s functions in base excision repair.</p><p>We fully agree that further mutagenesis and epistasis studies will be important for teasing apart the precise role of the BRCT domain in RFC function; this will be investigated in future studies and is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

In the case of efforts to understand the structure of double-stranded DNA, the complex interplay between Watson, Crick, and Franklin should be recognized and acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and we have changed the names of the DNA strands of the second DNA molecule bound on RFC’s exterior DNA binding site to strand1 and strand2 in Figure 1 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The RFC subunits have proper names, Rfc1 through Rfc5. Please, indicate how A and E subunits, etc., correspond to those. Authors also tend to switch up and down between nomenclatures which is confusing to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated Figure 1 and the manuscript for clarification and to keep the nomenclature consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. P6L, middle. The ATPase assay (Figure 2D) is described too vaguely, and conclusions of the gap size effect are lacking. This steady-state ATPase assay measures multiple turnovers, which requires iterative cycles of PCNA loading, followed by PCNA sliding (away from the loading site and off the DNA) and RFC dissociation, before reloading. The lower ATPase of the 5-nt gap would be consistent with the more sustained binding of the complex.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have updated the manuscript to include a more thorough discussion of the steady state ATPase results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The DNA damage sensitivity study of the δ-BRCT mutant closely recapitulates that of an Rfc1 NTD deletion study over twenty years ago, which was quoted. With the added insights in DNA repair pathways in general, and with the BRCT DNA binding properties here specifically, a more targeted site-directed mutagenesis approach would be more appropriate, and so would an epistasis analysis. For example, is the BRCT-δ phenotype epistatic to that of an Apn1/2 deletion? In that regard, it is of interest to note that Apn2 has a PCNA binding motif.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we have challenged δ BRCT yeast with an additional DNA damaging reagent to further test the hypothesis that RFC’s BRCT domain contributes to BER. A systematic study with yeast double mutants is a fantastic suggestion and will be the focus of follow-up work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
