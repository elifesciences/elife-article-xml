In the brain, endocannabinoids act via Type 1-cannabinoid receptors (CB1) to modulate synaptic transmission and mediate multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. CB1 knockout (CB1KO) mice display a range of behavioral phenotypes, in particular hypoactivity and various deficits in learning and memory, including cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning. Here we find that the apparent effects of CB1 deletion on cerebellar learning are not due to direct effects on CB1-dependent plasticity, but rather, arise as a secondary consequence of altered behavioral state. Hypoactivity of CB1KO mice accounts for their impaired eyeblink conditioning across both animals and trials. Moreover, learning in these mutants is rescued by walking on a motorized treadmill during training. Finally, cerebellar granule-cell-specific CB1KOs exhibit normal eyeblink conditioning, and both global and granule-cell-specific CB1KOs display normal cerebellum-dependent locomotor coordination and learning. These findings highlight the modulation of behavioral state as a powerful independent means through which individual genes contribute to complex behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endocannabinoids</kwd><kwd>CB1</kwd><kwd>eyeblink conditioning</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>behavioral state</kwd><kwd>locomotion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist 55007413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>European Research Council Starting Grant 640093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/77686/2011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albergaria</surname><given-names>Catarina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/105949/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>N Tatiana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/86265/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darmohray</surname><given-names>Dana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabinoid receptors modulate cerebellar learning, not through direct effects on synaptic plasticity, but as a secondary consequence of their modulation of behavioral state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Signals relating to ongoing behavior are widely represented in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Musall et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Powell et al., 2015</xref>). Sensorimotor signals can be used to monitor and refine ongoing movements, while generalized changes in behavioral state, including arousal and levels of locomotor activity, influence sensory processing and perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">McGinley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schneider and Mooney, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pakan et al., 2016</xref>). Both locomotor activity and arousal modulate delay eyeblink conditioning, a form of cerebellum-dependent associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Neuromodulatory systems often directly affect behavioral state and also modulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. For example, cannabinoids are profound modulators of behavioral state, across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mackie, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Oakes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luchtenburg et al., 2019</xref>). Throughout the brain, endocannabinoids act as retrograde messengers to regulate neurotransmitter release, mainly via Type-1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors. Presynaptic CB1 receptors also mediate short- and long-term forms of synaptic plasticity in a wide variety of brain regions and cell types, raising the possibility that they provide a direct substrate for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Freund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mackie, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chevaleyre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Regehr et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>CB1 knockout mice (CB1KO) display a variety of behavioral phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Valverde et al., 2005</xref>). They exhibit altered feeding behavior, anxiety, and nociception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Degroot and Nomikos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ravinet Trillou et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, global CB1KOs are hypoactive, and spend less time running than their wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dubreucq et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaouloff et al., 2011</xref>). This hypoactivity has been attributed to the loss of CB1 receptors from GABAergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubreucq et al., 2013</xref>). They also display a range of impairments in learning and memory, including spatial memory and fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Varvel and Lichtman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marsicano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pamplona and Takahashi, 2006</xref>).</p><p>In the cerebellum, CB1 receptors are highly expressed in granule cells and are required for several forms of plasticity within the cerebellar cortex. They mediate short-term suppression of excitation and inhibition, which act on a timescale of tens of milliseconds to several seconds, as well as multiple forms of long-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diana and Marty, 2004</xref>). In particular, CB1 receptors have been implicated in long-term depression (LTD) between parallel fibers and Purkinje cells, an oft-hypothesized, but widely debated, substrate for cerebellar learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ito, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schonewille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Johansson et al., 2018</xref>). Neither global CB1KOs nor granule-cell-specific CB1KOs express LTD in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A previous study found that global CB1KOs were impaired in delay eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishimoto and Kano, 2006</xref>), a form of cerebellum-dependent associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McCormick and Thompson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim and Thompson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heiney et al., 2014</xref>). Pharmacological evidence also implicates CB1 signaling in eyeblink conditioning. Systemic CB1 antagonists impair acquisition of delay eyeblink conditioning in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishimoto and Kano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2020</xref>), as do both systemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2016</xref>) and intracerebellar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2020</xref>) CB1 agonists. However, a critical role for cerebellar CB1-mediated plasticity in cerebellar learning has not been directly established.</p><p>We recently demonstrated that engaging in locomotor activity enhances delay eyeblink conditioning within the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>), raising the question of whether hypoactivity could indirectly contribute to the apparent impairments of CB1KO mice in cerebellar learning. Here we find that decreased locomotor activity fully accounts for the effects of CB1 deletion on eyeblink conditioning. Moreover, both global and cerebellar granule-cell-specific CB1KO mice show normal cerebellum-dependent locomotor learning. We conclude that the previously described effects of CB1R deletion on cerebellar learning arise as a secondary consequence of hypoactivity in CB1KOs, and not from direct effects on cerebellar plasticity. These findings highlight the modulation of behavioral state, including locomotor activity, as a powerful mechanism through which individual genes contribute to cognition and behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CB1KOs are hypoactive and have impaired eyeblink conditioning</title><p>We tested cerebellum-dependent delay eyeblink conditioning in global CB1KO mice and their wildtype littermates using a head-fixed apparatus with a freely rotating running wheel as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>).

We analyzed the amplitude and timing of CRs in CB1KOs by analyzing trials in which the CS was presented alone, without a US. Like the percentage of CRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), eyelid closures in CB1KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, red line) were smaller than the CRs elicited in the more active control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, dashed line), but comparable to their activity-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, solid lines). In addition, CRs of CB1KOs, like those of controls, were well-timed: they peaked at around the time that the US would have been presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We previously showed for wildtype mice that both session-to session and trial-to-trial variation in the amplitude of CRs is positively correlated with locomotor speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>). This was also true for global CB1KOs (trials: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; sessions: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). At a given walking speed, CR amplitudes were comparable for CB1KOs and their littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). However, there were differently skewed distributions of locomotor speeds across trials in the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> histogram). Therefore, to quantitatively compare CR amplitudes, we analyzed trials in which the animals were stationary, starting from onset of learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). There was no significant difference in the amplitude of eyelid closure for stationary trials in CB1KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J,K</xref>; p=0.58).</p><p>Endocannabinoid signaling mediates short-term plasticity that acts on a timescale of tens of milliseconds up to several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chevaleyre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Regehr et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore investigated whether there might be more subtle effects on learned responses on these timescales in CB1KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). First, we investigated the timing of CRs to longer (500 ms) interstimulus intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Perrett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chettih et al., 2011</xref>).

Next, we asked whether a lack of CB1 signaling could interfere with single-trial learning effects, in which response amplitudes are modulated based on the presence or absence of an air-puff US on the <italic>previous</italic> trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>, inset; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang and Lisberger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khilkevich et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Najafi and Medina, 2020</xref>). Both CB1KOs and controls displayed larger amplitude CRs on trials following trials that included a puff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Thus, even these more subtle features of delay eyeblink conditioning, both of which have been hypothesized to result from plasticity in the cerebellar cortex, were intact in CB1KO mice.</p><p>Taken together, the results so far suggest that the apparent impairments in eyeblink conditioning of CB1KO mice, both in terms of rate and amplitude of learning, can be fully accounted for by their hypoactivity.

Wildtype mice were injected intra-peritoneally with the CB1R antagonist AM251 before each training session. Similar to the locomotor phenotype of CB1KO mice, acute antagonist application reduced several measures of locomotor activity both across and within animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Several previous studies have demonstrated that cannabinoids, strong modulators of synaptic transmission that are required for several forms of plasticity, influence cerebellum-dependent associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishimoto and Kano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2020</xref>). Here we show that this influence is exerted indirectly, through alteration of behavioral state; CB1 receptors themselves are dispensable for two distinct forms of cerebellar learning.</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence presented here support the conclusion that the apparent effects of CB1 deletion on cerebellar learning arise as a secondary consequence of the hypoactivity of global CB1KOs, rather than through direct effects on cerebellar plasticity. First, eyeblink conditioning deficits in CB1KO mice were fully accounted for by differences in locomotor activity, across both animals and trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Second, eyeblink conditioning in global CB1KOs was fully rescued by equalizing locomotor activity with a motorized treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Third, a systemic CB1-antagonist did not impair eyeblink conditioning on a motorized treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Fourth, CB1KOs were able to learn to walk more symmetrically in a cerebellum-dependent locomotor learning task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, mice lacking CB1 receptors in cerebellar granule cells exhibited none of the behavioral phenotypes observed in global knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>Knockout animals have been used extensively to investigate the role of specific receptors and signaling pathways in complex behaviors such as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dubnau and Tully, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Picciotto and Wickman, 1998</xref>). The sometimes-conflicting findings from this approach are often attributed to its widely-acknowledged drawbacks, including limited cellular and temporal specificity, and the possibility of compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>). In this case, we present a different confound: a receptor that appears to be required for learning in one behavioral context, is not required in another. Altering behavioral state – whether via the cannabinoid system, or by exposure to a motorized treadmill – profoundly modulates the capacity for learning. As a consequence, externally controlling locomotor activity rescues the effect of CB1 receptor deletion, revealing a complex interplay between genes, behavior, and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Eisener-Dorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Picciotto and Wickman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crawley, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, when we corrected for differences in locomotor activity, we often observed a small but consistent enhancement of learning in CB1KOs. This was true on the self-paced treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>) as well as on the motorized treadmill (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). This could be due to compensatory mechanisms upregulated in response to parallel fiber CB1 deletion, although interestingly, a similar trend was also observed following acute treatment with a CB1R antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). An alternative possibility is that this small enhancement is a consequence of decreased arousal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>). Although locomotor activity levels generally increase with heightened arousal, as measured by pupil size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mineault et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reimer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Reimer et al., 2016</xref>), by controlling for differences in locomotion we previously demonstrated that increased arousal on its own has a small negative influence on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>). Thus the subtle enhancement of learning and the smaller pupil sizes in CB1KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) are consistent with the possibility that the altered behavioral state of the CB1KOs could have two competing effects on learning: one detrimental, due to decreased locomotor activity, and one beneficial, due to decreased arousal. Under physiological conditions, however, the enhancement by locomotor activity is a much stronger determinant of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albergaria et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The modulation of behavioral state in CB1KO mice is likely to be of extra-cerebellar origin. Deletion of CB1 receptors from interneurons in the ventral tegmental area was identified as the source of hypoactivity in CB1KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dubreucq et al., 2013</xref>). CB1KOs also exhibit a number of other behavioral differences, including altered feeding and anxiety levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zimmer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Degroot and Nomikos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ravinet Trillou et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that CB1Rs on non-granule-cell types within the cerebellum, such as molecular layer interneurons or climbing fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diana and Marty, 2004</xref>) may contribute either to hypoactivity and/or to the subtle motor phenotype we observed in mice walking on a motorized treadmill (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). However, regardless of the origin of the hypoactivity, correcting for it reveals that CB1Rs are not required for eyeblink conditioning.</p><p>The finding that all behavioral measures were normal in G6KOs suggests that all forms of parallel fiber-mediated CB1-dependent plasticity at synapses onto either Purkinje cells or interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenowitz and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2011</xref>) are dispensable for eyeblink conditioning as well as cerebellum-dependent locomotor coordination and learning. This seems unlikely to be solely due to compensation in the knockouts, since a CB1 antagonist, which induces hypoactivity, similarly caused no impairment in eyeblink conditioning on a motorized treadmill.</p><p>In pointing toward an extracerebellar role for CB1 receptors in modulating cerebellar learning, our results are consistent with previous findings that systemic CB1 antagonists impair eyeblink conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kishimoto and Kano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2010</xref>), but localized infusion in the cerebellar cortex does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2020</xref>). While both systemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2016</xref>) and intracerebellar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steinmetz and Freeman, 2020</xref>) CB1 agonists impair acquisition, this is likely to be due to acute suppression of neurotransmitter release, rather than reflecting specific effects on learning. Indeed, our results suggest that endocannabinoid signaling within the cerebellar cortex may be less important for learning-related plasticity than for regulating overall levels of excitability and transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Marsicano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Regehr et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Since previous studies have demonstrated the necessity of CB1 receptors in parallel fiber LTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Safo and Regehr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carey et al., 2011</xref>), our results would seem to argue against a critical role for parallel fiber LTD in cerebellar learning. While we cannot rule out the possibility that a CB1-independent form of LTD could be invoked in vivo, there are a host of other plasticity mechanisms within the cerebellar circuit that could provide potential substrates for learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hansel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carey, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johansson et al., 2015</xref>). However, we emphasize that a broader point made by our results is that such reductionist approaches to the complex system that is the brain of a behaving animal should be taken with caution. Myriad plasticity mechanisms can be induced in vitro, and variations in induction protocols and other factors may alter the specific cellular pathways involved under various conditions. Neuromodulators like cannabinoids have multiple effects on synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavioral state, and as we underscore here, untangling these effectively requires more than one approach.</p><p>In conclusion, CB1 receptors modulate cerebellum-dependent associative learning via indirect effects on behavioral state, and not via CB1-mediated parallel fiber plasticity.

To externally control the speed of the treadmill, a DC motor with an encoder (Maxon) was used. For experiments on the motorized treadmill, mice were additionally habituated to walk at the target speed until they walked normally and displayed no external signs of distress. There was no difference across genotypes in the amount of habituation time.</p><p>Locomotor activity was measured using an infra-red reflective sensor placed underneath the treadmill. Eyelid movements of the right eye were recorded using a high-speed monochromatic camera (Genie HM640, Dalsa) to monitor a 172 × 160 pixel region, at 900fps. Custom-written software using LabVIEW, together with a NI PCIE-8235 frame grabber and a NI-DAQmx board (National Instruments), was used to trigger and control all the hardware in a synchronized manner.</p><p>Acquisition sessions consisted of the presentation of 100 CS-US paired trials and 10 CS-only trials, which allow for the analysis of the kinematics of CRs without the masking effect that comes from the US-elicited reflex blink. The 110 trials were separated by a randomized inter-trial interval (ITI) of 5–20 s. In each trial, CS and US onsets were separated by a fixed interval (ISI) of 300 ms and both stimuli co-terminated. The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> were conducted in dedicated ‘test sessions’ following acquisition, in which only 50% of the trials contained an air-puff US, in order to assess the influence of US presence/absence on single-trial learning.</p><p>For all training experiments, the unconditioned stimulus (US) was an air-puff (40 psi, 50 ms) controlled by a Picospritzer (Parker) and delivered via a 27G needle positioned ~0.5 cm away from the cornea of the right eye of the mouse. The direction of the air-puff was adjusted for each session of each mouse so that the unconditioned stimulus elicited a normal eye blink. The CS had a 350 ms duration and was a white light LED (5 mW) positioned ~3 cm directly in front of the mouse.</p><p>The video from each trial was analyzed offline with custom-written software using MATLAB (MathWorks). The distance between eyelids was calculated frame by frame by thresholding the grayscale image and extracting the minor axis of the ellipse that delineated the eye. Eyelid traces were normalized for each session, ranging from 1 (full blink) to 0 (eye fully open). Trials were classified as CRs if the eyelid closure reached at least 0.1 (in normalized pixel values) and occurred between 100 ms after the time of CS onset and the onset of US.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of locomotor coordination</title><p>Locomotor coordination was assessed using our previously described LocoMouse setup, a tracking and analysis system for freely moving mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, mice walked across a glass corridor, with a mirror placed at 45 deg below the mouse, so that a single high-speed camera recorded both bottom and side views. Individual trials consisted of single crossings of the corridor. Mice initiated trials by walking back and forth between two dark ‘home’ boxes on each end of the corridor. Tracking and gait analysis was performed offline.</p><p>Tracking data was first broken down into strides using a simple peak detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado et al., 2015</xref>).

Since, LDA assumes independence within the feature space, PCA was applied first to address inter-variable correlation and avoid overfitting. PCA was performed by eigenvalue decomposition of the data covariance matrix. The first 10 PCs explained 86% of the variance and the data projected onto these 10 PCs was used as input to the LDA. The end contributions of the initial gait parameters to the two LD axes were obtained by multiplying the PCA mapping by the LDA mapping.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Locomotor learning on a split-belt treadmill</title><p>Split-belt locomotor adaptation experiments and analyses were performed on a modified version of the LocoMouse setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Machado et al., 2015</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darmohray et al., 2019</xref>). Two motor-driven transparent treadmill belts independently imposed the walking speed on the two sides of the body. Split-belt locomotor adaptation experiments consisted of ‘baseline’ tied, split-belt, and ‘washout’ tied-belt trials. All trials were one minute in duration, with brief periods in which the motors were off, in between trials.</p><p>Granule-cell-specific CB1KO mice and their littermate controls were run in a single session adaptation protocol (two tied trials, eight split trials; eight tied trials). For these mice, split-belt trial speeds were at a 2.14:1 ratio: 0.175 m/s (slow) and 0.375 m/s (fast). Global CB1KO mice and their littermate controls underwent a longer, multi-session adaptation protocol consisting of 10 trials per day (session 1: three tied, seven split; sessions 2–3: 10 split; session 4: three split, seven tied; session 5: 10 tied), with lower overall belt speeds (tied: 0.2 m/s; slow: 0.125 m/s fast: 0.275 m/s).</p><p>For split-belt locomotor adaptation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we compared mutants and littermate controls on individual and interlimb coordination parameters. For individual limb analyses, we compared the two groups on their initial response to split-belt walking by assessing how stride length and step-length symmetry scaled on the first split-belt trials. Limb speeds during stance were monitored throughout the split-belt period to ensure that animals were consistently maintaining split-belt walking; two animals were excluded from the global CB1KO experiment for not meeting this criterion. To assess learned changes in interlimb coordination, we compared the change in symmetry from early to late split (late – early) and aftereffects (first washout trial – average baseline) of mutants and littermate controls. For percent symmetry change plots, changeover split trials (late – early) and aftereffects were normalized by the average (group) initial error.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistics toolbox in MATLAB and R. For the correlation between speed and CR amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), we used a mixed model approach. We specified random slopes and intercepts models and included mouse/subject as a random covariate using the lme2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates, 2005</xref>). We report F tests (ANOVA) with Satterthwaite degrees of freedom correction; reported post-hoc analyses are t-tests with Tukey corrections for multiple comparisons. For the correlation between average distance and onset session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), as well as session-to-session changes in distance and CR amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>), we used linear regression. To compare the average distance between animals of each genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the differences between average CR peak amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), onset learning sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the average amplitudes of eyelid closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), we used Student’s unpaired t-tests. For comparing behavioral state parameters between CB1KOs and littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>), as well as between animals injected with AM251 or vehicle solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>) and granule-cell-specific CB1KOs and respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), we used the same test. For within animal comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), we performed a Student’s paired t-test.</p><p>For locomotor adaptation analyses, we used mixed models to test for fixed effects of genotype (CB1KOs and littermate controls) and experimental phase on the asymmetry of each gait parameter (either stride length, step length). Experimental phase had three levels including early split (initial error), change over split trials (late - early) and aftereffects. Early and late split were the first and last split-belt trials. Aftereffects were the first post-split tied-belt trial.

the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses, and CB1 antagonists also influence eyeblink conditioning, so the assumption has been that these two observations were causally related. Here, the authors upend this view, providing convergent lines of evidence that the effects of a CB1 antagonist on eyeblink conditioning are instead indirectly mediated by its effects on locomotion, which this lab has previously shown to influence eyeblink conditioning. There are significant implications for understanding the role of plasticity at the parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses in cerebellum-dependent learning.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Signaling through endocannabinoid (CB1) receptors has been shown to influence several forms of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum and also to influence cerebellum-dependent learning tasks, including eyeblink conditioning. Here, the authors show quite convincingly that the effects of manipulating CB1 signaling on eyeblink conditioning are mediated, not directly through effects on cerebellar plasticity, as one would assume, but indirectly through the effects of CB1 signaling on the behavioral state of the animal, and, more specifically, the level of locomotor activity. The study design is strong, leveraging global and cerebellar granule cell specific knockout of CB1 and acute pharmacological manipulations, and using the natural behavioral variability as well as experimenter-controlled manipulation of the level of locomotion using a motorized treadmill to obtain convergent evidence for the conclusions. The results provide additional support for the authors' previous work showing an influence of locomotion on eyeblink conditioning, and raise the interesting the question of what the functional role of CB1 signaling within the cerebellum might be, which could inspire more work to resolve it. More generally, this study highlights the need for caution in interpreting causal relationships between observations at the synaptic and behavioral level. If one observes that a given manipulation affects both synaptic plasticity and learning, it may be tempting to infer a causal relationship from that correlation, but the authors' findings provide a reminder that deeper analysis is required, and that the behavioral state can have widespread influence on brain function, including functions that are considered low-level or automatic.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A more nuanced interpretation of the results in the context of previous findings is merited.</p><p>1) More than one reviewer noted that the authors should include discussion of the documents effects of agonists on eyeblink conditioning, which yield different insights and conclusions about the role of cannabinoid signaling in the cerebellum than the effects of antagonists alone, which are described in this and previous studies. Cannabinoid agonists cause eyeblink conditioning deficits in humans and rats. These deficits cannot be attributed to decreased locomotor activity because humans are instructed to stay seated and rats freeze throughout the training sessions.

Cannabinoid agonists cause eyeblink conditioning deficits in humans and rats. These deficits cannot be attributed to decreased locomotor activity because humans are instructed to stay seated and rats freeze throughout the training sessions. Moreover, the deficits in rats are found with intracerebellar agonist infusions. The agonist effects combined with the current findings seem to suggest that CB1Rs within the cerebellum are not essential for cerebellar learning mechanisms under normal conditions, but cannabinoid agonists can impair cerebellar learning by artificially suppressing NT release within the cortex.

We have added additional information about the effects of CB1 agonists to the Introduction, and added a new paragraph to the Discussion, where we explicitly discuss our results within the context of the agonist studies.

We have added a new Figure 1—figure supplement 2, which addresses both timing and single trial effects – both of which are completely normal in CB1KOs.
