continuous eye growth throughout life. We found that <italic>Yap</italic>, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, is specifically expressed in these stem cells. <italic>Yap</italic> knock-down leads to an accelerated S-phase and an abnormal progression of DNA replication, a phenotype likely mediated by upregulation of <italic>c-Myc</italic>. This is associated with an increased occurrence of DNA damage and eventually p53-p21 pathway-mediated cell death. Finally, we identified PKNOX1, a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of genomic stability, as a functional and physical interactant of YAP. Altogether, we propose that YAP is required in adult retinal stem cells to regulate the temporal firing of replication origins and quality control of replicated DNA. Our data reinforce the view that specific mechanisms dedicated to S-phase control are at work in stem cells to protect them from genomic instability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08488.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08488.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08488.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In animals, stem cells divide to produce the new cells needed to grow and renew tissues and organs. Understanding the biology of these cells is of the utmost importance for developing new treatments for a wide range of human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Before a stem cell divides, it copies its DNA and the two sets of genetic instructions are then separated so that the two daughter cells both have a complete set. This process needs to be as accurate as possible because any errors would result in incorrect genetic information being passed on to the daughter cells.</p><p>Stem cells in the light-sensitive part of the eye—called the retina—divide to produce the cells that detect light and relay visual information to the brain. In many animals, these stem cells stop dividing soon after birth and the retina stops growing. However, the stem cells in frogs and fish continue to divide throughout the life of the animal, which enables the eye to keep on growing.</p><p>A protein called YAP regulates the growth of organs in animal embryos, but it is not clear what role this protein plays in stem cells, particularly after birth. To address this question, Cabochette et al. studied YAP in the retina of frog tadpoles. The experiments show that YAP is produced in the stem cells of the retina after birth and is required for the retina to continue to grow.</p><p>Cabochette et al. used tools called ‘photo-cleavable Morpholinos’ to alter the production of YAP in adult stem cells. The cells that produced less YAP copied their DNA more quickly and more of their DNA became damaged, which eventually led to the death of these cells. Further experiments revealed that YAP interacts with a protein called PKNOX1, which is involved in maintaining the integrity of DNA.</p><p>Cabochette et al.'s findings provide the first insights into how YAP works in the stem cells of the retina and demonstrate that it plays a crucial role in regulating when DNA is copied. A future challenge is to find out whether YAP plays a similar role in the stem cells of other organs in adult animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08488.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08488.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>neural stem cell</kwd><kwd>Hippo/Yap pathway</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>ciliary marginal zone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>L' Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-BLAN-1220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Campus Paris Saclay, Foundation de Cooperation Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Idex Paris-Saclay</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Retina France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (National Center for Scientific Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Univ Paris Sud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cluster of Excellence</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Heidelberg University</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henningfeld</surname><given-names>Kristine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Hippo pathway downstream effector YAP regulates S-phase progression to protect neural stem cells of the retina from experiencing genomic instability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult stem cell maintenance is required to sustain long-term preservation of tissue homeostasis. In the fish or amphibian retina, a continuously proliferating peripheral domain called ciliary marginal zone (CMZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wetts et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perron et al., 1998</xref>) was recently formally demonstrated to contain genuine multipotent and self-renewing neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centanin et al., 2011</xref>). The CMZ not only ensures cell replacement, but also contributes to life-long growth of the eye through the permanent generation of all retinal cell types. The CMZ thus represents an ideal model for dissecting molecular cues underlying retinal stem cell properties in vivo. Such knowledge is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies based on the mobilization and targeted activation of endogenous neural stem cells for tissue repair.</p><p>The Hippo pathway effector yes-associated protein (YAP) was identified as a major regulator of organ growth through its actions on embryonic precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ramos and Camargo, 2012</xref>). YAP function in adult stem cells, however, remains unclear. For instance, <italic>Yap</italic> overexpression increases self-renewal of airway basal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, it surprisingly leads to a loss of intestinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry et al., 2013</xref>), while being seemingly neutral regarding the quantity and function of hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jansson and Larsson, 2012</xref>). Inactivation studies further suggested that YAP is largely dispensable in a physiological context for the homeostasis of several adult organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azzolin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), although this might reflect in some cases functional redundancy with the other Hippo effector TAZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imajo et al., 2015</xref>). YAP is implicated in tissue regeneration but its effects are controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the role of YAP in vertebrate adult stem cells may likely be context-dependent and clearly deserves further investigation. Since its function in adult neural stem cells is presently unknown, we took advantage of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> CMZ model system and investigated whether <italic>Yap</italic> is involved in the maintenance of an active pool of retinal stem cells in the continuously growing post-embryonic frog eye. Although YAP gain of function led quite expectedly to CMZ cell overproliferation, the loss of function analysis revealed a more complex phenotype. Indeed, we found that stem cells were still present but exhibited aberrant cell cycle progression. In particular, DNA replication timing was found to be altered leading to a dramatic S-phase shortening. This correlates with increased DNA damage and eventually cell death. We also found that YAP functionally and physically interacts with PKNOX1, a transcription factor required to maintain genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iotti et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Yap</italic> is expressed in slow dividing stem cells of the post-embryonic retina</title><p>In situ hybridization at the optic vesicle stage revealed prominent <italic>Yap</italic> expression in the presumptive retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and in the neural retina/RPE border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a region we previously proposed to be the presumptive adult stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El Yakoubi et al., 2012</xref>). In line with this, we found that in the post-embryonic retina, <italic>Yap</italic> is expressed in the most peripheral stem cell-containing region of the CMZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). We also performed immunostaining using an antibody whose specificity was assessed in a loss of function context, that is, in tadpoles injected with <italic>Yap</italic> Morpholinos (<italic>Yap</italic>-MO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for efficiency and specificity evaluation of <italic>Yap</italic>-MO). YAP protein was detected in stem cells located at the tip of the CMZ, mainly in the cytoplasm, although some signal could be observed as well in the nuclei of these cells. Of note, we also found YAP labeling in Müller glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To delineate more precisely the <italic>Yap</italic> expression domain, we co-labeled <italic>Yap</italic> and proliferative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A short EdU pulse was performed allowing slow dividing stem cells to be distinguished from fast proliferating transit amplifying progenitors in the CMZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xue and Harris, 2011</xref>). <italic>Yap</italic> staining was found to be prominent in EdU-negative stem cells and in the most peripheral EdU-positive cells (young progenitors).

We found that compared to the control, <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown results in a significantly lower percentage of mitotic cells per section, which is suggestive of a longer total cell cycle length.

Surprisingly, it also revealed a dramatic reduction of S-phase length in morphant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p><p>Such unexpected S-phase shortening prompted us to further investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. In eukaryotes, origins of replication are activated throughout the S-phase in a temporally controlled manner such that some origins fire early and others fire late. The <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Myc</italic> proto-oncogene has been shown to accelerate S-phase by inducing premature origin firing initiation and increasing origin density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Srinivasan et al., 2013</xref>).

This may account, at least in part, for the S-phase length shortening. To strengthen this hypothesis, we examined EdU-labeled replication foci at the tip of the CMZ. Their abundance and distribution, as classically observed in synchronized cultured cells, are indeed known to differ between early (numerous small foci located throughout the nucleus) and mid/late S-phase (limited number of large foci; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Dierendonck et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koberna et al., 2005</xref>).

In situ hybridization analysis revealed that its expression in the wild type retina is restricted to the CMZ. In addition and consistent with the NanoString data, <italic>p53</italic> staining was strongly enhanced in the CMZ of <italic>Yap</italic>-MO-injected tadpoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). Of note, an up-regulation was observed in the neural tube as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). p21 is a member of the CIP/KIP family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors that blocks the G1-S transition and has emerged as a key player in the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attardi and DePinho, 2004</xref>). Since it was previously described as a lens-specific marker in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daniels et al., 2004</xref>), we asked if it could be linked with the observed CMZ phenotype. We thus performed in situ hybridization and observed a strong ectopic <italic>p21</italic> labeling within the CMZ of <italic>Yap</italic> morphant tadpoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). As a whole, these results suggest that increased apoptosis and probably delayed cell cycle progression resulting from <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown might be driven by the p53-p21 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>PKNOX1 is a novel partner of YAP in the retina</title><p>As stated above, YAP is a co-transcriptional activator that functions in association with transcription factors such as its classical partners of the TEAD family.

Our knowledge regarding the molecular basis sustaining somatic stemness features is still very limited but may have important implications for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. In the present study, we identified YAP, a downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, as a stem cell specific marker required for homeostatic growth of the frog post-embryonic retina. Our in vivo loss of function approach unexpectedly revealed a novel role for YAP in governing DNA replication timing of retinal stem cells. We propose a model in which this function would contribute to the maintenance of their genomic stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Importantly, based on our findings in the neural tube, we propose that such function might be generalizable to other neural precursor populations. Whether this involves YAP cytoplasmic and/or nuclear activity remains an open question.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08488.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating YAP function in retinal stem cells.</title><p>We found that YAP is expressed in CMZ retinal stem cells (left panel). The middle panel shows the cell cycle of wild type retinal stem cells and the putative role of the YAP/PKNOX1 complex in the control of S-phase temporal progression (represented by the distinct patterns of DNA replication foci). YAP knock-down (right panel) leads to a dramatic reduction of S-phase length likely due to c-Myc-dependent premature firing of late replication origins. This results in increased occurrence of DNA damage, enhanced <italic>p21</italic> and <italic>p53</italic> expression and eventually cell death.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08488.018">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08488.018</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08488-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The ability of nuclear YAP to expand stem/progenitor cell populations has been established in numerous model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barry and Camargo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piccolo et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying altered cell proliferation (changes in cell cycle length and/or re-entry) are rarely investigated in detail. In the developing neural tube for instance, YAP-driven increase in neural progenitor cell number has been proposed to result from accelerated cell cycle progression but whether its loss of function alters cell cycle kinetics as well remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). As observed in other adult organs in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azzolin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), our results suggest that YAP is dispensable for the maintenance of the stem cell pool. We instead uncovered that its depletion lengthens retinal stem cell divisions. However, to our surprise, this is associated with a dramatic shortening of their S-phase. It should be emphasized that such phenotype likely corresponds to a hypomorphic one due to the use of Morpholinos that allows partial loss of function. DNA replication is a tightly regulated process that follows a strict temporal program. Our observation that <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown results in a mark reduction of late S-phase labeling patterns can suggest that some firing origins have advanced their activation timing, which may account for the reduced S-phase duration. The genetic control of DNA replication temporal progression has not been elucidated yet and there are thus very few examples in the literature where gene perturbation leads to a deregulation of S-phase duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aparicio, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>). Beyond its well-characterized transcriptional activity, it was reported that c-Myc exerts a non-transcriptional control on DNA replication. Its overexpression indeed causes increased replication origin activity and consequent S-phase shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez-Sola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Srinivasan et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, in contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> or cancer cells, where <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Myc</italic> has been reported to be positively regulated by <italic>Yap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neto-Silva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stocker, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>), we found that its expression is enhanced in the CMZ of <italic>Yap</italic> morphant tadpoles. Although the underlying mechanism deserves further investigation, this raises the hypothesis that <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Myc</italic> may contribute to the S-phase defects caused by <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown. Besides, in addition to be involved in replication progression, we do not exclude that YAP may also regulate replication origin licencing in G1, as recently reported in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen and Stanger, 2015</xref>). This might explain the observed lengthening of the cell cycle as a result of impaired G1/S transition. Alternatively, delayed G-phase progression might occur as a secondary consequence of S-phase defects.</p><p>Replication stress is a source of DNA damage, which may ultimately trigger activation of the p53-p21 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartek and Lukas, 2001</xref>). As observed following <italic>c</italic>-<italic>Myc</italic> overexpression in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominguez-Sola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Srinivasan et al., 2013</xref>), we found an increased occurrence of double-strand breaks in <italic>Yap</italic> morphant retina, associated with an upregulation of both <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>p21</italic>. Since p21 is known to inhibit G1/S and G2/M transitions and p53 to induce programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vogelstein et al., 2000</xref>), this could contribute to both the lengthening in G phases and the increased number of apoptotic cells.</p><p>These findings raise key questions regarding specific features of stem cell biology. In addition to unique properties (such as the ability to self renew), emerging evidence suggests that somatic stem cells also differ from progenitor cells in the way they regulate basic cellular processes including their metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess et al., 2014</xref>) or DNA-damage responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Insinga et al., 2014</xref>). Regarding cell cycle progression, it has been shown during development that mammalian cortical neural stem cells exhibit a substantially longer S-phase than progenitors committed to neuron production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Turrero García et al., 2015</xref>). It was thus proposed that neural stem cells may need to invest more time during S-phase into quality control of replicated DNA. In agreement with this, we also found that CMZ retinal stem cells exhibit a longer S-phase compared to fast amplifying progenitors (data not shown). In addition, our work points for the first time towards a factor, YAP, that may be critically involved in this stem cell specific regulation of S-phase. Although its precise function in this process remains to be investigated, it indeed appears to be required for proper choreography of the DNA replication program and may as such be necessary to maintain genomic integrity of retinal stem cells.</p><p>Our findings also have important medical implications since aberrant DNA replication timing has been proposed to be a causative factor in diseases such as cancer and neuronal disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aladjem, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watanabe and Maekawa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Donley and Thayer, 2013</xref>). Interestingly, another component of the Hippo pathway, LATS1, has very recently been involved in ATR-mediated response to replication stress in lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pefani et al., 2014</xref>). Several Hippo pathway components may thus regulate (independently or in concert) S-phase progression and quality control and thereby safeguard genomic integrity.</p><p>Although <italic>Homothorax</italic> is known to partner the <italic>Drosophila Yap</italic> homologue <italic>Yorkie</italic> in some developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), this has not been reported yet for its vertebrate orthologs. Here, we provide biochemical and functional evidences supporting an interaction between PKNOX1 and YAP in the retina. PKNOX1 belongs to the TALE (three amino acids loop extension) class of homeodomain proteins and is involved in many developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berthelsen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferretti et al., 2006</xref>). Down-regulation of <italic>pknox1</italic> in both zebrafish and mouse embryos leads to a small eye phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ferretti et al., 2006</xref>), reminiscent of what we found in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>pknox1</italic> inactivation was reported to trigger cell death in the zebrafish CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deflorian et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>pknox1</italic> deficiency leads to increased DNA damage and apoptosis both in embryonic fibroblasts and in the mouse epiblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Micali et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez-Diaz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iotti et al., 2011</xref>). On the basis of these different reports and our findings, we thus propose that PKNOX1 and YAP interact together to maintain genomic stability in retinal stem cells. Whether PKNOX1 functions in competition with TEAD for YAP interaction or whether they all associate in a tripartite complex are important questions to be addressed in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All animal care and experimentation were conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines, under the institutional license C 91-471-102.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All of the reviewers felt that this manuscript was very novel, interesting, and provided essential new insights into the function of YAP in neural stem cells in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> retina, and its function in cell cycle control and genomic stability. The authors showed that <italic>Yap</italic> loss results in elevated <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression, dramatically shortened S-phase with slower cell cycle progression, p53 induction and cell death. The accelerated S-phase is associated with a shift towards an “early” S-phase labeling patterns, increased DNA damage and death. Using morpholino knockdowns, fluorescence complementation analysis, overexpression and pull down assays they provide evidence for interaction of PKNOX1 with YAP. The reviewers were very impressed by the elegant approaches used, the high quality of the data throughout the manuscript, and the inclusion of many critical controls.</p><p>Issues to address in the revision:</p><p><italic>A) Experimental</italic></p><p>The reviewers felt that the study would be strengthened by some further characterization of the phenotype of overexpressed YAP. The knock down phenotype suggests that the cell cycle is extended by about 10hrs, which is the result of slowing down G2 by about 2h, shortening S-phase by about 13h, and assuming no change in M-phase, lengthening G1 by about 20h. Clearly the major affect is on G1 and S. It isn't very clear, why, if YAP-MO cells are rushing through S, why they also seem to hang up in G1. Perhaps cells that have made mistakes in the previous S have trouble in the G1-S transition. The reviewers felt there may be a clue to this in looking at what is happening in the overexpression/overactivity (overgrowth) phenotype. If YAP is affecting both of these phases of the cell cycle independently, then one would expect to see YAP overactivity both shorten G1 and lengthen S, but if the MO phenotype is primarily on S (inhibiting replication fork firing) then overactivity should slow down S but not affect G1 so much. The overactivity phenotype may also suppress <italic>c-myc</italic>, but this is problematic as <italic>c-myc</italic> is pro-proliferative. As there may be an antagonism <italic>n-myc</italic> and <italic>c-myc</italic> in this system, perhaps YAP-MO cells are biased to <italic>c-myc</italic> while YAP-overactive cells are biased to <italic>n-myc</italic>. A focused analysis on the cell cycle kinetics of the CMZ cells with a pulse of YAP should be considered.</p><p>While not essential, the reviewers also felt that it could strengthen the analysis if the authors determined if PNOX1 morphants also have elevated <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>B) Figure improvement and textual issues</italic></p><p>1) When is YAP expressed in retinal development? Does it become gradually restricted to the CMZ? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, it appears most <italic>Yap</italic> is cytoplasmic and not nuclear. The authors should comment on this. Do they think that the phenotypes caused by <italic>yap</italic> manipulation in the CMZ is due to cytoplasmic functions (and therefore interfering with other signaling pathways?).</p><p>2) The authors have done an excellent job in focussing in on stem cells and on the cell cycle effects, yet it is not altogether clear whether the cell cycle timing effects are particularly or only restricted to the stem cells. Are the YAP-controlled cell cycle dynamic effects quantifiably different in the stem cells vs. the progenitors?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the <italic>yap</italic> morphant eye appears to indicate great cell packing and cell number, but the eye (at least this section) looks to be the same size as controls. The Authors should comment on this – particularly as the general conclusion is that <italic>yap</italic> knock-down reduces the cell cycle period, increases cell death and causes a small eye phenotype. Is this because the eyes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> were taken at an earlier stage as compared to those described later on for the ‘final’ phenotype.</p><p>4) The formatting of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> is confusing. It would be improved by labeling the panels and images with the conditions rather than having the reader refer back to the table for explanation. (A clearer example is how similar data are represented in the supplemental data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). More guidance in the Legend and/or text might help. Or perhaps more direct labels in C and D.</p><p>5) The authors should emphasize this is a knock-down/partial loss of function study. The use of morpholinos is particularly complicated as the per cell knock-down and dynamics of knock-down can vary tremendously. The authors should more fully acknowledge the caveats of morpholino knock-down and that the phenotypes likely relate to hypomophic <italic>yap</italic> activity, and not full loss.</p><p>6) Related to point 3, the authors should comment on the potential role of taz/wwtr1 in providing addition (compensatory/redundant) co-transcriptional activity to that of <italic>Yap</italic>. What is the status of Taz expression in the frog CMZ?</p><p>7) Last, although <italic>Tead1</italic> was used as a positive control for <italic>yap</italic> interaction, the function of the most-common <italic>yap</italic> nuclear interactant was not addressed. Is this in competition for <italic>pknox1</italic> binding, functioning in a tripartite complex, or simply not expressed in the CMZ? At minimum, given the canonical nature of <italic>yap</italic>/taz-tead activity, this should be commented upon.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08488.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Issues to address in the revision:</italic></p><p>A) Experimental</p><p><italic>The reviewers felt that the study would be strengthened by some further characterization of the phenotype of overexpressed YAP.

A focused analysis on the cell cycle kinetics of the CMZ cells with a pulse of YAP should be considered.</italic></p><p>The question raised by the referee is very pertinent but extremely difficult to address in vivo. We do not have the tools to follow individual cells along their different rounds of division and can only measure global changes of cell cycle kinetics in a group of cells. As mentioned by the reviewer, this does not allow deciphering if G1 slow-down in <italic>Yap</italic> morphant CMZ is directly due to <italic>Yap</italic> depletion or a secondary consequence of S-phase defects. We agree that cell cycle kinetics analyses following <italic>Yap</italic> overexpression may provide some clues regarding that question. We thus performed two independent experiments but unfortunately, the analysis turned out to be more challenging than expected.</p><p>We first limited our analysis to the tip of the CMZ where stem cells reside. We however couldn’t find any difference in the EdU-labeling index between controls and <italic>Yap</italic>-overexpressing stem cells. We do not know whether this reflects that (i) YAP quantity is not limiting in these cells, (ii) whether YAP is not sufficient per se to slow down S-phase of stem cells (which already have a long S-phase) or (iii) whether homeostatic mechanisms maintain physiological levels of YAP activity in these <italic>Yap</italic>- expressing cells, as recently described in the mouse (Chen et al. Genes and Dev 2015 29(12):1285-97).</p><p>We thus wondered whether the impact of YAP on cell cycle kinetics could be detected in cells that normally do not express <italic>Yap</italic>. We therefore focused our analysis on CMZ progenitor cells. However, delimitation of the CMZ in many tadpoles was rendered extremely difficult by the deformations caused by the overgrowth phenotype (retinal folding). Consequently, we couldn’t discriminate post-mitotic neurons engulfed in the overgrown CMZ from EdU-negative proliferative cells. Our countings in CMZ progenitors are thus not trustable. Overall, we thus decided not to include these data in the manuscript. We thus leave open the question and accordingly modified the Discussion section: “Besides, in addition to be involved in replication progression, we do not exclude that YAP may also regulate replication origin licencing in G1, as recently reported in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen and Stanger, 2015</xref>) . This might explain the observed lengthening of the cell cycle as a result of impaired G1/S transition. Alternatively, delayed G-phase progression might occur as a secondary consequence of S-phase defects.”</p><p><italic>While not essential, the reviewers also felt that it could strengthen the analysis if the authors determined if PNOX1 morphants also have elevated</italic> c-Myc <italic>expression.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we performed <italic>c-Myc</italic> in situ hybridization on <italic>pknox1</italic> morphant retinas. We found that similarly to the <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown, <italic>c-Myc</italic> is upregulated in the CMZ compartment. This data is now added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (panel F) and mentioned in the Results section, last paragraph.</p><p>B) Figure improvement and textual issues</p><p><italic>1) When is YAP expressed in retinal development? Does it become gradually restricted to the CMZ?</italic>?</p><p>To address the question of <italic>Yap</italic> expression in retinal development, we now provide in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> in situ hybridization panels during embryonic retinogenesis. At optic vesicle stages, <italic>Yap</italic> is faintly expressed in the presumptive neural retina (NR) but strongly labels the presumptive retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as well as the NR/RPE border, a region that has been proposed to contain cells dedicated to form the CMZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">El Yakoubi et al., 2012</xref>). It then indeed gets restricted to the CMZ at later stages of development. These additional data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref> are mentioned in the Results section, subsection “Yap is expressed in slow dividing stem cells of the post-embryonic retina”.</p><p><italic>In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>, it appears most</italic> Yap <italic>is cytoplasmic and not nuclear. The authors should comment on this. Do they think that the phenotypes caused by</italic> yap <italic>manipulation in the CMZ is due to cytoplasmic functions (and therefore interfering with other signaling pathways?).</italic></p><p>As rightly noticed, YAP appears mainly cytoplasmic in CMZ cells. Yet, confocal analyses revealed small amounts of YAP protein in their nuclei as well. We added this information in the Results section: “YAP protein was detected in stem cells located at the tip of the CMZ, mainly in the cytoplasm, although some signal could be observed as well in the nuclei of these cells”. Whether the morphant CMZ phenotype is due to the loss of either or both YAP cytoplasmic or nuclear function thus remains an open question. We have raised this issue in the Discussion section, first paragraph.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have done an excellent job in focussing in on stem cells and on the cell cycle effects, yet it is not altogether clear whether the cell cycle timing effects are particularly or only restricted to the stem cells. Are the YAP-controlled cell cycle dynamic effects quantifiably different in the stem cells vs. the progenitors?</italic></p><p>The EdU cumulative labeling data we provide concern only 3 selected cells located in the most peripheral region, that we confidently assume to be stem cells. It would be much more complicated to delineate and only consider the <italic>Yap</italic>-expressing progenitor pool. Establishing objective limits between <italic>Yap</italic>-expressing stem and progenitor cells would require two additional stainings: one to label the whole domain where <italic>Yap</italic> is expressed and another to identify the stem cell compartment (in situ hybridization against a specific marker) . We don’t have the tools so far to perform such multiple labeling in addition to EdU and PH3 staining.</p><p>However, we did measure S-phase and total cell cycle lengths of all CMZ cells (but the 3 aforementioned stem cells). We found a 25% reduction in S-phase length (compared to 79% decrease when only stem cells are taken into account). This may reflect that <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown effects are more pronounced in stem <italic>versus</italic> progenitor cells. However, since we measured S-phase in a heterogeneous cohort composed of both <italic>Yap</italic>-expressing and <italic>Yap</italic>-negative progenitors, we cannot confidently conclude on that point. We thus prefer not to mention this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>, the</italic> yap <italic>morphant eye appears to indicate great cell packing and cell number, but the eye (at least this section) looks to be the same size as controls.

There is however some variability in retinal size both in controls and morphant embryos. We agree that the chosen sections are not representative of the expected phenotype. To better illustrate retinal size reduction, we now show another picture for the control retina that comes from the very same experiment.</p><p><italic>4) The formatting of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>is confusing.

Each panel is now labeled so there is no need to refer back each time to the table. We believe this indeed makes the figure easier to read. We also accordingly modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The authors should emphasize this is a knock-down/partial loss of function study. The use of morpholinos is particularly complicated as the per cell knock-down and dynamics of knock-down can vary tremendously. The authors should more fully acknowledge the caveats of morpholino knock-down and that the phenotypes likely relate to hypomophic</italic> yap <italic>activity, and not full loss.</italic></p><p>We now point out in the Discussion section, second paragraph, that the use of Morpholinos leads to a partial loss of function and therefore that the observed phenotypes are hypomorphic.</p><p><italic>6) Related to point 3, the authors should comment on the potential role of taz/wwtr1 in providing addition (compensatory/redundant) co-transcriptional activity to that of</italic> Yap<italic>. What is the status of Taz expression in the frog CMZ?</italic></p><p>As in other systems, TAZ might indeed compensate for at least part of YAP function. We cannot exclude that it is the case in the CMZ. However, in contrast to <italic>Yap</italic>, <italic>Taz</italic> seems faintly expressed in the postembryonic retina as inferred from a very weak and diffuse in situ hybridization signal. This is now added in the Result section, first paragraph, and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>.</p><p><italic>7) Last, although</italic> Tead1 <italic>was used as a positive control for</italic> yap <italic>interaction, the function of the most-common</italic> yap <italic>nuclear interactant was not addressed. Is this in competition for</italic> pknox1 <italic>binding, functioning in a tripartite complex, or simply not expressed in the CMZ? At minimum, given the canonical nature of</italic> yap<italic>/taz-tead activity, this should be commented upon.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that some information should be provided about TEAD/YAP potential interaction within the CMZ. We thus have added an in situ hybridization showing that <italic>Tead1</italic> and <italic>Tead2</italic> are both expressed in retinal stem cells of the CMZ, and as such are potential partners of YAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>, and subsection “Yap is expressed in slow dividing stem cells of the post-embryonic retina”).</p><p>We also added an experiment showing that, in contrast to wild type YAP, a truncated construct of YAP lacking the TEAD binding site (<italic>Yap</italic> <sup><italic>TBS</italic></sup> ) is unable to trigger enhanced proliferation in the CMZ, as a wild-type YAP construct does. This suggests that the overproliferative phenotype in the retina requires interaction with a TEAD protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>, and subsection “Yap overexpression promotes post-embryonic eye overgrowth”).</p><p>Whether TEAD and PKOX1 function in competition for YAP binding or in a tripartite complex is certainly an important issue to be addressed in the future. We now comment upon this in the Discussion section, last paragraph.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>We noticed that we omitted to mention the plasmids used for in situ hybridization in the Methods section in the previous version of the manuscript. We now added this information in the subsection “In situ Hybridization”.</p><p>We added in the Discussion section (fourth paragraph) a novel reference supporting that neural stem cells have a longer S -phase than progenitors committed to neuron production: Turrero García, M., Chang, Y., Arai, Y., and Huttner, W.B. (2015). S-phase duration is the main target of cell cycle regulation in neural progenitors of developing ferret neocortex. J. Comp. Neurol. [Epub ahead of print].</p></body></sub-article></article>
