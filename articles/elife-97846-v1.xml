We investigated if expressing designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) in the mid-cervical spinal cord could effectively stimulate phrenic motor output to increase diaphragm activation. Two primary questions were addressed: (1) does effective DREADD-mediated diaphragm activation require focal expression in phrenic motoneurons (vs. non-specific mid-cervical expression), and (2) can this method produce a sustained increase in inspiratory tidal volume? Wild-type (C57Bl/6) and ChAT-Cre mice received bilateral intraspinal (C4) injections of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding the hM3D(Gq) excitatory DREADD. In wild-type mice, this produced non-specific DREADD expression throughout the mid-cervical ventral horn. In ChAT-Cre mice, a Cre-dependent viral construct was used to drive neuronal DREADD expression in the C4 ventral horns, targeting phrenic motoneurons. Diaphragm electromyograms (EMG) were recorded in isoflurane-anesthetized spontaneously breathing mice at 4–9 weeks post-AAV delivery. The DREADD ligand JHU37160 (J60) caused a bilateral, sustained (&gt;1 hr) increase in inspiratory EMG bursting in both groups; the relative increase was greater in ChAT-Cre mice. Additional experiments in ChAT-Cre rats were conducted to determine if spinal DREADD activation could increase inspiratory tidal volume during spontaneous breathing, assessed using whole-body plethysmography without anesthesia. Three to four months after intraspinal (C4) injection of AAV driving Cre-dependent hM3D(Gq) expression, intravenous J60 resulted in a sustained (&gt;30 min) increase in tidal volume. Subsequently, phrenic nerve recordings performed under urethane anesthesia confirmed that J60 evoked a &gt;200% increase in inspiratory output. We conclude that targeting mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression to the phrenic motoneuron pool enables ligand-induced, sustained increases in phrenic motor output and tidal volume. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>respiratory neural control</kwd><kwd>chemogenetics</kwd><kwd>DREADD</kwd><kwd>phrenic</kwd><kwd>diaphragm EMG</kwd><kwd>plethysmography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HD052682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007698</institution-id><institution>Graduate School Funding Award from the University of Florida</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Benevides</surname><given-names>Ethan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>DREADD-mediated activation of phrenic motor output produces sustained increases in diaphragm activity and tidal volume, highlighting a potential strategy to restore breathing in clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many respiratory disorders are associated with reduced or impaired activation of respiratory motoneurons. Neurologic injuries (e.g., traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke) and neurodegenerative conditions (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Pompe disease) will often result in decreased respiratory motor output, including impaired activation of the phrenic motoneurons which innervate the diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berlowitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Perrin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mehta, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burakgazi and Höke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuller et al., 2013</xref>). Another prominent example is obstructive sleep apnea, in which pharyngeal motoneurons have reduced output during sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jordan and White, 2008</xref>). Treatment options that increase respiratory motoneuron activation to improve breathing are limited. However, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) may have use in this regard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 2021</xref>). Structurally derived from naturally occurring G-protein-coupled receptors, DREADDs have been engineered to respond exclusively to exogenous ligands that are otherwise biologically inert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu and Roth, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armbruster et al., 2007</xref>). This provides a means to selectively stimulate cells expressing the DREADD. Prior studies have used DREADDs to stimulate upper airway muscle activation during breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 2021</xref>). For example, following expression of DREADDs in murine hypoglossal motoneurons, tongue electromyogram (EMG) activity can be increased using DREADD ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleury Curado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleury Curado et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleury Curado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horton et al., 2017</xref>). This response is functionally beneficial as shown by increased patency of the upper airway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleury Curado et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The present study focused on chemogenetic activation of the phrenic neuromuscular system. Phrenic motoneurons provide motor innervation of the diaphragm muscle and are located in the mid-cervical (C3–C5) spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuller et al., 2022</xref>). We tested the hypothesis that expressing DREADDs in the mid-cervical spinal cord would enable systemic (intravenous [IV] or intraperitoneal) delivery of a selective DREADD ligand to produce sustained increases in the respiratory-related activation of the diaphragm. In doing so, we addressed two important questions. First, we determined if effective diaphragm activation requires focal DREADD expression targeting phrenic motoneurons only, or if non-specific expression in mid-cervical interneurons and phrenic motoneurons would be sufficient. This question derives from prior studies of cervical spinal cord stimulation. A compelling body of work, with studies in multiple species, demonstrates that non-specific activation of cervical spinal networks can be highly effective at increasing diaphragm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiMarco and Kowalski, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alilain et al., 2008</xref>). One theory to explain this result is that a general increase in the excitability of cervical propriospinal networks leads to increased phrenic motoneuron activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Satkunendrarajah et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane, 2011</xref>). There is also evidence that phrenic motoneurons can integrate multiple synaptic inputs in a manner that produces orderly recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiMarco and Kowalski, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, DREADD-induced activation of mid-cervical neurons or networks may be sufficient for ligand-induced diaphragm activation. On the other hand, DREADD expression may need to be restricted to phrenic motoneurons if the goal is to produce inspiratory-related diaphragm activation. To address this question, we studied diaphragm responses in two mouse models: (1) a wild-type model in which DREADDs were non-specifically expressed in the C3–C5 spinal cord, encompassing interneurons populations and motoneurons, and (2) a choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-Cre model in which DREADD expression was restricted to ChAT-positive neurons in the ventral C3–C5 spinal cord, targeting the phrenic motoneuron pool.</p><p>The second question we addressed was if phrenic motoneuron activation via cervical spinal cord DREADDs could produce sustained increases in inspiratory tidal volume in unanesthetized, spontaneously breathing animals. While previous results from the hypoglossal motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleury Curado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleury Curado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horton et al., 2017</xref>) provide a proof-of-concept that DREADDs can stimulate respiratory motoneuron activity, whether a sustained increase in tidal volume could be evoked by expressing DREADDs in phrenic motoneuron was uncertain. For example, during spontaneous breathing, a DREADD-induced increase in phrenic motoneuron excitability, and thus diaphragm activation, could be rapidly offset by decreases in bulbospinal neural drive to the phrenic motor pool, secondary to reduced arterial CO<sub>2</sub> or increased vagal-mediated inhibition. An increase in diaphragm activation could also trigger a decrease in accessory respiratory muscle activation, thereby attenuating or preventing increases in tidal volume. Lastly, data from the hypoglossal motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleury Curado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleury Curado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horton et al., 2017</xref>), as well as our initial results in the anesthetized mouse indicated that both phasic (i.e., during the inspiratory period) and tonic (i.e., occurring across the respiratory cycle) activation of the diaphragm would increase after DREADD activation, and how this would impact tidal volume was not clear. Accordingly, we studied ChAT-Cre rats using whole-body plethysmography and a direct measure of phrenic motor output via nerve recordings. The plethysmography studies allowed us to determine if DREADD activation of phrenic motoneurons causes a sustained increase in tidal volume and ventilation during spontaneous breathing in the unanesthetized rat. Phrenic nerve recordings were performed under urethane anesthesia and enabled direct quantification of DREADD activation on the neural drive of the diaphragm while controlling variables including arterial CO<sub>2</sub> and lung volume.</p><p>Collectively, the results of this work demonstrate that mid-cervical spinal DREADD expression enables the selective DREADD ligand, J60, to produce sustained increases in the neural drive to the diaphragm, resulting in increased tidal volume during spontaneous breathing. Further development of this technology may enable application to clinical conditions associated with impaired diaphragm activation and hypoventilation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diaphragm EMG responses in wild-type mice</title><p>Wild-type mice underwent bilateral injections of AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry into the ventral horns at spinal segment C4.

This response was also verified using direct recordings of phrenic nerve discharge. Additionally, the DREADD ligand was able to produce an increase in inspiratory tidal volume in awake, freely behaving animals. These proof-of-concept studies provide a foundation for further development of this technology toward clinical application for restoring diaphragm activation in conditions such as cervical spinal cord injury.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Targeted gene delivery to the phrenic motor pool</title><p>The intraspinal AAV delivery used here was based on previous studies demonstrating successful gene delivery to phrenic motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alilain et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>).

Spinal-delivered viral vectors have also been used to successfully drive local expression of channelrhodopsin-2 to enable light activation of diaphragm output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alilain et al., 2008</xref>), and to drive expression of the astrocyte glutamate transporter GLT1 in the area of the phrenic motor nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Other methods that have been employed to drive gene expression in phrenic motoneurons include intrapleural- and intramuscular diaphragm injection of viral vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thakre et al., 2023</xref>). Intrapleural delivery requires microinjection to the ‘pleural space’ between the visceral pleura that lines the lungs and the parietal pleura that covers the thoracic cavity. This technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantilla et al., 2009</xref>) effectively targets phrenic motoneurons in rodent models of cervical spinal cord injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gransee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martínez-Gálvez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gransee et al., 2017</xref>) and Pompe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keeler et al., 2020</xref>). Intramuscular diaphragm injection allows the vector to enter phrenic nerve terminals and reach phrenic motoneuron soma via retrograde movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thakre et al., 2023</xref>). Direct diaphragm injection allows for a relatively high target specificity, with the gene of interest expressed almost exclusively in phrenic motoneurons (although expression can also occur in diaphragm myofibers, depending on the promoter sequence used). In pilot experiments, we tested intrapleural and intramuscular diaphragm injections using AAV9 vectors encoding GFP (AAV9-CAG-GFP) or DREADD (AAV9-hSyn-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry and AAV9-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry). We did not, however, observe histological or physiological evidence of phrenic motoneuron transduction with these AAV9 vectors. Direct intraspinal injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>) was therefore used to introduce the hM3D(Gq) into the phrenic motor nucleus. While this enabled proof-of-concept for targeting DREADDs to the cervical spinal cord and phrenic motoneurons, the intrapleural or diaphragmatic injection delivery routes might ultimately prove better for selective phrenic motoneuron targeting.

Two of these studies used pharmacologically selective actuator module, a type of ionotropic chemogenetic receptor, to activate lumbar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ouali Alami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxena et al., 2013</xref>) motoneurons, in mouse models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the remaining studies, excitatory DREADDs were applied to spinal motoneurons to improve axon regeneration following peripheral nerve injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jaiswal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jaiswal and English, 2017</xref>). A small but growing body of work has employed DREADDs to activate hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doyle et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these studies show that once hM3D(Gq) is expressed in XII motoneurons, DREADD ligands will rapidly produce an increase in the EMG activation of tongue muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleury Curado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Singer et al., 2022</xref>). This increase in tongue muscle output tends to manifest as an increase in the inspiratory-related activation and tonic discharge across the respiratory cycle. Since increased tongue muscle activation can promote patency of the upper airway, XII motoneuron DREADD expression has been suggested as a possible treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleury Curado et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fleury Curado et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horton et al., 2017</xref>). For the present study, the primary innovation is the first application of DREADD technology to phrenic motoneurons. This approach was highly effective at driving sustained activation of the diaphragm muscle. The underlying mechanisms are discussed next.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Chemogenetic stimulation of breathing</title><p>An important consideration is how DREADD-induced increases in the excitability of spinal neurons, including phrenic motoneurons, interacts with the endogenous neural control of breathing. Phrenic motoneurons receive a rhythmic, monosynaptic, glutamatergic synaptic input from medullary neurons. Acting via NMDA and AMPA receptors, this produces phrenic motoneuron depolarization and subsequent diaphragm muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuller et al., 2022</xref>). Activating DREADDs on phrenic motoneurons should lower the threshold for activation via excitatory glutamatergic synaptic inputs, which would produce a greater output during the inspiratory phase. Alternatively, DREADD activation could directly lead to phrenic motoneuron action potentials even in the absence of synaptic input from the brainstem. This latter possibility could explain the tonic discharge (i.e., EMG output across the entire respiratory cycle) that was noted to occur after delivery of the DREADD ligand. Non-specific spinal cord DREADD expression, as occurred in the wild-type mice (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a, ai</xref>), would likely produce an increase in the excitability and/or activation of phrenic motoneurons as well as propriospinal neurons in the immediate vicinity. Neurophysiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Streeter et al., 2020</xref>), as well as anatomical data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lane, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lane et al., 2008</xref>), confirm synaptic connections between mid-cervical interneurons and phrenic motoneurons, making it possible that DREADD activation of these interneurons impacted the diaphragm motor response in the wild-type mice.</p><p>The control of breathing is also impacted by well-established ‘closed loop’ physiologic feedback mechanisms regulating lung volume and arterial blood gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Molkov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dempsey and Welch, 2023</xref>). For example, if DREADD-induced activation of the diaphragm leads to increased alveolar ventilation, and metabolic rate is not impacted, then arterial CO<sub>2</sub> values will decrease and the overall neural drive to breathe will also decrease. Vagal afferent feedback corresponding to increased lung volume also has a powerful inhibitory impact on inspiration and therefore diaphragm activation. However, the sustained increase in diaphragm EMG and tidal volume that we observed following application of the DREADD ligand indicates that these mechanisms, if activated, were not sufficient to fully inhibit the increased phrenic motoneuron output. In this regard, our additional experiments in which direct recordings of bilateral phrenic nerve discharge are informative. These nerve recording experiments were done to enable direct evaluation of the impact of spinal DREADD activation on phrenic motor output while keeping arterial blood gases and lung volume constant. Under these more rigorously controlled conditions, IV delivery of the DREADD ligand produced a rapid and sustained increase in inspiratory burst amplitude in the phrenic nerve, and with no impact on the rate of the inspiratory bursts. The relative increase in inspiratory motor output was considerably greater in the phrenic nerve recording experiments (~250% of baseline) as compared to the diaphragm EMG response in spontaneously breathing animals (~100% of baseline). This may indicate that vagal and/or blood gas-related inhibitory mechanisms, as mentioned above, somewhat constrained the response to the DREADD ligand in the spontaneously breathing animal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Critique of methods</title><p>There are a few caveats that should be discussed. First, the precision of the AAV delivery could be improved by further refining spinal injection surgical techniques. In the current study, we used a stereotaxic frame and previously validated coordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McGuire et al., 2005</xref>) to guide the intraspinal AAV injections. However, we observed variability in the laterality (i.e., left vs. right side of the spinal cord) of mid-cervical mCherry expression as well as the physiological response to the DREADD ligand, particularly in the ChAT-Cre mice (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This could have occurred due to subtle variations of the positioning of the animal within the stereotaxic frame, and/or placement of the needle tip, leading to slight deviations for the desired coordinates between the left and right phrenic nuclei. Second, we did not unequivocally verify that the DREADD was expressed in phrenic motoneurons using retrograde labeling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mantilla et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rana et al., 2022</xref>). However, the phrenic motor nucleus has been well described in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiu et al., 2010</xref>) and the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rana et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rana et al., 2019</xref>), and the fluorophore (mCherry) expression observed in our experiments is very clearly in the expected location of phrenic motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b–ci</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, the robust increase in phrenic motor output after the DREADD ligand, particularly in the ChAT-Cre rat experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) is further evidence of effective phrenic motoneuron targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data support the conclusion that cervical spinal cord directed chemogenetic receptors can be used to produce sustained increases in phrenic motor output, diaphragm activation, and inspiratory tidal volume. Collectively, the data indicate that DREADDs should be directed exclusively to phrenic motoneurons versus non-specific expression in the immediate vicinity. In this regard, improvement of the AAV delivery methods will increase the selectivity of the approach for more precise targeting of phrenic motoneurons. Concerning the ‘translational value’ of this work, spinal cord chemogenetics may have application to clinical conditions associated with an inability to activate the diaphragm. For example, incomplete cervical spinal cord injury is a condition in which the bulbospinal synaptic inputs to phrenic motoneurons are interrupted. After incomplete cervical spinal cord injury, focal expression of an excitatory DREADD in phrenic motoneurons could be used to increase the excitability of these cells, thereby improving the efficacy of spared bulbospinal synaptic inputs which convey ‘inspiratory drive’.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV-hSyn-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_50474">Addgene_50474</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV transgene plasmid</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_44361">Addgene_44361</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV transgene plasmid</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JHU37160</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HelloBio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HB6261</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DREADD agonist</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version R2019a<break/>(9.6.1072779)<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SigmaPlot</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Systat Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 14<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_003210">SCR_003210</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The R Foundation for Statistical Computing</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Version 4.3.1 – ‘Beagle Scouts’<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were carried out using C57Bl/6, wild-type mice (Taconic), ChAT-Cre mice (B6.129S6-Chattm2(cre)Lowl/J; Jackson Laboratories), and ChAT-Cre rats (LE-Tg(Chat-Cre)5.1Deis; Rat Resource &amp; Research Center).

Mice were 6–10 weeks old (wild-type cohort: 7–9 weeks; ChAT-Cre cohort: 6–10 weeks) at the time of injection while ChAT-Cre rats were 2–5 months old. Surgery was performed under aseptic conditions. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (induction: 3–4% isoflurane; maintenance: 2–3% isoflurane in 100% O<sub>2</sub>) while rats were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) delivered intraperitoneally. Animals were placed prone on a circulating water heating pad to maintain body temperature. A longitudinal incision was made starting at the base of the skull and extending caudally. The underlying back musculature was opened from the base of the skull to spinal segment C6. Using a micro-curette, the muscle and connective tissue overlying laminae C3–C5 were removed. A laminectomy of the C4 dorsal lamina exposed the dura mater below. A bilateral durotomy was then performed exposing the spinal cord.

To prevent movements and EMG contamination of the phrenic neurogram pancuronium bromide was administered (3 mg/kg IV, Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis) to achieve neuromuscular blockade. A catheter (polyethylene tubing; PE 50; Intramedic) was placed in the femoral artery to enable monitoring of arterial blood pressure via a transducer amplifier (TA-100, CWE) and allow withdrawal of arterial blood samples (65 μl) for measurement of partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and O<sub>2</sub> (PaO<sub>2</sub>), pH, and base excess (ABL 90 Flex, Radiometer; Copenhagen, Denmark).</p><p>The phrenic nerves were exposed bilaterally using a dorsal approach as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thakre and Fuller, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thakre et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, a midline incision was made at the base of the skull extending to spinal level T2. The muscles connecting the shoulder blades to the spinal column were separated to expose the phrenic nerves. The phrenic nerves were isolated, cut distal to the spinal cord, and suctioned into custom-made glass electrodes filled with 0.9% saline solution. Phrenic nerve activity was amplified (×10 kHz) using a differential AC amplifier (Model 1700, A-M systems, Everett, WA), band-pass filtered (100 Hz to 3 kHz), and digitized at 25 ks/s (Power 1401, CED).</p><p>At the beginning of the experiment, the apneic threshold was determined by slowly reducing the inspired CO<sub>2</sub> until phrenic nerve inspiratory activity ceased for 60 s.

Baseline blood gas values served as references to assess if further arterial samples were isocapnic. To keep end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> and PaCO<sub>2</sub> near baseline (within ±2.0 mmHg), minor adjustments to inspired CO<sub>2</sub> and ventilation rate were made as needed.

If the increase in phrenic nerve amplitude in response to the ‘maximal’ challenge was lower than the response observed during either hypoxic episode, it was considered a sign of deteriorating nerve–electrode contact, and the preparation was excluded from all formal analyses.

Cervical and thoracic spinal cords were blocked in optimal cutting temperature media and cryosectioned at 20 µm. The viral constructs included a red fluorescent protein (mCherry) fused to the hM3D(Gq) DREADD which allowed evaluation of DREADD expression by assessing mCherry expression via fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>We performed a qualitative assessment of mCherry expression in the mid-cervical spinal cord. One intact section from the middle of each spinal segment (C3–C6) was chosen as a representative section and underwent assessment. Sections were segmented into the following quadrants: left dorsal, right dorsal, left ventral, and right ventral. The quadrant was scored as ‘positive’ if mCherry-positive neurons or fibers were observed; otherwise, the sub-segment was marked ‘negative’ (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> for example). The entirety of the gray matter from each section was analyzed for all animals, whether wild-type or ChAT-Cre. Although ChAT-Cre expression was expected to be limited primarily to motoneurons, which are the predominant ChAT-positive neuronal subtype in the spinal cord, there is also evidence of ChAT-positive interneuron populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gotts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alkaslasi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mesnage et al., 2011</xref>) which we also wished to capture in our analysis. Results were compiled into a summary table showing the total positive counts by animal cohort, spinal segment, and quadrant (see Results section; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Animals that showed no positive mCherry labeling in the C3–C6 cord were excluded from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data analysis and statistics</title><p>Custom MATLAB (MathWorks; Natick, MA) scripts were created, and are available upon request. These scripts were used to analyze diaphragm EMG, phrenic nerve, and plethysmography waveforms. EMG signals were digitally filtered using a second-order, bandpass Butterworth filter (100–1000 Hz) and then rectified and integrated by taking the absolute value of the signal followed by applying a moving median filter (50 ms time constant for mice; 75 ms time constant for rats) and moving average filter (50 ms time constant for mice; 175 ms time constant for rats). The script identified each EMG burst and calculated peak amplitude, minimum amplitude (tonic activity), and AUC for each burst which was then averaged across animals and compared across experimental conditions.</p><p>Phrenic nerve signals were digitally filtered using a second-order, bandpass Butterworth filter (100–3 kHz) and then rectified and integrated by taking the absolute value of the signal followed by applying a moving median filter (50 ms time constant) and moving average filter (50 ms time constant). The analysis script calculated the peak phrenic burst amplitude and minimum amplitude for each burst which was then averaged across animals and compared across experimental conditions. Systolic (SP), diastolic (DP), and mean arterial blood pressure (MAP; formula: MAP = DP + 1/3 (SP − DP)) along with instantaneous heart rate were calculated from the arterial pressure trace.</p><p>In plethysmography experiments, airflow pressure, chamber temperature, chamber humidity, barometric pressure, and animal body temperature were used to calculate respiratory frequency, tidal volume, and ventilation via a custom MATLAB script. Tidal volume was calculated using the Drorbaugh and Fenn equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drorbaug and Fenn, 1955</xref>).</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software) and R (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing; version 4.3.1). In mouse diaphragm EMG studies, one-way repeated measure ANOVA was used to statistically compare diaphragm EMG peak amplitude, AUC, tonic activity, and heart rate across time before and after J60 application. Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare left and right hemidiaphragm EMG peak amplitude, AUC, tonic activity, and heart rate between ChAT-Cre and wild-type mice at the 30-min post-J60 administration time point. Differences in mortality between wild-type and ChAT-Cre mice post-J60 application were assessed using Pearson’s Chi-squared test with Yates’ continuity correction using the chisq.test function in R. In instances where animals did not survive the entire duration of the anesthetized recording, data up until the time point preceding their death was included.</p><p>In control EMG experiments, one-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare EMG peak responses across baseline, sham injection, and J60 administration. These data were also assessed normalized to baseline, in which case EMG peak responses after sham injection and J60 application were compared using paired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><p>In plethysmography experiments, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare raw and normalized tidal volume, respiratory frequency, and minute ventilation across time and treatment (saline vs. J60). Paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare responses to hypercapnic–hypoxic ventilatory challenges across treatments. One-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare phrenic peak amplitude, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, mean arterial blood pressure, and respiratory rate across time for phrenic nerve recordings. The relationship between time post-AAV injection and average phrenic response to J60 was assessed for ChAT-Cre rats using the cor.test function in R to run a Pearson’s product moment correlation. Both male and female animals were included in this study to improve the generalizability of the results. However, we were not adequately powered for sex comparisons and therefore did not perform any statistical analysis to assess sex differences.</p><p>In cases of significant main effects, the Tukey post hoc test was used to assess differences between individual time points. For instances where data failed to meet general linear model assumptions (i.e., normality, homogeneity of variances), nonparametric equivalents of the previously mentioned statistical tests were used. Data were considered statistically significant when p ≤ 0.05. The mean data are presented along with the standard error of the mean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures described in this manuscript involving rats, mice, and tissue were approved by the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #202107438) and in strict accordance with the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Statistical summary for the impact of DREADD activation on diaphragm EMG in wild-type mice.</title><p>Time points are in reference to minutes passed since J60 infusion.

Strengths to this study include a comparison of non-specific DREADD expression in the mid-cervical spinal cord versus specific targeting to ChAT-positive neurons, and the measurement of multiple respiratory-related outcomes, including phrenic inspiratory output, diaphragm EMG activity and ventilation.

We did not originally assess the effects of time post-injection on DREADD response. Generally, AAV transgene expression has been demonstrated to be long-term and stable in the CNS of mice.[1] However, there is some variation in the reporting time of peak transgene expression[2], and this may potentially impact our results.</p><p>In investigating this issue further, we discovered an error in our reporting as we did have n = 1 wild-type mouse that underwent EMG recordings 62 days (~9 weeks) post-AAV injection. This has been corrected in the manuscript (lines 87-88).</p><p>Addressing this question is challenging due to the uneven distribution of time points within the 4–9-week windows for each group. Essentially, there were two groups per cohort, one studied at 4-5 weeks and one at 8-9 weeks. More specifically:</p><p>- Wild-type cohort: n = 10 animals were studied 28–33 days post-injection, and n = 1 at 62 days.</p><p>- ChAT-Cre cohort: n = 4 animals were studied 28–30 days post-injection, and n = 5 at 56–59 days.</p><p>We performed Pearson correlation analyses between time post-injection and diaphragm EMG response to DREADD activation (peak amplitude and area under the curve, AUC) for both cohorts (Author response image 1):</p><p>- ChAT-Cre: No significant correlations were found (peak amplitude: r<sup>2</sup> = -0.117, r = -0.1492, p = 0.702, Figure 1a-b; AUC:r<sup>2</sup> = -0.0883, r = 0.2184, p = 0.572, Figure 1c-d).</p><p>- Wild type: Initial analysis of all data showed significant correlations (peak amplitude:r<sup>2</sup> = 0.362, r = 0.6523, p = 0.0296, Figure 1a; AUC: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.347, r = 0.6424, p = 0.033, Figure 1c), suggesting a moderate positive correlation between time post-injection and EMG response. However, when the single 8–9-week wild-type mouse was excluded, these correlations were no longer significant (peak amplitude: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.172, r = 0.5142, p = 0.128, Figure 1b; AUC: r<sup>2</sup> = 0.23, r = 0.5614, p = 0.0913, Figure1d).</p><p>Comparing wild-type and ChAT-Cre groups directly was unreliable due to the single wild-type mouse studied at the later time point. We attempted to model time post-injection as a continuous variable (i.e., exact days post-injection) using a restricted maximum likelihood mixed linear model in JMP; however, the analysis could not be performed because there were not sufficient overlapping time points between the two cohorts (i.e., not all days post-injection were represented in both groups). To mitigate this, we binned animals into two groups: 4–5 weeks and 8–9 weeks post-injection. This analysis returned a significant interaction between cohort and time post-injection (p = 0.0391), however there were no significant multiple comparisons upon Tukey post hoc test (i.e., p &gt; 0.05).</p><p>Based on these findings, we feel confident that time post-injection is unlikely to have a significant impact on diaphragm EMG response to DREADD activation in the ChAT-Cre cohort. However, in the wild-type cohort, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions, as only one animal was studied at the 8–9-week time point. For similar reasons, it remains unclear whether the relationship between time post-AAV transduction and DREADD response differs between cohorts. Given the inconclusive nature of these results, we have elected not to include this analysis in the manuscript. Nevertheless, to ensure transparency, we have provided Author response image 1 below of peak amplitude and AUC plotted against time, allowing readers to evaluate the data independently.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Plots of diaphragm EMG peak amplitude, (a-b) and area under the curve (c-d) vs. days post-AAV injection for wild-type (blue) and ChAT-Cre (orange) mice.</title><p>Pearson correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationship between time post-AAV injection and diaphragm EMG DREADD response in wild-type and ChAT-Cre mouse cohorts. r<sup>2</sup>, r, and p-values are shown in each panel for both cohorts.

This includes a sample of mice (n = 2) and rats (n = 3), recorded from using the same diaphragm EMG procedure described in the manuscript.

Whole body plethysmography protocol. Three hypercapnic hypoxic challenges are a lot for a rat within a 3-hour recording session in freely behaving rats. Did the authors verify with control/ vehicle experiments that repeated challenges in the absence of J60 do not cause potentiation of the response? I understand that it is not possible to invert the order of the injections (due to likely long-term effects of J60) or it is too late to perform vehicle and J60 injections on different days, but controls for repeated challenges should be performed in this type of experiment, especially considering the great variability in the response observed in Figure 4 (in normoxic conditions).</p></disp-quote><p>We did not conduct control experiments to assess the impact of repeated hypercapnic hypoxic challenges on the naïve response (i.e., in the absence of J60). However, our experimental protocol was designed such that each experimental period (i.e., post-vehicle or post-J60 infusion) was normalized to baseline recordings taken immediately prior to the vehicle or J60 infusion. While repeated exposure to hypercapnic hypoxic challenges may have altered respiratory output, we are confident that normalizing each experimental period to its respective baseline effectively captures the impact of DREADD activation on ventilation, independent of any potential potentiation that may have occurred due to gas challenge exposure. We have included raw values for all plethysmography outcomes (see Figure 4, panels a-c) to ensure full data transparency. Still, we believe that the baseline-normalized values more accurately reflect the impact of DREADD activation on the components of ventilation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, why the response to the hypercapnic hypoxic challenges are not reported?

This limits the interpretation of the results. If the authors used Chat-cre rats, the virus should only be in Chat+ MN. Knowing how selective the virus is, and whether its expression was selective for Phrenic MN versus other MN pools, could address several technical questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that detailed quantification of expression by motoneuron pool would be of value in future work. However, for these initial proof-of-concept experiments, we performed the quadrant-based qualitative analysis of mCherry expression to provide a simple comparison of mCherry expression between groups (i.e., ChAT-Cre vs. wildtype mice). This analysis allowed us to: (1) show the reader that each animal included in the study showed evidence of mCherry expression and (2) give the reader an idea of patterns of mCherry expression throughout the mid-cervical spinal cord. Additionally, it is important to note that while ChAT is a marker of motoneurons some populations of interneurons also express ChAT(2-4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the increased values of Dia EMG AUC and no changes in respiratory rate, did the authors determine if there was a change in the inspiratory time with J60 administration?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not assess inspiratory time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>High death rate in DREADD WT mice - was histological analysis performed on these mice?

While the reviewer's speculations are reasonable, we feel these reasons are unlikely to explain the death rate in DREADD WT mice as ChAT-Cre mice received the same volume injected into their spine and lived up until and during diaphragm EMG recordings. Additionally, WT mice lived for 4-5 weeks post-injection which would be past the acute phase that a large immune response to the viral dose would have occurred.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 299-304.

One animal showed a 12% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure following J60 administration while the other showed a 35% decrease.

While the mean data in Figures 1F and 2F do indicate that, on average, animals had tonic diaphragm EMG responses to DREADD activation, the examples given in Figures 1A and 2A show minimal responses. This makes it difficult to fully appreciate the tonic response from those particular traces. However, clear tonic activity can be appreciated from Figures 5A and S2. In these figures, tonic activity is evident from the integrated EMG signals, presenting as a sustained increase in baseline activity between bursts—essentially an upward shift from the zero point.</p><p>References</p><p>(1) Van Savage, J. &amp; Avegno, E.
