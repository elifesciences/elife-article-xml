Discoordination leads to aspiration pneumonia, the leading cause of death in neurodegenerative disease. Here, we study the role of the postinspiratory complex (PiCo) in coordinating breathing and swallowing. Using optogenetic approaches in freely breathing anesthetized ChATcre:Ai32, Vglut2cre:Ai32 and intersectional recombination of ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mice reveals PiCo mediates airway protective behaviors. Activation of PiCo during inspiration or the beginning of postinspiration triggers swallow behavior in an all-or-nothing manner, while there is a higher probability for stimulating only laryngeal activation when activated further into expiration. Laryngeal activation is dependent on stimulation duration. Sufficient bilateral PiCo activation is necessary for preserving the physiological swallow motor sequence since activation of only a few PiCo neurons or unilateral activation leads to blurred upper airway behavioral responses. We believe PiCo acts as an interface between the swallow pattern generator and the preBötzinger complex to coordinate swallow and breathing. Investigating PiCo’s role in swallow and laryngeal coordination will aid in understanding discoordination with breathing in neurological diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>control of breathing</kwd><kwd>swallow function</kwd><kwd>neurocircuitry</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL090554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Jan-Marino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL144801</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Jan-Marino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL151389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Jan-Marino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL160102-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huff</surname><given-names>Alyssa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL126523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez</surname><given-names>Jan-Marino</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The postinspiratory complex acts as an interface between the swallow pattern generator and the preBötzinger complex to coordinate swallow and breathing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery of the preBötzinger complex (preBötC) more than 30 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 1991</xref>) triggered a wave of mechanistic studies aimed at understanding the neuronal determinants that drive inhalation. By contrast, the mechanistic understanding of exhalation lacks far behind. Indeed, often called ‘passive’ expiration, this term suggests that expiration is primarily driven by mechanical recoil forces of the lung and may occur without neuronal control. Far from the truth, expiration is complex involving the neuronal control of multiple muscles, and the exquisite coordinated valving of laryngeal and pharyngeal control with other behaviors such as vocalization, coughing, or swallowing.</p><p>Exhalation is traditionally subdivided into different phases – exhalation begins with postinspiration or E1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bautista and Dutschmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutschmann and Dick, 2012</xref>), followed by late expiration or the E2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richter and Smith, 2014</xref>). But there is also ‘active expiration’ which is associated with the conditional activation of intercostal and abdominal muscles that are recruited during high metabolic demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdala et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molkov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pisanski and Pagliardini, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Postinspiratory complex (PiCo) has been defined by a population of interneurons, located within the intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt) that uniquely co-expresses both glutamate and acetylcholine. PiCo is both sufficient and necessary for generating the postinspiratory phase of breathing. Indeed, it was hypothesized that this complex may be involved in various postinspiratory behaviors such as swallowing and vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed as work in the rat has shown this region serves as a relay within the IRt that integrates postinspiratory motor outputs and other non-respiratory central pattern generators (CPGs) such as swallowing, crying, lapping, and whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toor et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dempsey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hartmann and Brecht, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hülsmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moore et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moore et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pitts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). These experiments performed independently by various groups in different animal models suggest that PiCo may serve as a hub, mediating various laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors.</p><p>The swallow motor pattern involves coordinated bilateral activation of more than 26 pairs of muscles innervated by 5 cranial nerves to ensure proper food/liquid breakdown (oral phase), safe transfer of the bolus (pharyngeal and esophageal phase) to the stomach, and airway protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Matsuo and Palmer, 2008</xref>). Swallow motor pattern moves spatiotemporally in a rostral to caudal direction: starting with the oropharynx and ending with the upper and lower esophageal sphincters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doty and Bosma, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitts and Iceman, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thexton et al., 2007</xref>). While this study focuses primarily on the pharyngeal phase of swallow, we record swallow behavior from muscles of the oropharynx deemed ‘submental complex’ including mylohyoid, geniohyoid, and digastric muscles innervated by the trigeminal, hypoglossal, and facial nerves, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erik Van Lunteren, 1988</xref>). These muscles move the hyoid bone and the larynx superior and anterior, under the tongue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitts and Iceman, 2023</xref>). Muscles of the laryngopharynx include thyrohyoid, posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA), thyroarytenoid, and thyropharyngeus, innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), a branch of the vagus nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erik Van Lunteren, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nasri et al., 1997</xref>). When the larynx is elevated, the upper esophageal sphincter opens while the ‘laryngeal complex’ (PCA; lateral, transverse, and oblique arytenoid, cricothyroid, and thyroarytenoid muscles) closes off the airway by adduction of the thyroarytenoid muscle, and the bolus passes through the pharynx to the esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pitts and Iceman, 2023</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to further explore the role of PiCo in the coordination of breathing, swallowing, and laryngeal activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartlett, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartlett Jr, D, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dutschmann and Dick, 2012</xref>). Using optogenetic techniques, we performed phase-specific activation of cholinergic and glutamatergic PiCo neurons in ChATcre:Ai32 and Vglut2cre:Ai32 mice, respectively. We also developed an intersectional approach to stimulate ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 neurons in order to specifically activate only glutamatergic neurons that co-express ChAT in PiCo region in a spontaneously breathing anesthetized in vivo preparation. All three optogenetic approaches independently resulted in two airway protective behaviors: swallow and laryngeal activation. We hypothesize that PiCo acts as a hub for airway protective behaviors, aiding in swallow–breathing coordination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of cholinergic/glutamatergic PiCo neurons</title><p>Here, we report for the first time a triple conditioned mouse expressing cre in ChAT cells and FlpO in Vglut2 cells enhanced by a red fluorescent protein (tdTomato, Ai65) inserted into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus (N = 4 animals).

Our study confirms aspects of Toor et al., who previously hypothesized, under fictive conditions (deafferented and paralyzed), that neurons of the IRt in the PiCo area of rats act as a hub for swallow and laryngeal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toor et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we introduced intersectional genetics to specifically stimulate interneurons in the PiCo area that co-express cholinergic and glutamatergic transmitters. This allowed us to compare the effects of these co-expressing neurons with those evoked by stimulating neurons that were only characterized by their cholinergic or glutamatergic transmitter phenotype. We find that activating glutamatergic/cholinergic interneurons within the PiCo region triggered motor patterns of both swallow and laryngeal-related nerve and muscle activation, specific to respiratory phase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Characteristics of PiCo</title><p>Swallow motor activity was evoked in an all-or-none manner, and preferentially when stimulating ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 neurons during inspiration. Swallow motor activity outlasted the triggering stimulus and either abruptly terminated ongoing inspiratory activity or if the stimulus did not terminate inspiration, swallowing occurred after the completion of inspiratory activity. Prolonged stimulation of these neurons (10 s) does not trigger sequential swallows; however, it produces one swallow at the beginning of the stimulus, while inhibiting inspiration, when the stimulus occurs during or right after inspiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). If prolonged stimulation of PiCo begins further into expiration, either laryngeal activation or no motor response will occur, similar to what is seen with the short pulse stimulations. Thus, the effects of PiCo stimulation are tightly coordinated with the respiratory rhythmogenic network. As already demonstrated by Anderson et al., PiCo is mutually connected with the inspiratory CPG, the preBötC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). Stimulating Dbx1 neurons in the area of the preBötC inhibits ongoing activity in PiCo via GABAergic mechanisms, while stimulating PiCo cholinergic neurons inhibits ongoing inspiratory activity and resets respiratory activity in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Postinspiratory airway protective behaviors</title><p>Stimulation of PiCo activates different postinspiratory airway protective mechanisms depending on the presence of inspiratory activity. A previous study suggests the presence of a dual peripheral and central mechanism involving vagal lung afferents and central respiratory activity, respectively, dependent on respiratory phase, referred to as a ‘swallow gate’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horton et al., 2018</xref>). These authors suggest that central processing between areas of the respiratory central pattern generator and the putative swallow pattern generator (SPG) is mediated by a central swallow gate to coordinate swallow and breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horton et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that PiCo functions as a gate. However, for the PiCo-mediated phase-dependent mechanism to occur, bilateral stimulation of a sufficient number of PiCo neurons is necessary since incomplete and/or asymmetric expression of channelrhodopsin in the population of glutamatergic/cholinergic PiCo neurons led to an upper airway motor activity characterized by abnormal temporal activation and coordination between the laryngeal and submental complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>PiCo-stimulated swallow activity was triggered in an all-or-none manner, similar to swallows evoked by liquid, brainstem, and superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) electrical stimulation, a concept established in the late 1800s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meltzer, 1883</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miller and Sherrington, 1915</xref>). By contrast, laryngeal activation had a graded response dependent on the duration of the optogenetic stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). As shown by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>, this laryngeal activity is critical for the generation of postinspiratory activity recorded from the vagal nerve. While PiCo activates laryngeal motor activity during postinspiratory activity, this motor activity could have different functional roles. The laryngeal activity evoked by PiCo stimulation could be a central and integral component to a laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR), an airway protective mechanism that prevents aspiration of foreign material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaneoka et al., 2018</xref>). Another possibility is a muscular response of the, previously studied, non-respiratory expiratory laryngeal motoneurons (ELM). As originally hypothesized by Anderson et al., we believe that PiCo is involved in multiple laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>) such as vocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wei et al., 2022</xref>), LAR (laryngeal activation) and coughing.</p><p>It has been hypothesized that inhibition of the IRt blocks fictive swallow but not swallow-related apnea. We want to emphasize that this apnea was generated by SLN stimulation and not by a natural swallow stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Toor et al., 2019</xref>). It is known that SLN stimulation causes endogenous release of adenosine that activates 2A receptors on GABAergic neurons, resulting in the release of GABA on inspiratory neurons and subsequent inspiratory inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abu-Shaweesh, 2007</xref>), suggesting that the SLN-evoked apnea may not be the same as a swallow-related apnea. Moreover, microinjections of isoguvacine into the Bötzinger complex attenuated the apneic response but not the ELM burst activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sun et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the Bötzinger complex, not PiCo, could be involved in modulating the swallow induced apnea.

However, PiCo-triggered swallows occur at a broader range of the respiratory cycle, while still predominantly occurring within the postinspiratory phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also find that duration and amplitude of swallow-related muscle and nerve activity were decreased during PiCo-stimulated swallows compared to water-evoked swallows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These differences are likely due to the fact that the PiCo-triggered swallows are missing the behavioral context of water-evoked swallows and do not activate the sensory component of the SPG to the same extent as the water-evoked swallows.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>‘All-or-none’ behavior</title><p>Swallow has been thought of as an ‘all-or-nothing’ response as early as 1883 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meltzer, 1883</xref>).

Swallows are thought to be a fixed action pattern, with duration of stimulation having no effect on behavior duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dick et al., 1993</xref>). Thus, it was interesting that in instances when few PiCo neurons were transfected, either unilateral or bilateral, an unknown activation of upper airway activity occurred. Motor activity no longer outlasted laser stimulation but rather was contained within, and the timing of the motor sequence was reversed in comparison to a water- or PiCo-evoked swallow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, if insufficient numbers of neurons are activated, PiCo’s influence to specifically activate swallow or laryngeal activation is blurred, resulting in the uncoordinated activation of muscles involved in both behaviors, which does not occur in an all-or-none manner. Thus, it is possible that PiCo is involved in assembling the swallow motor pattern itself and unilateral activation of PiCo could either desynchronize swallow interneurons or activate only one side of the SPG. Since we did not record bilateral swallow-related muscles and nerves, this question needs to be further examined.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title><italic>Schluckatmung</italic></title><p>Diaphragm activity has been shown to be multimodal, having different activity patterns for swallow and breathing, including concurrent inhibited respiratory-related activity and activated swallow-related activity, <italic>Schluckatmung</italic>, in physiological and fictive swallows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huff et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pitts et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pitts et al., 2018</xref>).

Here, we found that injection of water into the oral cavity of a ChATcre:Ai32 and a ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mouse did not evoke a swallow, which is likely due to the depth of anesthesia. Another limiting factor of our preparation is the need to open the tracheal window which disrupts the positive subglottic pressure generated during expiration. This leads to lengthening of expiratory duration and also causes irregular breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Henderson-Smart et al., 1982</xref>). Follow-up studies will be necessary to further investigate postinspiratory behaviors and swallow in alert animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that PiCo aids in regulating laryngeal coordination during swallow and other behaviors. The identification of PiCo as an important region in swallow–breathing coordination will be critical for a better understanding the mechanisms underlying diseases and disorders with prevalent swallow–breathing discoordination. Leigh syndrome, stroke, and Parkinson’s disease, as well as obstructive sleep apnea and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, all have high incidences of aspiration pneumonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Armstrong and Mosher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cvejic and Bardin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tanaka et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Won et al., 2021</xref>). Aspiration is the result of a discoordination of laryngeal closure during swallow that allows foreign material to enter into the airway instead of the esophagus. Further investigation into PiCo in the context of various breathing and neurological diseases can lead to potential therapeutic targets or decreasing or even eliminating aspiration-related pneumonia in high-risk populations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult (P54-131, average P75) male and female mice were bred at Seattle Children’s Research Institute (SCRI) and used for all experiments.

We restricted ChR2 expression to the PiCo region in order to transfect and photo-stimulate the region with the highest density of ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO neurons of the PiCo region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>). For AVV injection, the mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (2%). The correct plane of anesthesia was assessed by the absence of the corneal and hind-paw withdrawal reflexes. Mice received postoperative ketoprofen (7 mg/kg, subcutaneous [s.c.]) for two consecutive days. All surgical procedures were performed under aseptic conditions. The hair over the skull and neck were removed and skin disinfected. The mice were then placed prone on a stereotaxic apparatus (bite bar set at –3.5 mm for flat skull; David Kopf Instruments Tujunga, CA). A 0.5 mm diameter hole was drilled into the occipital plate on both sides caudal to the parieto-occipital suture. Viral solutions were loaded into a 1.2 mm internal diameter glass pipette broken to a 20 μm tip (external diameter). To target the PiCo region with ChR2-AAV, the pipette was inserted in the brainstem in the following coordinates: 4.8 mm below the dorsal surface of the cerebellum, 1.1 mm lateral to the midline, and 1.6 mm caudal to the lambda, and bilateral injections of 150 nL were made slowly at 50 nL/min using a glass micropipette and an automatic nanoliter injector (NanoinjectII, Drummond Scientific Co.

Adult mice were initially anesthetized with 100% O<sub>2</sub> and 1.5% Isoflurane (Aspen Veterinary Resources Ltd, Liberty, MO) for 2–3 min in an induction chamber. Once the breathing slowed, they were injected with urethane (1.5 mg/kg, i.p. Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and secured supine on a custom surgical table. Core temperature was maintained through a water heating system (PolyScience, Niles, IL) built into the surgical table. Mice were then allowed to spontaneously breathe 100% O<sub>2</sub> for the remainder of the surgery and experimental protocol. Adequate depth of anesthesia was determined via heart and breathing rate, as well as lack of toe pinch response every 15 min. A supplemental dose of 0.1 mL of urethane was given to maintain adequate anesthetic depth, when necessary. Bipolar electromyogram (EMG) electrodes were placed in the costal diaphragm to monitor respiratory rate and heart rate throughout the experiment. The trachea was exposed through a midline incision and cannulated caudal to the larynx with a curved (180°) tracheal tube (PTFE 24G, Component Supply, Sparta, TN). The hypoglossal (XII) and vagus (X) nerves were then dissected followed by cannulation of the trachea. The RLN was carefully dissected away from each side of the trachea before the cannula was tied in and sealed with super glue to ensure no damage to the RLN. The trachea and esophagus were then cut to detach the rostral end of the trachea just caudal to the cricoid cartilage, preserving the arytenoids and bilateral RLN. A tube filled with 100% O<sub>2</sub> was attached to the cannulated trachea to provide supplemental oxygen throughout the experiment. Continuing in the supine position, the occipital bone was removed, followed by continuous perfusion of the ventral medullary surface with warmed (~36°C) artificial cerebral spinal fluid (aCSF; in mM: 118 NaCl, 3 KCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 D-glucose) equilibrated with carbogen (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) by a peristaltic pump (Dynamax RP-1, Rainin Instrument Co, Emeryville, CA). As previously published (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huff et al., 2022</xref>), the XII and X nerves were isolated unilaterally, cut distally, and their activity was recorded from a fire-polished pulled borosilicate glass tip (B150-86-15, Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA) filled with aCSF connected to the monopolar suction electrode (A-M Systems, Sequim, WA) and held in a 3D micromanipulator (Narishige, Tokyo, Japan; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Multiple bipolar EMGs, using 0.002′′ and 0.003′′ coated stainless steel wires (A-M Systems, part nos. 790600 and 79100, respectively), simultaneously recorded activity from several swallow and respiratory-related muscle sites.

Diaphragm activity during PiCo-triggered swallows (<italic>Schluckatmung</italic>) was present in some animals but this was not common. Laryngeal activation was characterized as activity of the XII, X, and laryngeal complex from onset to offset of the laser pulse and absence of the diaphragm EMG activity.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Postinspiratory complex acts as a gating mechanism regulating swallow-breathing coordination and other laryngeal behaviors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>, for the following reasons:</p><p>Despite the impressive methodological approaches used and some interesting findings provided in the manuscript, the three reviewers reached a consensus considering that the present study suffers from several important weaknesses. First, the conclusions drawn by the authors are not fully and sufficiently supported by the data. Addressing this would require additional sets of experiments.</p><p>Second, there is an absolute requirement for much more detail in the description of the methods, more developed and rigorous data analysis including statistics, and a better demonstration of the conceptual framework of phase-dependent PiCo-mediated gating of swallowing and breathing behavior. The concept defended here, meaning that the PiCo should be considered as the swallowing pattern generator remains to be fully demonstrated. With the actual data, the reviewers point to the fact that the authors do not have convincing arguments to affirm this and they rather suggest strongly reconsidering the discussion to address the possibility of other mechanisms possibly involved in the coupling between swallowing and breathing.</p><p>Finally, the entire paper would deserve improvement in the writing in general and also in the illustrations to fix some imprecisions, errors, contradictions, and lack of details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract:</p><p>• I don't think that the current study &quot;reveals this small brainstem microcircuit acts as a central gating mechanism for airway protective behaviors.&quot; How is PiCo functioning as a microcircuit in this capacity? The statement is too bold in general and it would be more accurate to say &quot;this region mediates swallow and other laryngeal behaviors&quot;.</p><p>• Distinguish &quot;laryngeal activation&quot; from swallow more clearly here.</p><p>• The sentence beginning &quot;PiCo triggers consistent…&quot; is confusing as written</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>• The explanation of &quot;yield&quot; as it applies to diaphragm activation needs to be expanded.</p><p>• The role of this region with crying is mentioned in the introduction, but there is no citation for papers that discuss the integration of breathing with vocalization. Such citations could include Hartmann and Brecht 2020, Wei et al., 2022, and Hulsmann et al., 2019.</p><p>Results:</p><p>• The first heading includes &quot;gates&quot; – this is an interpretation, and as such doesn't belong in the results.</p><p>• In the results paragraph for Figure 2, the main findings are not stated.</p><p>• For the result &quot;laser pulse duration did not affect respiratory rhythm reset…&quot; please include the data/stats for this.</p><p>• The headings for Figure 3 results paragraph and for the figure legend don't make sense as written.</p><p>• In Figure 4A: please mark where the water stim was applied. This panel is also not explained in the Results section, so please add it there.</p><p>• Figure 4B, please add a color legend.</p><p>• For Figure 4, please add a table with stats for these data.</p><p>• Regarding the swallow numbers in Figure 4, why are there so many more for the Vglut2 strain? Were there more trials or were they more likely to swallow with the stim? It's not clear if absolute swallow numbers are given anywhere – just probabilities.</p><p>• In general, the terms used for your transgenic mice/neurons are confusing in places. In the first place you want to use the abbreviations, please define them very clearly.</p><p>• Figure S1 and Figure 6: using – and + signs to refer to water vs opto stims is confusing. &quot;-ChAT&quot; or &quot;+ChAT&quot; makes it seem like there's a genetic difference between the two. Pick different X-axis labels to distinguish between stims. The Figure S1 explanation in the results text is also quite confusing.</p><p>• Why did you present different metrics for the different strains in Figure S1? LC duration, insp delay, and XII amplitude are done for ChAT but not Vglut2 animals. And the opposite for X burst duration and X amplitude? That makes it difficult to visually compare the different strains.</p><p>• Also in Figure S1: I can't clearly see data points/lines for all the animals in all the plots. For example, it doesn't appear that data for all 10 ChAT animals are in each of the purple plots. Just wondering if they were excluded for some reason or if I'm misunderstanding something.</p><p>• Figure S2 and Figure 5. Please put directions on the X-axis of the plot and explain your zero point.</p><p>• The paragraph (and related figs/tables such as tables S3and7) where you talk about the &quot;different behavior&quot; in 3 mice is confusing, mostly due to the term chosen. Try calling it &quot;partial swallow&quot; or &quot;incomplete swallow&quot; or something like that. A normal swallow is technically &quot;swallow-related motor activation&quot;, so it's difficult to distinguish the two with that term.</p><p>• In the paragraph that starts with &quot;Swallow related motor activation was not triggered…&quot;, the writing in the paragraph should be edited for clarity.</p><p>Methods:</p><p>• Are you sure you don't mean descending aorta?</p><p>• See other comments about explaining genetics and staining more thoroughly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The present study investigates the role of the PiCo in swallow-breathing coordination. The study is a follow-up on previously published data that have already shown that the PiCo plays a role in swallow-breathing coordination. The use of selective optogenetic stimulation of subsets of PiCo neurons is laudable. The novelty of the results is unclear. The role of the PiCo in swallow-breathing coordination was already shown and that swallows can reset the respiratory cycle is known for decades. The finding that optogenetic activation of the PiCo during early expiration triggers swallows while PiCo activation during later stages evokes unspecified laryngeal activation seems an interesting result but may need further validation.</p><p>Specific Concerns:</p><p>Overall the presented data only partially support the conclusions.</p><p>&quot;PiCo triggers consistent swallow behavior and preserves physiologic swallow motor sequence&quot;</p><p>Such a conclusion would require performing a power spectral analysis of the motor EMGs that compromise a large variety of functional different oral and laryngeal muscle groups to display the physiologic swallow motor sequence. In this context, it should be shown that EMG recordings of the submental complex which covers muscles active during the oral phase of swallowing should precede the onset of the laryngeal complex EMG. In summary, the swallow motor sequence needs to be better analyzed and quantified.</p><p>Methods</p><p>The description of the methods is short and lacks important details. As written, the only physiologic parameter controlled during experiments was the core temperature. Were blood gas composition, heart rate, and blood pressure also monitored? If yes please provide data. The figures indicate a range of respiratory frequencies (for instance figure 1C stimulation showing swallow is around 80-100 while breathing frequency for the experiment illustrating laryngeal activation seems to 30-40 breaths/mins). The duration of the diaphragm EMG seems to range from around 500ms to 200ms.</p><p>Please verify and discuss whether the depth of anesthesia could have significantly affected the outcomes of your study.</p><p>Were any criteria for the overall autonomic state of the animal used to determine the start of an experiment?</p><p>Please provide the time constant for EMG and nerve signal integration. They seem to be quite variable in the figures.</p><p>The approach for the recording of EMG activities and laser placement is unclear. I assume a ventral approach was implemented for nerve and EMG recordings, but it is unclear how you inserted the laser for optogenetic stimulation. The predetermined location of the PiCo is not sufficient information. Apparently, the light activation of the PiCo was performed from the medullary surface (dorsal or ventral??). This seems a crude approach and not well controllable approach. Please provide more detail on the procedure. In addition, since the location of the laser cannot be determined by histology it is mandatory to provide additional controls. Please provide data that show placement at the border of the predetermined location of the Pico does not evoke swallow or laryngeal activation.</p><p>Submental and laryngeal complex EMG recordings: How were movement artifacts during swallowing and breathing controlled or avoided? See the comment below – all activity seems synchronized with inspiration in all recordings presented in the results.</p><p>Results</p><p>Please provide animal numbers for each experimental setting in the text of the result section.</p><p>It seems that during breathing both submental and laryngeal complex EMG are synchronized with the diaphragm EMG (see all figures). This would mean that all recorded muscles of the laryngeal and submental complex contract during inspiration. If so, how do the contraction of muscles that are all functionally inspiratory mediate swallowing? Showing a photograph that illustrates the placement of the surface electrodes in the submental and laryngeal complex (please also include labels for all the specific muscles mentioned in the material section) would be helpful to assess the present study and would greatly enhance the impact of the study.</p><p>In none of the presented recordings respiratory-related postinspiratory activity is evident in recordings of the laryngeal complex. According to the triple oscillator hypothesis, this would mean that the PiCo, as a postinspiratory oscillator, is inhibited during respiration in the present experimental setting. Could this be an effect of viral transfections?</p><p>Strangely, In Figure 6 you show a vagus ENG which has postinspiratory discharge while the laryngeal complex which should include laryngeal adductor muscle activity is quiet. Even more inconsistency is illustrated by the absence of postinspiratory discharge in the vagus in Figure 4. This again raises the question of whether the experimental conditions may affect the outcome of the study.</p><p>Figure 6. Has the title &quot; Missed or low transfection of PiCo neurons stimulates incomplete swallow related motor activation&quot; This is also a centerpiece in the discussion.</p><p>It is odd that then a representative trace of 80ms activation of ChAT/Vglut2 neurons at PiCo resulting in swallow-related motor activation is shown without highlighting the differences to previous swallow motor activation. The only obvious significant difference was the absence of Schluckathmung. Otherwise, the swallow-related motor activation seems to less or more match the other already quite variable recordings presented, whether Schluckathmung is present or not. Please show a more convincing example of incomplete motor activation, before it is made a central and provocative point in the discussion.</p><p>Moreover, Figure 6D illustrates differences between water-evoked swallows and PiCo-evoked swallows which does not relate to the differences between sufficient and insufficient PiCo transfection and belongs rather to Figure 4. – what is the rationale for the organization of this figure?</p><p>Figure 4 according to your scale bar the water-evoked swallow is longer in duration and thus does not match the group data illustrated in Figure 6.</p><p>Figure 7 is unnecessary, and biased, and does not summarize the findings or the discussion.</p><p>Finally, it would also greatly enhance the impact of the study to illustrate whether prolonged PiCo stimulation (1-5s) can evoke multiple swallows – it would be important to know whether the PiCo is only involved in the central gating of solitary swallows or can also gate multiple swallows. This would be also important for the translational impact (as discussed) of your study since patients usually aspirate after performing multiple swallows during drinking behavior.</p><p>Tracing experiments:</p><p>Where in the brainstem did you actually see CTb-labelled cells after larynx injection? What was the rationale for this experiment and why was it important to study whether the PiCo contains motor neurons? Please better explain why this is a crucial experiment for the proof of concept that the PiCo is involved in swallow-breathing coordination.</p><p>CTb NTS: The tracer injection site clearly shows a spillover of CTb into the hypoglossal motor neurons.</p><p>Suppl Figure 3D is the pico located in the caudal medulla at the level of the area postrema? Has to be a mistake and thus the figure does not illustrate the absence of CTB-labelled cells in the PiCo.</p><p>The discussion needs to be focused on the present results.</p><p>For instance, it is not adequate to explain the quite variable burst durations of the putative PiCo-mediated swallow activation by discussing that swallow's pattern may change in relation to the structure and consistency of a food bolus, etc. This was not studied. A discussion that questions the all-or-nothing mechanisms because of incomplete swallow motor activation without showing an example of such incomplete motor activation is also not appropriate. Instead, a focused discussion on why the PiCo evoked motor activations reflect swallows should be included. A discussion of technical limitations (e.g. how anesthesia may have affected the results) is also missing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Co-transmission is confusing in this context, recommend using terminology like &quot;intersectional recombination&quot;</p><p>&quot;Viral tracing&quot; when referring to CTB tracing is incorrect. CTB is a molecule (protein complex) not a virus.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The introduction would benefit from a description of the swallowing pattern and the muscles involved, with particular emphasis on those from which EMG recordings were made in the current study.</p><p>The 2016 Anderson paper suggests that PiCo is homogeneous (not &quot;heterogenous) with a very specific molecular complement ChAT/Vglut2, a definition to the exclusion of the diverse surrounding neurons.</p><p>&quot;Since, work in the rodent has shown this region serves as a premotor relay within the IRt that integrates postinspiratory motor outputs and other non-respiratory central pattern generators (CPGs) such as swallowing, crying, lapping, whisking (Ain Summan Toor et al., 2019; Dempsey et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2013; Moore, Kleinfeld, and Wang, 2014; Pitts, Huff, Reed, Iceman, and Mellen, 2021), suggesting that PiCo may serve as a hub, acting as a gate, for various laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors&quot;</p><p>The IRt region has certainly been shown to be premotor the oro-motor behaviours listed. The above claim seems to base the PiCo's potential involvement as a pre-motor structure for laryngeal adduction purely on its proximity to the IRt as opposed to any actual demonstration that PiCo neurons are themselves premotor (i.e. innervate motor neurons). If that is the case, it should be made more explicit in the text, 1. what is being inferred about the PiCo in regard to pre-motor status, and 2. offer some evidence to support that reasoning.</p><p>Results:</p><p>It is a little laborious to specify the transgenic condition in each experiment (e.g. Vglut-cre – early stimulation vs ChAT-cre – early stimulation vs Vglut2-flpo/ChAT-cre – early stimulation). This study has identified a transgenic solution that permits selective stimulation PiCo neurons (i.e. Cre and flippase recombination of ChR2 in the con/fon AAV system): the legibility of the manuscript might be improved by first establishing equivalence (or inequivalence) between these genetic conditions and then reporting only the results for the intersectional condition that best captures PiCo (and saving the Vglut2- and ChAT- only conditions for the supplementary data). If the Vglut2 &quot;PiCo&quot; stimulation provides a quantitative or qualitatively different response to the double condition, it should probably be reported under the caveat these effects are likely due to the many non-PiCo neurons being stimulated in parallel. Sup Figure 3 B from this study (and Figure 1B from Anderson et al. 2016) demonstrates this quite well, ChAT neurons likely make up less than 1/3 of the vglut2 neurons in the area.</p><p>Shortcomings of the anatomical tracing are highlighted in the public review section.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Postinspiratory complex acts as a gating mechanism regulating swallow-breathing coordination and other laryngeal behaviors&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>This paper is an extremely valuable contribution in the functional characterization of PiCo, a specific medullary region involved in the control of swallow behavior and its coordination with breathing.

Nevertheless, a few concerns should be considered. The main ones being:</p><p>1. Writing: the style is a bit repetitive in the result section, leading to the risk of rendering the main outcomes blurred.

Even if these points might very probably constitute the future research of the Ramirez group.</p><p>Full reviews are detailed below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments</p><p>This is a very interesting study performed by Ramirez group which demonstrated using intersectional genetic approaches in order to selectively stimulate a region in the brainstem already described to be involved in post inspiration, now suggesting to be also involved in swallow/laryngeal motor behaviors. The findings are important and relevant for the field. The manuscript is well written, well illustrated, and the authors already made an extensive revision in the first round when they submitted previously to e<italic>Life</italic>. I have only a few comments and suggestions to clarify some points</p><p>1) I totally understand the role of PiCo in the post inspiratory activity, and its more than clear that PiCo has to do with this important phase of the motor behavior, however, post inspiration is not only involved in swallow. The selective activation of PiCo is selective for swallow or other postinspiratory behavior?</p><p>2) Pag 13, lines 316-319: &quot;Prolonged stimulation of PiCo (10 seconds) does not trigger sequential swallows, however, produces one swallow at the beginning of the stimulus, inhibiting inspiration, when the stimulus occurs during or right after inspiration (Figure S5)&quot;. Does the sentence mean that PiCo can trigger other behaviors?</p><p>3) &quot;Microinjections of isoguvacine into the Bötzinger complex attenuated the apneic response but not the ELM burst activity (Sun et al., 2011), suggesting the Bötzinger complex, not PiCo, could be involved in modulating the swallow-induced apnea&quot;. I really liked this idea, but will it be important to show a possible interaction between BotC and PiCo? Please comment.</p><p>4) The authors comment that further studies are necessary to understand the interaction between PiCo and the pontine respiratory group on modulating swallow and other airway protective behaviors. I agree, but a study in rats using standard neuroanatomy/neurophysiology techniques showed a significant input from KF and PAG regions to PiCo region (PMID = 34582982). Both areas have neurons involved in respiratory behaviours such as swallow, cough and speech.</p><p>5) If PiCo evoked swallows are not triggered in a behavioral context, I am wondering when PiCo should be recruited to evoke swallow? What is the physiological condition that the physiology system will need to have PiCo activity?</p><p>6) Please correct me if I am wrong. According to the histology and counting described in the Results section we have approximately 60% of neurons in thePiCO region, i.e VGlut/Chat neurons. Am I right?</p><p>7) Abstract: I think it will be necessary to add a general conclusion about the data observed in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the Authors investigated the role of a medullary region, named Postinspiratory Complex (PiCo), in the mediation of swallow/laryngeal behaviours and their coordination with breathing. This region, first described in 2016, is characterized by the presence of glutamatergic and cholinergic interneurons. Thus, experiments have been performed in single allelic and intersectional allelic recombinase transgenic mice to specifically excite cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons by means of optogenetic approaches, while recording swallow and laryngeal motor response. The data indicate that in anesthetized mice the activation of PiCo neurons during inspiration or at the beginning of the post-inspiratory phase evokes a swallow motor sequence, similar to that induced by water application, while the only laryngeal activation is observed when PiCo neurons are activated in later stages of expiration. Interestingly, the Authors further investigate the anatomical landmarks of PiCo using a complex intersectional transgenic technique to reveal by immunohistochemical analyses the distribution of cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons. They conclude that the PiCo region may be involved in the regulation of laryngeal coordination during swallow and other laryngeal behaviours. These data add in an interesting piece in the ongoing discussion on ponto-medullary structures involved in swallow-breathing coordination.</p><p>The Authors' claims and conclusions are mostly justified by their data. However, it should be acknowledged that the impact of the study is to a certain extent limited by the lack of knowledge on the source of excitatory inputs to PiCo during swallowing under physiological condition as well as the connectivity between this region and the swallowing CPG, a structure not well defined, or other brain regions involved in the reflex.</p><p>Major strengths of the manuscript:</p><p>– The methodological approach is sophisticated and well suited for the experimental question. The in vivo mouse preparation developed for this study takes advantage of a selective optogenetic stimulation of specific cell types with the simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from upper airway muscles involved in respiration and swallowing to assess their motor patterns.</p><p>– The choice of the topic. The findings described in this study are interesting since there is growing evidence that this medullary region could to be involved in several functions related to airway protection and other oral behaviours.</p><p>– This study fits in with previous works. This work is a logic extension of previous studies from this group on swallowing-breathing coordination with further advances in the technical difficulties of experimental protocols and skills necessary to improve them.</p><p>Major weaknesses of the manuscript:</p><p>– The writing style is wordy and repetitive in the result section. This makes difficult to follow data presentation. This part needs to be shortened to highlight the main outcomes of the study.</p><p>– In my opinion, supplementary material is too redundant (Table S6 and table S7 could be removed since illustrate data from a very low number of animals).</p><p>Recommendations for the authors</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The Introduction is too long and some efforts should be done to make it shorter and more focussed.</p><p>Lines 73-85: It is not necessary to repeat all findings of the previous study by Anderson et al.

My comments are brief as the other Reviewers have noted the caveats, many of which I agree with.</p><p>This study is a tour de force combining technically-demanding approaches to obtain EMG recordings from most of the relevant muscles and nerves (submental complex, laryngeal complex, diaphrgam; vagus and hypoglossal nerves), coupled with elegant intersectional genetic approaches to specifically target for activation cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons that comprise PiCo. This strategy avoids nearby glutamatergic neurons in the reticular formation and cholinergic motoneurons in the NA.</p><p>The results are clear and striking in that activation of PiCo is sufficient to elicit swallow and laryngeal activation, with the precise timing of each dependent on the phase of the respiratory cycle (swallowing in early PI, laryngeal activation in later I). Moreover, the sequence of events resulting from PiCo activation appear qualitatively similar to those events occuring during a more &quot;physiological&quot; swallow elicited by water administration into the oral cavity. The authors have included the necessary controls, as requested by the Reviewers.</p><p>In addition, the authors have further refined the anatomical boundaries of Pico using their intersectional transgenic strategy, showing that Glut/Cholinergic neurons that comprise PiCo are medial to the cholinergic neurons of the NA.</p><p>The authors should be congratulated for performing such a rigorous, technically-demanding set of experiments to show a critical function for PiCo in vivo in swallowing, laryngeal activation, and their coordination with inspiration. Their findings clearly show that PiCo is sufficient to elicit swallowing and reset the respiratory rhythm. They have expanded our knowledge regarding PiCo in these functions and have set the stage for future studies that will further delineate the mechanisms by which PiCo drives these behaviors. No study is perfect, this one included. There are obviously caveats that the other Reviewers have raised, but that have been acknowledged by the authors and, in my opinion, have been discussed sufficiently in the paper. An important extension of these findings is to demonstrate that PiCo is necessary for swallowing/larygneal function (and coordination with breathing) in a more natural, physiological setting (i.e. normal swallow of a bolus of water/food etc). What are the ramifications of optogenetic silencing of PiCo on normal swallowing? In addition, as mentioned by other reviewers, the precise neural circuitry through which PiCo acts, and how it is integrated with the nTS and other regions needs to be more clearly defined. It seems as though the authors are working on these questions in a separate study.</p><p>In summary, the findings of Huff et al. are a significant advance of our knowledge regarding PiCo and post-inspiratory behaviors. Their study using in vivo recordings from the relevant nerves and muscles, in conjunction with an elegant transectional approach to specifically target PiCo is impressive. The finding that the specific activation of PiCO is sufficient to drive swallowing and laryngeal activation during the post-inspiratory period (and resetting inspiration) is critical for the fields of neural control of breathing and swallowing. They set the stage for future research that expands on the role of PiCo in natural post-inspiratory behaviors, as well as their neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie them.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86103.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by eLife, for the following reasons:</p><p>Despite the impressive methodological approaches used and some interesting findings provided in the manuscript, the three reviewers reached a consensus considering that the present study suffers from several important weaknesses. First, the conclusions drawn by the authors are not fully and sufficiently supported by the data. Addressing this would require additional sets of experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for acknowledging the impressive methodological advances. As suggested, and to better support our data, we have added new experiments and additional controls. Specifically, we added control experiments such as identical optogenetic protocols that stimulate PiCo in Ai32+/+ mice not crossed with any cre lines, as well as ChATcreVglut2FlpO:ChR2 mice that did not transfect with channelrhodopsin, resulting in no response. This was also shown in the form of an added supplemental figure (Figure S3). We added a supplemental figure showing that long (10s) continuous stimulation of PiCo does not result in sequential swallows, rather only one swallow at the beginning of the stimulation if stimulated during or right after inspiration (Figure S5). We added additional data to prove that stimulation duration did not have an effect on respiratory rhythm allowing us to group all stimulation durations for both “swallow” and “non-swallow” behaviors to evaluate respiration rhythm reset (Figure S1). We added additional ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mice to increase the N number in order to increase the validity and power of the findings. We also removed tracing experiments of lesser quality (CTB) as well as language surrounding these experiments. The only experiments we did not add was using an opsin or technique that would eliminate or inhibit ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO neurons. While we agree that this would have been a good idea, there is a technical limitation since this technique is not available. Efforts are being made in our lab to make this happen, but we are far from ready to use this, which would delay the publication of this study by more than a year. Indeed, because of the already “impressive methodological advances”, this study is more than 6 years in the making. In the meantime, studies with less sophisticated techniques were published. Thus, we don’t think it is justified to ask for further experiments that are not feasible with the currently available technologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, there is an absolute requirement for much more detail in the description of the methods, more developed and rigorous data analysis including statistics, and a better demonstration of the conceptual framework of phase-dependent PiCo-mediated gating of swallowing and breathing behavior. The concept defended here, meaning that the PiCo should be considered as the swallowing pattern generator remains to be fully demonstrated. With the actual data, the reviewers point to the fact that the authors do not have convincing arguments to affirm this and they rather suggest strongly reconsidering the discussion to address the possibility of other mechanisms possibly involved in the coupling between swallowing and breathing.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above we have removed any language claiming PiCo is a swallow gate. Though we would like to point out that we never claimed PiCo should be considered the swallow pattern generator. We do not believe this is the case. We have revised the language to make sure this claim is not suggested. We have also added additional statistical analysis and description of the analysis that we have employed, both in text and supplemental figures. We have also provided a supplemental figure of our methods to aid in clarity of out protocols (Figure S6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the entire paper would deserve improvement in the writing in general and also in the illustrations to fix some imprecisions, errors, contradictions, and lack of details.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully edited, and revised the text and the illustrations, as well as added many figures to be void of any errors, contradictions and lack of details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>• I don't think that the current study &quot;reveals this small brainstem microcircuit acts as a central gating mechanism for airway protective behaviors.&quot; How is PiCo functioning as a microcircuit in this capacity? The statement is too bold in general and it would be more accurate to say &quot;this region mediates swallow and other laryngeal behaviors&quot;.</p><p>• Distinguish &quot;laryngeal activation&quot; from swallow more clearly here.</p><p>• The sentence beginning &quot;PiCo triggers consistent…&quot; is confusing as written</p></disp-quote><p>The above points have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. The manuscript now states Activation of PiCo during inspiration or the beginning of postinspiration triggers swallow behavior, while there is a higher probability for stimulating only laryngeal activation (activation of only laryngeal complex) when activated further into expiration, suggesting PiCo’s role in swallow-breathing coordination. PiCo triggered swallow preserves physiologic swallow motor sequence, while stimulated laryngeal activation is dependent on stimulation duration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction:</p><p>• The explanation of &quot;yield&quot; as it applies to diaphragm activation needs to be expanded.</p><p>• The role of this region with crying is mentioned in the introduction, but there is no citation for papers that discuss the integration of breathing with vocalization. Such citations could include Hartmann and Brecht 2020, Wei et al., 2022, and Hulsmann et al., 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>The above points have been incorporated into the revised manuscript. The manuscript now states: Postinspiration was originally defined in 1937 by Gesell and White (Gesell and White, 1938) calling it an “after discharge” of the diaphragm, similar to “yield” which refers to the simultaneous muscle activity of the decrementing diaphragm and incrementing expiratory laryngeal muscles, serving as a mechanical brake to slow exhalation (Huff A, 2020a)…. Since, work in the rodent has shown this region serves as a premotor relay within the IRt that integrates postinspiratory motor outputs and other non-respiratory central pattern generators (CPGs) such as swallowing, crying, lapping, whisking (Ain Summan Toor et al., 2019; Dempsey et al., 2021; Hartmann and Brecht, 2020; Hülsmann et al., 2019; Moore et al., 2013; Moore, Kleinfeld, and Wang, 2014; Pitts, Huff, Reed, Iceman, and Mellen, 2021; Wei, Collie, Dempsey, Fortin, and Yackle, 2022), suggesting that PiCo may serve as a hub, mediating various laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>• The first heading includes &quot;gates&quot; – this is an interpretation, and as such doesn't belong in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Gate has been removed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the results paragraph for Figure 2, the main findings are not stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the main findings to figure 2 in the manuscript. The manuscript now states: When evaluating the phase shift plots, we divided PiCo stimulated responses into swallow and non-swallow (Figure 2). Non-swallow included PiCo activation that resulted in both laryngeal activation and no motor response. We found that in all genetic mouse lines studied, laser pulse duration did not affect respiratory rhythm reset in either swallow or non-swallow responses, allowing us to group all laser pulse durations as one (Figure S1). Using a Pearson correlation and simple linear regression, the correlation coefficient (r, Figure 2A) and line of best fit (slope, Figure 2B), respectively, was calculated for each genetic mouse type and response to determine the degree of correlation between behavior response and reset of the respiratory rhythm. There is a high degree of correlation between shifting or delaying the following inspiratory burst and triggering a swallow when stimulating ChATcre:Ai32 (r = 0.77, p&lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.87 ) and ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 (r = 0.79 , p&lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.73) mice. While there is a moderate degree of correlation in the Vglut2cre:Ai32 (r = 0.33, p&lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.69) mice. Indicating that triggering a swallow in the ChATcre:Ai32 and ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mice has a stronger effect on resetting the respiratory rhythm. We found a moderate degree of correlation between the following inspiratory burst and non-swallows stimulated by ChATcre:Ai32 (r = 0.45, p&lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.35), and a low degree of correlation in Vglut2cre:Ai32 (r = 0.29, p&lt; 0.0001, slope = 0.22), and ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 (r = 0.23, p = 0.0001, slope = 0.09) mice. Indicating that triggering a behavior other than swallow has a weak effect on resetting the respiratory rhythm in all of the genetic mouse types, under our anesthetic conditions, see discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• For the result &quot;laser pulse duration did not affect respiratory rhythm reset…&quot; please include the data/stats for this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplemental figure showing this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The headings for Figure 3 results paragraph and for the figure legend don't make sense as written.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the heading for clarity.

It's not clear if absolute swallow numbers are given anywhere – just probabilities.</p></disp-quote><p>The same number of trials were done for each mouse strain and animal. However for the Vglut2 mice they were more likely to swallow in response to the laser stimulation. There is also one more Vglut2cre:Ai32 experiment than ChATcre:Ai32, and 5 more Vglut2cre:Ai32 then ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 experiments. Language has been added to the manuscript to make this clear. The manuscript now states: There are more swallows in Vglut2cre:Ai32 mice due to a larger N number and a higher probability of triggering a swallow over any other behavior (Figure 1B).</p><p>We indicate total of swallows in response to laser for all 3 mouse strains in the figure 4 legend but do not give the raw values of each swallow per mouse per mouse strain.

Pick different X-axis labels to distinguish between stims. The Figure S1 explanation in the results text is also quite confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have changed the X-axis labels to be clearer. It now states: water (Water stim) and swallows triggered by stimulation of PiCo (PiCo stim).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Why did you present different metrics for the different strains in Figure S1? LC duration, insp delay, and XII amplitude are done for ChAT but not Vglut2 animals. And the opposite for X burst duration and X amplitude? That makes it difficult to visually compare the different strains.</p></disp-quote><p>The point of this figure was not to visually compare across genetic strains. Therefore we only presented significant effects between water and PiCo evoked swallow. However, the complete data are presented in table S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Also in Figure S1: I can't clearly see data points/lines for all the animals in all the plots. For example, it doesn't appear that data for all 10 ChAT animals are in each of the purple plots. Just wondering if they were excluded for some reason or if I'm misunderstanding something.</p></disp-quote><p>No data points have been excluded. However some data points are extremely close in value and appear as if they are on top of each other, making it difficult to decipher one point from another. There is also the case as in the ChATcre:Ai32 water stim you do not see 10 connecting points because one of the mice did not show swallows in response to water but did swallow in response to laser stimulation. These instances are reflected in degrees of freedom now added to the data tables and in the text: For example, injection of water into the oral cavity of a ChATcre:Ai32 and a ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mouse did not evoke a swallow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure S2 and Figure 5.

This description has been added to the manuscript: <italic>X-axis is the transitioning point of compact and semi-compact NAmb.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The paragraph (and related figs/tables such as tables S3and7) where you talk about the &quot;different behavior&quot; in 3 mice is confusing, mostly due to the term chosen. Try calling it &quot;partial swallow&quot; or &quot;incomplete swallow&quot; or something like that. A normal swallow is technically &quot;swallow-related motor activation&quot;, so it's difficult to distinguish the two with that term.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not feel comfortable calling this a partial or incomplete swallow because we are not sure this is a swallow. Swallow requires activation of related muscles in a rostrocaudal temporal sequence. The behavior that has been evoked here does not have this sequence therefore we cannot call this a swallow or any variation of. We have changed the name to “upper airway motor activity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the paragraph that starts with &quot;Swallow related motor activation was not triggered…&quot;, the writing in the paragraph should be edited for clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited this paragraph to improve clarity. The manuscript now says: However, unlike the PiCo triggered swallow activity, upper airway motor activity stimulated by 40ms pulses were significantly shorter than activity stimulated with 200ms pulses (paired t-test: p = 0.01, t = 5.61, df = 3) (Table S1B). Indicating the upper airway motor activity duration is dependent on laser pulse duration similar to PiCo stimulated laryngeal activation, though shares similar characteristics to both swallow and laryngeal activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods:</p><p>• Are you sure you don't mean descending aorta?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes we are sure. These perfusion methods have been previously published (Lima, J. C., Oliveira, L. M., Botelho, M. T., Moreira, T. S., and Takakura, A. C. (2018).)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The present study investigates the role of the PiCo in swallow-breathing coordination. The study is a follow-up on previously published data that have already shown that the PiCo plays a role in swallow-breathing coordination. The use of selective optogenetic stimulation of subsets of PiCo neurons is laudable. The novelty of the results is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the reviewer missed the important novelty. No study before has stimulated specifically cholinergic-glutamatergic neurons. This is a fundamental technical advance as it is the first study to show that stimulating specifically this interneuron population has the effects on swallow-breathing coordination. All previous studies most certainly also activated laryngeal motoneurons, which could contribute to a swallow reflex response to the laryngeal motor activation, which would not be caused by stimulating specifically PiCo interneurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The role of the PiCo in swallow-breathing coordination was already shown</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, no previous study has stimulated specifically cholinergic-glutamatergic interneurons in PiCo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>…and that swallows can reset the respiratory cycle is known for decades. The finding that optogenetic activation of the PiCo during early expiration triggers swallows while PiCo activation during later stages evokes unspecified laryngeal activation seems an interesting result but may need further validation.</p><p>Specific Concerns:</p><p>Overall the presented data only partially support the conclusions.</p><p>&quot;PiCo triggers consistent swallow behavior and preserves physiologic swallow motor sequence&quot;</p><p>Such a conclusion would require performing a power spectral analysis of the motor EMGs that compromise a large variety of functional different oral and laryngeal muscle groups to display the physiologic swallow motor sequence. In this context, it should be shown that EMG recordings of the submental complex which covers muscles active during the oral phase of swallowing should precede the onset of the laryngeal complex EMG. In summary, the swallow motor sequence needs to be better analyzed and quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>With all due respect, the reviewer’s comment seems to be inconsistent. On one hand the reviewer states that it has previously been demonstrated that PiCo coordinates swallowing, yet when we read the Toor study, they have not done what the reviewer seems to require from us. Indeed, the Toor study only used SLN stimulation under fictive conditions (deafferented and paralyzed). Our study also includes EMG recordings, while the Toor study is solely based on nerve recordings. While a power spectrum analysis may be appropriate when using surface electrodes of the submental complex in the human that covers and outputs a sum of the recording from a large variety of various muscle groups, this is not appropriate for animal studies that use wire EMG electrodes in certain muscle groups. Our analysis of swallow motor sequence has previously been published (Huff et al. 2022). Using timing of swallow related EMG activity to evaluate swallow sequence is a widely used and accepted analysis in the field (Pitts et al. 2013, King et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods</p><p>The description of the methods is short and lacks important details. As written, the only physiologic parameter controlled during experiments was the core temperature. Were blood gas composition, heart rate, and blood pressure also monitored? If yes please provide data. The figures indicate a range of respiratory frequencies (for instance figure 1C stimulation showing swallow is around 80-100 while breathing frequency for the experiment illustrating laryngeal activation seems to 30-40 breaths/mins). The duration of the diaphragm EMG seems to range from around 500ms to 200ms.</p></disp-quote><p>Heart and respiratory rate were monitored and recorded via EMG electrodes. Blood pressure was not able to be measured due to the necessity of an arterial line that this experimental model lacks. To this point arterial blood gases were not measured. We see a range of respiratory rates among all of our mice, this could be due to their internal variability and depth of anesthesia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please verify and discuss whether the depth of anesthesia could have significantly affected the outcomes of your study.</p></disp-quote><p>The following has been added to the manuscript: Anesthesia can decrease, and sometimes abolish laryngeal postinspiratory activity (Henderson‐Smart, Johnson, and McClelland, 1982; Sherrey and Megirian, 1974). The depth of anesthesia is a limiting factor of this study. For example, injection of water into the oral cavity of a ChATcre:Ai32 and a ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mouse did not evoke a swallow. This is most likely due to the depth of anesthesia since it is known that anesthesia also decreases the excitability of swallow reflex (D’Angelo et al., 2014). Positive subglottic pressure, generated during expiration, is disrupted during opening of the tracheal window (performed in the proposed anesthetized preparation) leading to lengthening of expiratory duration, and also causing irregular breathing (Henderson‐Smart et al., 1982) another limiting factor of this model. There are no apparent studies that have investigated the neural coordination of postinspiratory behaviors and breathing in the alert mouse. Follow-up studies are desirable to further investigate postinspiratory behaviors and swallowing in alert animals.</p><p>However, studying alert animals comes with other experimental limitations. For example, it would be extremely difficult to bilaterally and optogenetically stimulate PiCo with the same specificity as done in the present study, while simultaneously recording from laryngeal muscles and hoping that the mouse is still capable of swallowing naturally. We feel that this is the beyond the scope of the present study.</p><p>With all due respect to this reviewer, it seems that this reviewer is not familiar with the technical difficulties associated with performing our experiments in mice. One possible reason why Toor et al. likely performed their study in rats was that rats are much larger, which makes it easier to perform the dissections, monitor blood pressure, etc. However, the downside of using rats is that it does not allow the authors to use the same intersectional genetic approaches that can be done in mice, but not in rats. Thus, it took us much longer to complete the present study. When Toor et al. showed their first results in a SFN poster we were already working on this project for more than one year. To develop the intersectional genetic approach used in the present study took close to four years. It might seem like a minor technical advance to this reviewer and apparently also to reviewer number 1, but we initially worked with the Allen Institute that specifically created a transgenic mouse for us to perform these experiments. But, it took us almost two years of breeding and genotyping, numerous histological controls etc. to finally realize that this method does not work. Hence, we started to develop a viral approach. But, also for the viral approach, we encountered problems. We had several months in which the virus did not express. Thus, we have hundreds of “controls” in which “sham-viral injections” or “transgenic approaches” did not allow us to evoke swallows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were any criteria for the overall autonomic state of the animal used to determine the start of an experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>In the methods sections we state “Adequate depth of anesthesia was determined via heart and breathing rate, as well as lack of toe pinch response every 15 minutes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please provide the time constant for EMG and nerve signal integration. They seem to be quite variable in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>500ms time bars are present in each figures where a representative EMG/ENG trace is present. Also all values are reported in ms indicated on Y-axis and within the Results section.</p><p>We have added to the analysis section: Using the Spike2 software, data was further processed using a band pass filtered (200-700Hz, 40Hz transition gap) then rectified and smoothed (20ms). Using the Spike2 software the ECGdelete 02.s2s script is used to remove heart artifact, when present, from the ENG and EMG recordings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The approach for the recording of EMG activities and laser placement is unclear. I assume a ventral approach was implemented for nerve and EMG recordings, but it is unclear how you inserted the laser for optogenetic stimulation. The predetermined location of the PiCo is not sufficient information. Apparently, the light activation of the PiCo was performed from the medullary surface (dorsal or ventral??).

This is an experimental characteristic that interests us and we will continue to study why the laryngeal postinspiratory activity is variable among all of our mice throughout the experiment.

This is likely due to the level of anesthesia (refer to the discussion), the effect of removing the portion of the trachea below the level of the larynx, or the overpowering of inspiratory activity in the EMG channel. While it is possible to sparse out the various inspiratory and expiratory laryngeal muscles in the cat and rat, this is extremely difficult to do in the mouse which is why we are measuring a complex of multiple laryngeal muscles not just the thyroarytenoid which is responsible for the laryngeal postinspiratory activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6.

The depth of anesthesia is a limiting factor of this study. For example, injection of water into the oral cavity of a ChATcre:Ai32 and a ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mouse did not evoke a swallow. This is most likely due to the depth of anesthesia since it is known anesthesia also decreases the excitability of swallow reflex (D’Angelo et al., 2014). Positive subglottic pressure, generated during expiration, is disrupted during opening of the tracheal window (performed in the proposed anesthetized preparation) leading to lengthening of expiratory duration, and also causing irregular breathing (Henderson‐Smart et al., 1982) another limiting factor of this model. There are no apparent studies that have investigated the neural coordination of postinspiratory behaviors and breathing in the alert mouse, a necessity to this field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Co-transmission is confusing in this context, recommend using terminology like &quot;intersectional recombination&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This Change has been made: Using optogenetic approaches in freely breathing- anesthetized ChATcre:Ai32, Vglut2cre:Ai32 and intersectional recombination of ChATcre:Vglut2FlpO:ChR2 mice reveals PiCo mediates airway protective behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Viral tracing&quot; when referring to CTB tracing is incorrect.

Swallow motor pattern moves in a rostral to caudal--starting with the oropharynx and ending with the upper and lower esophageal sphincters-- direction (R. W. Doty and Bosma, 1956; Pitts and Iceman, 2023; Thexton, Crompton, and German, 2007). While this study focuses primarily on the pharyngeal phase of swallow, we record swallow behavior from muscles of the oropharynx deemed “submental complex” including mylohyoid, geniohyoid and digastric muscles; innervated by the trigeminal, hypoglossal and facial nerves, respectively (Erik Van Lunteren, 1988). These muscles move the hyoid bone and the larynx superior and anterior, under the tongue (Pitts and Iceman, 2023). Muscles of the laryngopharynx include thyrohyoid, posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA), thyroarytenoid, and thyropharyngeus; innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), a branch of the vagus nerve (Erik Van Lunteren, 1988; Nasri et al., 1997). When the larynx is elevated, the upper esophageal sphincter opens while the “laryngeal complex” (PCA; lateral, transverse and oblique arytenoid, cricothyroid and thyroarytenoid muscles) closes off the airway by adduction of the thyroarytenoid muscle, and the bolus passes through the pharynx to the esophagus (Pitts and Iceman, 2023).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The 2016 Anderson paper suggests that PiCo is homogeneous (not &quot;heterogenous) with a very specific molecular complement ChAT/Vglut2, a definition to the exclusion of the diverse surrounding neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, this is a common and unintended misunderstanding. We never wanted to imply that PiCo is homogeneous. We used the cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons as a tool to identify and manipulate this region. Nature has strict space limitations and reviewers asked us to remove anything that was tangential to the main thrust of the paper. Thus, we removed evidence that PiCo contains glutamatergic and inhibitory neurons some of which have pacemaker properties. In the original publication we only state: This provides additional evidence that glutamatergic–cholinergic neurons are important for rhythm generation within the PiCo network. We conclude that the PiCo and preBötC can function as independent oscillators with similar rhythm-generating but distinct modulatory properties. We specifically state “important for rhythm generation” in order to not imply that they are the sole source for rhythm generation. We also compare this network with the preBötC which is generally accepted to be “heterogenous” and state “similar rhythm-generating properties”. We also predicted that the PiCo region will be important for other behaviors: As an excitatory rhythmogenic network, the PiCo may not only be involved in the control of breathing, but might also contribute to the generation of other postinspiratory behaviours such as swallowing and vocalization. Although, we did not perform behavioural assays in this study, various types of postinspiratory burst waveforms were observed in the vagal nerve (Extended Data Figure 10) that were similarly affected by manipulation of the PiCo, supporting the idea that this network might have a broad role in controlling postinspiratory activities. <bold>All of our predictions</bold> were confirmed by Toor et al., as well as Kevin Yackle who identified that the same region is critical for swallowing and vocalization. Of course, we are somewhat disappointed that these authors chose different names for the exact same region. But, we refuse to discredit their important contributions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Since, work in the rodent has shown this region serves as a premotor relay within the IRt that integrates postinspiratory motor outputs and other non-respiratory central pattern generators (CPGs) such as swallowing, crying, lapping, whisking (Ain Summan Toor et al., 2019; Dempsey et al., 2021; Moore et al., 2013; Moore, Kleinfeld, and Wang, 2014; Pitts, Huff, Reed, Iceman, and Mellen, 2021), suggesting that PiCo may serve as a hub, acting as a gate, for various laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors&quot;</p><p>The IRt region has certainly been shown to be premotor the oro-motor behaviours listed. The above claim seems to base the PiCo's potential involvement as a pre-motor structure for laryngeal adduction purely on its proximity to the IRt as opposed to any actual demonstration that PiCo neurons are themselves premotor (i.e. innervate motor neurons). If that is the case, it should be made more explicit in the text, 1. what is being inferred about the PiCo in regard to pre-motor status, and 2. offer some evidence to support that reasoning.</p></disp-quote><p>For swallow we do not think PiCo is premotor due to the absence of a graded response. Meaning regardless of the stimulation duration if the laser activates PiCo at the appropriate phase during the respiratory cycle a swallow will be triggered. However it is possible for laryngeal activation to be premotor because of its’ graded response. Meaning as the laser duration increases laryngeal activation increases in duration. As stated above, our ongoing anatomical studies fail to demonstrate direct connections to laryngeal motoneurons, but this study has a different scope and is work in progress. Also, we certainly don’t want to wait another year or two before publishing our studies to avoid another situation like this one: i.e. that everything we publish is already known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>It is a little laborious to specify the transgenic condition in each experiment (e.g. Vglut-cre – early stimulation vs ChAT-cre – early stimulation vs Vglut2-flpo/ChAT-cre – early stimulation). This study has identified a transgenic solution that permits selective stimulation PiCo neurons (i.e. Cre and flippase recombination of ChR2 in the con/fon AAV system): the legibility of the manuscript might be improved by first establishing equivalence (or inequivalence) between these genetic conditions and then reporting only the results for the intersectional condition that best captures PiCo (and saving the Vglut2- and ChAT- only conditions for the supplementary data). If the Vglut2 &quot;PiCo&quot; stimulation provides a quantitative or qualitatively different response to the double condition, it should probably be reported under the caveat these effects are likely due to the many non-PiCo neurons being stimulated in parallel. Sup Figure 3 B from this study (and Figure 1B from Anderson et al. 2016) demonstrates this quite well, ChAT neurons likely make up less than 1/3 of the vglut2 neurons in the area.</p></disp-quote><p>We have decided to keep this data in the manuscript because it is possible ChAT neurons that do not co expresses Vglut2, and Vglut2 neurons that do not co-express ChAT are PiCo neurons involved in the modulation of swallow and laryngeal activation. We then used the ChATcre:Vglut2:ChR2 mice as a marker to define PiCo region. As stated above and as we published in our Nature paper, PiCo is a rhythmogenic network like the preBötC. While we used the cholinergic and glutamatergic neurons to manipulate this region, this network does not only contain glutamatergic-cholinergic neurons. Indeed, a network containing only one neurotransmitter phenotype would be highly unusual, and to the best of our knowledge, we don’t know of any network in the mammalian nervous system that consists of only one neurotransmitter phenotype. Hence, it makes only sense to us to compare the effect of VGluT2, ChAT and Vglut/ChAT neurons in this region.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors have properly addressed most of the previous comments.

Please clarify whether you think that PiCo might be involved in other post-inspiratory behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>As we already proposed in our Nature article in 2016, we hypothesize that PiCo is a hub for multiple postinspiratory behaviors, similarly to the preBötC which is thought to be involved in multiple inspiratory related behaviors. Indeed, we believe that PiCo is involved in most laryngeal behaviors. In private discussions with Kevin Yackle and as stated in his Wei et al. 2022 publication they have concluded that the iRO is likely a component of PiCo. Thus, it is reasonable to say that PiCo is likely involved in vocalization, Laryngeal adductor reflex and possibly cough. Since rodents do not have the cough reflex this possibility would have to be studied in a different model. The following sentence has been added to the discussion. “As originally hypothesized by Anderson et al. 2016, we believe that PiCo is involved in multiple other laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors such as vocalization (Wei et al., 2022), LAR (laryngeal activation) and coughing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Discuss what could be the source of excitatory inputs to PiCo during swallowing under physiological condition as well as the connectivity between this region and the swallowing CPG, a structure not well defined, or other brain regions involved in the reflex as the nTS for example. Even if these points might very probably constitute the future research of the Ramirez group.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We agree this is the next step and have started generating preliminary data for these very questions. We have preliminary data using DREADD techniques to silence NTS and find that when NTS is inactivated PiCo cannot trigger swallows, but is still able to reset the respiratory rhythm. However, all of this work is very preliminary and will require several months to be completed. Thus, we feel it is not appropriate for this manuscript. However the following has been added to the manuscript:” There are known projections from NTS to PiCo (Oliveira et al., 2021) and connections between PiCo and preBötC (Anderson et al., 2016) giving reason to suggest PiCo acts as an interface between the SPG and preBötC.”… “Here we show that PiCo-triggered swallows preserve the rostrocaudal swallow pattern and hyoid elevation seen in physiologic swallows (R.

The findings are important and relevant for the field. The manuscript is well written, well illustrated, and the authors already made an extensive revision in the first round when they submitted previously to eLife. I have only a few comments and suggestions to clarify some points</p><p>1) I totally understand the role of PiCo in the post inspiratory activity, and its more than clear that PiCo has to do with this important phase of the motor behavior, however, post inspiration is not only involved in swallow. The selective activation of PiCo is selective for swallow or other postinspiratory behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. As stated above, we believe that PiCo is important for many laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors. This manuscript focuses on the two we have so far identified being swallow and laryngeal activation. With this study alone we are not able to functionally identify the “laryngeal activity” behavior. However due to previous literature we know laryngeal activity is airway protective so this “laryngeal activity” could be associated with LAR. We have added the following sentence to the manuscript: “As originally hypothesized by Anderson et al. 2016, we believe that PiCo is involved in multiple other laryngeal postinspiratory behaviors such as vocalization (Wei et al., 2022), LAR (laryngeal activation) and coughing.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Pag 13, lines 316-319: &quot;Prolonged stimulation of PiCo (10 seconds) does not trigger sequential swallows, however, produces one swallow at the beginning of the stimulus, inhibiting inspiration, when the stimulus occurs during or right after inspiration (Figure S5)&quot;. Does the sentence mean that PiCo can trigger other behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, much like the short pulse stimulations, If the 10s stimulus occurs later into expiration either laryngeal activation will occur or no motor response will be evoked. This has been clarified in the manuscript and now states: “Prolonged stimulation of these neurons (10 seconds) does not trigger sequential swallows, however produces one swallow at the beginning of the stimulus, while inhibiting inspiration, when the stimulus occurs during or right after inspiration (Figure S5). If prolonged stimulation of PiCo begins further into expiration either laryngeal activation or no motor response will occur, similar to what is seen with the short pulse stimulations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) &quot;Microinjections of isoguvacine into the Bötzinger complex attenuated the apneic response but not the ELM burst activity (Sun et al., 2011), suggesting the Bötzinger complex, not PiCo, could be involved in modulating the swallow-induced apnea&quot;. I really liked this idea, but will it be important to show a possible interaction between BotC and PiCo? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we believe it is necessary to understand the connections between PiCo and Bötzinger complex as well as their connections to the putative swallow pattern generator. We are currently collecting preliminary data, for a grant, looking at the inhibitory (GABAergic and glycinergic) control of PiCo. We have also several ongoing studies to try to better define PiCo and Bötzinger complex using Neuropixel recordings as well as RNAseq. But these are ongoing studies and it will take probably more than a year to complete. Since we believe PiCo may play a role in LAR and we know that the Bötzinger complex plays a role in ELM it is necessary to develop an approach that just focuses on investigating the “laryngeal activity” triggered by PiCo. We have added the following sentence to the manuscript: “Future studies will be important to further explore the inhibitory control of PiCo, in particular connections between the Bötzinger complex and PiCo and their connections to the SPG.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors comment that further studies are necessary to understand the interaction between PiCo and the pontine respiratory group on modulating swallow and other airway protective behaviors. I agree, but a study in rats using standard neuroanatomy/neurophysiology techniques showed a significant input from KF and PAG regions to PiCo region (PMID = 34582982). Both areas have neurons involved in respiratory behaviours such as swallow, cough and speech.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out the missed important publication and known data. We are very embarrassed and cannot believe we did not include this as it is from one of our own authors. The manuscript now states “A previous study in the rat anatomically describes neuronal projections from Kölliker-Fuse and NTS to PiCo (Oliveira, Takakura, and Moreira, 2021) suggesting that PiCo’s involvement in swallow-breathing coordination also involves the Parabrachial Nucleus and Kölliker-Fuse Nucleus in the dorsolateral pons which has previously been implicated as a sensory relay for the larynx, in particular postinspiratory activity of laryngeal adductor and swallow-breathing coordination (Bautista and Dutschmann, 2014; Dutschmann and Herbert, 2006). Further studies are necessary to understand the functional interaction between PiCo and the pontine respiratory group on modulating swallow and other airway protective behaviors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) If PiCo evoked swallows are not triggered in a behavioral context, I am wondering when PiCo should be recruited to evoke swallow? What is the physiological condition that the physiology system will need to have PiCo activity?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on very recent preliminary data using DREADD receptor technology, we do not believe that PiCo itself is able to evoke a swallow. It must have input from the caudal NTS. But, to confirm this preliminary finding requires a careful quantitative analysis, careful mapping of the NTS and vector expression. Thus, we believe that PiCo is responsible for the proper timing of swallow. Therefore it is activated in concert with the swallow pattern generator to make sure swallow and inspiration do not occur at the same time. Other ongoing preliminary data in a disease mouse model for Leigh Syndrome shows that in the presence of neuroinflammation in PiCo swallow-breathing coordination is disrupted with swallows occurring during inspiration and not postinspiration. When the neuroinflammation is removed with treatment, swallow-breathing coordination is restored and swallows occur during postinspiration. Since none of this data is published and completed we are not able to reference this in this manuscript. The following has been added in the manuscript: “These differences are likely due to the fact that the PiCo-triggered swallows are missing the behavioral context of water-evoked swallows and do not activate the sensory component of the SPG to the same extent as the water-evoked swallows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Please correct me if I am wrong. According to the histology and counting described in the Results section we have approximately 60% of neurons in thePiCO region, i.e VGlut/Chat neurons. Am I right?</p></disp-quote><p>Here we showed 2 different scenarios: (A) ChAT antibody staining representing all ChAT expressing cells in the area; (B) An intersectional genetic animal to tag Chat/Vglut2 double expressing cells. It is possible that other methods will give higher cell counts for cells in these regions than the ChatCre/Vglut2FlpO/Ai65 cross because two recombination events need to take place to activate the reporter. So, for instance, if Cre and Flp were both 80% efficient, the overall efficiency would be only 0.8 x 0.8 = 64%. This contrasts with the use of staining. It’s a general handicap of combinatorial marking systems that multiple events are needed, and as a consequence some sensitivity is sacrificed for the increased specificity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Abstract: I think it will be necessary to add a general conclusion about the data observed in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The following sentence has been added to the abstract: “We believe PiCo acts as an interface between the swallow pattern generator and the preBötzinger complex to coordinate swallow and breathing. Investigating PiCo’s role in swallow and laryngeal coordination will aid in understanding discoordination with breathing in neurological diseases.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #5 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, the Authors investigated the role of a medullary region, named Postinspiratory Complex (PiCo), in the mediation of swallow/laryngeal behaviours and their coordination with breathing. This region, first described in 2016, is characterized by the presence of glutamatergic and cholinergic interneurons. Thus, experiments have been performed in single allelic and intersectional allelic recombinase transgenic mice to specifically excite cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons by means of optogenetic approaches, while recording swallow and laryngeal motor response. The data indicate that in anesthetized mice the activation of PiCo neurons during inspiration or at the beginning of the post-inspiratory phase evokes a swallow motor sequence, similar to that induced by water application, while the only laryngeal activation is observed when PiCo neurons are activated in later stages of expiration. Interestingly, the Authors further investigate the anatomical landmarks of PiCo using a complex intersectional transgenic technique to reveal by immunohistochemical analyses the distribution of cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons. They conclude that the PiCo region may be involved in the regulation of laryngeal coordination during swallow and other laryngeal behaviours. These data add in an interesting piece in the ongoing discussion on ponto-medullary structures involved in swallow-breathing coordination.</p><p>The Authors' claims and conclusions are mostly justified by their data. However, it should be acknowledged that the impact of the study is to a certain extent limited by the lack of knowledge on the source of excitatory inputs to PiCo during swallowing under physiological condition as well as the connectivity between this region and the swallowing CPG, a structure not well defined, or other brain regions involved in the reflex.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is necessary to understand the excitatory inputs to PiCo. We have started answering this question and preliminary data to suggest PiCo evoked swallows is dependent on caudal NTS, the presumed swallow pattern generator. However, the swallow pattern generator is still not well defined, and further studies will be necessary to better characterize the neuronal substrate of this CPG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major strengths of the manuscript:</p><p>– The methodological approach is sophisticated and well suited for the experimental question. The in vivo mouse preparation developed for this study takes advantage of a selective optogenetic stimulation of specific cell types with the simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from upper airway muscles involved in respiration and swallowing to assess their motor patterns.</p><p>– The choice of the topic. The findings described in this study are interesting since there is growing evidence that this medullary region could to be involved in several functions related to airway protection and other oral behaviours.</p><p>– This study fits in with previous works.

My comments are brief as the other Reviewers have noted the caveats, many of which I agree with.</p><p>This study is a tour de force combining technically-demanding approaches to obtain EMG recordings from most of the relevant muscles and nerves (submental complex, laryngeal complex, diaphrgam; vagus and hypoglossal nerves), coupled with elegant intersectional genetic approaches to specifically target for activation cholinergic/glutamatergic neurons that comprise PiCo. This strategy avoids nearby glutamatergic neurons in the reticular formation and cholinergic motoneurons in the NA.</p><p>The results are clear and striking in that activation of PiCo is sufficient to elicit swallow and laryngeal activation, with the precise timing of each dependent on the phase of the respiratory cycle (swallowing in early PI, laryngeal activation in later I). Moreover, the sequence of events resulting from PiCo activation appear qualitatively similar to those events occuring during a more &quot;physiological&quot; swallow elicited by water administration into the oral cavity. The authors have included the necessary controls, as requested by the Reviewers.</p><p>In addition, the authors have further refined the anatomical boundaries of Pico using their intersectional transgenic strategy, showing that Glut/Cholinergic neurons that comprise PiCo are medial to the cholinergic neurons of the NA.</p><p>The authors should be congratulated for performing such a rigorous, technically-demanding set of experiments to show a critical function for PiCo in vivo in swallowing, laryngeal activation, and their coordination with inspiration. Their findings clearly show that PiCo is sufficient to elicit swallowing and reset the respiratory rhythm. They have expanded our knowledge regarding PiCo in these functions and have set the stage for future studies that will further delineate the mechanisms by which PiCo drives these behaviors. No study is perfect, this one included. There are obviously caveats that the other Reviewers have raised, but that have been acknowledged by the authors and, in my opinion, have been discussed sufficiently in the paper. An important extension of these findings is to demonstrate that PiCo is necessary for swallowing/larygneal function (and coordination with breathing) in a more natural, physiological setting (i.e. normal swallow of a bolus of water/food etc). What are the ramifications of optogenetic silencing of PiCo on normal swallowing?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that in this manuscript we have not discussed if PiCo is necessary for natural or physiological response. We have ongoing preliminary data in a disease model (Leigh Syndrome) in which increased inflammation and cell death of PiCo neurons results in swallow-breathing discoordination with water swallows occurring during inspiration instead of postinspiration. When this disease model is treated and the neuroinflammation is eliminated swallow-breathing coordination is restored and swallows occur during postinspiration. With this information we believe PiCo is active during the natural physiologic setting and is responsible for coordinating the proper timing for swallow to occur during postinspiration. We have further preliminary data of using DREADD techniques to silence NTS and find that when NTS is inactivated PiCo cannot trigger swallows. Since all of this work is preliminary it is not appropriate for this manuscript.</p><p>To address optogenetically silencing PiCo: While there is a Cre/FlpO AAV for archaerhodopsin we have found the archaerhodopsin to be technically challenging and not sufficient to silence neurons. We used e.g. the archaerhodopsin with Dbx1 neurons in the Huff et al. 2022 manuscript and found this to be the case. We believe a better technique is to use an inhibitory DREADD approach and there is not one currently for cre/FlpO. The Ramirez lab is working on a new AAV approach to knock out PiCo specific neurons however the technology is very novel, and based on a collaboration with another laboratory at the UW and not ready for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, as mentioned by other reviewers, the precise neural circuitry through which PiCo acts, and how it is integrated with the nTS and other regions needs to be more clearly defined. It seems as though the authors are working on these questions in a separate study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. The authors agree that looking at the connections between PiCo and NTS is the next step. We have some preliminary data and are in the process of writing a grant to investigate this very question (see above). We have added the following to the manuscript:” These differences are likely due to the fact that the PiCo-triggered swallows are missing the behavioral context of water-evoked swallows and do not activate the sensory component of the SPG to the same extent as the water-evoked swallows. There are known projections from NTS to PiCo (Oliveira et al., 2021) and connections between PiCo and preBötC (Anderson et al., 2016) giving reason to suggest PiCo acts as an interface between the SPG and preBötC.” We originally used the word “gate” to better describe the role of PiCo, but previous reviewers literally hated this description. Thus we opted to delete this word from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
