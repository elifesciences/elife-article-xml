emphasize the need for improved therapeutic strategies. The recent discovery of prevalent ESR1 mutations in relapsed tumors underscores a sustained reliance of advanced tumors on ERα signaling, and provides a strong rationale for continued targeting of ERα. Here we describe GDC-0810, a novel, non-steroidal, orally bioavailable selective ER downregulator (SERD), which was identified by prospectively optimizing ERα degradation, antagonism and pharmacokinetic properties. GDC-0810 induces a distinct ERα conformation, relative to that induced by currently approved therapeutics, suggesting a unique mechanism of action. GDC-0810 has robust in vitro and in vivo activity against a variety of human breast cancer cell lines and patient derived xenografts, including a tamoxifen-resistant model and those that harbor ERα mutations. GDC-0810 is currently being evaluated in Phase II clinical studies in women with ER+ breast cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15828.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15828.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>SERD</kwd><kwd>GDC-0810</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007208</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA68485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Luis</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Henry Charles</given-names></name><name><surname>Tantawy</surname><given-names>Mohammed Noor</given-names></name><name><surname>Arteaga</surname><given-names>Carlos L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000869</institution-id><institution>Susan G.

About 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), a hormone-regulated transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dunnwald et al., 2007</xref>). ERα-positive breast cancers typically respond well to therapy that attenuates ERα signaling, either by blocking the production of estrogens via aromatase inhibitors, or antagonizing the activity of estrogens through competitive binding of ER antagonists such as tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Puhalla et al., 2012</xref>). While estrogen disrupting therapies are often effective both in the adjuvant and metastatic setting, patients frequently relapse after prolonged therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowsett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Davies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mauri et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Though resistance to endocrine therapies frequently emerges, relapsed tumors remain dependent on ER, which is highlighted by patient responses to second and third line endocrine therapies after failure of an earlier line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mouridsen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lewis and Jordan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perey et al., 2007</xref>). ER signaling re-activation in the relapsed setting can occur due to changes in ligand sensitivity and specificity, for example, resistance to tamoxifen has been proposed to be a result of the selection of tumor cells that recognize the ER:tamoxifen complex as agonistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gottardis and Jordan, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McDonnell and Wardell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takimoto et al., 1999</xref>). More recently however, a series of mutations in the ligand binding domain of ERα have been found at a high prevalence (25–40%) in relapsed, metastatic patients, though are very rare in untreated populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jeselsohn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merenbakh-Lamin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toy et al., 2013</xref>). These mutations have been shown in overexpression experiments to confer estrogen-independent activity to the receptor, and to reduce the potency of, for example, tamoxifen. The continued dependence of breast cancer tumors on ERα provides a strong rationale to continue to target ER in both first line and relapsed/advanced settings.</p><p>Selective ER Downregulators (SERDs) are competitive ERα antagonists that also induce a conformational shift of the receptor that results in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of ERα, via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wijayaratne and McDonnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wijayaratne et al., 1999</xref>). The unique dual-function of SERDs (ER antagonism and depletion) may enable them to block ER signaling in cellular settings where other endocrine agents, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors have failed. Indeed, the clinical impact of fulvestrant as a treatment of recurrent, endocrine resistant disease, supports this notion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perey et al., 2007</xref>).Though fulvestrant has served as an important proof of concept for the SERD approach [see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis et al., 2015</xref>)], it is limited by its poor pharmaceutical properties, which necessitates administration by intramuscular injection and limits the applied dose, exposure, and receptor engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robertson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kruchten et al., 2015</xref>). The fulvestrant 500 mg regimen (500 mg on day 1, 14, 28; monthly thereafter) exhibited improvement in progression free survival and overall survival over the initially approved and marketed 250 mg regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Leo et al., 2010</xref>). The 500 mg regimen achieves higher plasma concentrations and a more rapid ascent to steady-state drug levels, which in turn is thought to result in superior modulation of ER signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kuter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>). However, the 500 mg dose does not fully saturate ER binding in patients, as inhibition of [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoroestradiol uptake was incomplete in 38% (6/16) of patients analyzed. Importantly, this lack of receptor occupancy was associated with lack of clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kruchten et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that SERDs have the potential to provide effective and well-tolerated therapy for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer, and highlight the need for the development of SERDs with optimized bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. Here we describe a novel, potent non-steroidal ER antagonist and degrader, GDC-0810, that is orally bioavailable and has strong anti-tumor activity in endocrine-sensitive and -resistant models of ER+ breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of GDC-0810, a novel SERD</title><p>With the goal of creating a next generation, orally bioavailable SERD, we prospectively optimized ERα degradation, antagonist activity, as well pharmacokinetic properties, starting with a triphenylalkene ER ligand scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). These efforts resulted in the identification of an indazole series of SERDs, including GDC-0810 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Compounds were assessed for their ability to modulate ERα protein levels in MCF7 breast cancer cells using a quantitative In-Cell Western (ICW) immunofluorescence assay, which enabled determination of compound potency and maximal activity in a high throughput format. GDC-0810 was prioritized for further characterization based on its ability to robustly reduce cellular ERα levels within 4 hr, to levels approaching that observed with fulvestrant, with sub-nanomolar potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4OH-tamoxifen), exhibited some activity in this assay, though it failed to reduce ERα signal to the level achieved by fulvestrant or GDC-0810. The ability of GDC-0810 to reduce steady-state levels of ERα was confirmed using a Western Blot assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We further demonstrated that GDC-0810-mediated ERα depletion is dependent on the 26S proteasome, since addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, fully blocked GDC-0810 depletion of ERα, similar to the effect of MG132 treatment in preventing fulvestrant-mediated ER turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15828.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GDC-0810 induces proteasome-dependent degradation of ERα and suppresses proliferation of MCF7 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) GDC-0810 structure.

To assess the ERα conformation induced by GDC-0810 relative to other SERMs and SERDs, we utilized a mammalian 2-hybrid based peptide interaction assay. This assay, run in the presence of saturating concentrations of ER ligands, differentiates ligand-induced ER conformations based on the ability of the ligand-bound receptor to interact with discriminatory peptide probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iannone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Norris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paige et al., 1999</xref>). We included in our analysis fulvestrant, 4OH-tamoxifen, a number of additional clinically approved ER ligands, such as bazedoxifene, and also GW7604. GW7604 is an active metabolite of GW5638, an ER ligand that entered Phase I clinical trials for breast cancer, but is not currently in further clinical development. Like GDC-0810, GW5638 is a non-steroidal dual function ER antagonist and degrader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Willson et al., 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1997</xref>).

GDC-0810 thus induces an ER conformational profile that is different from that induced by 4OH-tamoxifen, fulvestrant and other marketed SERMs and similar to GW7604 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the biological activity of ERα is determined by the conformation of the receptor and its ability to interact with other regulatory proteins, this result implies differences in the response of ERα to GDC-0810 and the clinically approved ERα therapeutics.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15828.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GDC-0810 promotes an ER confirmation distinct from 4OH-tamoxifen and fulvestrant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ERα conformational profiling.

Though 4OH-tamoxifen primarily antagonizes estrogen-dependent ER signaling in breast cancer cells, its partial agonistic activity has been revealed through gene expression profiling in the absence of estrogen, in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wardell et al., 2013</xref>). To assess the potential agonistic activity of GDC-0810 we evaluated the consequence of GDC-0810 treatment on a previously described SERM discriminatory gene set, likewise, in the absence of estrogen in MCF7 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wardell et al., 2013</xref>). In line with earlier observations, 4OH-tamoxifen induces a strong up-regulation of a gene set that includes the estrogen-responsive genes, <italic>AGR2</italic> and <italic>RASGRP</italic>, while fulvestrant fails to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). GDC-0810 most closely resembled fulvestrant and GW7604 in this analysis, displaying little of the transcriptional agonist activity observed with the SERMs 4OH-tamoxifen, lasofoxifene, arzoxifene or endoxifene and often demonstrating inverse agonist activity on estradiol responsive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings are consistent with ER-ChIP analysis demonstrating that GDC-0810 treatment, similar to fulvestrant, can reduce the levels of ERα associated with chromatin on ERα target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Wardell et al. have demonstrated that fulvestrant and bazedoxifene can inhibit ER signaling and estrogen-dependent proliferation in the absence of ER degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wardell et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013</xref>). This was demonstrated using an experimental system whereby ER was over-expressed in an attempt to saturate the degradation machinery, enabling an uncoupling of ER degradation from ER antagonism. Likewise, we sought to determine if GDC-0810 can inhibit ER signaling in the absence ER degradation, using a similar strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wardell et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2013</xref>). Over-expression of ER in doxycycline-inducible MCF7 cells resulted in the induction of the ER target gene, PR, consistent with ligand-independent activation of the pathway. Treating these cells with fulvestrant resulted in both depletion of ER, as well as suppression of PR. In the case of GDC-0810 treatment, PR was likewise suppressed, though ER levels remained high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cell viability assays demonstrated that both fulvestrant and GDC-0810 suppress proliferation of MCF7 cells over-expressing ER, with EC50s and IC50s similar to cells expressing endogenous levels of ER, despite the retention of high ER levels in the over-expressing cells treated with GDC-0810 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). These data imply that GDC-0810 has the ability to antagonize ER function independent from its degradation activity, consistent with the demonstration that GDC-0810 displaces the co-activator PGC1α in cell free biochemical assays, in which ER degradation does not occur (see below, Figure 6A).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>GDC-0810 displays mild estrogenic activity in uterine models in vitro and in vivo</title><p>Since the activity of ER ligands can be tissue/cell-type dependent, we next evaluated the effects of GDC-0810 in the uterus, first making use of the Ishikawa endometrial cell line, in which alkaline phosphatase expression is controlled by ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Holinka et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Littlefield et al., 1990</xref>). In line with previous reports, 4OH-tamoxifen robustly increases alkaline phosphatase activity, while fulvestrant shows no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). GDC-0810 modestly increases alkaline phosphatase activity, though plateaus at low concentrations, below the level stimulated by 4OH-tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To follow up on this observation we next assessed the consequences of GDC-0810 administration on the uterus of juvenile rats. Tamoxifen at 60 mg/kg, dosed orally, once a day for 3 days, increases uterine wet weight, though not to the extent driven by the administration of 0.1 mg/kg 17α estradiol over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, Fulvestrant at 50 mg/kg acts as an inverse agonist, resulting in a significant decrease in uterine weight relative to the control group. GDC-0810 dosed at 0.1 or 10 mg/kg did not significantly alter uterine wet relative to the vehicle control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly though, histological analysis and quantification of endometrial cell height showed that, like estradiol and tamoxifen, GDC-0810 induced a cuboidal to columnar morphological change in the epithelial cells, while the epithelia from fulvestrant-treated animals remained cuboidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). In line with the observed morphological changes to the endometrial epithelium, gene expression analysis demonstrated that GDC-0810 induces ER target genes, including C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These in vivo phenotypes were observed at a GDC-0810 dose of 0.1 mg/kg and were not significantly different at the 10 mg/kg dose, suggesting saturation of the effect at low doses. Together, these data demonstrate that GDC-0810 mildly stimulates ER signaling in the uterus, similar to the recently described SERD AZD9496 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weir et al., 2016</xref>).

To determine the ability of GDC-0810 to inhibit E2 stimulated tumor growth in vivo, we treated MCF7 tumor bearing nu/nu mice orthotopically implanted with 0.36 mg/60 day release E2 pellets (Innovative Research) with GDC-0810, ranging from 1 to 100 mg/kg/day p.o. Fulvestrant was delivered by sub-cutaneous injection, with an initial loading dose of 50 mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 8, and subsequent dosing of 25 mg/kg twice per week to achieve exposures similar to those achieved in the clinic. In the MCF7 xenograft model, GDC-0810 displayed dose dependent efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The 100 mg/kg/day dose caused tumor regressions; an effect similar to withdrawal of estrogen pellets at the start of dosing. In contrast, fulvestrant, at a clinically relevant dose as well as at a considerably higher dose (200 mg/kg, 3 times per week), yielded only modest tumor growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It is important to note that the restriction of the fulvestrant response to tumor growth inhibition, rather than stasis or tumor regression, was not a function of low exposure, as the plasma concentrations at the 200 mg/kg dose were on average 12–14 µg*hr/mL, approximately 30-fold above the clinical exposure of the fulvestrant 500 mg clinical regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pritchard et al., 2010</xref>).

To determine the ability of GDC-0810 to effectively bind tumor-localized ER in vivo, FES-PET imaging was performed on mice bearing MCF7 xenograft tumors following a 7-day treatment with GDC-0810. Prior to GDC-0810 administration FES-PET signal was detectable in both the vehicle and pre-treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). However, when assayed after the seventh consecutive oral daily dose, GDC-0810 at 10 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day reduced FES uptake by 45 and 63 percent respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). At study termination on day 9, the GDC-0810 treatment groups displayed a dose dependent decrease in tumor volume and in ERα and PR immunohistochemical staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). While the difference in reduction of FES uptake between the 10 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day treatment groups did not reach statistical significance, each dose resulted in a statistically lower FES uptake compared to that in vehicle-treated animals. This would suggest that maximal GDC-0810-mediated ER antagonism, as a result of receptor occupancy and/or degradation, is achieved with a dose of ≥10 and ≤100 mg/kg/day in this model system.</p><p>We next evaluated the activity of GDC-0810 in patient derived xenograft (PDX) model, HCI-003. Like MCF7, HCI-003 tumors are ER+, E2 dependent and tamoxifen sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). GDC-0810, dosed at 10 and 100 mg/kg/day in mice implanted with 1 mg E2 impregnated beeswax pellets, drove tumor stasis, while fulvestrant dosed at 30 times the clinical exposure induced tumor regression, approaching that observed in vehicle treated animals whose estradiol pellets were excised at start of the dosing period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Consistent with GDC-0810 SERD activity in vitro, tumors collected after 43 days of dosing displayed reduced ERα target gene transcription and reduced ERα protein levels, as monitored by quantitative PCR and Western Blot, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). GDC-0810 also displayed anti-tumor activity in ZR75-1, an additional ER+ breast cancer xenograft model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, GDC-0810 did not exhibit any anti-tumor activity in MDA-MB-231, an ER negative human breast cancer tumor model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Lack of efficacy in this ER-negative model is consistent with the GDC-0810 mechanism of action being selectively mediated through ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>GDC-0810 has anti-tumor activity in a tamoxifen-resistant MCF7 model</title><p>We previously generated a tamoxifen-resistant xenograft model, TamR1, by chronically treating MCF7 tumor bearing mice with tamoxifen until a resistant tumor emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2015</xref>).

Our earlier work showed that treatment with GDC-0810 p.o. at 100 mg/kg/day induced tumor regressions in this model, while fulvestrant SC at 200 mg/kg (3x/week) exhibited only modest tumor growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lai et al., 2015</xref>). These experiments were conducted in mice with relatively high levels of circulating estradiol, with estradiol being delivered via 0.72 mg 60 day release E2 pellets that are reported by the manufacturer (Innovative Research) to deliver between 300 and 400 pg/ml estradiol. Under these conditions the high E2 reduces the steady state ERα protein levels, thus confounding the readout of ERα protein as a pharmacodynamic endpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given this limitation of the 'high E2' models, the anti-tumor and pharmacodynamic response to GDC-0810 treatment was evaluated in the TamR1 model grown in mice implanted with pellets designed to release lower concentrations of estradiol (0.18 mg 60 day E2 pellets, reported to deliver 75–100 pg/mL estradiol).

Twenty-four clonal lines were generated and their mutant allele frequencies, at the DNA level, were evaluated using mutant-specific droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We selected 7 clones that contained the highest mutant allele frequency for further characterization. These clones were assessed for the expression of the mutant allele using ddPCR on cDNA, in cells grown in either standard media, or hormone-depleted charcoal stripped media. The mutant allele was expressed at ~33% of total mRNA, in all clones examined regardless of growth conditions. One of these clonal lines (clone 6) was selected for subsequent studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Despite expressing only 33% mutant RNA, ER.Y537S cells display a high level of estrogen-independent ER pathway activity, as demonstrated by high expression of the ER-target genes, TFF1, GREB1 and PGR, in the absence of estrogen, although these genes can be further stimulated with the addition of estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We then performed cell viability experiments, assessing the anti-proliferative activity of GDC-0810 in ER.WT and ER.Y537S cells. When the viability assay is conducted in the absence of E2, GDC-0810 displays a marked reduction in potency in the mutant versus wild-type setting, with 22 fold higher concentration being required to achieve 50% maximal inhibition of growth in the ER.Y537S versus ER.WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, solid black line vs. solid blue line). In the presence of low E2 concentration (0.1 nM), this potency shift is less apparent, with only four fold increased compound concentration being required to achieve the same growth inhibition as in the ER.WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, dashed black line vs. dashed blue line). The patterns are similar in the case of fulvestrant, with greater potency shifts occurring in the absence of estrogen versus the presence of estrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The potency of 4OH-tamoxifen is marginally shifted in ER.Y537S cells relative to ER.WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The observed potency-shift for GDC-0810 in mutant cells in not restricted to clone 6, as this phenotype was seen in an additional 6 clones that were evaluated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the ability of GDC-0810 to reduce ER levels in ER.WT versus ER.Y537S cells, in the presence and absence of estrogen. Consistent with previous reports, estrogen itself reduces steady-state levels of ER, while simultaneously increasing PR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, lane 1 vs. lane 7). GDC-0810 reduces steady-state levels of ER protein, in both ER.WT and ER.Y537S cells, demonstrating that the presence of ER.Y537S does not preclude GDC-0810-mediated ER-degradation, though due to a mixed population of ER.WT and ER.Y537S we cannot directly determine if GDC-0810 induced degradation of ER.Y537S is any more or less efficient than that of ER.WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The presence of ER.Y537S elevates PR protein levels in the absence of estrogen, consistent with the gene expression data, and this is further induced with the addition of estrogen. The absolute levels of PR achieved in mutant expressing cells are elevated compared to the levels seen in estrogen-treated wild-type ER cells, though this may be a feature of less than saturating/low E2 concentration. GDC-0810 reduces both estrogen-driven, and mutant-driven PR protein levels, athough residual PR is still detected in the mutant cells at 24 hr post compound addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Like PR, cyclin D1 levels are increased by both estrogen stimulation and by the presence of the ER.Y537S mutation; in both cases treatment with GDC-0810 blocks this increase, with cyclin D1 levels being comparable to un-stimulated cells. In contrast to the robust ER-depletion mediated by GDC-0810 and fulvestrant, tamoxifen does not deplete ER in either ER.WT or ER.Y537S cells, and robustly stabilizes ER in the presence of estrogen, in a dose dependent manner, while simultaneously decreasing levels of PR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,H</xref>). These data highlight the different consequences of the SERDs versus tamoxifen on ER levels, but demonstrate that GDC-0810, fulvestrant, and 4OH-tamoxifen are all mechanistically, and in principle, capable of suppressing ER signaling driven by the expression of ER.Y537S in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F,H</xref>).</p><p>As an additional ER mutant knock-in model, AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated homologous recombination was used to introduce the ER.D538G mutation into T47D cells, such that the mutation would be expressed under the endogenous promoter. T47D ER.D538G cells, expressing WT:D538G mRNA at a 1:1 ratio (data not shown) express endogenous levels of total ER, though very high levels of PR relative to WT cells, even in the absence of estrogen, implying robust estrogen-independent pathway activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Stimulation with estrogen results in depletion of ER in WT and D538G cells, as expected, though does not further induce PR in the mutant cells. In cell viability assays, GDC-0810 suppresses the proliferation of both ER.WT cells and ER.D538G cells, with modest differences in potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We next fluorescently labeled the T47D ER.WT (with RFP) and ER.D538G cells (with GFP) and performed cell-cell competition assays, to further evaluate the conditions under which ER mutant cells have a competitive growth advantage relative to wild-type cells, and the effect of mutant ERα on response to GDC-0810. When mixed at a 1:1 ratio at day 0, and grown in the absence of estrogen, ER.D538G cells robustly outcompete ER.WT cells, with WT cells representing only 7.8% (± 1%) of the total population on day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). In the presence of 0.1 nM estrogen however, much of this competitive advantage is lost, with WT cells representing 40% ± 0.2% of the total population at day 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). GDC-0810 attenuates both the estrogen-dependent growth of ER.WT cells, as well as estrogen-independent growth of the ER.D538G cells, though both cell types continue to proliferate at low levels in the presence of drug. In the case of the ER.WT cells, this rate of proliferation is equivalent to cells grown in the absence of estrogen, suggesting that ER-independent mechanisms may support low-level proliferation in these cells. These cell labeling/cell competition experiments further indicate that ER mutant cells do not confer a non-cell autonomous growth signal to ER.WT cells grown in the absence of estrogen, since ER.WT cells grow at the same rate, regardless of whether they are grown alone, or co-cultured with estrogen-independent ER.D538G cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15828.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>GDC-0810 exhibits activity in T47D ER.D538G knock-in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of T47D ER.WT and ER.D538G cells in the presence and absence of estrogen.

Therefore, GDC-0810 was tested in a xenograft derived from MCF7 cells overexpressing amino-terminal HA-tagged ER.Y537S (HA-ER.Y537S), which formed rapidly growing tumors in ovariectomized mice without estradiol supplementation. Strikingly, GDC-0810 100 mg/kg/day p.o. induced tumor regressions in the HA-ER.Y537S overexpressing model, while tamoxifen 60 mg/kg/day p.o. and fulvestrant 200 mg/kg SC (3x/week) resulted in tumor stasis at exposures higher than those achieved in clinic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). As an additional in vivo ER mutant model, we utilized WHIM20, an ER.Y537S-expressing patient derived xenograft model (PDX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2013</xref>). WHIM20 is heterozygous for the Y537S mutation, though the mutant allele represents close to 100% of the ESR1 transcript produced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A pharmacodynamic (PD) experiment showed that GDC-0810, dosed orally at 100 mg/kg, and fulvestrant dosed intramuscularly at the high dose of 200 mg/kg for 4 days, both modulate a collection of known ER regulated targets, including robust suppression of RASGRP1 and AREG, as examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Western blot analysis, quantitative reverse phase protein array (RPPA) and IHC of ER and PR, in the same 4-day PD experiment, demonstrated that GDC-0810 and fulvestrant treatment resulted in modest decreases in ER and PR protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,D</xref>). Importantly, in a separate efficacy study, GDC-0810 100 mg/kg/day treatment and tamoxifen 60 mg/kg/day induced tumor stasis, while fulvestrant at at a dose that roughly achieves plasma levels similar to those achieved with the 500-mg dose in humans (50 mg/kg days 1, 3 and 7, 25 mg/kg weekly thereafter; 0.015 mg/mL at trough on day 21, AUC ~0.36 μg*hr/mL) did not induce regression but resulted in tumor growth inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15828.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>GDC-0810 antagonizes estrogen-independent ER.Y537S-expressing tumors in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MCF7 HA-ER.Y537S overexpressing tumors were implanted in animals without supplemental 17β-estradiol pellets.

However, pre-clinical and clinical data indicate that fulvestrant's therapeutic action is limited by its poor pharmaceutical properties. GDC-0810 is a product of efforts to capitalize on the advantages associated with the SERD approach, while overcoming the limitations associated with fulvestrant. GDC-0810 is a non-steroidal, orally bioavailable dual function ER antagonist and down-regulator that induces potent, rapid proteasome-mediated ERα degradation in breast cancer cells. GDC-0810 binds ERα with low nanomolar potency, exhibits good oral bioavailability, and dose-dependent/linear pharmacokinetics in the mouse. When administered orally, once daily, at doses that deliver substantial plasma concentrations and are well-tolerated, GDC-0810 displays robust anti-tumor activity in cell line-based and patient derived xenograft models of breast cancer.</p><p>Though GDC-0810 clearly shares features with fulvestrant, such as the ability to down-regulate ER protein levels in breast cancer cells, the GDC-0810:ER complex interacts with a set of peptides that are distinct from those that interact with the fulvestrant:ER complex, suggesting that these compounds promote distinct ER conformations, and may therefore have a different mechanism by which they induce ER turnover. The observations that 1) saturation of the GDC-0810 and the fulvestrant ER degradation machinery occur differentially in our doxycycline-inducible ER-over-expressing MCF7 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and 2) that fulvestrant, but not GDC-0810, drives degradation of ER in the rat uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,F</xref>), further supports the notion that these compounds have distinct mechanisms by which they induce ER degradation, and potentially require differing co-factors or distinct sets of E3 ligases. The observation that activation of the ER pathway occurs concomitantly with lack of robust ER degradation upon GDC-0810 treatment in the rat uterus suggests that although ER degradation is not absolutely required for direct ER antagonism, it may be associated with preventing ER agonism, at least in this context.</p><p>The behavior of GDC-0810 in the conformational profiling assay is itself intriguing; specifically the robust recruitment of the GW5P2 and 47P3 peptides to the ER:GDC-0810 complex, which are not recruited by any of the already marketed SERM/SERD:ER complexes. GW5P2 was experimentally derived from efforts to identify unique, selective conformation-sensing peptides using a random 10-residue peptide phage display library in the presence of GW5638 or its metabolite GW7604 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iannone et al., 2004</xref>). 47P3 was subsequently generated as an attempt to make a second generation, higher affinity, more specific peptide for the GW7604:ER complex. Notably, the binding of the GW5P2 and 47P3 peptides to various ER:ligand complexes was highly correlated with the presence of an acrylic or carboxylic acid head group in ligand structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iannone et al., 2004</xref>). The binding of GW5P2 and 47P3 to the ER:GDC-0810 complex thus likely reflects the presence of this acrylic acid side chain in GDC-0810. It was speculated that these selective peptides may be affinity-optimized versions of naturally occurring co-repressor peptides which are yet to be discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Iannone et al., 2004</xref>). Future identification of such co-repressors may provide a foothold in our efforts to understand the molecular mechanism by which GDC-0810 antagonizes ER function.</p><p>FES-PET imaging, which we used as a real-time pharmacodynamic biomarker in the MCF7 xenograft model, has previously been used to monitor the activity of endocrine agents in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Linden et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2006</xref>). A recent analysis demonstrated that reductions in FES-PET signal following fulvestrant treatment were both highly variable and incomplete (&lt;75% reduction in SUV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kruchten et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of robust inhibition of FES-PET signal was associated with lack of clinical benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Kruchten et al., 2015</xref>). FES-PET imaging is likewise being utilized in clinical studies of GDC-0810. In the Phase I dose escalation study in postmenopausal women with ER+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01823835), complete/near complete (&gt;90%) suppression of FES uptake was reported to be observed in 90% of patients with FES-PET scans, including 5 patients with known ESR1 mutations, providing early clinical evidence of robust ER engagement by GDC-0810 [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickler M, 2015</xref>), and manuscript in preparation]. Since FES-PET signal does not distinguish competitive antagonism from ER depletion; a thorough molecular evaluation of pre- and post- treatment biopsies will be required to better understand how ER antagonism coupled with degradation impacts ER signaling and ultimately clinical response.</p><p>The landmark discoveries of highly prevalent, recurrent ESR1 mutations in patients that have failed multiple lines of endocrine therapy highlights the sustained reliance of ER+ breast cancer on ER function, and further emphasizes the need for next generation ER-targeted therapeutics. We generated ER.Y537S and ER.D538G knock-in mutant cell lines to model the two most commonly occurring clinical mutations. Despite expressing 50% or less of the mutant allele, these cells display robust estrogen-independent ER signaling and estrogen-independent cell proliferation. Cell competition assays further highlight that much of the competitive advantage of the mutant cells occurs in the absence of estrogen, mimicking AI-treatment, and that this competitive advantage is lost both in the presence of estrogen and in the presence of GDC-0810. These data are consistent with recent retrospective clinical studies showing that ESR1 mutations in plasma DNA predict relative resistance to AIs but not to fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fribbens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schiavon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spoerke et al., 2016</xref>). In patients, these mutations were frequently sub-clonal, and the question was raised as to whether estrogen-independent ER mutant cells might confer estrogen-independence to neighboring ER wild-type cells. Based on our observations from the T47D model, this appears not to be the case, as ER.WT cells exhibit the same growth rate, regardless of whether they are co-cultured with ER.D538G-expressing cells or grown alone.</p><p>GDC-0810 maintains its ability to induce ER degradation, to suppress ER signaling, and to inhibit proliferation in cell lines that express mutant ER, though a higher drug concentration is needed. Structural studies and molecular dynamics simulations of ER mutants have demonstrated that the Y537S and D538G substitutions shift ER, and particularly helix 12 (H12), into a conformation that resembles an active/liganded ER wild-type conformation, providing a molecular explanation for the constitutive activity of these mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nettles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Toy et al., 2013</xref>). A recent biophysical analysis of these mutants has provided an important extension of those findings, demonstrating that this 'pre-organized agonist state' restricts access to the ligand binding domain, which influences binding of both estrogen and tamoxifen, and presumably other ligands, including GDC-0810, which is consistent with what we show here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fanning et al., 2016</xref>). Fanning et al. further demonstrate that tamoxifen fails to fully restore H12 as well as the H11-12 loop back to the wild-type antagonist state, providing a further explanation for reduced tamoxifen potency in the mutant context. They hypothesize that highly potent, next generation SERDs, including GDC-0810, may have an increased ability to destabilize H12 and thereby drive efficacy in the ER mutant setting. Our observations that despite the somewhat reduced potency in vitro, GDC-0810 displays robust activity in mutant models in vivo, are in line with this hypothesis, although we acknowledge that tamoxifen likewise exhibits robust in vivo efficacy in the WHIM20 ER.Y537S model. The data demonstrating in vivo activity for GDC-0810 in ER mutant models is consistent with: 1) the in vivo exposures of GDC-0810 being sufficient to overcome the potency shifts caused by ER.Y537S in vitro, and 2) the level of ER pathway suppression driven by GDC-0810 in the mutant context being sufficient for in vivo anti-tumor activity. How these pre-clinical studies will relate to clinical observations is an ongoing question; the activity of GDC-0810 in ER mutant versus wild-type patients is being carefully monitored in clinical studies.</p><p>The clinical activity of fulvestrant supports ER degradation as a desirable feature of ER therapeutics targeting ER+ breast cancer. However, the question still remains as to how much advantage SERDs will have relative to ER ligands that function as potent antagonists in the absence of ER degradation. Indeed, our data shows that despite differences in activity in vitro, tamoxifen, like GDC-0810 is efficacious in ER.WT and mutant models in vivo, and it could be argued that the superior activity of GDC-0810 could in some cases be due to its potent antagonistic effects coupled together with good bioavailability and PK properties, rather than its ability to lower ER protein levels. Along these lines, we show that GDC-0810’s ER degradation activity can be uncoupled from its antagonistic activity in MCF7 cells. A recent study likewise highlighted the activity of bazedoxifene, a SERD/SERM hybrid that displays only modest ER degradation activity relative to fulvestrant and GDC-0810, as having robust efficacy against ER.WT and mutant models both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wardell et al., 2015</xref>). It stands to reason that in many cases, antagonism of the ER signaling pathway should be sufficient to drive anti-tumor activity. We argue that the benefit of SERDs vs. non-degrader antagonists will be most apparent in those contexts where ER becomes reactivated in the presence of drug, such as is observed in the TamR1 xenograft, in which tamoxifen behaves as a strong agonist. Since the relatively limited number of pre-clinical in vivo models fails to recapitulate the multiple potential mechanisms of ER-dependent resistance, nor the profound heterogeneity that exists across ER+ breast cancer patients, we feel that this is a question that will ultimately be addressed in the clinic, as we gain additional experience with GDC-0810 and other SERDs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and reagents</title><p>MCF7 (ATCC), T47D (ATCC), ZR-75-1 (ATCC) cells were maintained in RPMI 1640.

In cases where data is unavailable or cell line ancestry is questionable, DNA or cell lines are re-purchased to perform profiling to confirm cell line ancestry.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>SNPs analyzed</title><p>rs11746396, rs16928965, rs2172614, rs10050093, rs10828176, rs16888998, rs16999576, rs1912640, rs2355988, rs3125842, rs10018359, rs10410468, rs10834627, rs11083145, rs11100847, rs11638893, rs12537, rs1956898, rs2069492, rs10740186, rs12486048, rs13032222, rs1635191, rs17174920, rs2590442, rs2714679, rs2928432, rs2999156, rs10461909, rs11180435, rs1784232, rs3783412, rs10885378, rs1726254, rs2391691, rs3739422, rs10108245, rs1425916, rs1325922, rs1709795, rs1934395, rs2280916, rs2563263, rs10755578, rs1529192, rs2927899, rs2848745, rs10977980</p><sec id="s17"><title>Mycoplasma testing</title><p>All stocks are tested for mycoplasma prior to and after cells are cryopreserved.

The donor vector, containing the mutation of interest in the 3’ homology arm, and the gRNA, designed to cleave upstream of exon 10, along with Cas9 expression vector, were transfected into MCF7 cells. Pools of MCF7 cells in which donor DNA had been incorporated were obtained after positive (puromycin) and counter (ganciclovir) selection. Clones derived from single cells were then subject to PCR and Sanger sequencing, and subsequently to ddPCR to determine the allelic frequencies. Positive clones were infected with Ad-CMV-iCre to excise the selection cassette, which was followed by GFP-negative cell sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>HA-ER.Y537S stable over-expressing MCF7 cells</title><p>This cell line was generated by sub-cloning ESR1 wild-type and mutant cDNAs containing an amino terminal hemagglutinin tag into pCDH-EF1-MCS-(PGK-Puro) (System Biosciences).

Tumor fragments or cell suspensions were implanted subcutaneously on the right flank. Specific experimental and treatment paradigms are listed in the Supplemental information. Tumors were measured in two dimensions twice weekly. Volume in mm<sup>3</sup> was calculated by the formula: volume = length × (width<sup>2</sup>)/2. When tumors reached an average size of roughly 150 – 350 mm<sup>3</sup>, animals were randomized into groups and treatment was started. Animals were sacrificed after the final dose and tumors were excised, cut into approximately 30 mg fragments and flash frozen for pharmacodynamic analysis. Additional tumor fragments for immunohistochemistry were placed in 10% Neutral Buffered Formalin for 24 hr, and transferred to 70% ethanol until processing. 5 µm sections were labeled for ERα (Abcam#16660) or Ki67 (Abcam#16667) and stained with HRP/DAB detection kit (Abcam #64261).

Their strategy is based on first identifying compounds that work as estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) that were then studied further in a variety of ways to examine their efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. There is a clear need for such drugs, since currently used agents that also degrade ER (Fulvestrant) have poor pharmacokinetic properties and must be given to breast cancer patients by intramuscular injection, a route that is painful and probably still gives an insufficient exposure of the tumors to the drug.</p><p>Major Revisions Requested:</p><p>1) Analyze and discuss more incisively the relationship between ER SERD and ER antagonist activity, including how in vitro results relate-or stand in contrast-to in vivo outcomes. GDC-0810 is likely to have activity in several contexts of hormone-resistance where ER dependence is retained. Work by other investigators using other SERDs and ER antagonists in these types of resistance models should be cited and discussed (Wardell, Ellis et al. 2015 in Clinical Cancer Research; Couillard et al. 1998 in Cancer Research). In particular, Discussion should address in some detail the Wardell paper as well as previous work by those authors (Wardell et al. 2013 Clinical Cancer Research, Wardell et al. 2011 Biochemical Pharmacology) regarding the question of whether degradation of ER by GDC-0810 is necessary for the drug's antitumor effects.</p><p>2) Provide a conclusion in which the factors of SERD and antagonist efficacy and potency, as well as PK, oral activity and accessible dosing are presented in a balanced way. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, a distinction is made between GDC-0810 and Tamoxifen-like compounds on the basis of GDC-0810 inducing a different conformation and causing ER degradation, but then, in vivo, there is little difference between Tamoxifen and GDC-0810 in several xenografts (3A, 3C, 3D, 6B). It would be valuable if you could show a context (e.g., resistance due to Y537S) where the degradation matters in vivo. If not, you could simply conclude that at this point there is no correlation between ER degradation and in vivo activity, and that in vivo efficacy represents mainly potency of antagonism and improved PK.</p><p>3) Provide more discussion of mechanistic differences. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, 14 conformation selective peptides are studied with GDC-0810 and other SERM/SERD ER ligands. The findings nicely show that GDC-0810 induces a distinct conformation in wild type ERa, especially involving three of these peptides (GW5P2, 47P3, BN2). A more complete discussion of these intriguing results is needed:</p><p>A) Are these results dose-related and are they reproducible (unclear if there were biological or technical replicates) and are they confirmed by other assays?</p><p>B) Which conformation selective peptides (as representative of coregulators and other factors) were actually studied, and which showed changes or no changes in their interaction with wild type ER and GDC, vs. wild type ER and Fulvestrant, vs. wild type ER with E2? (This should be presented in a table in the manuscript or as a supplementary table.)</p><p>C) Can anything be learned from the three specific peptides (GW5P2, 47P3, BN2) whose interactions appear unique to GDC-0810 regarding the ultimate efficacy of GDC?</p><p>D) Peptide interaction studies with mutant ER Y537S or D538G vs. wt ER could be very informative.</p><p>E) Finally, it would be nice (though not absolutely required if strong responses can be made to the foregoing issues) to confirm these findings in cell lines with the appropriate coregulator proteins, and to test whether such unique interaction is necessary for GDC-0810 action as this would change the entire manuscript from being a largely descriptive study to one that includes a truly novel mechanistic observation.</p><p>Other Items Needing Addition or Correction:</p><p>4) The authors find that inhibition of the ER mutants requires significantly higher doses of GDC-0810 similar to what has been found for other ER ligands and shown by Fanning et al. to be the result of differences in affinity. What is the affinity of GDC-0810 for WT and mutant ERs?</p><p>5) Most of the studies of the ER mutants employ a single clone of MCF7 engineered using CRISPR to express the mutation. Is this clone representative of the entire population or multiple other clones? T47D cell engineered to express the mutation are not characterized in detail. Do these behave similarly to the MCF7 clones?</p><p>6) Abstract implies several points of 'novelty' that are of unclear significance. That GDC-0810 is the first orally bioavailable SERD in Phase 2 relies on a somewhat blurry definition of SERM vs. SERD vs. SERM/SERD. Does this represent a major distinction in expected antitumor activity from EM800 or bazedoxifene?</p><p>7) In several sections, attention to dose-dependence of biologic effects (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>) is not made, making it hard to interpret.</p><p>8) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> should include Fulvestrant as direct comparison.</p><p>9) Related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, it would be worth mentioning whether GDC-0810 is agonistic in other tissues such as uterus or bone.</p><p>10) Is the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> generated in the absence of presence of E2? The authors should include a dose response curve of GDC-0810 in the absence of E2. This should clearly be shown. The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> are not conclusive – it seems that GDC-0810 has some agonist activity at low doses (?). It can't be compared to Fulvestrant since that data looks inconsistent at low doses. This experiment should be repeated.</p><p>11) For in vivo treatment (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and Figure 3—figure supplement 1B), it is assumed that the GDC-0810 treatment is given in the presence of E2 (it is described in more detail later in the manuscript). This should be more clearly indicated in both the figure and the legend.</p><p>12) It is not clear why the investigators choose to study interaction of the ESR1 mutant with PGCalpha (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which is a less well described co-activator in the context of ER and its mutants. Why didn't they test SRC1, SRC3 or other better-described co-activator interaction? (Or is the rationale for this experiment linked to data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>? If that is the case, it should be stated).</p><p>13) It would be worth evaluating mutant and WT expression at the end of study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> to evaluate transgene expression (mRNA) and degradation.</p><p>14) It is unclear when biological or technical replicates of experiments have been done. This should be more clearly stated (and possibly performed if not in some circumstances). Some figures lack statistical analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>15) IC50s for GDC-0810 and Fulvestrant for WT and mutant cells should be given.</p><p>16) What are PR levels in the ESR1 mutant tumor -/+ GDC-0810 treatment?</p><p>17) Wardell et al., 2013 reference should be completed.</p><p>18) The Methods are quite well written and thorough; however, it would be helpful if figure legends stated the number of days after cell injection or tumor fragment implantation that treatment with ligands was begun.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15828.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Comments regarding the work on mechanisms focused on two points: First, there is an incomplete analysis of some of the results, which presumably could be readily improved.

We have made significant investments in addressing the relationship between ER degradation and antagonist activity, including experimentally, by removing some data to de-emphasize some points, and by better placing our data and discussion in context of what has been previously reported. We demonstrate, using additional experimental data, that GDC-0810’s ability to suppress ER signaling can be uncoupled from its ability to deplete ER, and acknowledge here, and in the Discussion that its potent ER antagonism coupled with good PK and bioavailability are likely all major contributing factors to robust in vivo efficacy, potentially independent of degradation. We also note though, in the context of newly included uterus data, that ER degradation may be associated with preventing ER agonism, which may be more relevant for long-term/acquired resistance in vivo.

Work by other investigators using other SERDs and ER antagonists in these types of resistance models should be cited and discussed (Wardell, Ellis et al. 2015 in Clinical Cancer Research; Couillard et al. 1998 in Cancer Research). In particular, Discussion should address in some detail the Wardell paper as well as previous work by those authors (Wardell et al. 2013 Clinical Cancer Research, Wardell et al. 2011 Biochemical Pharmacology) regarding the question of whether degradation of ER by GDC-0810 is necessary for the drug's antitumor effects.</italic></p><p>We have used the “ER over-expression strategy” described by Wardell et al. (2013) Clinical Cancer Research and Wardell et al. (2011) Biochemical Pharmacology in order to test whether degradation of ER by GDC-0810 is necessary for the drug’s antagonistic properties in vitro. These data are provided as new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D, E</xref>, and are described and discussed in the last paragraph of subsection “GDC-0810 induces a distinct ERα conformation versus tamoxifen and other ER therapeutics, and does not exhibit tamoxifen-like ER agonism in MCF7 cells”, and in the second and last paragraphs of the Discussion. We find, similar to what had previously been reported for fulvestrant and bazedoxifene, that the depletion of ER is neither required for the ability of GDC-0810 to suppress the expression of PR, as a read-out for ER pathway activity, nor for its ability to suppress the proliferation of MCF7 cells. This is entirely consistent with the demonstration that GDC-0810 acts directly as an ER antagonist, by outcompeting E2 and changing the ER conformation such that the PGC1α co-activator, for example, is displaced, in cell free assays where degradation does not occur. We note here that while over-expression of ER had previously been seen to block ER degradation mediated by fulvestrant, in our experiment fulvestrant retained its degradation activity. We speculate that the overexpression of ER in our doxycycline-inducible cells may not be as high as what was reported previously – though these levels are sufficient to prevent GDC-0810’s ability to deplete ER, consistent with distinct mechanisms of degradation driven by fulvestrant versus GDC-0810.</p><p><italic>2) Provide a conclusion in which the factors of SERD and antagonist efficacy and potency, as well as PK, oral activity and accessible dosing are presented in a balanced way. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"/>, a distinction is made between GDC-0810 and Tamoxifen-like compounds on the basis of GDC-0810 inducing a different conformation and causing ER degradation, but then, in vivo, there is little difference between Tamoxifen and GDC-0810 in several xenografts (3A, 3C, 3D, 6B). It would be valuable if you could show a context (e.g., resistance due to Y537S) where the degradation matters in vivo. If not, you could simply conclude that at this point there is no correlation between ER degradation and in vivo activity, and that in vivo efficacy represents mainly potency of antagonism and improved PK.</italic></p><p>We acknowledge, and agree with the reviewers’ point that despite clear mechanistic differences in vitro, GDC-0810 and tamoxifen both exhibit anti-tumor activity in most of our pre-clinical models in vivo, which supports the idea that in these cases, in vivo efficacy represents mainly potency of antagonism and good drug-like properties. We propose that the advantage of the SERD approach will be most clearly highlighted in cases that represent re-activation of ER signaling in the presence of therapeutics, illustrated by the TamR1 model for example. It has been argued that clinically, ER-dependent resistance mechanisms to both AI’s and SERMs account for a high fraction of resistant and relapsing disease. Unfortunately, our pre-clinical models do not represent this scenario, and are far from representative of the enormous heterogeneity of ER-dependent resistance mechanisms likely to be found in the clinic. We argue that truly understanding whether the SERD approach will drive meaningful benefit over what can be achieved with antagonist/tamoxifen-like approaches will be unveiled only through rigorous clinical testing in that heterogeneous population. Recent clinical trial results indicate that fulvestrant is superior to aromatase inhibitor (FALCON) and prior trials indicate that aromatase inhibitors and equal to or superior to tamoxifen. Since these points provide important context for this manuscript we have now tried to be considerably more direct, clear and balanced in this respect, in particular in our revised Discussion (last paragraph).</p><p><italic>3) Provide more discussion of mechanistic differences. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, 14 conformation selective peptides are studied with GDC-0810 and other SERM/SERD ER ligands. The findings nicely show that GDC-0810 induces a distinct conformation in wild type ERa, especially involving three of these peptides (GW5P2, 47P3, BN2). A more complete discussion of these intriguing results is needed:</italic> </p><p>We have provided additional data, details, as well as a more complete discussion of our findings related to the conformational profiling assay, as requested, see subsection “GDC-0810 induces a distinct ERα conformation versus tamoxifen and other ER therapeutics, and does not exhibit tamoxifen-like ER agonism in MCF7 cells” and the third paragraph of the Discussion. Specific points raised by the reviewers are addressed below:</p><p><italic>A) Are these results dose-related and are they reproducible (unclear if there were biological or technical replicates) and are they confirmed by other assays?</italic> </p><p>Since the goal of the experiment was to evaluate potential differences in ER conformation induced by various ligands, and each of the ligands has a different binding affinity for ER, we used a single, saturating dose of ligand (1μM), to neutralize those differences in binding; these findings are therefore unlikely to be dose-related. We have added this information to the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, to the description in the Results in the subsection “GDC-0810 induces a distinct ERα conformation versus tamoxifen and other ER therapeutics, and does not exhibit tamoxifen-like ER agonism in MCF7 cells”, and to the supplementary methods subsection “ERα Conformational Profiling Assay”. This approach is in keeping with how similar conformational profiling assays have been used both historically (Iannone et al., 2004; Norris et al., 1999) and more recently (Wardell et al., 2013). Data provided for these experiments are from biological triplicates and is now specified in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>B) Which conformation selective peptides (as representative of coregulators and other factors) were actually studied, and which showed changes or no changes in their interaction with wild type ER and GDC, vs. wild type ER and Fulvestrant, vs. wild type ER with E2? (This should be presented in a table in the manuscript or as a supplementary table.)</italic> </p><p>The data provided shows all peptides and drug-induced ER interactions that we studied using this approach, all in the context of wild-type ER. The only other co-regulator interaction that was studied in the context of GDC-0810 is PGC1α, and that data is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>,though this is a different assay format and question that is being addressed. The majority of these peptides was derived from phage display approaches, and are not representative of naturally-occurring co-regulators or other factors (see also below).</p><p><italic>C) Can anything be learned from the three specific peptides (GW5P2, 47P3, BN2) whose interactions appear unique to GDC-0810 regarding the ultimate efficacy of GDC?</italic> </p><p>We completely agree that the very robust interaction of the GDC-0810:ER complex with peptides GW5P2, 47P3, BN2 is very intriguing. We have provided additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> demonstrating that these same peptides robustly interact with the GW7604:ER complex. Peptides GW5P2 and 47P3 were experimentally derived though phage display, as peptides that would specifically interact with this complex. It was reported that the presence of a carboxylic or acrylic acid in the head group of a large panel of ER ligands correlated with the recruitment of these peptides to ER. Recruitment of these same peptides to the GDC-0810:ER complex therefore likely reflects the presence of an acrylic acid in GDC-0810. We now provide these details, and further elaborate in our revised Discussion (third paragraph).</p><p><italic>D) Peptide interaction studies with mutant ER Y537S or D538G vs. wt ER could be very informative.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this would be an interesting experiment, though would be more suited to a manuscript in which the main focus is the biology of mutant ER, rather than this manuscript in which we are aiming to focus on characterization of GDC-0810. We have, where possible, tried to contribute to this important discussion by generating and characterizing 2 distinct ER knock in mutant models. Indeed, we believe that such knock-in cell lines are the first to be described for the ESR1 mutations and as such are a meaningful contribution to the community.</p><p><italic>E) Finally, it would be nice (though not absolutely required if strong responses can be made to the foregoing issues) to confirm these findings in cell lines with the appropriate coregulator proteins, and to test whether such unique interaction is necessary for GDC-0810 action as this would change the entire manuscript from being a largely descriptive study to one that includes a truly novel mechanistic observation.</italic></p><p>We would love to be able to probe the functional relevance of these peptide interactions in order to gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of GDC-0810, as the reviewers suggest. Unfortunately, these peptides are not derived from naturally occurring proteins (see also above), which we could experimentally manipulate. We plan to pursue proteomics approaches to try and identify endogenous members of the ER:GDC-0810 complex, but feel that such data would be beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Other Items Needing Addition or Correction:</italic> </p><p><italic>4) The authors find that inhibition of the ER mutants requires significantly higher doses of GDC-0810 similar to what has been found for other ER ligands and shown by Fanning et al. to be the result of differences in affinity.

We see similar trends as in the MCF7 ER.Y537S clones in terms of estrogen-independent pathway activity and a potency shift for GDC-0810 in proliferation assays.</p><p><italic>6) Abstract implies several points of 'novelty' that are of unclear significance. That GDC-0810 is the first orally bioavailable SERD in Phase 2 relies on a somewhat blurry definition of SERM vs. SERD vs. SERM/SERD.

The rationale for selecting a single fixed dose for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> is described above. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, we likewise selected a single high dose, across a number of genes, with a collection of positive controls in an attempt to screen for agonistic activity of GDC-0810 in MCF7 cells. It seems that at least 1 reviewer is particularly interested in whether we see any agonistic activity for GDC-0810 at low concentrations (see also point 10 below) perhaps triggered by the observation that some ER ligands can exert a biphasic response on ER signaling. We have therefore included additional data here, showing results from a gene expression analysis (Taqman) as a dose response curve. Unlike what we find for 4OH-tamoxifen, we do not observe evidence of agonism triggered by GDC-0810 in MCF7 cells, regardless of concentration or presence versus absence of E2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>).
