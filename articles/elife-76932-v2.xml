transition is not well understood. Prior studies have also suggested that skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) localize to the surrounding periosteum and serve as a major source of marrow-associated SSPCs, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes during skeletal development. To further understand the cell transition process by which hypertrophic chondrocytes contribute to osteoblasts or other marrow associated cells, we utilized inducible and constitutive hypertrophic chondrocyte lineage tracing and reporter mouse models (<italic>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> and <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic>) in combination with a <italic>PDGFRa<sup>H2B-GFP</sup></italic> transgenic line, single-cell RNA-sequencing, bulk RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescence staining, and cell transplantation assays. Our data demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate marrow-associated SSPCs that serve as a primary source of osteoblasts during skeletal development. These hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived SSPCs commit to a CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cell phenotype during skeletal development and demonstrate unique abilities to recruit vasculature and promote bone marrow establishment, while also contributing to the adipogenic lineage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypertrophic chondrocytes</kwd><kwd>osteoblasts</kwd><kwd>adipocytes</kwd><kwd>bone marrow</kwd><kwd>progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>skeletal stem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH/NIAMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR071722</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilton</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>NIH/NIAMS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AR063071</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilton</surname><given-names>Matthew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate marrow associated skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs), which ultimately re-differentiate into cells of the osteoblast or adipocyte lineages during skeletal development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most skeletal elements arise from a cartilage template via the process of endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long and Ornitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono et al., 2019</xref>). During skeletal development, mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells condense and differentiate to form chondrocytes or cartilage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spencer et al., 2014</xref>). These chondrocytes undergo rapid proliferation while depositing an extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in type II collagen (COL2A1), forming the initial immature cartilage rudiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono et al., 2019</xref>). As cartilage growth proceeds, the chondrocytes localized nearest the center of each rudiment exit the cell cycle and undergo a process of maturation and hypertrophic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capasso et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long and Ornitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ono et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reginato et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmid and Conrad, 1982</xref>). Hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are identified by their specific expression of type X collagen (COL10A1), are ultimately responsible for secreting additional proteins such as Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor alpha (VEGFÎ±), Platelet Derived Growth Factor beta (PDGFÎ²), and Indian Hedgehog (IHH) among other factors to promote both vascular invasion and osteoblast differentiation of the surrounding perichondrial progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Capasso et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reginato et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schmid and Conrad, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">St-Jacques et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zelzer et al., 2004</xref>). As vessels from the perichondrium invade the hypertrophic cartilage to establish the marrow cavity, newly formed osteoblasts and their progenitors are delivered by these vessels to the marrow space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>). There, osteoblasts secrete a type I collagen (COL1A1)-rich matrix that ultimately mineralizes to replace the cartilage with bone, while the hypertrophic cartilage is remodeled and reduced with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olsen et al., 2000</xref>). Hypertrophic chondrocytes are essential for both establishment of the marrow cavity and bone formation; however, their precise fate and direct or indirect contribution to bone formation has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Recent genetic evidence suggests that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of transdifferentiation to directly generate osteoblasts and osteocytes that contribute to the formation of trabecular and endocortical bone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>). To determine the fate of growth plate chondrocytes during endochondral bone formation, investigators have utilized mouse lines combining constitutive and inducible CRE recombinases under the control of the <italic>Col2a1, Acan,</italic> or <italic>Col10a1</italic> promotors/enhancers with a recombination sensitive reporter. Utilization of the constitutive and inducible <italic>Col2a1Cre/Col2a1CreERT2</italic> mouse lines have complicated our understanding of this lineage by the fact that in addition to their expression in immature chondrocytes, <italic>Col2a1</italic> and these genetic tools have been noted to be expressed within and/or label directly perichondrial and marrow associated cell populations known to give rise to osteoblast lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hilton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Long et al., 2001</xref>). Some of the more convincing data generated utilizing a <italic>Col2a1CreERT2</italic> mouse line and recombination-sensitive reporter comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>, which established an approach for low-dose tamoxifen delivery to drive recombination in clones or clusters of immature chondrocytes that could be tracked over time. When the chase period was short (1â5 days post tamoxifen), reporter expression was largely restricted to immature chondrocyte clusters or extensions of these clusters into early hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, when the chase period was extended (10 days post tamoxifen), reporter expression could be observed throughout individual columns of proliferating to hypertrophic chondrocytes that also extended into <italic>Col1a1</italic>-expressing osteoblasts localized only to the regions of metaphyseal bone directly underneath the labeled chondrocytes; a result that is consistent with chondrocytes transitioning to an osteoblastic fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>). Similar pulse-chase experiments were performed utilizing the <italic>AcanCre<sup>ERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> reporter model at both embryonic and adult time points utilizing doses of tamoxifen that elicit high rates of recombination in chondrocytes. These data suggested that following short (1â3 days post tamoxifen) or long (2 weeks post tamoxifen) chase periods, non-chondrocytic cells associated with the primary spongiosa and trabecular bone were reporter positive with some cells labeling with the <italic>Col1a1(2.3 kb)-eGFP</italic>.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>) The most convincing data was generated utilizing a combination of constitutive and inducible <italic>Col10a1Cre/Col10a1CreERT2</italic> mouse lines and recombination-sensitive reporters; models that are much more restricted in their expression to hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>). This study, as well as others solely utilizing a constitutive <italic>Col10a1Cre</italic> model, determined that hypertrophic chondrocytes can relatively quickly give rise to osteoblastic cells expressing OSTERIX (OSX), COL1A1, and eventually even OSTEOCALCIN (OCN) and/or SCLEROSTIN (SOST) expressing osteocytes within the trabecular and endocortical bone matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2014b</xref>). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref> utilized a <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-eYFP</sup></italic> reporter model and noted the presence of some YFP<sup>+</sup>, <italic>Perilipin-</italic>expressing adipocytes and YFP<sup>+</sup>, PDGFRÎ²<sup>+</sup> pericytes within the bone marrow, suggesting the potential for alternate fates of hypertrophic chondrocytes beyond the osteoblast lineage. Utilizing similar techniques, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2020</xref> also demonstrated the potential for mature adipocytes to arise from <italic>Col10a1</italic>-expressing hypertrophic chondrocytes.</p><p>Since the fates of mature osteoblasts, adipocytes, and pericytes are unlikely to arise from independent hypertrophic chondrocyte transdifferentiation events, we reasoned that the hypertrophic chondrocytes may undergo a dedifferentiation process to generate skeletal stem and progenitor cell (SSPC) population(s) that localize to the bone marrow and maintain the capacity of redifferentiating into more mature cell fates. To address this issue, we utilized hypertrophic chondrocyte genetic reporter mouse models combined with single cell RNA-sequencing, immunofluorescent staining validation assays, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS)/flow cytometry, and bulk RNA-sequencing approaches of clonal cell populations. Our data indicate that hypertrophic chondrocytes indeed undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate bone-marrow-associated SSPCs embryonically and postnatally. These SSPC likely serve as a primary source of osteogenic cells during skeletal development and also contribute to the adipogenic lineage, but not the pericyte lineage. Further, these studies indicate that the hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs are strikingly similar at the transcriptomic level to marrow-associated SSPCs derived from other sources, but behave quite differently upon kidney capsule transplantation to test their multipotency. Hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs were able to give rise to a fully mature bone ossicle, complete with marrow cavity and adipocytes, while marrow SSPCs from other sources could only generate bone.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hypertrophic chondrocytes give rise to osteoblasts and other marrow-associated cells</title><p>To validate the osteogenic fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes, we first utilized the <italic>Col10a1CreERT2</italic> mouse line crossed with a <italic>Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> reporter (<italic>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic>). These mice were harvested at E16.5 following tamoxifen injections from E13.5-E15.5. Hypertrophic chondrocytes and their descendants found within the newly formed bone marrow cavity were tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A number of these descendants co-expressed the osteoblast protein OCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>, white arrow); however, OCN-, tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> cells were also apparent within the marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bâc</xref>, orange arrow). Additionally, we injected <italic>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice with a single dose of tamoxifen (TM) at postnatal day 6 (P6) and harvested at 12 hr, 24 hr, and 2 weeks following TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1dâg</xref>). At 12 hr following TM administration, specific expression of the tdTOMATO reporter was observed within hypertrophic chondrocytes and no cells within the marrow or surrounding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). At 24 hr following TM administration, the tdTOMATO reporter could now be observed in a limited number of marrow-associated cells directly below the cartilage growth plate, as well as within hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). At 2 weeks following TM administration, the tdTOMATO reporter had cleared from the hypertrophic chondrocytes and was now exclusively present in a number marrow-associated cells; some of those being at a significant distance from the growth plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). In this distal region of the marrow, we also observed trabecular bone lining cells that co-labeled for tdTOMATO and OCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; white arrows), suggesting that these cells had transitioned from hypertrophic chondrocytes to osteoblasts. Interestingly, other tdTOMATO-positive marrow-associated cells were not directly in contact with bone matrix and did not co-label with OCN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>; orange arrow), suggesting the presence of another cell type or cell stage within the bone marrow that may be derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. Additionally, by inducing recombination at both 2 months and 4 months of age and chasing for 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, we continued to observe contribution of tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> cells to the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1a, b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hypertrophic chondrocytes are the primary source of osteoblasts/osteocytes in trabecular bone.</title><p>Tibia sections of <italic>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice injected with tamoxifen at E13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 and subsequently sectioned at E16.5 and stained for (<bold>a</bold>) DAPI/RFP.

These data suggest that hypertrophic chondrocytes likely undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate even the most primitive SSCs; however, these cells themselves may be heterogeneous due to the differential expression of genes that allow for their segregation into multiple distinct clusters within our Seurat analysis.</p><p>In an attempt to further delineate each of the SSPC clusters in our Seurat analysis, we analyzed the data to identify genes restricted in their expression to a single SSPC cluster.

To assess this directly, we performed immunofluorescent staining for ENDOMUCIN (EMCN) on bone sections of <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice at 2 months of age and identified a number of tdTOMATO+ reporter cells directly adjacent to EMCN expressing endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3a</xref>). To ensure that these tdTOMATO+ cells were not pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells (vSMCs), we assessed our differential gene expression data for genes that serve as common markers for these specific cell types, including <italic>Acta2, Nes, Kcnj8, Rgs5, Cspg4,</italic> and <italic>Mcam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chasseigneaux et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamazaki and Mukouyama, 2018</xref>).

Given the expression of these adipogenic regulators and marker genes, we asked if hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived cells in clusters 3, 4, and 5 represent mature adipocytes or whether these cells could ultimately give rise to mature adipocytes in vivo. Our differential gene expression analysis did not indicate the presence of <italic>Perilipin</italic> (<italic>Plin1</italic>), a mature lipid laden adipocyte marker, in SSPC clusters 3, 4, or 5, suggesting that none of these cells isolated utilizing our procedures were representative of mature adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).

Regulation of vascular development was interesting, although not a surprising finding, since we know that terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete factors to initiate vessel invasion from the periosteum and we had identified a number of marrow-associated hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs localized near blood vessels. The fact that the tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> or hypertrophic chondrocyte derived CFU-Fs were enriched in genes associated with cellular proliferation was unanticipated. To this end, we investigated EdU incorporation into all CFU-Fs from <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mice at day 5 in culture that consisted of at least 5 cells. We observed a greater percentage of cells in tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> CFU-Fs that had incorporated EdU as compared to tdTOMATO<sup>-</sup> CFU-Fs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref> - top). By day 10 in culture, tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> CFU-Fs on average were larger and displayed more colonies with 200+ cells as compared to tdTOMATO<sup>-</sup> CFU-Fs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7f</xref> - bottom).

Current genetic lineage tracing studies have suggested a transdifferentiation mechanism by which hypertrophic chondrocytes differentiate directly into an osteoprogenitor or mature osteoblast without transiting through an intermediate or more primitive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we have provided genetic and transcriptomic evidence, consistent with our hypothesis, that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to form SSPC populations ultimately giving rise to osteoblastic and adipogenic cell fates within the marrow compartment of embryonic, postnatal, and adult bones. A number of genetic and flow cytometric approaches have been used to identify and isolate multipotent SSPC populations within both the bone marrow and periosteal compartments. Many of these efforts have used alternative genetic models (<italic>Gremlin1Cre, LeprCre, Col2a1Cre, Cxcl12Cre</italic>) with lineage tracing and/or RNA-seq analyses or have utilized flow cytometric-based selection methods with antibodies against PDGFRÎ±, CD200, and ITGAV among others followed by differentiation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boulais et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farahani and Xaymardan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gulati et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mizuhashi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Worthley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>).

It has also largely been assumed that these marrow-associated SSPCs are derived from the perichondrial/periosteal cells during skeletal development.

A population of lineage negative, CXCL12-, PDGFRÎ±+, SCA1+ SSPCs (PÎ±S cells) have been identified as a quiescent population associated with vessels near the endosteum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>). These PÎ±S cells are also capable of forming CFU-Fs, can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, while also being important for the migration and maintenance of HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nusspaumer et al., 2017</xref>). The appearance of these cells at E16.5 (but not 2 months) suggests that these might be either a more transient population derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes or are of an initial finite number and contribute early in development and are lost with age, as opposed to hypertrophic chondrocyte derived CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells (<italic>Cxcl12<sup>+</sup>; Ly6a1<sup>-</sup></italic>) that continue to be present in our data at 2 months of age.</p><p>Our analyses of 2-month <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> bone marrow identified not only hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived osteoprogenitors (<italic>Sp7</italic> expressing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>) and osteoblast populations, but also hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived marrow and vessel-associated cells expressing <italic>Lepr, Pdgfra, Pdgfrb, Grem1, Cxcl12,</italic> with several expressing <italic>Itgav, Cd200, and Eng</italic> (CD105) while lacking the expression of <italic>Col10a1, Cre,</italic> and most osteogenic genes. Since <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Pparg,</italic> and <italic>Adipoq</italic> are also expressed throughout many of these cells at 2 months of age, we postulate that these hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived cells encompass populations of SSPCs with the capability of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation. This indeed was confirmed via our in vitro and in vivo differentiation assays. Prior work has demonstrated that <italic>Runx2</italic> expressing and LEPR<sup>+</sup> progenitors are primed for osteoblastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), while LEPR<sup>+</sup> progenitors expressing <italic>Adipoq</italic> and <italic>Pparg</italic> are associated with adipogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Priming of the SSPCs may allow for their rapid differentiation when in the proper supportive osteogenic/adipogenic niche or outside a niche that supports SSPC maintenance.</p><p>Since SSPC populations, including CAR cells, were thought to originate from perichondrial/periosteal cell sources and since LEPR+ cells constitute ~100% of CFU-Fs, we attempted to compare SSPCs/CAR cells derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes to those of other origins by utilizing <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> bone marrow cells plated at clonal density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou et al., 2014a</xref>). Nearly 50% of the CFU-Fs were originally derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes (tdTOMATO+), while the other half of CFU-Fs (tdTOMATO-) were likely derived from a perichondrial/periosteal origin. Additionally, when compared to SSPCs derived from other cell sources, the hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs were much more conducive to the formation of a bone ossicle with adipocytes and marrow upon transplantation, highlighting the supportive nature of these cells to vascular invasion and hematopoietic cell populations. Collectively, these data indicate for first time that growth plate hypertrophic chondrocytes may serve as a reservoir for the generation of SSPCs (including PÎ±S cells) and osteoblasts during early embryonic development, but then primarily shift to CAR cell populations as the mice proceed through postnatal development and homeostasis.</p><p>Assessments of 2 M bulk RNA-seq data and EdU incorporation assays from CFU-F cultures, as well as cell cycle analysis of our scRNA-seq data, indicate an enhanced proliferative capacity for hypertrophic chondrocyte derived CFU-Fs and SSPCs/CAR cells. This data may be reflective of the fact that Yang et al. also identified the presence of both hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived <italic>Col1a1<sup>+</sup> and Col1a1<sup>-</sup></italic> marrow-associated cells that were BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating cells, indicating that hypertrophic chondrocytes eventually re-enter the cell cycle during this cell fate transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 2014a</xref>). Interestingly, our scRNA-seq dataset identified similar proportions of cycling cells in hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs/CAR cells and osteoblasts. This is in stark contrast to the more quiescent phenotype observed in most primitive SSPC populations that have been highlighted across numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). However, recent work utilizing similar scRNA-seq approaches assessed proliferation rates of chondrocyte and perichondrial-derived SSPCs and osteoblast populations in the <italic>Col2a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> bone marrow and also indicated similar proliferative capacities between later committed progenitors and osteoblasts, which was greater than the most primitive of SSPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Zhong et al., also utilized the <italic>AdipoqCre<sup>ERT2</sup>; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> model to investigate colony forming and proliferative potential of broad populations of <italic>Adipoq-</italic>expressing cells and descendants. These tdTOMATO<sup>+</sup> cells contributed very little to CFU-Fs and exhibited minimal proliferation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Tikhonova et al. also utilized scRNA-seq and identified a subset of cells from the <italic>LeprCre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> lineage that cluster into a high cycling group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>), which may represent a more proliferative LEPR<sup>+</sup> SSPC population derived from the cartilage growth plate. Finally, it is worth noting again that the in vivo contribution of <italic>AdipoqCre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> and <italic>LeprCre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> lineages to osteoblasts and/or osteocytes is something that occurs over developmental time postnatally, while the <italic>Col10a1Cre; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> lineage contributes to the osteoblast and osteocyte fates rapidly; as early as the embryonic period of skeletal development. This may also be attributed to the rapid or transient nature by which hypertrophic chondrocytes transit through the SSPC phase during these periods, such that the <italic>LeprCre</italic> or <italic>AdipoqCre</italic> do not have sufficient time or levels of <italic>Cre</italic> expression to induce recombination within this population. Also note that we do not observe <italic>Adipoq</italic> expression in the transitional cells at E16.5. Therefore, <italic>LeprCre</italic> and <italic>AdipoqCre</italic> may only be efficient at recombining floxed alleles within the less transient SSPC populations postnatally that continue to be maintained as SSPCs and subsequently slowly/weakly contribute to the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages during late postnatal/adult skeletal development and homeostasis.</p><p>While the data presented here demonstrates hypertrophic chondrocyte contribution to SSPCs, we note the importance of further studies to elucidate the mechanisms driving this process. Recent publications have suggested roles for pathways like WNT/Î²-catenin in balancing osteogenesis and adipogenesis from hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, Sox9 was shown to be important for maintaining chondrocytes before changing fates toward the osteoblast lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haseeb et al., 2021</xref>). Future studies will need to take into account the potential different signaling pathways that drive the dedifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes to a SSPC fate versus the re-differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs toward the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. Additional studies have also demonstrated a potential transient embryonic and postnatal contribution of hypertrophic chondrocytes to developmental bone formation, since genetic deletion of <italic>Runx2</italic> within hypertrophic chondrocytes (and their descendants) initially reduces osteoblastic bone formation that ultimately fully recovers around 3â6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qin et al., 2020</xref>). While it is possible that the late postnatal formation is ârecoveredâ from osteoblasts derived purely from an alternate source (such as the periosteum), it is also possible that removal of <italic>Runx2</italic> within the hypertrophic chondrocyte lineages induces some hypertrophic chondrocyte cell death, alters angiogenic/osteogenic factors (VEGFa among others) secreted from hypertrophic chondrocytes, and/or delays the re-differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived SSPCs toward the osteoblast lineage; thus simply delaying postnatal bone formation by reducing the contribution of hypertrophic chondrocytes and their descendants to the earliest stages of bone development. Further studies are needed to more thoroughly understand these lineage contributions over time, as we demonstrate with the <italic>Col10a1CreERT2; Rosa26<sup>fs-tdTomato</sup></italic> mouse line that there is a continued contribution of osteoblastic cells from hypertrophic chondrocytes throughout embryonic development to at least approximately 4â5 months of age or skeletal maturity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains</title><p>The <italic>Col10a1Cre</italic> mouse line was a generous gift from Dr. Klaus von der Mark and has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Park et al., 2015</xref>).

review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Hypertrophic Chondrocytes Serve as a Reservoir for Unique Marrow Associated Skeletal Stem and Progenitor Cells, Osteoblasts, and Adipocytes During Skeletal Development&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your initial submission has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. Although the work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Several prior studies showed that hypertrophic chondrocytes can give rise to osteoblast lineage cells during skeletal development and growth. In the present study, the authors, by conducted a characterization on the localization and lineage fate of the tdTomator+ cells using Col10a1CreERT2 ; R26-tdTomato lineage-tracing system, confirmed that hypertrophic chondrocytes gave rise to osteoblasts and other bone marrow associated cells. The authors then performed single cell RNA-sequencing on cells derived from 2-month-old Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato mice. They found that a subset of bone marrow tdTomato+ cells are skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPC) that contribute to osteogenic cells and the adipogenic lineage cells. Finally, the authors performed bulk RNA-sequencing on the tdTomoto+ and tdTomoto- CFU-Fs, and they found enriched expression of cell proliferation and vascular development genes within the tdTomoto+ CFU-Fs. These findings add new evidence to the current concept of chondrocyte-osteoprogenitors-osteoblast transdifferentiation and suggest hypertrophic chondrocytes may undergo dedifferentiate into SSPC. I have the following issues for the authors to address:</p><p>1. The lineage tracing study was conducted only in postnatal mice (P6) and chased for 2 weeks. Lineage tracing at different age groups (pre-natal or adult mice) would be useful. Moreover, more evidence is needed to claim that hypertrophic chondrocytes-derived cells undergo a process of dedifferentiation into SSPCs. For example, it is necessary to conduct fluorescence imaging to assess whether stem/progenitor markers (preferentially use another fluorescence reporter mouse strain) colocalize with tdTomato in bone/bone marrow tissue sections from Col10a1CreERT2 ; R26-tdTomato mice at different time points after tamoxifen treatment. Flow cytometry analyses of the expression of the stem/progenitor markers in sorted tdTomato+ cells would also be helpful.</p><p>2. Could the authors explain why the single cell RNA-seq were conducted using bone/bone marrow cells derived from 2-month-old non-inducible Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato mice? The Tamoxifen-inducible strain at early postnatal stage may make more sense.</p><p>3. In Figure 1l, 70-80% of OCN was tdTomato+ in Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato mice. However, in Figure 5 and Figure S10, tdTomoto+ and tdTomoto- colonies showed similar ability of osteogenesis. Please explain the discrepancy.</p><p>4. In Figure 5, the authors show that nearly 50% of CFU-F colonies derived from Col10a1Cre;R26-tdTomato mice. What is the age of the mice used? Is this age-associated?</p><p>5. In Figure S10, the authors assessed the in vitro osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacities of the colonies. The images of different staining results should be presented.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. I suggest that Figure S3, especially the staining data in Col10a1CreERT2;Rosa26-tdTomato mice, could be moved to the main text because it provides important evidence to support the dedifferentiation of the labeled tdTomato+ cells.</p><p>2. The mechanisms underlying the dedifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes are interesting. This may be elaborated in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1. This study utilized a powerful combination of hypertrophic chondrocyte-specific lineage tracing models and single cell RNA-seq analyses, to uncover previously unknown identities of hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived bone marrow stromal cell populations.</p><p>2. This study took a closer look at Col10a1-creER-based lineage-tracing models to confirm that hypertrophic chondrocytes can transition into bone marrow stromal cells.</p><p>3. This study discovers heterogeneity of hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived cells in bone marrow, including osteoblasts and undifferentiated stromal cells that may overlap with skeletal stem and progenitor cells.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. The major conclusion of this study on de-differentiation is mostly supported by single cell RNA-seq analyses of flushed and sorted bone marrow stromal cells, which does not capture the transition of hypertrophic chondrocytes.</p><p>2. The authors used Col10a1-CreER and Col10a1-Cre models interchangeably without much considering the important temporal factor. SSPCs that they defined in scRNA-seq experiments may not represent those generated by a recent transformation event. The transformation may have occurred at a much earlier development time point. Essentially all SSPCs in the endochondroal pathway are, after all, derived from chondrocytes. Therefore, these SSPCs may not represent a unique cell population.</p><p>3. The authors did not consider the heterogeneity of chondrocytes that are marked by Col10a1-Cre, which include hypertrophic chondrocytes at various locations of the growth plate.</p><p>4. This study did not directly show that hypertrophic chondrocyte-derived SSPC populations actually contribute to osteoblasts. These cells could be just bystanders, whereas direct transformation of hypertrophic chondrocytes to osteoblasts may be more significant.</p><p>5. The section pertaining to support of hematopoiesis was mostly irrelevant.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. Title:</p><p>It is unclear what the authors mean by &quot;unique&quot; marrow associated skeletal stem and progenitor cells. They defined these cells based on previously available markers as described in the main text; therefore, they are not &quot;unique&quot;.</p><p>2. Abstract:</p><p>Generally speaking, this abstract is oversimplified and overstated, not capturing the essence of this study. The distinction between two models of lineage tracing (constitutive active vs. inducible) should be delineated.</p><p>Line 38: I am not sure which reference(s) the authors mean by saying that &quot;SSPCs localized to the surrounding periosteum serve as the primary source of marrow associated SSPCs, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes during skeletal development&quot;. The periosteum does not provide a precursor for marrow cell populations. The perichondrium is not a primary source of marrow cells.</p><p>Line 40: The authors should specify which genetic reporter mouse models they used in this study.</p><p>Line 42: What do the authors mean by this: &quot;â¦unique marrow associated SSPCs, previously characterized as a CXCL12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells&quot;? This sentence is contradictory. Moreover, the definition of CAR cells is well-established in the field.</p><p>3. Introduction:</p><p>Line 47-63: Olsen et al. 2000 is cited five times in the first paragraph. Although this is a valid book chapter to cite, they should identify the primary literature and also cite these papers accordingly.</p><p>Line 83-85: It is not true that the Acan-CreER model is more restricted to chondrocytes within the growth plate. It shows more recombination in the periosteum and other marrow components.</p><p>Line 109-110: It is not surprising that hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs are striking similar to marrow associated SSPCs, because, after all, most SSPCs are derived from chondrocytes in the endochondral pathway.</p><p>4. Results:</p><p>Line 128: IF staining in Figure 1d is not convincing.</p><p>Line 131-132: This point is not new and has been already shown in preceding studies. Although I appreciate their efforts to reproduce, these results are confirmatory and not entirely novel.</p><p>Line 153: Singe cell RNA-seq is not the right approach to reveal &quot;multiple cell fates&quot; of hypertrophic chondrocytes.</p><p>Line 160-161: To support this statement, the authors should include FACS plots in the paper.</p><p>Line 162: Why is the number of cells analyzed here so small (~1,000 cells)? This would limit the power of scRNA-seq analysis.</p><p>Line 217: Although interesting, the authors did not provide concrete evidence that de-differentiation generates &quot;the most primitive SSCs&quot;. This is largely speculative.</p><p>Line 242-251: I am not sure how these discussions on support of hematopoiesis fit into the lines of discussion.</p><p>5. Discussion:</p><p>Line 390: I don't think that the authors showed here with genetic evidence that &quot;hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to form unique SSPCs populations&quot;. This piece of data would be critical to sustain the major conclusion of this study.</p><p>Line 403 (and the title): Why do the authors think that hypertrophic chondrocytes serve as a &quot;reservoir and alternative source&quot; of SSPCs? Their data clearly support the now well-accepted notion that these cells are a &quot;primary&quot; source of SSPCs.</p><p>Line 436: The authors are not the first group demonstrating that growth plate chondrocytes serve as a reservoir for CAR cells.</p><p>Line 466-469: The last conclusions appear to be vastly overstated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Authors examined the process of transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes to osteoblasts or other marrow associated cells using the lineage tracing reporter mice (Col10a1 Cre-Rosa Tomato mice), which express Tomato in the hypertrophic chondrocytes and their descendants. They showed that more than 80% of bone marrow osteoblasts was derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. They performed scRNA sequencing of Tomato-positive cells, and the gene expression profiles of most of the Tomato-positive cells are like those in skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) and a niche cell for hematopoietic stem cells. It was confirmed by the staining of the Tamato-positive cells with immunohistochemistry using antibodies against PDGFRb, LEPR, and PDGFRa, which are expressed in SSPCs. Further, they showed that 25% of adipocytes and 37% of LepR+ cells were derived from Tamato-positive cells by immunohistochemistry. They also showed that half of the CFU-F was derived from Tamato-positive cells, and they had more proliferative activity than that derived from Tamato-negative cells. They concluded that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate SSPCs, which serve as a primary source of bone marrow osteoblasts and some source of adipocytes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The scRNA sequencing of the transdifferentiated cells enabled the characterization of SSPCs derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes in detail.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. They used immunohistochemistry for the quantitative analysis, including the frequencies of transdifferentiated osteoblasts and LepR+ cells. The immunohistochemistry using adult mouse samples is not easy because of the process of decalcification, which reduces antigen reactivity. They should use reporter mice driven by 2.3 kb Col1a1 promoter for the frequency of transdifferentiated osteoblasts, and LepR Cre Rosa mice for the frequency of LepR+ cells. Further, they prepared the samples by immersion fixation but not perfusion fixation. It is important to prepare the samples for immunohistochemistry by perfusion fixation to keep the antigen reactivity. They performed immunohistochemistry using OCN antibody to detect osteoblasts in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 8. The number of OCN-positive cells are too low, indicating that the immunohistochemical analysis is not working. Further, the pictures with higher magnification are required for the evaluation of the staining in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures3, 6, 8, and the locations of the pictures with high magnification should be shown in the pictures with low magnification. In Supplementary Figure 3, most of the cells look Tomato single positive cells and PDGFRb, LEPR, or PDGFRa single positive cells. It is contradictory to Figure 3.</p><p>2. 37 % of LepR+ cells were derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, more than 80% of OCN-positive cells were derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. The discrepancy also seems to have been caused by the quantitative analysis using immunohistochemistry of LepR and OCN.</p><p>3. In Figure 2, the populations of osteocytes (cluster 1) and osteoblasts (cluster 2) were too small, indicating that the samples were not appropriately collected. It skews the understanding of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. It is recommended to perform scRNA sequencing at embryonic stage (E16.5-18.5) to confirm the appearance of dedifferentiated cells.</p><p>4. The frequency of osteoblasts derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes at 2 months of age was 83% in this paper, and it was described as consistent to the previous reports. However, it was 19-31% at 3 weeks of age in Yang et al. (Cell Res 24:1266, 2014), 62-63% at 1 month of age in Zhou et al. (PLoS Genet 10: e1004820, 2014), and 15% at 3 weeks of age in Qin et al. (PLoS Genet 16: e1009169, 2020). The frequencies were examined using reporter mice in the previous three papers. As the OCN immunostaining was not working, however, the frequency of this paper is not reliable. Even if it is reliable, the data is not consistent to the previous papers. Further, the last paper, which was not cited in this paper, also showed that bone volume becomes normal by 6 weeks of age in the absence of transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating the transient requirement of the transdifferentiation at embryonic and neonatal stage. Referring the previous findings, precise discussion should be done.</p><p>5. The presence of the dedifferentiated cells does not mean that hypertrophic chondrocytes transdifferentiate into osteoblasts through the dedifferentiated cell stage. The data in this paper is consistent with the previous findings, which indicated that hypertrophic chondrocytes become osteoblasts, adipocytes, and stromal cells. Further, the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes into Cxcl12-positive stromal cells was already shown in the previous paper (Nature 563: 254, 2018), although in detailed expression profiles of the stromal cells were provided in this paper.</p><p>6. In Figure 5G, are more than half of the cells in cluster 1 (osteocytes) S/G2/M phase?</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1. In line 131 on page 6, what are other osteogenic markers?</p><p>2. In line 147-148 on page 7, what does &quot;loosely associated with the marrow&quot; mean?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76932.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In Figure 3g, we demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes initially labeled at E13.5-15.5 transition into a marrow associated <italic>Pdgfra</italic>-expressing cells during bone development. These data were achieved by generating a <italic>Col10a1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; R26-tdTomato</italic> mouse line that incorporates a PDGFRa-H2B-GFP knock-in allele. This PDGFRa-H2B- GFP allele was also utilized with our <italic>Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato</italic> mouse line for flow cytometry of marrow associated cells at 2-months of age and demonstrated that greater than 70% of all of hypertrophic chondrocyte derived marrow associated cells or SSPCs are PDGFRa/GFP positive, which is consistent with our scRNA-seq data at this timepoint (Figure S4c)<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could the authors explain why the single cell RNA-seq were conducted using bone/bone marrow cells derived from 2-month-old non-inducible Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato mice? The Tamoxifen-inducible strain at early postnatal stage may make more sense.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the transient nature of the hypertrophic chondrocytes following single tamoxifen injections in <italic>Col10a1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; R26-tdTomato</italic> mice and their limited contribution to the marrow utilizing this strategy, we opted to use the <italic>Col10a1Cre<sup>ERT2</sup>; R26-tdTomato</italic> mouse line. Original inducible experiments did not yield sufficient cell numbers following tissue digestion, FACS, and downstream quality check/removals. We chose 2-months of age as a postnatal developmental time point in which the hypertrophic chondrocytes would have likely produced a potential variety of de-differentiated and or differentiated marrow associated cell types. We thought this would be ideal for capturing the full breadth of what hypertrophic chondroyctes were capable of becoming during skeletal development and homeostasis, in addition to the bone associated osteoblasts and osteocytes. To further address reviewersâ concerns, we have now performed an additional scRNA-seq experiment and analysis of E16.5 <italic>Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato</italic> long bones (cartilage, bone, and marrow tdTomato+ cells) and have confirmed prior 2-month scRNA-seq data that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a dedifferentiation process to generate SSPCs prior to becoming cells of the osteoblast lineage (Figure 2, 3, S2, and S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 1l, 70-80% of OCN was tdTomato+ in Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato mice. However, in Figure 5 and Figure S10, tdTomoto+ and tdTomoto- colonies showed similar ability of osteogenesis. Please explain the discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer notes that 70-80% of OCN+ osteoblasts were tdTomato+, and that the tdTomato+ and tdTomato- colonies were roughly equal in numbers and osteogenic potential. So then why are most osteoblasts and osteocytes derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes? We attribute this to the rapid growth that is required during early skeletal development and the quick turnover of hypertrophic chondrocytes from the growth plate. This likely allows for faster contribution of the hypertrophic chondrocyte derived cells as compared to the invading periosteal associated osteo- progenitors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In Figure 5, the authors show that nearly 50% of CFU-F colonies derived from Col10a1Cre;R26-tdTomato mice. What is the age of the mice used? Is this age-associated?</p></disp-quote><p>The 50% CFU ratio was performed at 2-months of age (the same timepoint as our adult scRNA-seq experiment). We have now performed an additional CFU analysis at 8-months of age (Figure 7) and observed relatively similar numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure S10, the authors assessed the in vitro osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacities of the colonies. The images of different staining results should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed Oil Red O and Von Kossa staining to quantify the in vitro differentiation capacity. These were first analyzed under a fluorescence microscope and marked on the plate for tdTomato positive and tdTomato negative. After the stain is performed that tdTomato signal is much weaker and in the case of Von Kossa is completely opaque because of the stain. In preparation for this re-submission we instead performed in vivo kidney capsule transplantation assays to truly assess their multilineage differentiation capacity. These in vivo data demonstrate that both SSPC populations are capable of forming osteoblasts that generate bone; however, only the hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs are capable of forming a complete vascularized bone organ with host derived marrow, and donor derived osteoblasts, osteocytes, some marrow associated cells, and adipocytes (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We do; however, agree that there might be subclasses of chondrocytes that potentially contribute to SSPCs differently. A recent study by Mizuhashi, et al. (2019) found that borderline chondrocytes exist and rarely undergo hypertrophy or express <italic>Col10a1</italic>. Differing sources of SSPCs is further supported by our CFU analysis that indicate than nearly half of colonies or progenitors do not originate from hypertrophic chondrocytes and that hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs appear to have different multilineage capabilities when transplanted in vivo. With this in mind, we also performed scRNA-seq of tdTomato+ cells from E16.5 <italic>Col10a1Cre; R26-tdTomato</italic> long bones which captures the specific transitional period as hypertrophic chondrocytes give way for the formation of the nascent marrow cavity and endochondral bone, allowing us to demonstrate that some of the SSPCs are certainly derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes during skeletal development (Figure 2, 3, and S3). Some of the SSPCs identified at 2months of age may indeed be cells that were generated at earlier time-points and remain as progenitors within the marrow space, however new lineage tracing data at 2- and 4-months of age suggest that their contribution to marrow associated cells and the osteoblast lineage persists well into adulthood (Figure S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We cannot exclude this possibility, but note that we see SSPCs derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes along the length of the metaphyseal/trabecular region, as well as, throughout the marrow cavity. The expression of the <italic>Col10a1-</italic>driven CRE is specific to cells only within the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, and therefore demonstrate that the marrow derived SSPCs, osteoblast lineage cells, and adipocytes are derived from cells within this hypertrophic zone.

They showed that more than 80% of bone marrow osteoblasts was derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. They performed scRNA sequencing of Tomato-positive cells, and the gene expression profiles of most of the Tomato-positive cells are like those in skeletal stem and progenitor cells (SSPCs) and a niche cell for hematopoietic stem cells. It was confirmed by the staining of the Tamato-positive cells with immunohistochemistry using antibodies against PDGFRb, LEPR, and PDGFRa, which are expressed in SSPCs. Further, they showed that 25% of adipocytes and 37% of LepR+ cells were derived from Tamato-positive cells by immunohistochemistry. They also showed that half of the CFU-F was derived from Tamato-positive cells, and they had more proliferative activity than that derived from Tamato-negative cells. They concluded that hypertrophic chondrocytes undergo a process of dedifferentiation to generate SSPCs, which serve as a primary source of bone marrow osteoblasts and some source of adipocytes.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The scRNA sequencing of the transdifferentiated cells enabled the characterization of SSPCs derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes in detail.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>1. They used immunohistochemistry for the quantitative analysis, including the frequencies of transdifferentiated osteoblasts and LepR+ cells. The immunohistochemistry using adult mouse samples is not easy because of the process of decalcification, which reduces antigen reactivity. They should use reporter mice driven by 2.3 kb Col1a1 promoter for the frequency of transdifferentiated osteoblasts, and LepR Cre Rosa mice for the frequency of LepR+ cells. Further, they prepared the samples by immersion fixation but not perfusion fixation. It is important to prepare the samples for immunohistochemistry by perfusion fixation to keep the antigen reactivity. They performed immunohistochemistry using OCN antibody to detect osteoblasts in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 8. The number of OCN-positive cells are too low, indicating that the immunohistochemical analysis is not working. Further, the pictures with higher magnification are required for the evaluation of the staining in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures3, 6, 8, and the locations of the pictures with high magnification should be shown in the pictures with low magnification. In Supplementary Figure 3, most of the cells look Tomato single positive cells and PDGFRb, LEPR, or PDGFRa single positive cells. It is contradictory to Figure 3.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed flow analysis for PDGFRa utilizing another reporter line (PDGFRa-H2B-GFP) and antibody for PDGFRB and found a majority of tdTomato+ cells in the marrow are SSPCs (Figure S4c). We cannot fully understand the contribution to direct transdifferentiation and dedifferentiation with the currently available tools. We disagree that using a <italic>Col1a1(2.3kb)</italic> reporter would only demonstrate transdifferentiated but could also include osteoblasts that went through a SSPC intermediate. Additionally, a <italic>LepRCre</italic> combined with a genetic reporter would also not be usable as the CRE recombinase would affect the reporter already in the <italic>Col10a1Cre;R26-tdTomato</italic> line. Previous publications cited in this paper have utilized immersion fixation for immuno-staining and we disagree that perfusion fixation is absolutely required for preserving antigen reactivity. We have provided better images further demonstrating the co-labeling of cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. 37 % of LepR+ cells were derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. However, more than 80% of OCN-positive cells were derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes. The discrepancy also seems to have been caused by the quantitative analysis using immunohistochemistry of LepR and OCN.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference in rates of generating the LEPR+ (SSPCs) and OCN+ (osteoblasts) are likely independent processes. The rate at which LEPR+ populations differentiate, proliferate, and/or become quiescent may not be the same and therefore the contributions to the OCN+ osteoblasts could change over time. Additionally, we cannot rule out some transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes which would increase the OCN+ population independent of LEPR+ population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 2, the populations of osteocytes (cluster 1) and osteoblasts (cluster 2) were too small, indicating that the samples were not appropriately collected. It skews the understanding of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation. It is recommended to perform scRNA sequencing at embryonic stage (E16.5-18.5) to confirm the appearance of dedifferentiated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We purposefully performed only a short digest on the bones as to not obtain as many osteoblasts. We were interested more in the question of whether hypertrophic chondrocytes could dedifferentiate into an SSPC-type population. The reviewer is correct that we cannot draw a direct connection between the rate of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation from this dataset. Additionally, we have performed E16.5 scRNA-sequencing, as noted by multiple reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The frequency of osteoblasts derived from hypertrophic chondrocytes at 2 months of age was 83% in this paper, and it was described as consistent to the previous reports. However, it was 19-31% at 3 weeks of age in Yang et al. (Cell Res 24:1266, 2014), 62-63% at 1 month of age in Zhou et al. (PLoS Genet 10: e1004820, 2014), and 15% at 3 weeks of age in Qin et al. (PLoS Genet 16: e1009169, 2020). The frequencies were examined using reporter mice in the previous three papers. As the OCN immunostaining was not working, however, the frequency of this paper is not reliable. Even if it is reliable, the data is not consistent to the previous papers. Further, the last paper, which was not cited in this paper, also showed that bone volume becomes normal by 6 weeks of age in the absence of transdifferentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating the transient requirement of the transdifferentiation at embryonic and neonatal stage. Referring the previous findings, precise discussion should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded the conclusions of this study in comparison to the previous studies noted by the reviewer. Yang, et al. utilized a different Cre line as well as used in situ hybridization to analyze overlap. Zhou, et al. utilized the same Cre as this study but looked at 1 month of age which could be different than our 2-month time point because of continued turnover of the hypertrophic cells and proliferation of osteoblasts although their numbers are consistent with our osteocyte quantifications. Qin, et al. provided numbers that are not comparable as the control for these quantifications have one allele of Runx2 deleted (controls were Col10a1Cre;R26- tdTomato;Runx2fl/+). The authors did not provide evidence that the heterozygous allele did not cause a phenotype of its own and also confounds the conclusion that transdifferentiation is only an embryonic/neonatal phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The presence of the dedifferentiated cells does not mean that hypertrophic chondrocytes transdifferentiate into osteoblasts through the dedifferentiated cell stage. The data in this paper is consistent with the previous findings, which indicated that hypertrophic chondrocytes become osteoblasts, adipocytes, and stromal cells. Further, the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes into Cxcl12-positive stromal cells was already shown in the previous paper (Nature 563: 254, 2018), although in detailed expression profiles of the stromal cells were provided in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>See Reviewer 2 comment 4 for the transdifferentiation versus dedifferentiation conclusions. Additionally, we disagree that this paper demonstrated that hypertrophic chondrocytes were the source of CAR cells. The authors utilized a <italic>Pthrp-Cre<sup>ER</sup></italic> model that targeted mSSC (based on their flow data) and no evidence of them being chondrocytes (only showing a much earlier state). The authors saw contribution to chondrocyte columns and what appear to be hypertrophic chondrocytes, but do not investigate this further. Additionally, their later paper 2019 JBMR showed that this <italic>Pthrp-Cre<sup>ER</sup></italic> can label a borderline chondrocyte (<italic>Col10a1</italic>-negative) cell population associated with some contribution to CAR cells, albeit very minimally at an early postnatal time point. Furthermore, since this tool is not a constitutive CRE, the total contribution over time is very limited. When quantifications were performed the authors did not calculate the percentage of contribution, but rather simply noted that <italic>Pthrp-Cre<sup>ER</sup></italic> derived cells are capable of generating CXCL12+ marrow associated cells. Finally, the <italic>Pthrp-Cre<sup>ER</sup></italic> derived cells were very restricted in their potential as they could never give rise to adipocytes. We leave open the possibility that if these cells do contribute to hypertrophic chondrocytes later in development, they likely are not the only contributing cells as we have demonstrated that hypertrophic chondrocyte derived SSPCs can give rise to adipocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 5G, are more than half of the cells in cluster 1 (osteocytes) S/G2/M phase?</p></disp-quote><p>We do observe some distribution across the cell cycle in cluster 1. Cluster 1 does not appear to be an osteocyte as osteoblasts can express the genes highlighted in Figure 4 and we do not observe <italic>Sost</italic> or other osteocyte associated genes in cluster 1, suggesting this is likely not an osteocyte population but rather a second osteoblast population, potentially on a differentiation path toward an osteocyte. Our digestion protocol was not designed to dissociate osteocytes, but rather focus on the marrow associated hypertrophic chondrocyte derived cell populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 131 on page 6, what are other osteogenic markers?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been reworded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In line 147-148 on page 7, what does âloosely associated with the marrowâ mean?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been reworded.</p></body></sub-article></article>
