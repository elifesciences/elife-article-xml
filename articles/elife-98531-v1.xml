Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt is the primary effector of PDGFRα signaling during mouse skeletal development. We previously demonstrated that Akt phosphorylates the RNA-binding protein serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (Srsf3) downstream of PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells, leading to its nuclear translocation. We further showed that ablation of <italic>Srsf3</italic> in the murine neural crest lineage results in severe midline facial clefting and widespread alternative RNA splicing (AS) changes. Here, we demonstrated via enhanced UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation of MEPM cells that PDGF-AA stimulation leads to preferential binding of Srsf3 to exons and loss of binding to canonical Srsf3 CA-rich motifs. Through the analysis of complementary RNA-seq data, we showed that Srsf3 activity results in the preferential inclusion of exons with increased GC content and lower intron to exon length ratio. We found that Srsf3 activity downstream of PDGFRα signaling leads to retention of the receptor in early endosomes and increases in downstream PI3K-mediated Akt signaling. Taken together, our findings reveal that growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of an RNA-binding protein underlies gene expression regulation necessary for mammalian craniofacial development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme</kwd><kwd>PDGFRa</kwd><kwd>Srsf3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DE030864</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fantauzzo</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM147025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Neelanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014450</institution-id><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sajek</surname><given-names>Marcin P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Neelanjan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31DE032252</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Forman</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upon PDGFRα signaling in mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme cells, Srsf3 exhibits differential transcript binding, resulting in retention of the receptor in early endosomes and increased downstream PI3K-mediated Akt signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Craniofacial development is a complex morphogenetic process that requires a precise interplay of multiple cell and tissue types to generate the frontonasal skeleton. Disruption of this process can result in some of the most common birth differences in humans, such as cleft lip and palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mai et al., 2019</xref>). Signaling through the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) is essential for human craniofacial development. Heterozygous missense mutations in the coding region of <italic>PDGFRA</italic> that alter amino acids within the extracellular, transmembrane, or cytoplasmic domains of the receptor, in addition to single base-pair substitutions in the 3’ untranslated region (3’ UTR), are associated with nonsyndromic cleft palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rattanasopha et al., 2012</xref>). Further, single-nucleotide polymorphisms that repress transcriptional activity of the promoter upstream of <italic>PDGFC</italic>, which encodes one of two PDGFRα ligands, are associated with cleft lip and palate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2009</xref>). This role of PDGFRα signaling in craniofacial development is conserved in mice, as <italic>Pdgfra</italic> mutant mouse models display a variety of defects that range from cleft palate to complete facial clefting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">He and Soriano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Soriano, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tallquist and Soriano, 2003</xref>). These phenotypes are recapitulated in embryos lacking both <italic>Pdgfa</italic> and <italic>Pdgfc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ding et al., 2004</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is the primary effector of PDGFRα signaling during skeletal development in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>). Following activation, PI3K increases phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) levels at the cell membrane, leading to the recruitment and subsequent phosphorylation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt. Akt subsequently dissociates from the membrane to phosphorylate an array of target proteins that are involved in wide-ranging cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manning and Cantley, 2007</xref>). We previously identified proteins phosphorylated by Akt downstream of PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling in primary mouse embryonic palatal mesenchyme (MEPM) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>). Gene ontology analysis revealed that 25% of the 56 proteins were involved in RNA processing, with a particular enrichment for RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Alternative RNA splicing (AS) is a process by which different combinations of exons from the same gene are incorporated into mature RNA transcripts, thereby contributing to gene expression regulation and enhancing the diversity of protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). AS occurs in approximately 95% of multi-exon human genes, frequently in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Dysregulation of AS causes a number of diseases due to mutations in precursor RNA sequences, mutations in core components of the spliceosome complex, and/or mutations in auxiliary RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scotti and Swanson, 2016</xref>). These <italic>trans</italic>-acting auxiliary RBPs bind to specific sequence and/or structural motifs in a target RNA via one or more RNA-binding domains to promote or inhibit exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). The phenotypes resulting from global and/or tissue-specific knockout of multiple RBPs have established that RBP-mediated AS is an essential process during mouse craniofacial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bebee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cibi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). We previously demonstrated that ablation of <italic>Srsf3</italic> in the murine neural crest lineage results in severe midline facial clefting and facial bone hypoplasia, due to defects in proliferation and survival of cranial neural crest cells, and widespread AS changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Srsf3 belongs to the serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein family of splicing factors that generally promote exon inclusion by binding to exonic and intronic splicing enhancers and by recruiting spliceosome components to the 5’ and 3’ splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). Srsf3 specifically was shown to bind pyrimidine-rich motifs, with a preference for exonic regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>). Srsf3 is phosphorylated downstream of PDGF and EGF stimulation and all-<italic>trans</italic> retinoic acid treatment, and by the kinases Akt and SRPK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bavelloni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of the Akt consensus sites within the C-terminal arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain of Srsf3 drives its translocation to the nucleus, where AS takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bavelloni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, phosphorylation of the RS domain can alter the ability of SR proteins to interact with other proteins, such as the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) component of the spliceosome and additional RBPs, and affect the ability of SR proteins to bind RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen and Green, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xiao and Manley, 1997</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which Srsf3 activity is regulated downstream of specific signaling inputs in a context-specific manner to regulate RNA binding and/or sequence specificity remain undetermined.</p><p>Here, we identified changes in Srsf3-dependent AS and Srsf3 transcript binding in the absence or presence of PDGF-AA ligand in MEPM cells. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that Srsf3 activity and PDGFRα signaling have more pronounced effects on AS than gene expression, as well as a significant dependence in regulating AS. Using enhanced UV-crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (eCLIP), we found a shift from intronic to exonic Srsf3 binding and loss of CA-rich sites upon PDGF-AA stimulation. Further, we demonstrated that the subset of transcripts that are bound by Srsf3 and undergo AS upon PDGFRα signaling commonly encode regulators of PI3K signaling and early endosomal trafficking, ultimately serving as a feedback mechanism to affect trafficking of the receptors. Combined, our findings provide significant insight into the mechanisms underlying RBP-mediated gene expression regulation in response to growth factor stimulation within the embryonic mesenchyme.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PDGFRα signaling for 1 hr minimally affects gene expression</title><p>To determine the Srsf3-dependent changes in gene expression and AS downstream of PDGFRα signaling, we stably integrated a scramble shRNA (scramble) or an shRNA targeting the 3’ UTR of <italic>Srsf3</italic> (shSrsf3) into immortalized MEPM (iMEPM) cells via lentiviral transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Western blotting revealed a 66% decrease in Srsf3 protein levels in the shSrsf3 cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We previously demonstrated that phosphorylated Srsf3 levels peaked in the nucleus of iMEPM cells following 1 hr of PDGF-AA ligand treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>). As such, cells were left unstimulated (-PDGF-AA) or treated with 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA for 1 hr (+PDGF-AA). RNA was isolated and sequenced from three biological replicates across each of the four conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We first examined Srsf3-dependent differentially expressed (DE) genes by comparing scramble versus shSrsf3 samples across the same PDGF-AA stimulation condition (-PDGF-AA or +PDGF-AA). We detected 827 DE genes in the absence of ligand treatment and 802 DE genes upon ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There was extensive overlap (521 out of 1108; 47.0%) of Srsf3-dependent DE genes across ligand treatment conditions, resulting in a total of 1108 unique genes within both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Of the 521 shared DE genes, 514 (98.7%) had the same directionality, including 273 (52%) with shared increases in expression in the shSrsf3 samples and 241 (46%) with shared decreases in expression in the shSrsf3 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). These findings demonstrate that expression of a set of genes (521) depends on Srsf3 activity independent of PDGFRα signaling, while a similarly sized set of genes (587) is differentially expressed in response to both Srsf3 activity and PDGFRα signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the Srsf3-dependent DE genes revealed that the most significant terms for biological process commonly involved regulation of osteoblast differentiation, calcium-dependent cell–cell adhesion, regulation of cell migration, and canonical Wnt signaling, while only a handful of significant terms for molecular function were detected in unstimulated cells, relating to cation channel activity and phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PDGFRα signaling for 1 hr minimally affects gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of RNA-seq experimental design.

Of the nine shared alternatively spliced transcripts, 100% had the same directionality, including five (56%) with shared negative changes in PSI (exon included more often in +PDGF-AA samples) and four (44%) with shared positive changes in PSI (exon skipped more often in +PDGF-AA samples) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that both Srsf3 activity and PDGFRα signaling have more pronounced effects on AS than gene expression. While more transcripts and genes are subject to these regulatory mechanisms upon loss of Srsf3 activity, the magnitude of events is more greatly skewed toward AS upon PDGF-AA stimulation. Further, these results show that AS of a set of transcripts (9) depends on PDGFRα signaling independent of Srsf3 activity, while a much larger set of transcripts (613) is alternatively spliced in response to both PDGFRα signaling and Srsf3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). When combined with the data above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), this points to a profound dependence between PDGFRα signaling and Srsf3 in regulating AS of transcripts in the facial mesenchyme. GO analysis of these PDGF-AA-dependent alternatively spliced transcripts demonstrated only a handful of significant terms for molecular function in the scramble cells, all relating to protein kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>The vast majority of Srsf3-dependent (70.2–73.7%) and PDGF-AA-dependent (62.1–65.1%) AS events involved skipped exons, with minimal contribution from retained introns, mutually exclusive exons, alternative 5’ splice sites, or alternative 3’ splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). For the Srsf3-dependent skipped exon events, there were more transcripts with +ΔPSI (exon skipped more often in shSrsf3 samples) (44.8%) as opposed to -ΔPSI (exon included more often in shSrsf3 samples) (25.4%) in the absence of PDGF-AA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with previous results that SR proteins tend to promote exon inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010</xref>). However, PDGF-AA ligand treatment led to an increase in the percentage of transcripts with -ΔPSI (36.5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that PDGFRα signaling promotes exon skipping in the presence of Srsf3. Among the PDGF-AA-dependent skipped exon events, there was a significant shift in transcripts with -ΔPSI (exon included more often in +PDGF-AA samples) in the absence (41.0%) versus presence (19.5%) of Srsf3, and a corresponding shift in transcripts with +ΔPSI (exon skipped more often in +PDGF-AA samples) (21.1% and 45.6%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), again suggesting that PDGF-AA stimulation causes increased exon skipping when Srsf3 is present.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Srsf3 exhibits differential transcript binding upon PDGFRα signaling</title><p>To determine direct binding targets of Srsf3 downstream of PDGFRα signaling, we conducted eCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van Nostrand et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Van Nostrand et al., 2016</xref>) of iMEPM cells that were left unstimulated (-PDGF-AA) or treated with 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA for 1 hr (+PDGF-AA) as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

We detected 6555 total eCLIP peaks in protein-coding genes in the -PDGF-AA samples and 8584 total peaks in the +PDGF-AA samples. Among the -PDGF-AA peaks, 3727 (56.9%) were located in exons (CDS) and 1690 (25.8%) were located within introns, with the rest binding within 5’ UTRs (768, 11.7%) and 3’ UTRs (367, 5.60%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

Consistent with the results above and previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>), Srsf3 binding was enriched in exonic regions, as opposed to intronic regions, surrounding the splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). There was greater mean coverage of Srsf3 peaks in the +PDGF-AA condition versus the -PDGF-AA condition within 100 nucleotides upstream of the 5’ splice site and within 100 nucleotides downstream of the 3’ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Additionally, we detected decreased mean coverage in the +PDGF-AA condition within 25 nucleotides downstream of the 5’ splice site boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these data show that PDGFRα signaling leads to increased binding of Srsf3 to exons.

As such, we correlated the eCLIP peaks with AS events across all four treatment comparisons by identifying transcripts in which Srsf3 bound within an alternatively spliced exon or within 250 bp of the neighboring introns. In agreement with our findings above for the entire eCLIP dataset, Srsf3 exhibited differential binding in exons and surrounding the 5’ and 3’ splice sites upon PDGF-AA stimulation in these high-confidence, overlapping datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). We performed an unbiased motif enrichment analysis of Srsf3 peaks within the high-confidence, overlapping datasets, again revealing different motifs between ligand treatment conditions and an enrichment of GA-rich motifs in the +PDGF-AA samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether transcripts that are differentially bound by Srsf3 and undergo differential AS downstream of PDGFRα signaling contribute to shared biological outputs, we conducted GO analysis of the 149 unique transcripts from the high-confidence, overlapping datasets. The most significant terms for biological process involved protein phosphorylation and deacetylation, and RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Given that PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling is critical for craniofacial development and regulates AS in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klinghoffer et al., 2002</xref>), we turned our focus toward GO terms associated with this signaling pathway. We noted enrichment of PI3K-related GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), which encompassed the genes <italic>Becn1, Wdr81,</italic> and <italic>Acap3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Related to their roles in PI3K signaling, each of these gene products has been shown to regulate membrane and/or endocytic trafficking. Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) is a critical component of early endosomes and is mainly generated by conversion of phosphatidylinositol (PI) by the class III PI3K complex, which includes Beclin-1 (encoded by <italic>Becn1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wallroth and Haucke, 2018</xref>). WDR81 and Beclin-1 have been shown to interact, resulting in decreased endosomal PI(3)P synthesis, PI(3)P turnover, and early endosome conversion to late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, this role of WDR81 contributes to RTK degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rapiteanu et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, Acap3 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Arf6, converting Arf6 to an inactive, GDP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miura et al., 2016</xref>). Arf6 localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes, and has been shown to regulate endocytic membrane trafficking by increasing PI(4,5)P2 levels at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006</xref>). Further, constitutive activation of Arf6 leads to upregulation of the gene encoding the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and increased activity of both PI3K and AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yoo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Within our data, Srsf3 binding was increased in <italic>Becn1</italic> exon 7 upon PDGF-AA stimulation, at an enriched motif within the high-confidence, overlapping datasets, and we observed a corresponding increase in retention of adjacent intron 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). As <italic>Becn1</italic> intron 7 contains a premature termination codon (PTC), this event is predicted to result in nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in the absence of Srsf3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Srsf3 binding was also increased in <italic>Wdr81</italic> exon 8 in response to PDGF-AA treatment, and our analyses revealed a corresponding increase in excision of adjacent exon 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). Because <italic>Wdr81</italic> exon 9 encodes two WD-repeat domains, which are generally believed to form a β-propeller structure required for protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Roberts, 2001</xref>), this AS event is predicted to result in a protein missing a functional domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These splicing patterns predict increased levels of Beclin-1 and decreased levels of functional Wdr81 in the presence of Srsf3 and PDGF-AA stimulation, resulting in augmented early endosome formation. Srsf3 binding was additionally increased in <italic>Acap3</italic> exon 19 upon PDGF-AA stimulation, at an enriched motif within the high-confidence, overlapping datasets, and we observed a corresponding increase in excision of adjacent intron 19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

These findings further suggest that retention of PDGFRα in early endosomes leads to increases in downstream PI3K-mediated Akt signaling.

PDGF-AA-dependent differential gene expression was minimal following 1 hr of ligand treatment and led to increased expression of immediate early genes <italic>Klf10, Egf3,</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic>, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vasudevan et al., 2015</xref>) and in line with the enriched GO terms of regulation of transcription and DNA binding. Alternatively, PDGF-AA-dependent alternatively spliced transcripts were enriched for protein kinase activity, consistent with our prior AS findings upon disruption of PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling in the palatal shelf mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, our results demonstrated a significant dependence on the RBP Srsf3 for AS downstream of PDGFRα activation. In fact, we found that 88% of Srsf3-dependent and 99% of PDGF-AA-dependent alternatively spliced transcripts were responsive to both Srsf3 activity and PDGFRα signaling. As discussed above, Srsf3 is phosphorylated downstream of multiple stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bavelloni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dennison et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>), and it is likely that these additional inputs contributed to Srsf3-dependent AS that was non-responsive to PDGF-AA treatment. Further, our previous mass spectrometry screen identified 11 additional RBPs involved in AS that are phosphorylated by Akt downstream of PI3K-mediated PDGFRα signaling in primary MEPM cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fantauzzo and Soriano, 2014</xref>), which may account for the small fraction of PDGF-AA-dependent AS that was non-responsive to Srsf3 knockdown.

Alternatively, PDGF-AA ligand treatment led to an increase in the percentage of Srsf3-dependent transcripts with a -ΔPSI (exon included more often in shSrsf3 samples), suggesting that PDGFRα signaling causes decreased exon inclusion in the presence of Srsf3. Interestingly, a recent paper found that tethering Srsf3 downstream of the 5’ splice site or upstream of the 3’ splice site using MS2 stem loops did not lead to AS of a splicing reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmok et al., 2024</xref>). However, the assay did not test tethering within the exon and used a single minigene sequence context, and thus had the potential to lead to false negative results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmok et al., 2024</xref>). Whether phosphorylation of Srsf3 directly influences its binding to target RNAs or acts to modulate Srsf3 protein–protein interactions which then contribute to differential RNA binding remains to be determined, though findings from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schmok et al., 2024</xref> may argue for the latter mechanism. Studies identifying proteins that differentially interact with Srsf3 in response to PDGF-AA ligand stimulation are ongoing and will shed light on these mechanisms.</p><p>This study represents the first endogenous CLIP analysis of Srsf3 in the absence of protein tagging, and thus circumvents potential limitations with prior approaches in which assayed RBPs were overexpressed and/or fused to another protein. Our eCLIP analyses revealed several changes in Srsf3 transcript binding downstream of PDGF-AA stimulation, including increased Srsf3 binding to exons and loss of Srsf3 binding to canonical CA-rich motifs. A previous CLIP study using a stably integrated SRSF3-EGFP transgene in mouse P19 cells determined that SRSF3 binding was enriched in exons, particularly within 100 nucleotides of the 5’ and, to a lesser extent, 3’ splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with our results. This same study identified a CA-rich canonical SRSF3 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>). While such motifs were identified here in the absence of PDGF-AA treatment, they were lost upon ligand stimulation. Again, this shift could be due to loss of RNA binding owing to electrostatic repulsion and/or changes in ribonucleoprotein composition and will be the subject of future studies.</p><p>Our findings additionally pointed to novel properties of exons whose inclusion is dependent on Srsf3 in the absence of PDGFRα signaling. We demonstrated that these included exons had a higher GC content, a lower ratio of downstream intron to exon GC content, and a decreased ratio of upstream and downstream intron to exon length. These findings are consistent with previous results demonstrating that included exons tend to have higher GC content than the flanking introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amit et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, PDGF-AA ligand stimulation resulted in binding of Srsf3 to exons with a lower GC content, again suggesting that phosphorylation of the RBP downstream of this signaling axis promotes exon skipping.</p><p>By cross-referencing our RNA-seq and eCLIP datasets, we showed that 24% of the alternatively spliced transcripts across our four treatment comparisons had an Srsf3 eCLIP peak. As Srsf3 also has functions in the cytoplasm, such as RNA trafficking, translation, and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howard and Sanford, 2015</xref>), the additional eCLIP peaks may reflect alternate roles for Srsf3 in RNA metabolism. Conversely, Srsf3-mediated AS may be delayed following transcript binding in the short timeframe of our experimental design. However, the extent of overlap that we observed is in line with previous studies correlating alternatively spliced transcripts upon knockdown of an RBP with endogenous eCLIP results for that same RBP, including Rbfox2 (10%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moss et al., 2023</xref>) and LUC7L2 (18–26%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jourdain et al., 2021</xref>). The degree to which our RNA-seq and eCLIP datasets overlapped here points to the robustness and biological significance of our findings.</p><p>Our combined analyses demonstrated that Srsf3 binds and mediates the AS of transcripts that encode proteins that regulate PI3K signaling and early endosomal trafficking downstream of PDGFRα activation, including <italic>Becn1, Wdr81,</italic> and <italic>Acap3</italic>.

These data further confirm that our iMEPM model system served as a powerful platform to uncover mechanisms that are utilized during craniofacial development in vivo.</p><p>Our subsequent in vitro validation studies showed that Srsf3-mediated PDGFRα signaling results in enlarged early endosomes, retention of the receptor in these early endosomes, and increased downstream PI3K-mediated Akt signaling. Relatedly, we and others have linked spatial organization with the propagation of PDGFRα signaling, such that rapid internalization of the receptors into early endosomes or autophagy of the receptors are required for maximal phosphorylation of AKT downstream of PDGFRα activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rogers et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simpson et al., 2024</xref>). Together, these results indicate a feedback loop at play in the craniofacial mesenchyme in which stimulation of PDGFRα homodimer signaling leads to Srsf3-dependent AS of transcripts, a subsequent increase in the levels of proteins that maintain the receptor in early endosomes, and a corresponding decrease in the levels of proteins that promote trafficking of the receptor to late endosomes for eventual degradation. These findings thus represent a novel mechanism by which PDGFRα activity is maintained and propagated within the cell. Whether similar mechanisms exist downstream of alternate RTKs or contribute to increases in the phosphorylation of effector proteins other than Akt remain to be determined. In the future, it will be worthwhile to attempt to functionally link the AS of transcripts such as <italic>Becn1, Wdr81,</italic> and/or <italic>Acap3</italic> to the endosomal trafficking changes observed above using splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).</p><p>Taken together, our findings significantly enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which Srsf3 activity is regulated downstream of growth factor stimulation. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that retention of another shuttling SR protein, Srsf1, exclusively in the nucleus resulted in widespread ciliary defects in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haward et al., 2021</xref>). This finding indicates that dissecting nuclear from cytoplasmic functions of SR proteins can provide powerful insight into the physiological relevance of each.

After 24 hr, cells were serum starved and treated with 10 ng/mL PDGF-AA as described above. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and washed in PBS. Cells were blocked for 1 hr in 5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Inc) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4°C in primary antibody diluted in 1% normal donkey serum in PBS. After washing in PBS, cells were incubated in donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-absorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000; A21206; Invitrogen) or donkey anti-mouse IgG (H+L) highly cross-absorbed secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 546 (1:1000; A10036; Invitrogen) diluted in 1% normal donkey serum in PBS with 2 μg/mL DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 1 hr. Cells were mounted in VECTASHIELD HardSet Antifade Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc, Burlingame, CA) and photographed using an Axiocam 506 mono digital camera (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC, White Plains, NY) fitted onto an Axio Observer 7 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC) with the ×63 oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 at room temperature. The following antibodies were used for immunofluorescence analysis: Rab5 (1:200, C8B1, 3547, Cell Signaling Technology Inc), PDGFRα (1:20, AF1062, R&amp;D Systems). For assessment of Rab5 puncta size and colocalization experiments, three independent trials, or biological replicates, were performed. For each biological replicate, 20 technical replicates consisting of individual cells were imaged with Z-stacks (0.24 μm between Z-stacks with a range of 1–6 Z-stacks) per timepoint. Images were deconvoluted using ZEN Blue software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC) using the ‘Better, fast (Regularized Inverse Filter)’ setting. Extended depth of focus was applied to Z-stacks using ZEN Blue software (Carl Zeiss Microscopy LLC) to generate images with the maximum depth of field. For assessment of Rab5 puncta size, images were converted to 8-bit using Fiji software (version 2.14.0/1.54f). Images were subsequently converted to a mask and watershed separation was applied. A region of interest (ROI) was drawn around each Rab5-positive cell and particles were analyzed per cell using the ‘analyze particles’ function. For colocalization measurements, an ROI was drawn around each PDGFRα-positive cell in the corresponding Cy3 channel using Fiji. For each image with a given ROI, the Cy3 channel and the EGFP channel were converted to 8-bit images. Colocalization was measured using the Colocalization Threshold function, where the rcoloc value (PCC) was used in statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed on the average values from each biological replicate with Prism 10 (GraphPad Software Inc) using a two-way ANOVA followed by uncorrected Fisher’s LSD test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98531-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>.

The authors in this study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which PDGFRa signaling activates the RNA-binding protein Srsf3 to regulate alternative splicing (AS) and gene expression (GE) necessary for craniofacial development. PDGFRa signaling-mediated Srsf3 phosphorylation drives its translocation into the nucleus and affect binding affinity to different proteins and RNA, but the exact molecular mechanisms were not known. The authors performed RNA sequencing on immortalized mouse embryonic mesenchyme (MEPM) cells treated with shRNA targeting 3' UTR of Srsf3 or scramble shRNA (to probe AS and DE events that are Srsf3 dependent) and with and without PDGF-AA ligand treatment (to probe AS and DE events that are PDGFRa signaling dependent). They found that PDGFRa signaling has more effect on AS than on DE. A matching eCLIP-seq experiment was performed to investigate how Srsf3 binding sites change with and without PDGFRa signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The work builds well upon the previous data and the authors employ a variety of appropriate techniques to answer their research questions.</p><p>(2) The authors show that Srsf3 binding pattern within the transcript as well as binding motifs change significantly upon PDGFRa signaling, providing a mechanistic explanation for the significant changes in AS.</p><p>(3) By combining RNA-seq and eCLIP datasets together, the authors identified a list of genes that are directly bound by Srsf3 and undergo changes in GE and/or AS. Two examples are Becn1 and Wdr81, which are involved in early endosomal trafficking.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors identify two genes whose AS are directly regulated by Srsf3 and involved in endosomal trafficking; however, they do not validate the differential AS results and whether changes in these genes can affect endosomal trafficking. In Figure 6, they show that PDGFRa signaling is involved in endosome size and Rab5 colocalization, but do not show how Srsf3 and the two genes are involved.</p><p>(2) The proposed model does not account for other proteins mediating the activation of Srsf3 after Akt phosphorylation. How do we know this is a direct effect (and not secondary or tertiary effect)?</p><p>This is a thoroughly revised manuscript. I would like to congratulate the authors to have invested a lot of time, resources, new data, and a more refined discussion to make this a compelling piece of work. I have no further concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98531.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Forman</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sajek</surname><given-names>Marcin P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>Eric D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Philadelphia</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Neelanjan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fantauzzo</surname><given-names>Katherine A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In their manuscript &quot;PDGFRRa signaling regulates Srsf3 transcript binding to affect PI3K signaling and endosomal trafficking&quot; Forman and colleagues use iMEPM cells to characterize the effects of PDGF signaling on alternative splicing.

There are some concerns that should be considered, however.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for these supportive comments.</p><p>(1) It took some time to make sense of the number of DE genes across the results section and Figure 1. The authors give the total number of DE genes across Srsf3 control and loss conditions as 1,629 with 1,042 of them overlapping across Pdgf treatment. If the authors would add verbiage to the point that this leaves 1,108 unique genes in the dataset, then the numbers in Figure 1D would instantly make sense. The same applies to PDGF in Figure 1F and the Venn diagrams in Figure 2.</p><p>We have edited the relevant sentence for Figure 1D as follows: “There was extensive overlap (521 out of 1,108; 47.0%) of Srsf3-dependent DE genes across ligand treatment conditions, resulting in a total of 1,108 unique genes within both datasets (Fig. 1C,D; Fig. S1A).” Similarly, we edited the relevant sentence for Figure 1F as follows: “There was limited overlap (4 out of 47; 8.51%) of PDGF-AA-dependent DE genes across Srsf3 conditions, resulting in a total of 47 unique genes within both datasets (Fig. 1E,F; Fig. S1B).” We edited the relevant sentence for Figure 2B as follows: “There was limited overlap (203 out of 1,705; 11.9%) of Srsf3-dependent alternatively-spliced transcripts across ligand treatment conditions, resulting in a total of 1,705 unique events within both datasets (Fig. 2A,B).” Finally, we edited the relevant sentence for Figure 2D as follows: “There was negligible overlap (9 out of 622; 1.45%) of PDGF-AA-dependent alternatively-spliced transcripts across Srsf3 conditions, resulting in a total of 622 unique events within both datasets (Fig. 2C,D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The percentage of skipped exons in the +DPSI on the righthand side of Figure 2F is not readable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the label for the percentage of skipped exon events with a +DPSI for the -PDGF-AA vs +PDGF-AA (scramble) alternatively-spliced transcripts in Figure 2E so that it is legible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It would be useful to have more information regarding the motif enrichment in Figure 3. What is the extent of enrichment? The authors should also provide a more complete list of enriched motifs, perhaps as a supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added <italic>P</italic> values beneath the motifs in Figure 3F and 3G. Further, we have added a new Supplementary Figure, Figure S5, that lists the occurrence of the top 10 most enriched motifs in the unstimulated and, separately, stimulated samples in the eCLIP dataset and in a control dataset, as well as their <italic>P</italic> values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It is unclear what subset of transcripts represent the &quot;overlapping datasets&quot; on lines 280-315. The authors state that there are 149 unique overlapping transcripts, but the Venn diagram shows 270. Also, it seems that the most interesting transcripts are the 233 that show alternative splicing and are bound by Srsf3. Would the results shown in Figure 5 change if the authors focused on these transcripts?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct that 233 of the alternatively-spliced transcripts had an Srsf3 eCLIP peak, as indicated in Figure 5A. However, several of these eCLIP peaks were a large distance from an alternatively-spliced element in the rMATS datasets, indicating that Srsf3 binding may not be contributing to the splicing outcomes in these cases. Instead, we correlated the eCLIP peaks with AS events by identifying transcripts in which Srsf3 bound within an alternatively-spliced exon or within 250 bp of the neighboring introns. We have added additional text clarifying this point in the Results: “We next sought to identify high-confidence transcripts for which Srsf3 binding had an increased likelihood of contributing to AS. Previous studies revealed enrichment of functional RBP motifs near alternatively-spliced exons (Yee et al., 2019). As such, we correlated the eCLIP peaks with AS events across all four treatment comparisons by identifying transcripts in which Srsf3 bound within an alternatively-spliced exon or within 250 bp of the neighboring introns (Tables S12-S15).” Further, we have relabeled Figure 5B as “Highconfidence, overlapping datasets biological process GO terms”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In general, there is little validation of the sequencing results, performing qPCR on Arhgap12 and Cep55. The authors should additionally validate the PI3K pathway members that they analyze. Related, is Becn1 expression downregulated in the absence of Srsf3, as would be predicted if it is undergoing NMD?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two new figure panels, Figure 5F-5G, assessing <italic>Wdr81</italic> AS and Wdr81 protein sizes, as this gene has previously been implicated in craniofacial development. We have added the following text to the Results section: “Finally, as Wdr81 protein levels are predicted to regulate RTK trafficking between early and late endosomes, we confirmed the differential AS of <italic>Wdr81</italic> transcripts between unstimulated scramble cells and scramble cells treated with PDGFAA ligand for 1 hour by qPCR using primers within constitutively-expressed exons flanking alternatively-spliced exon 9. This analysis revealed a decreased PSI for <italic>Wdr81</italic> in each of three biological replicates upon PDGF-AA ligand treatment (Fig. 5F). Relatedly, we assessed the ratio of larger isoforms of Wdr81 protein (containing the WD3 domain) to smaller isoforms (missing the WD3 domain) via western blotting. Consistent with our RNA-seq and qPCR results, PDGFAA stimulation for 24 hours in the presence of Srsf3 led to an increase in smaller Wdr81 protein isoforms (Fig. 5G).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) What is the alternative splicing event for Acap3?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following text to the Results section and updated Figure 5E with <italic>Acap3</italic> eCLIP peak visualization and the predicted alternative splicing outcome: “Finally, Acap3 is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase Arf6, converting Arf6 to an inactive, GDP-bound state (Miura et al., 2016). Arf6 localizes to the plasma membrane and endosomes, and has been shown to regulate endocytic membrane trafficking by increasing PI(4,5)P2 levels at the cell periphery (D’Souza-Schorey and Chavrier, 2006). Further, constitutive activation of Arf6 leads to upregulation of the gene encoding the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and increased activity of both PI3K and AKT (Yoo et al., 2019)… Srsf3 binding was additionally increased in <italic>Acap3</italic> exon 19 upon PDGF-AA stimulation, at an enriched motif within the highconfidence, overlapping datasets, and we observed a corresponding increase in excision of adjacent intron 19 (Fig. 5D,E). As <italic>Acap3</italic> intron 19 contains a PTC, this event is predicted to result in more transcripts encoding full-length protein (Fig. 5E).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The insets in Figure 6 C&quot;-H&quot; are useful but difficult to see due to their small size. Perhaps these could be made as their own figure panels.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the size of the previous insets in new Figure 6 panels C’’’-H’’’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In Figure 6A, it is not clear which groups have statistically significant differences. A clearer visualization system should be used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added bracket shapes to Figure 6A indicating the statistically significant differences between scramble 0 minutes and scramble 60 minutes, and between scramble 60 minutes and shSrsf3 60 minutes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Similarly in Figure 6B, is 15 vs 60 minutes in the shSrsf3 group the only significant difference?

The authors in this study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which PDGFRa signaling activates the RNA-binding protein Srsf3 to regulate alternative splicing (AS) and gene expression (GE) necessary for craniofacial development. PDGFRa signaling-mediated Srsf3 phosphorylation drives its translocation into the nucleus and affects binding affinity to different proteins and RNA, but the exact molecular mechanisms were not known. The authors performed RNA sequencing on immortalized mouse embryonic mesenchyme (MEPM) cells treated with shRNA targeting 3' UTR of Srsf3 or scramble shRNA (to probe AS and DE events that are Srsf3 dependent) and with and without PDGF-AA ligand treatment (to probe AS and DE events that are PDGFRa signaling dependent). They found that PDGFRa signaling has more effect on AS than on DE. A matching eCLIP-seq experiment was performed to investigate how Srsf3 binding sites change with and without PDGFRa signaling.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The work builds well upon the previous data and the authors employ a variety of appropriate techniques to answer their research questions.</p><p>(2) The authors show that Srsf3 binding pattern within the transcript as well as binding motifs change significantly upon PDGFRa signaling, providing a mechanistic explanation for the significant changes in AS.</p><p>(3) By combining RNA-seq and eCLIP datasets together, the authors identified a list of genes that are directly bound by Srsf3 and undergo changes in GE and/or AS. Two examples are Becn1 and Wdr81, which are involved in early endosomal trafficking. We thank the Reviewer for these supportive comments.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors identify two genes whose AS are directly regulated by Srsf3 and involved in endosomal trafficking; however, they do not validate the differential AS results and whether changes in these genes can affect endosomal trafficking. In Figure 6, they show that PDGFRa signaling is involved in endosome size and Rab5 colocalization, but do not show how Srsf3 and the two genes are involved.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two new figure panels, Figure 5F-5G, assessing <italic>Wdr81</italic> AS and Wdr81 protein sizes, as this gene has previously been implicated in craniofacial development. We have added the following text to the Results section: “Finally, as Wdr81 protein levels are predicted to regulate RTK trafficking between early and late endosomes, we confirmed the differential AS of <italic>Wdr81</italic> transcripts between unstimulated scramble cells and scramble cells treated with PDGFAA ligand for 1 hour by qPCR using primers within constitutively-expressed exons flanking alternatively-spliced exon 9. This analysis revealed a decreased PSI for <italic>Wdr81</italic> in each of three biological replicates upon PDGF-AA ligand treatment (Fig. 5F). Relatedly, we assessed the ratio of larger isoforms of Wdr81 protein (containing the WD3 domain) to smaller isoforms (missing the WD3 domain) via western blotting. Consistent with our RNA-seq and qPCR results, PDGFAA stimulation for 24 hours in the presence of Srsf3 led to an increase in smaller Wdr81 protein isoforms (Fig. 5G).” The experiments in Figure 6 compare early endosome size, PDGFRa localization in early endosomes and phospho-Akt levels in response to PDGF-AA stimulation in scramble versus shSrsf3 cells, demonstrating that Srsf3-mediated PDGFRa signaling leads to enlarged early endosomes, retention of PDGFRa in early endosomes and increased downstream phospho-Akt signaling. Though we agree with the Reviewer that functionally linking the AS events to the endosomal phenotype would strengthen our conclusions, these are technically challenging experiments for several reasons. First, this approach has typically relied on tiling oligos against a region of interest to find the optimal sequence. We identified several transcripts that are bound by Srsf3 and undergo alternative splicing upon PDGFRa signaling to potentially contribute to the regulation of PI3K signaling and early endosomal trafficking. We do not expect that these effects are mediated by a single transcript but may instead by mediated by a combination of alternative splicing changes. As such, these experiments would require us to identify and validate multiple splice-switching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Second, ASOs designed against a specific target may not lead to alternative splicing of that target, even in cases of high predicted binding affinities (Scharner et al., 2020, <italic>Nucleic Acid Res</italic> 48(2), 802816). Third, ASOs have been shown to result in off-target mis-splicing effects, which are hard to predict (Scharner et al., 2020, <italic>Nucleic Acid Res</italic> 48(2), 802-816). The design of functional ASOs is thus a long-standing challenge in the field, and likely beyond the scope of this manuscript. We have added the following text to the Discussion to highlight this potential future direction: “In the future, it will be worthwhile to attempt to functionally link the AS of transcripts such as <italic>Becn1, Wdr81</italic> and/or <italic>Acap3</italic> to the endosomal trafficking changes observed above using spliceswitching antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The proposed model does not account for other proteins mediating the activation of Srsf3 after Akt phosphorylation. How do we know this is a direct effect (and not a secondary or tertiary effect)?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is introduced in the Discussion: “Whether phosphorylation of Srsf3 directly influences its binding to target RNAs or acts to modulate Srsf3 protein-protein interactions which then contribute to differential RNA binding remains to be determined, though findings from Schmok et al., 2024 may argue for the latter mechanism. Studies identifying proteins that differentially interact with Srsf3 in response to PDGF-AA ligand stimulation are ongoing and will shed light on these mechanisms…. Again, this shift could be due to loss of RNA binding owing to electrostatic repulsion and/or changes in ribonucleoprotein composition and will be the subject of future studies.” We have added a potential change in Srsf3 protein-protein interactions upon Akt phosphorylation in the model in Figure 6J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>(1) It would strengthen the paper and improve the connection with the other sections of the paper if the authors show:</p><p>a) validation of PDGFRa signaling leading to AS of Becn1 and Wdr81 and corresponding changes in protein, and</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two new figure panels, Figure 5F-5G, assessing <italic>Wdr81</italic> AS and Wdr81 protein sizes, as this gene has previously been implicated in craniofacial development.

The authors say that they correlated eCLIP peaks with GE or AS events across all four treatment comparisons. The purpose of looking at both datasets was to find genes that are directly bound by Srsf3 and also have significantly affected GE and/or AS. Therefore, the data with and without PDGF-AA should be considered separately. For example, eCLIP peaks in the PDGF-AA condition can be correlated to Srsf3-dependent AS differences (comparing shSrsf3 and scramble) in the -PDGF-AA condition, and eCLIP peaks in the +PDGF-AA condition can be correlated to Srsf3-dependent AS differences in the +PDGF-AA condition. In the Venn diagram and the description, it seems like all comparisons were combined and it is not clear how the data were analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated in Figure 5A, 233 of the alternatively-spliced transcripts uniquely found in one of the four treatment comparisons had an Srsf3 eCLIP peak. However, several of these eCLIP peaks were a large distance from an alternatively-spliced element in the rMATS datasets, indicating that Srsf3 binding may not be contributing to the splicing outcomes in these cases. Instead, we correlated the eCLIP peaks with AS events by identifying transcripts in which Srsf3 bound within an alternatively-spliced exon or within 250 bp of the neighboring introns. We have added additional text clarifying this point in the Results: “We next sought to identify highconfidence transcripts for which Srsf3 binding had an increased likelihood of contributing to AS. Previous studies revealed enrichment of functional RBP motifs near alternatively-spliced exons (Yee et al., 2019). As such, we correlated the eCLIP peaks with AS events across all four treatment comparisons by identifying transcripts in which Srsf3 bound within an alternativelyspliced exon or within 250 bp of the neighboring introns (Tables S12-S15).” Further, we have relabeled Figure 5B as “High-confidence, overlapping datasets biological process GO terms”. We respectfully disagree with the Reviewer’s suggested comparisons. A comparison of the PDGF-AA eCLIP data with the scramble vs shSrsf3 (-PDGF-AA) data from the list of highconfidence transcripts resulted in only 7 transcripts. Similarly, a comparison of the +PDGF-AA eCLIP data with the scramble vs shSrsf3 (+PDGF-AA) data from the list of high-confidence transcripts resulted in only 14 transcripts. Separate gene ontology analyses of these lists of 7 and 14 transcripts revealed 21 and 40 significant terms for biological process, respectively, the majority of which encompassed one, and never more than two, transcripts. Had we separately examined the -PDGF-AA and +PDGF-AA data, we would not have detected the changes in <italic>Becn1, Wdr81</italic> and <italic>Acap3</italic> in Figure 5E.</p></body></sub-article></article>
