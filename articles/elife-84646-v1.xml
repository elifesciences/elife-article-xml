This can be attributed to the amount of leptin in circulation being proportional to the amount of adipose tissue that an individual has (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Obradovic et al., 2021</xref>). After being secreted by fat cells in adipose tissue, leptin predominantly acts in the hypothalamus as a major regulator of energy balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morrison, 2009</xref>). Likewise, both neural and adipose tissues are known to play an important role in the molecular etiology of body mass index (BMI), which is conventionally used to clinically diagnose obesity. However, despite being a cost-effective approach to routinely measure adiposity at scale, BMI is a construct that captures multiple heterogeneous subcomponents. This is epitomized by previous investigations into the functional genes that exert their effects on adiposity via their expression in brain and adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Timshel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rask-Andersen et al., 2019</xref>), highlighting the divergent pathways that exist between BMI and downstream complex traits.</p><p>Mendelian randomization (MR) is a causal inference technique that can exploit the random segregation of genetic variants within a population to evaluate the genetically predicted effects of modifiable exposures on complex outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Richmond and Davey Smith, 2022</xref>). We recently extended the principles of MR to evaluate the separate effects of molecular subcomponents of BMI using genetic variants partitioned by their impact on gene expression derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and brain tissue (known as ‘tissue-partitioned MR’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leyden et al., 2022</xref>). Using this approach suggested that the brain-derived variants are predominantly responsible for driving the effect of BMI on cardiometabolic disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leyden et al., 2022</xref>), which we postulate is due to their involvement in appetite regulation and energy expenditure. These in turn influence the timelines and sites of adipose tissue distribution, which have more adverse consequences at the same level of BMI as do the processes influenced by the SAT-derived variants. Conversely, the SAT-derived set of instruments were predominantly responsible for the effect of BMI on outcomes such as endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leyden et al., 2023</xref>). Differences in components of adiposity at the same level of BMI have previously been demonstrated with these instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leyden et al., 2022</xref>), preserving the gene–environment equivalence assumption in MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey Smith, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to dissect the causal pathway between BMI and circulating leptin using tissue-partitioned MR by leveraging these brain- and adipose tissue-derived sets of instruments. However, investigating this hypothesis is made even more challenging given that associations between BMI and leptin levels have been reported as early in life as childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shalitin and Phillip, 2003</xref>). Therefore, to further develop insight into the relationship between BMI and circulating leptin, we additionally applied another extension that we have developed in recent years known as ‘lifecourse MR’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>). This approach allows the independent effects of childhood and adult adiposity to be simultaneously estimated on an outcome that can also be measured at separate timepoints in the lifecourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richardson et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanderson et al., 2022</xref>), such as childhood (mean age: 10 y) and adulthood (mean age: 55 y) measures of circulating leptin levels in this study. Taken together, we aimed to conduct a proof-of-concept study for these novel extensions of the conventional MR approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Lifecourse Mendelian randomization</title><p>Lifecourse MR has been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, genetic instruments derived in the UK Biobank study based on self-reported body size at age 10 and measured adulthood BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>) have been shown to separate clinically measured childhood and adult BMI in three independent cohorts (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [ALSPAC] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>], the Young Finns Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Richardson et al., 2021</xref>], and the Trøndelag Health (HUNT) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandkvist et al., 2021</xref>]). Both univariable and multivariable MR analyses on childhood leptin were conducted in a one-sample setting using individual-level data from ALSPAC by analyzing genetic risk scores with adjustment for age and sex. Univariable MR analyses to estimate total effects on adulthood leptin were undertaken in a two-sample setting using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgess et al., 2013</xref>), as well as the weighted median and MR-Egger methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bowden et al., 2016</xref>). Multivariable MR analyses on adulthood leptin were also performed in a two-sample setting to estimate the direct and indirect effects of childhood body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanderson et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Tissue-partitioned Mendelian randomization</title><p>Instrument derivation and methodology for tissue-partitioned MR has also been described in detail previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Leyden et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, 86 independent adult BMI-associated instruments provided evidence of sharing a causal variant with proximal gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue through genetic colocalization analyses (based on a posterior probability [PPA] &gt; 0.8). The same approach provided evidence that the effects of 140 adult BMI instruments are putatively mediated by a nearby gene’s expression in brain tissue. These two sets of genetic variants have near identical average effect sizes on BMI (adipose = 0.0148 and brain = 0.0149 standard deviation [SD] change in BMI per effect allele), although the manner in which they relate to other anthropometric traits can markedly differ. For instance, we previously found that the brain tissue instruments were more strongly correlated with waist-to-hip ratio compared to the adipose–tissue instruments (<italic>r</italic> = 0.733 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.445, respectively, p<sub>comparison</sub>=0.001). Likewise, the brain tissue set was more highly correlated than the adipose set with a measure of visceral adipose tissue from the UK Biobank study (<italic>r</italic> = 0.554 and <italic>r</italic> = 0.254, respectively, p<sub>comparison</sub>=0.009), further suggesting that the way in which these tissue-partitioned sets of variants exert their effects on BMI likely varies in terms of biological pathways.</p><p>Univariable and multivariable MR analyses on childhood leptin measured in ALSPAC were undertaken as above in a one-sample setting by aggregating the tissue-partitioned BMI instruments as genetic risk scores and analyzing childhood leptin with adjustment for age and sex. Estimates on adulthood leptin were initially evaluated in a two-sample setting using the three univariable MR methods mentioned above, and subsequently using an extension of multivariable MR with instruments weighted by their PPA values for each tissue type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leyden et al., 2023</xref>).

The study methods are described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boyd et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fraser et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, 14,541 pregnant women residents in the former region of Avon, UK, with an expected delivery date between April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, were eligible to take part in ALSPAC. Of these initial pregnancies, there was a total of 14,676 fetuses, resulting in 14,062 live births and 13,988 children who were alive at 1 y of age.

Written informed consent was obtained for all study participants. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees. Childhood measures of circulating leptin levels were obtained from non-fasting blood samples taken from ALSPAC participants at mean age 9.9 y (range = 8.9–11.5 y). Leptin was measured by an in-house ELISA validated against commercial methods. Analyses in ALSPAC were undertaken on a final sample size of 4155 individuals after removing those without genetic data and withdrawn consent.</p><p>A further sensitivity analysis of body composition was conducted on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and skinfold measures obtained from the ALSPAC study. Trunk and total body DXA measures of lean, bone, and fat mass were obtained for ALSPAC participants at mean age 9.9 y (range = 8.9–11.5 y) as above. Skinfold thickness measures were available for 576 ALSPAC participants assessed at the 61-mth clinic (mean age 5.2 y) by skinfold caliper. The mean of three measurements was obtained for biceps, triceps, subscapular and suprailiac skinfold thickness.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Adulthood estimates for circulating leptin and fat distribution</title><p>Genetic estimates on adulthood circulating leptin levels were obtained from a study of 10,708 individuals enrolled in the Fenland study. Full details have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pietzner et al., 2021a</xref>). Leptin was measured using the SomaScan v4 assay, which applies single-stranded oligonucleotides aptamers with specific binding affinities to protein targets. This assay has also been reported to provide a very highly correlated measure of circulating leptin using the antibody-based Olink platform (<italic>r</italic> = 0.95) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pietzner et al., 2021b</xref>). The Fenland study was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (NRES Committee-East of England Cambridge Central, ref 04/Q018/19). All participants provided written informed consent. Although effect estimates from these summary-level data can be interpreted as a 1-SD change in normalized plasma leptin levels, we note that direct comparisons between estimates derived from childhood measures of leptin in ALSPAC should not be drawn given the various sources of heterogeneity between these measures.</p><p>We also obtained genetic estimates on adulthood circulating leptin levels from a previously conducted large-scale study of 35,559 individuals enrolled in the deCODE Health study (mean age: 55 y, SD: 17 y).

This was followed by applying multivariable MR, which provided evidence that childhood body size has a direct effect on increased leptin levels at this point in the lifecourse (β = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.90–1.30, p=6 × 10<sup>–28</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>).

Whilst there is irrefutable evidence that having a higher BMI increases circulating levels of leptin, these two extensions of MR methodology provide insight into lifecourse-specific effects and the tissues of action underlying this etiological relationship. We propose that these approaches can be conducted to build upon the findings by conventional MR analyses, which use naturally occurring genetic variants as causal anchors to help establish and estimate the causal effect of modifiable exposures on complex outcomes and disease endpoints.</p><p>Our application of lifecourse MR in this work supports a breadth of previous research using this technique, which highlights the importance of taking into consideration the age at which data from participants for exposure and outcome datasets are analyzed. Findings from this study provide evidence that adiposity in childhood exerts a direct effect on leptin levels when measured in early life, corroborating findings from observational studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shalitin and Phillip, 2003</xref>). Conversely, evidence of an indirect effect along the causal pathway involving adulthood adiposity was found when analyzing leptin measured in later life. This provides a powerful proof of concept for this approach, which has previously found evidence of a direct effect of increased childhood adiposity on lower risk of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Richardson et al., 2020</xref>), elevated risk of type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richardson et al., 2022a</xref>), and an influence on cardiac structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">O’Nunain et al., 2022</xref>). Evidence supporting indirect effects using this approach, as in this study for adulthood leptin, has been found previously for various cardiovascular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Power et al., 2021</xref>) and site-specific cancer endpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mariosa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Papadimitriou et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, in the multivariable MR analysis of childhood adiposity on childhood leptin, we found that the effect of adulthood adiposity, despite attenuating in comparison to univariable MR estimates, still provided some evidence of an indirect influence. However, within a lifecourse model an effect of adulthood adiposity on childhood leptin levels is impossible given that an adulthood risk factor cannot influence a trait measured at an earlier stage in the lifecourse. We therefore investigated this residual effect of the adulthood adiposity genetic score on in-depth measures of childhood adiposity using data from the age 10 clinic of the ALSPAC study. Similar evidence of a residual effect of the adulthood genetic score on childhood measured DXA-assessed fat mass was found in these analyses, whereas a direct effect of childhood adiposity was found on skinfold measures. These analyses further complement the study design of leveraging both individual- and summary-level data within an MR framework to develop more granular insight into the underlying etiological pathways between risk factors and complex traits. This residual influence of the adulthood BMI score on childhood leptin suggests that the aspects of childhood adiposity that relate to the adulthood genetic score in the multivariable analyses independently of the childhood score importantly influence leptin in childhood. In similar analyses for childhood vitamin D no such relationship was seen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Richardson et al., 2022b</xref>). This suggests that different aspects of childhood body composition influence circulating vitamin D and leptin levels, and demonstrates how cognisance of the gene-environment equivalence assumption in MR can motivate improved understanding of genotype to phenotype associations.</p><p>Tissue-partitioned MR analyses in this work suggest that the subcomponent of BMI proxied using genetic variants whose effects are putatively mediated via gene expression in brain tissue are predominantly responsible for driving effects of adiposity on leptin during both childhood and adulthood. We postulate that these findings highlight a role for appetite regulation and energy expenditure mechanisms as of fundamental importance in the effect of adiposity on leptin levels. This corroborates findings from the literature, which suggest that being overweight has a downstream consequence on elevated leptin levels due to leptin resistance occurring in the central nervous system, particularly the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gruzdeva et al., 2019</xref>). This is influenced by factors such as blood–brain barrier permeability, which results in leptin failing to suppress appetite and consequently leads to circulating hyperleptinemia amongst patients with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Izquierdo et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together with the evidence of an indirect effect highlighted by our lifecourse MR analysis, these findings suggest that leptin may have long-term consequences for appetite suppression. This in turn has an influence on excess body weight, which may start in childhood and then can be sustained into later life. Future research in this space should investigate large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) outcomes related to subcutaneous adipose tissues (e.g. skinfold thickness), particularly given that this is where leptin is primarily produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Russell et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Fractionating genetic instruments for the same exposure using molecular datasets has important considerations for the (often overlooked) gene–environment equivalence assumption in MR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey Smith, 2012</xref>). This states that the effect of germline genetic perturbations should have the same downstream consequence on outcomes as if they were caused by the modifiable exposures themselves. For the adipose- and brain tissue-partitioned sets of instruments used in this study, we found previously that the manner in which they relate to downstream disease and complex traits can drastically differ despite having almost identical average effect estimates on BMI as an exposure. In particular, this finding underlines the heterogeneous nature of BMI as a lifestyle risk factor and highlights that this human-derived construct likely captures various causal pathways underlying the relationship between anthropometry and complex outcomes. For example, we previously found evidence that the brain tissue-derived variants are predominantly responsible for the effect of BMI on both cigarette smoking and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leyden et al., 2023</xref>). We emphasize that future application of tissue-partitioned MR should carefully consider both the exposure and functionally relevant tissue types being investigated, as well as ensuring that the derived instrument sets are equally predictive of the exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Leyden et al., 2023</xref>). In particular, applications of a combined approach using both lifecourse and tissue-partitioned MR will likely be most powerful for exposures that have been analyzed by GWAS in large samples at distinct timepoints in the lifecourse (e.g. childhood and adulthood) where the functionally important tissue types have been well characterized by previous studies.</p><p>We note that both lifecourse and tissue-partitioned MR have important caveats. For instance, the childhood and adult body size instruments used to disentangle direct and indirect effects in this study do not provide insight into other timepoints over the lifecourse (e.g. adolescence). Future efforts should focus on deriving instruments to separate effects of age-specific adiposity at more granular windows over the lifecourse. Moreover, the childhood adiposity instruments are based on recall data, which is why they required validation in three independent cohorts as described in the ‘Methods’ section. In addition, tissue-partitioned instruments were derived using bulk tissue in this work due to the availability of data and therefore do not take into account cell-type heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glastonbury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Prince et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, as with all estimates derived from MR, triangulating findings from other orthogonal lines of evidence derived using different study design and datasets provides the most robust conclusions for the approaches applied in this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Munafò and Davey Smith, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our findings highlight a putative role for genes expressed in neural tissues in the etiology of adiposity and leptin levels during both childhood and adulthood. Furthermore, this innovative study provides a proof of concept into how the principles of MR can be adapted to investigate the hypotheses outside the scope of how this causal inference technique was originally conceived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davey Smith and Ebrahim, 2003</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>TGR is an employee of GlaxoSmithKline outside of this work</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>ALSPAC: Written informed consent was obtained for all study participants.

randomization studies (1) lifecourse MR which relates the genetic instruments to the outcome, eg obesity, at different stages of life eg childhood, and adulthood and (2) tissue partitioned MR to determine if the genetic instruments have different effects on different tissues such as the brain and adipose tissue. They combine these approaches to investigate the influence of adiposity on circulating leptin in order to demonstrate the value/proof of concept of these techniques in extending the use of MR. This is very clearly presented and well conducted work showing both important new methodology and clear-cut results and so providing compelling evidence on the impact of adiposity at age 10 and in middle life and the weight gain in between on leptin levels and that the effect is mediated via the brain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84646.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Janus</surname><given-names>Edward D</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01ej9dk98</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Janus</surname><given-names>Edward D</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01ej9dk98</institution-id><institution>University of Melbourne</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Manousaki</surname><given-names>Despoina</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01gv74p78</institution-id><institution>CHU Sainte-Justine</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.11.29.22282906">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.29.22282906v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

A bidirectional MR of Steiger filtering in the forward MR could answer this question.</p><p>Below are my point-by-point comments:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>Methods: When the authors say in the results: &quot;along the causal pathway&quot;, do they mean that they adjusted for adult body size in multivariable MR? If yes, please add this to the methods section of the abstract.</p><p>The units of change in exposure that confer the betas in the leptin outcome are not exposed in the abstract or in the manuscript (see additional comment on this below). This raises a challenge in directly comparing the two betas (ie in the childhood vs adulthood MR analysis).</p><p>In the conclusion, the phrase &quot;as well as raising implications for the gene-environment equivalence assumption in MR&quot;. It is not clear how this phrase is justified by the analyses presented in the abstract. It is explained in the discussion of the paper, but I would suggest omitting it from the abstract conclusion.</p><p>Some specifications are needed in regards to the exposure and the outcome of GWAS sources.</p><p>For the exposure GWAS: In the BMJ paper cited as the source of the SNPs for adult and childhood body size, it is described that adult body size was measured based on the measured body mass index during adulthood (mean age 56.5) while child body mass was self-reported perceived body size at age 10. This is important information that should appear in the methods section of the manuscript. This leads to the question, could the fact that the IVs for measuring adult vs child body mass were based on a different method of estimating body size explain the difference we see in the results of the lifecourse MR? I understand that these IVs successfully predicted adult vs child BMI in 3 cohorts, but the measure of the exposure conferred by the genetic instrument in adults vs children is different. This should be highlighted in the methods, Results section and as a limitation of this study.</p><p>In terms of the outcome GWAS:</p><p>In line 105, could the authors specify how were leptin levels measured in ALSPAC? Was the method the same as that in DECODE? If the method was different, could this as well induce any bias in the MR estimates?</p><p>In terms of comparison between ALSPAC and DECODE, the Icelandic population of DECODE may have a distinct genetic architecture from ALSPAC or other European cohorts. This could introduce bias due to population stratification when using instruments for the exposure that comes from European meta-analyses. Is there another adult proteomic GWAS with available leptin levels which can be used to replicate the results in DECODE?</p><p>Line 138: in the multivariable MR analyses, which were the other variables tested as exposures (ie other than the adiposity variants for children or adults?) -this part should be clarified in both methods and Results section. I understand that adulthood and childhood body size were the two exposure variables, based on the DAGs in Figure 1. It would be helpful to put the DAGs in the two boxes entitled &quot;Genetic variants&quot; the GWAS source of the genetic variants and specify: &quot; genetic variants for adulthood adiposity&quot; or &quot;genetic variants for childhood adiposity&quot; depending on the analysis. Also, could the authors explain in the legend the interpretation of the colours of the arrows (ie black vs red?).</p><p>Line 144: Could the authors specify if in the tissue partitioned MR analysis the IVs were for adult BMI?</p><p>Line 167: in the phrase: &quot;We firstly estimated the total effect of childhood adiposity on circulating leptin using data measured in ALSPAC participants at mean age 9.9 years in the lifecourse&quot;, please specify that you are referring to a univariate MR analysis.</p><p>In Tables S3 and S5, please provide the p-value of the intercept of the MR-Egger, as well as the Cohrane Q p-values for IVW and MR-Egger, and based on these results, please comment on the presence or absence of evidence of pleiotropy in the IVs used in the MR analyses.</p><p>Discussion: It would be nice to further elaborate on the hypothesis explaining the finding in regards to the indirect effect of childhood adiposity on adult leptin levels. In line 239, the authors explain this finding by &quot;individuals in a population remaining overweight for many years in the lifecourse&quot;. The effect of early-life adiposity remains after adjustment for adult adiposity. Can the results of the tissue-partitioned MR (in terms of the sole effect of brain BMI SNPs on leptin levels in childhood vs a composite effect of adipose and brain tissue IVs on adult leptin levels) inform us on a possible hypothesis explaining the above phenomenon? Could early-life adiposity be associated with specific hypothalamic responses persisting in adulthood?</p><p>In regards to the sensitivity analysis on the effect of tissue-partitioned BMI on visceral vs subcutaneous fat, the authors could provide further explanation on the relationship between leptin secretion and fat distribution providing a rationale for this analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84646.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It might not fit directly with the proof of concept aim of the manuscript, but this study could be a nice opportunity to test the opposite association, ie if leptin affects adiposity at different life stages.

Leptin was measured using the SomaScan v4 assay which applies single-stranded oligonucleotides aptamers with specific binding affinities to protein targets. This assay has also been reported to provide a very highly correlated measure of circulating leptin using the antibody based Olink platform (r=0.95) (25). The Fenland study was approved by the National Health Service (NHS) Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (NRES Committee-East of England Cambridge Central, ref. 04/Q018/19). All participants provided written informed consent.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In terms of comparison between ALSPAC and DECODE, the Icelandic population of DECODE may have a distinct genetic architecture from ALSPAC or other European cohorts. This could introduce bias due to population stratification when using instruments for the exposure that comes from European meta-analyses. Is there another adult proteomic GWAS with available leptin levels which can be used to replicate the results in DECODE?</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this suggestion. Since this manuscript was submitted, a protein GWAS study conducted in the Fenland study has made their full summary statistics available (Pietzner et al., Science (2021)). We have there now undertaken an additional analysis using Leptin data derived from the UK based Fenland cohort which we have included as our primary analysis, with deCODE analyses still included as a further validation analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 138: in the multivariable MR analyses, which were the other variables tested as exposures (ie other than the adiposity variants for children or adults?) -this part should be clarified in both methods and Results section. I understand that adulthood and childhood body size were the two exposure variables, based on the DAGs in Figure 1. It would be helpful to put the DAGs in the two boxes entitled &quot;Genetic variants&quot; the GWAS source of the genetic variants and specify: &quot; genetic variants for adulthood adiposity&quot; or &quot;genetic variants for childhood adiposity&quot; depending on the analysis. Also, could the authors explain in the legend the interpretation of the colours of the arrows (ie black vs red?).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified in the figure legends that multivariable MR analyses requires genetic variants for all exposures to be modelled simultaneously (as well as interpretation regarding the colours of arrows).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 144: Could the authors specify if in the tissue partitioned MR analysis the IVs were for adult BMI?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified on page 6 that these IVs were based on adult BMI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 167: in the phrase: &quot;We firstly estimated the total effect of childhood adiposity on circulating leptin using data measured in ALSPAC participants at mean age 9.9 years in the lifecourse&quot;, please specify that you are referring to a univariate MR analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated this sentence accordingly (page 9):</p><p>“We firstly conducted univariable MR to estimate the total effect of childhood adiposity on circulating leptin using data measured in ALSPAC participants at mean age 9.9 years in the lifecourse (Β=1.28 per 1-standard deviation (SD) change in leptin levels per change in body size category, 95% CI=1.10 to 1.46, P=2x10<sup>-41</sup>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Tables S3 and S5, please provide the p-value of the intercept of the MR-Egger, as well as the Cohrane Q p-values for IVW and MR-Egger, and based on these results, please comment on the presence or absence of evidence of pleiotropy in the IVs used in the MR analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>These additional statistics have been added to Supplementary Tables and referenced on page 12:</p><p>“Cochran’s Q-statistics for these analyses, as well as those derived in Lifecourse MR analyses, can be found in Supplementary File 1l, along with intercept terms for MR-Egger analyses which did not suggest horizontal pleiotropy may be biasing conclusions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: It would be nice to further elaborate on the hypothesis explaining the finding in regards to the indirect effect of childhood adiposity on adult leptin levels. In line 239, the authors explain this finding by &quot;individuals in a population remaining overweight for many years in the lifecourse&quot;. The effect of early-life adiposity remains after adjustment for adult adiposity. Can the results of the tissue-partitioned MR (in terms of the sole effect of brain BMI SNPs on leptin levels in childhood vs a composite effect of adipose and brain tissue IVs on adult leptin levels) inform us on a possible hypothesis explaining the above phenomenon? Could early-life adiposity be associated with specific hypothalamic responses persisting in adulthood?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added some further discussion regarding this point to page 16:</p><p>“Taken together with the evidence of an indirect effect highlighted by our lifecourse MR analysis, these findings suggest that leptin may have long term consequences for appetite suppression.
