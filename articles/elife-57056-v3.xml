Thoracic tracheoblasts are arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle in an ATR (mei-41)-Checkpoint Kinase1 (grapes, Chk1) dependent manner prior to mitotic re-entry. Here we investigate developmental regulation of Chk1 activation. We report that Wnt signaling is high in tracheoblasts and this is necessary for high levels of activated (phosphorylated) Chk1. We find that canonical Wnt signaling facilitates this by transcriptional upregulation of Chk1 expression in cells that have ATR kinase activity. Wnt signaling is dependent on four Wnts (Wg, Wnt5, 6,10) that are expressed at high levels in arrested tracheoblasts and are downregulated at mitotic re-entry. Interestingly, none of the Wnts are dispensable and act synergistically to induce Chk1. Finally, we show that downregulation of Wnt signaling and Chk1 expression leads to mitotic re-entry and the concomitant upregulation of Dpp signaling, driving tracheoblast proliferation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>tracheoblasts</kwd><kwd>Wnt</kwd><kwd>G2 arrest</kwd><kwd>Checkpoint Kinase I</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>inStem Core Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guha</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>InStem Core Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guha</surname><given-names>Arjun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Wnts can act synergistically to affect G2 arrest via transcriptional upregulation of a Checkpoint Kinase in the absence of any detectable DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The development of a single cell into a multicellular organism is achieved by a highly regulated process of cell proliferation. Cells divide at the appropriate time and place or remain paused either in the G1/G0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheung and Rando, 2013</xref>) or G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouldin and Kimelman, 2014</xref>) phases of the cell cycle. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms that regulate developmental G2 arrest.</p><p>The transition from G2 to M occurs via a mechanism that is conserved from yeast to humans. Mitotic entry is triggered by the activation of the Cyclin-dependant kinase 1 (Cdk1/Cdc2)-Cyclin B complex. Upon activation, the Cdc2-Cyclin B complex phosphorylates substrates in the cytoplasm and nucleus and prepares the cell for mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouldin and Kimelman, 2014</xref>). The activation of the Cdc2-Cyclin B complex is dependent on the dephosphorylation of Cdc2 by the phosphatase Cdc25. Mechanisms regulating developmental G2 arrest have been studied extensively in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnston and Edgar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayeni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Otsuki and Brand, 2018</xref>) and more recently in Zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). An emerging theme is that cells paused in G2 lack the essential drivers of G2-M such as Cdc25 and Cyclin B respectively.</p><p>Our studies on G2 arrest have focused on the progenitors of the thoracic tracheal (respiratory) system of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> (tracheoblasts). Tracheoblasts arrest in G2 for a period of ~56 hr during larval life and then enter mitosis at the onset of pupariation. The tracheoblasts, and the tracheae they comprise, grow in size while arrested (increase ~11 fold in volume) and undergo rapid size-reductive divisions thereafter (cell division time ~10 hr)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>). Contrary to other models of developmental G2 arrest in <italic>Drosophila,</italic> tracheoblasts express all the drivers necessary for G2-M and utilize a different mechanism for G2 arrest. We have shown previously that tracheoblasts co-opt the ATR (mei-41)/Chk1(Grapes) DNA damage checkpoint pathway for the induction of G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>). Loss of ATR/Chk1 results in tracheoblasts initiating mitoses precociously.</p><p>What remained unclear in this study is the mechanism by which the ATR/Chk1 axis is controlled. Although the activation of ATR/Chk1 has typically been associated with DNA damage, there was no evidence for DNA damage in arrested tracheoblasts.</p><p>Developmental signals coordinate G2 arrest and G2-M by controlling the expression of positive regulators of G2-M. For example, a pulse of <italic>Drosophila</italic> steroid hormone Ecdysone has been shown to induce the expression of Cdc25/<italic>Stg</italic> mRNA in imaginal histoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ninov et al., 2009</xref>). Along these lines, the Notch and Wnt signaling pathways repress the expression of <italic>Stg</italic> in neural precursors in the wing imaginal disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnston and Edgar, 1998</xref>). More recently, a study on neural stem cells has found that Insulin signaling upregulates Stg protein levels via repression of Tribbles expression; Tribbles is a kinase that targets Stg for proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Otsuki and Brand, 2018</xref>). These studies led us to investigate the possibility that developmental signaling pathways control the activation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway in tracheoblasts.</p><p>To identify signals that regulate ATR/Chk1, we knocked down the components of each of ten developmental signaling pathways that regulate cell proliferation and growth and examined whether these perturbations result in precocious mitotic re-entry. We found that perturbations in Wnt signaling led to premature cell division akin to Chk1 mutants. This led us to examine the role of the Wnt signaling pathway in the regulation of the ATR/Chk1 pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Wnt signaling is required for G2 arrest in Tr2 tracheoblasts</title><p>The tracheal branches of the second thoracic metamere (Tr2) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva are comprised of cells that also serve as the progenitors of the thoracic tracheal system of the adult animal. These tracheoblasts remain quiescent through most of larval life and rekindle a mitotic program prior to pupariation. Tracheoblasts in the Dorsal Trunk (DT) in Tr2 enter larval life in G1, transition from G1 to S to G2 in the first larval instar (L1) and remain arrested in G2 from second instar (L2) till 32–40 hr into third larval instar (L3) whereupon they re-enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref>). These cells express high levels of Chk1 mRNA and phosphorylated Chk1 (pChk1) during the period in which they are paused in G2 and downregulate levels of Chk1 mRNA and pChk1 upon mitotic re-entry.

Of the abovementioned signaling pathways, downregulation of components of the Wnt pathway resulted in precocious proliferation at 16–24 h L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). These findings led us to examine more carefully the role of Wnt signaling in the activation of the ATR/Chk1 axis in tracheoblasts.</p><p>The Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway regulates many different developmental processes in metazoans. Wnt genes encode secreted proteins that can act as signaling molecules and morphogens. The Wnt pathway is activated upon the binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled (Fz) receptors. Ligand-receptor engagement leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic phosphoprotein Dishevelled (Dsh). Phosphorylated Dsh antagonizes an intracellular complex that targets β-Catenin for degradation. The consequent stabilization of β-Catenin facilitates its translocation to the nucleus where it binds the TCF/LEF family of transcription factors and initiates the transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bejsovec, 2006</xref>). Apart from this ‘canonical’ mechanism, there are ‘non-canonical’ mechanisms for Wnt signaling that do not require β-Catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zhan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Swarup and Verheyen, 2012</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the role of Wnt signaling in tracheoblasts, we knocked-down the abovementioned components of the pathway in the trachea by RNA interference and examined the timing of mitotic re-entry. To establish the timecourse of cell proliferation in the tracheae we utilized two assays. First, we counted the numbers of tracheoblasts in Tr2 DT at L2 and at 16–24 h L3. Second, we quantified the frequencies of phospho-histone H3<sup>+</sup> (pH3<sup>+</sup>) mitotic figures. Knockdown of <italic>Fz2, Dsh and TCF (Pangolin)</italic> did not affect numbers of tracheoblasts in L2 but led to increased numbers at 16–24 h L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,n</xref> ≥ 7 tracheae per timepoint here and in all subsequent figures showing cell frequencies, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In our hands, the knockdown of <italic>Drosophila</italic> β-Catenin (<italic>Armadillo (Arm)</italic>) in the tracheal system from embryonic stages resulted in embryonic lethality. Thus, to characterize the role of β-Catenin in tracheoblasts at larval stages we knocked-down <italic>Arm</italic> expression in the trachea specifically at larval stages using the temperature sensitive Gal4-UAS-gal-80<sup>ts</sup> system (see schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Briefly, control (<italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+; UAS-Arm<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>/<italic>Tb)</italic> and <italic>Btl-Arm<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<italic>tub-GAL80<sup>ts</sup>/+; btl-GAL4/UAS-Arm<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) animals were grown at 18°C till 0–2 h L3 and moved to 29°C for 24 hr. The animals were dissected at 24–26 h L3 and the cell numbers in Tr2 DT were counted. Knockdown of <italic>Arm</italic> did not perturb numbers of cells in Tr2 DT in L2 but led to increased numbers of cells at 24 h L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,n</xref> ≥ 7 tracheae per condition, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Apart from quantifying cell numbers at L2 and early L3, we assayed mitotic activity by immunostaining with an antibody against phosphorylated Histone H3 (pH3), a marker for cells undergoing mitosis. We found increased frequencies of pH3<sup>+</sup> figures at early L3 in all backgrounds in which we observed increased numbers of cells at early L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). We also examined the timecourse of cell proliferation throughout L3 in wild type, Chk1 and Wnt pathway mutants. We found that tracheoblasts in Wnt pathway mutants, akin to Chk1 mutants, enter mitosis precociously and continue cell division thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, the cell proliferation assays show that loss of Wnt signaling leads to precocious mitotic re-entry and proliferation.</p><p>Next, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of Wnt signaling in Tr2 DT during larval stages. For this, we examined the expression of two reporters for Wnt signaling (<italic>Frizzled3 (Fz3)</italic>-GFP and <italic>Naked</italic> (Nkd)-lacZ) at L2, 0–8 h L3 and 32–40 h L3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Sivasankaran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tian et al., 2016</xref>). Immunostaining using anti-GFP and anti-β-gal antisera respectively revealed that levels of expression of <italic>fz3-GFP</italic> and <italic>nkd-lacZ</italic> were high at L2 and 0–8 h L3 and significantly lower at 32–40 hr into L3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, n = 6 tracheae per condition per experiment, n = 2).

The subsequent timecourse of cell proliferation in these mutants reveals that tracheoblasts that enter mitosis prematurely in L3 continue to divide post mitotic re-entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The reason that Wnt/Chk1-deficient tracheoblasts continue to divide after exiting G2 arrest was unclear to us. A previous study has identified Dpp (the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of TGF-β) as the signal required for proliferation of tracheoblasts post mitotic re-entry. Dpp signaling is initiated by the binding of the ligand (Dpp) to the receptor Serine/Threonine Kinase Thickveins (Tkv). This in turn leads to the phosphorylation of the transcriptional activator Mad. Phosphorylated Mad (pMad) translocates to the nucleus and regulates gene expression. Pertinently, an earlier study on tracheoblasts showed that Dpp signaling (pMad immunostaining) was undetectable in cells in G2 arrest and observed mid L3 onwards once the cells start dividing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Djabrayan and Casanova, 2016</xref>). In light of the proliferation in Chk1 and Wnt pathway mutants, we examined the levels of Dpp signaling in these mutant backgrounds prior to and post mitotic re-entry.</p><p>As reported previously, pMad immunostaining was undetectable in L2 and early L3 (0–8 h L3 and 16–24 h L3) and nuclear localized at 32–40 h L3, once the cells entered mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

We have previously reported that arrested tracheoblasts, and the tracheae they comprise, grow significantly during the period in which the cells are arrested in G2.

In this study we have investigated the mechanism for Chk1 activation in tracheoblasts. We find that Chk1 is transcriptionally upregulated in arrested tracheoblasts by the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and that this upregulation is sufficient to induce arrest. Our studies reveal that Wnt signaling is activated by four Wnt ligands - <italic>Wg, Wnt5, Wnt6, Wnt10 –</italic> that are all expressed in the tracheoblasts. We show that all four ligands are required for Chk1 upregulation and that the temporal expression of the ligands is also under transcriptional control. <italic>Wg, Wnt5, Wnt6,</italic> and <italic>Wnt10</italic> are high when the cells are arrested in G2 and low at the time the cells enter division.</p><p>A fascinating aspect of Wnt signaling in the trachea is that as many as four ligands appear to be required for G2 arrest; <italic>Wg, Wnt5, Wnt6</italic> and <italic>Wnt10</italic> are all necessary. The loss of any one of the ligands leads to a reduction in Chk1 mRNA levels in tracheoblasts comparable with the knockdown of TCF. Interestingly, our data also show that these 4 Wnts act redundantly to regulate <italic>Fz3</italic> in the same cells. We hypothesize that the ligands act synergistically to maintain a threshold of Wnt signaling necessary for <italic>Chk1</italic> expression.

Preliminary expression profiling of the larval tracheal system has indicated that both Derailed and Doughnut, RYK family receptors that mediate non-canonical Wnt signaling, are expressed (AG, AK unpublished). This suggests that Wnt5 could act either directly or indirectly to facilitate canonical Wnt signaling in tracheoblasts.</p><p>The role of the Wnt pathway in activation of the ATR/Chk1 axis in a developmental context has, to the best of our knowledge, not been reported previously. However, there is evidence that Wnt signaling can induce the DNA damage checkpoint and G2 arrest in chemo/radio resistant tumors. Radioresistant tumor cells exhibit higher levels of Wnt signaling that leads to upregulation of Myc expression and in turn Chk1/2 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). It is plausible that Wnt-dependent upregulation of Chk1 evidenced here and in other contexts could be a general mechanism for the activation of a G2 checkpoint.</p><p>The mechanism for G2 arrest in Tr2 tracheoblasts is intimately linked with growth. Tr2 tracheoblasts switch from hypertrophic growth to hyperplastic growth during larval life. The balance between these modes of growth determines tracheal size at the onset of pupariation. We have shown that withdrawal of negative regulators like Wnt/Chk1 leads to a precocious switch from hypertrophy to hyperplasty and to a reduction in tracheal size. An unusual feature of G2 arrest in tracheoblasts is that the concomitant expression of both positive and negative cell cycle regulators. We show here that the juxtaposition of positive and negative regulators is essential for hypertrophic growth and that the withdrawal of either positive or negative regulators perturbs growth. These findings could be broadly relevant to growth control in other systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>btl-GAL4</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Shiga et al., 1996</xref></td><td valign="top">FLYB: FBtp0001208</td><td valign="top">This line was a gift from Dr.Shigeo Hayashi</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-Chk1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">VDRC</td><td valign="top">110076</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-TCF<sup>RNAi</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">VDRC</td><td valign="top">3014</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>UAS-Chk1</italic></td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kizhedathu et al., 2018</xref> and <break/>This paper</td><td valign="top">FLYB: FBgn0261278</td><td valign="top">Developed using clone from DGRC: UFO05423</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Phospho-Chk1 (Ser345)</td><td valign="top">CST</td><td valign="top">2348</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Tyramide signal amplification system</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">B40922</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and handling</title><p>The following strains were obtained from repositories: <italic>TubGAL80<sup>ts</sup>; TM2/TM6b,Tb, UAS-FUCCI, UAS-Wnt2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (29441)<italic>, UAS-Wnt4<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (29442)<italic>, UAS-Wnt5<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (28534), <italic>UAS-Wnt6<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (30493), <italic>UAS-WntD<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (28947)<italic>, UAS-Wnt10<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (31989), <italic>UAS-CyclinB<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (34544), <italic>UAS-Stg<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (29556), <italic>nkd-lacZ, Chk1-LacZ, fz3-GFP, UAS-ArmS10, UAS-Tkv<sup>QD</sup>, Wnt6 KO, Wnt5<sup>400</sup>, Wg<sup>ts</sup></italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center), <italic>UAS-Chk1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (110076), <italic>UAS-TCF<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (3014), <italic>UAS-Fz2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (44391), <italic>UAS-Wg<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (13352), <italic>UAS-Wnt10<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (100867)<italic>, UAS-Dsh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (101525), <italic>UAS-Arm<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (7767)<italic>, UAS-Cdc2<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (106130) (Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> Resource Center), <italic>UAS-Chk1</italic> (In-house fly facility).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce Edgar (Reviewer #2); Greg Beitel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript entitled &quot;Multiple Wnts act synergistically to induce Chk1/Grapes expression and mediate G2 arrest in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheoblasts,&quot; Kizhedathu and colleagues investigate the developmental regulation of Chk1 activation in larval tracheoblasts of the Dorsal Trunk segment Tr2. They find that four Wnt ligands are required to achieve a level of active Chk1 (pChk1) needed to maintain tracheoblasts in G2 arrest. This regulation is achieved by autocrine signaling in which the canonical Wnt pathway is activated by 4 Wnt ligands expressed in the trachea at high levles. Wnt signaling is required for transcription of Chk1. None of the 4 highly expressed Wnts are dispensable. Release from G2 is required for activation of the Dpp/Tkv/pMad pathway that spurs continuing cell divisions.</p><p>This is a Research Advance manuscript following up on work reported in a prior publication entitled &quot;Negative regulation of G2-M by ATR/Chk1 (Grapes) facilitates tracheoblast growth and tracheal hypertrophy in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.&quot; The current work makes several important contributions. Having initially identified a G2 cell cycle arrest dependent on Chk1 and ATR, but not upon DNA damage, the authors now show that the cell cycle arrest is maintained through a canonical Wnt signal that mediates transcription of Chk1 mRNA. The authors identify 4 Wnt ligands expressed in the tracheoblasts and show that all 4 are required for G2 maintenance via Chk1 transcription, although individually dispensable for <italic>fz3</italic> transcription. The authors also show that the Dpp pathway signal required to drive tracheoblast cell divisions cannot operate during G2 cell cycle arrest. Lastly, authors note that Wnt5 is thought to signal through a nonconical pathway, but in this instance contributes to canonical signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Additional controls to confirm the requirement for 4 Wnts</p><p>– Is there any chance that there are off target effects from the RNAi that may cause this? Do the Wnt ligands impact each other’s expression? Wnt ligand KD followed by qPCR analysis of the Wnt ligands could be useful. This issue is important to discuss, and test.</p><p>– Test of second independent RNAi line where classic loss of function alleles are not available.</p><p>– Test RNAi of the non-expressed Wnt ligands and addition of a supplemental table documenting the screen (Wnt and other pathways) with RNAi line numbers, drivers, temperatures and results.</p><p>2) Clarify ability of overexpressed Wnts to rescue, and determine the requirement for nonconical Wnt pathway</p><p>– Address whether derailed or doughnut are required in tracheoblasts.</p><p>– Authors Wnt threshold model hinges on ability of overexpressed Wnt to compensate for loss of one Wnt ligand. However, this was only reported for one loss of function case (Wnt 6 RNAi), and only with one overexpressed Wnt (Wnt5). Authors should test ability of other Wnts to rescue and should also address whether a conventional Wnt can substitute, when overexpressed, for Wnt5.</p><p>3) Address inhibition of mitoses during L2:</p><p>– The authors show that downregulating the Wnt pathway in L2 stage does lead to the reduction of Chk1 mRNA (Figures 3A and 2, respectively), but that this does not result in tracheoblast mitoses. This indicates that in L2, in contrast to L3, there must be some additional control which is lifted after L2/L3 metamorphosis. The authors should discuss this issue and present possible explanations. If they have any more relevant data, this should also be presented.</p><p>4) Move Figure 5—figure supplement 1 into Results.</p><p>– Discussion paragraph four. Minimally, it is not appropriate to introduce data in the discussion that is not discussed in the main Results section. Moreover, the experiments and results are super interesting. I could be wrong because I am not an expert in the cell cycle, but I don't think the idea of a G2 arrested cell continuing to grow physically because it still expresses cell cycle promoting genes while in G2 arrest is really out there in the literature on cell and organ size control (although I think mammalian oocytes arrest in G2 and they get really big, but they also may have bridges to nurse-like cells to supplement growth). As such, I would strongly encourage the authors to make Figure 5—figure supplement 1 part of the main figures and discuss the basic findings in the Results section.

Neither the knockdown of Derailed nor Doughnut leads to precocious mitotic entry. While this does not eliminate the possibility that the non-canonical Wnt signalling pathway has a role in mediating G2 arrest, we have found no evidence for this.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57056-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Authors Wnt threshold model hinges on ability of overexpressed Wnt to compensate for loss of one Wnt ligand. However, this was only reported for one loss of function case (Wnt 6 RNAi), and only with one overexpressed Wnt (Wnt5). Authors should test ability of other Wnts to rescue and should also address whether a conventional Wnt can substitute, when overexpressed, for Wnt5.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we have tested whether <italic>Wnt10</italic> overexpression can rescue the Btl-Wn6 RNAi phenotype. We find that the overexpression of <italic>Wnt10</italic> can also rescue the loss of Wnt6. Together with the data that <italic>Wnt5</italic> overexpression can also rescue the <italic>Btl-Wnt6<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotype, these findings suggest that one Wnt can compensate for another.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Address inhibition of mitoses during L2:</p><p>– The authors show that downregulating the Wnt pathway in L2 stage does lead to the reduction of Chk1 mRNA (Figures 3A and 2, respectively), but that this does not result in tracheoblast mitoses. This indicates that in L2, in contrast to L3, there must be some additional control which is lifted after L2/L3 metamorphosis. The authors should discuss this issue and present possible explanations. If they have any more relevant data, this should also be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>There is indeed an additional mechanism of negative control that is lifted after the L2/L3 molt. In our earlier paper (Kizhedathu et al., 2018) we showed that induction of a constitutively active Cdc2 (Cdc2<sup>AF</sup>) cannot induce mitoses in L2 but can after the L2/L3 molt. We have reason to think that this additional layer of control could be linked to mitochondrial dynamics. We find that the mitochondria are fused in L2 and fragment immediately after the molt. We are currently investigating how mitochondrial dynamics are regulated and how these dynamics impact the cell cycle program. These findings are beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Move Figure 5—figure supplement 1 into Results.</p><p>– Discussion paragraph four. Minimally, it is not appropriate to introduce data in the discussion that is not discussed in the main Results section. Moreover, the experiments and results are super interesting. I could be wrong because I am not an expert in the cell cycle, but I don't think the idea of a G2 arrested cell continuing to grow physically because it still expresses cell cycle promoting genes while in G2 arrest is really out there in the literature on cell and organ size control (although I think mammalian oocytes arrest in G2 and they get really big, but they also may have bridges to nurse-like cells to supplement growth). As such, I would strongly encourage the authors to make Figure 5—figure supplement 1 part of the main figures and discuss the basic findings in the Results section. Then it could be revisited in the Discussion section to put the result in the bigger picture context.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
