reactivation. They are spread by community-acquired infection of free virus (acqHHV6A/6B) and by germline transmission of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6A/6B (iciHHV-6A/6B) in telomeres. We exploited a hypervariable region of the HHV-6B genome to investigate the relationship between acquired and inherited virus and revealed predominantly maternal transmission of acqHHV-6B in families. Remarkably, we demonstrate that some copies of acqHHV-6B in saliva from healthy adults gained a telomere, indicative of integration and latency, and that the frequency of viral genome excision from telomeres in iciHHV-6B carriers is surprisingly high and varies between tissues. In addition, newly formed short telomeres generated by partial viral genome release are frequently lengthened, particularly in telomerase-expressing pluripotent cells. Consequently, iciHHV-6B carriers are mosaic for different iciHHV-6B structures, including circular extra-chromosomal forms that have the potential to reactivate. Finally, we show transmission of an HHV-6B strain from an iciHHV-6B mother to her non-iciHHV-6B son. Altogether, we demonstrate that iciHHV-6B can readily transition between telomere-integrated and free virus forms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>excision</kwd><kwd>integration</kwd><kwd>human herpesvirus 6</kwd><kwd>latency</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIBTP 1645656</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Michael L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0901657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Nicola J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010395</institution-id><institution>HHV-6 Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pilot grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royle</surname><given-names>Nicola J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP 123214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flamand</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7-242209- BIOSTAT-CHF</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voors</surname><given-names>Adriaan A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UU_12014/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davison</surname><given-names>Andrew J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human herpesvirus 6B can transition between telomere-integrated and free viral forms, and frequent telomere-loop-driven partial or complete viral genome excision events create mosaicism in germline carriers of inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6B.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human herpesviruses 6A and 6B (HHV-6A/6B; species <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 6A</italic> and <italic>Human betaherpesvirus 6B</italic>) are closely related viruses, sharing approximately 90% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablashi et al., 2014</xref>). Their genomes comprise a unique region (U) of approximately 140 kb flanked on each side by a direct repeat (DR) of approximately 8 kb (DR<sub>L</sub> on the left and DR<sub>R</sub> on the right). A tandem repeat reiteration is located near each end of DR. T1 at one end of DR consists of 1–8 kb of telomere (TTAGGG) and degenerate telomere-like repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindquester and Pellett, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). T2 at the other end of DR is much shorter and contains only (TTAGGG) repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Achour et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). HHV-6A/6B have the capacity to integrate into human telomeres, most likely through a homology-dependent recombination mechanism facilitated by the perfect telomere repeats in T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbuckle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wallaschek et al., 2016b</xref>). The precise integration mechanism has not been defined, and searches for regulatory viral or host factors are underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gilbert-Girard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gilbert-Girard et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wallaschek et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wight et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>HHV-6A/6B infect over 90% of the global population in early childhood; this usually manifests with mild symptoms but nevertheless often requires medical attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Asano et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hall et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kondo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Ward and Gray, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zerr et al., 2005</xref>). As with most herpesviruses, HHV-6A/6B enter lifelong latency following primary infection, and the most serious impacts on health appear to occur when the virus reactivates. Reactivation of free virus acquired in the community (acqHHV-6A/6B) has been shown to cause viral encephalitis, drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome/drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DIHS/DRESS), and acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aihara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eshki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pritchett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Prusty, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yoshikawa et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, HHV-6A infection has been associated with multiple sclerosis and other chronic neurological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yao et al., 2010</xref>). Herpesviruses typically achieve latency by forming circular DNA episomes within specific cell types, but HHV-6A/6B episomes have not been detected and it has been proposed that latency of these viruses is achieved through telomeric integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbuckle et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>As a result of historical germline integrations into telomeres, approximately 1% of the population carries inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6A/6B (iciHHV-6A/6B), usually with a full-length copy of the viral genome in every cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbuckle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daibata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Leong et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tanaka-Taya et al., 2004</xref>). HHV-6A/6B appear to have the potential to integrate into any telomere; however, most contemporary instances of iciHHV-6A/6B are derived from a relatively small number of ancient integrations in a limited number of chromosome ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aswad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greninger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). For example, iciHHV-6B is commonly found integrated into the telomere on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p) in populations of European descent and iciHHV-6A is commonly found in the long arm of chromosome 22 (22q) in Japan. Integration sites have been determined in a variety of studies by one or a combination of the following methods: fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), PCR amplification from subterminal sequences adjacent to human telomeres (subtelomere) into the viral genome, inverse PCR and comparison with known subtelomere sequences, long-read sequencing, and optical genome mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daibata et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Luppi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nacheva et al., 2008</xref>); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aswad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greninger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawamura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miura et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wight et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Detection of viral gene expression in some iciHHV-6A/6B carriers has raised the possibility of a deleterious impact on the individual’s health over their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peddu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Strenger et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the presence of a large viral genome within a telomere has been shown to cause localized instability that may influence telomere DNA damage signaling and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wood and Royle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

Telomeres are terminated by a single-stranded 3′ overhang that can strand-invade into the upstream double-stranded telomeric DNA to form a telomere loop (t-loop) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doksani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Griffith et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).

Typically, multiple STELA reactions, each containing low quantities of genomic DNA (usual range 250–1000 pg or 38–152 cell equivalents per PCR), are conducted in parallel and processed by Southern blot hybridization to detect amplified telomere molecules of various lengths. The data collected from each STELA reaction is pooled to estimate average telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jeyapalan et al., 2008</xref>). Previously, we used STELA to detect and measure the length of iciHHV-6A/6B-associated telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>). To determine whether some copies of acqHHV-6B are integrated into telomeres, we aimed in this study to detect these potentially rare events using STELA in samples that had low but measurable levels of HHV-6B DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given the low abundance of HHV-6B in these samples, the quantity of saliva DNA added to each STELA PCR was increased (range 2–5 ng or 300–760 cell equivalents per PCR) and up to 900 parallel STELA reactions were processed. In addition, an aliquot of each completed STELA PCR was diluted and subjected to a second round of nested PCR with primers DR421R and TJ1F to amplify DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1. Successful amplification in the second round confirmed that an HHV-6B-associated telomere had been amplified in the primary STELA round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Sanger sequencing was used to verify the DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 repeat patterns from STELA products matched that amplified in bulk genomic DNA from the donor. Various steps were taken to avoid false-positive results. These include the use of newly designed STELA primers for these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and conducting STELA on genomic DNA from the HT1080 cell line (HHV-6A/6B negative) to check for potential non-specific amplification from another telomere or elsewhere in the human genome. No STELA products were generated from HT1080 among 900 STELA reactions, total 4.5 μg DNA screened. This two-step STELA procedure, conducted on DNA from six saliva and two kidney samples, identified a small number of amplicons from some samples with acqHHV-6B (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The proportion of HHV-6B genomes from which a telomere was amplified was estimated using the HHV-6B copy number per cell (determined by ddPCR) and by estimating the number of cell equivalents of DNA used per STELA reaction, assuming 6.6 pg DNA per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For the eight samples analyzed, an average of 0.95% (range 0–1.98%) of HHV-6B genomes resulted in pvT1 amplification, indicative of telomeric integration. The low copy number of HHV-6B in these samples, combined with reduced PCR amplification efficiency of longer molecules (telomeres in this case), has a stochastic effect on the potential to detect an HHV-6B-associated telomere in each STELA reaction. For these reasons, the error rate associated with detection of acqHHV-6B-associated telomere is undetermined and the integration frequencies should be interpreted cautiously.</p><p>We then sought to measure the proportion of acqHHV-6B genomes that are <italic>not</italic> integrated in saliva samples, using ddPCR to quantify the copy numbers of DR and PAC1.

For the iciHHV-6B samples used in this study, T2 ranged in length from 16 to 31 telomere repeats (96–186 bp).

Genomic DNA from two iciHHV-6B individuals (1B-iciHHV-6B and 4B-11p15.5) was digested with combinations of restriction enzymes that cut in the unique region and DR (X: SacI and PstI), only the unique region (Y: XbaI and ScaHF), or were not treated with restriction enzymes.

Amplicons of variable length were detected reflecting different lengths of telomere repeat arrays expected in individual DR circles. Restriction digestion with SacI/PstI, including between DR8F(A/B) and T2, prevents amplification from DR circles.

Repeats patterns were color coded and aligned as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The majority of iciHHV-6B genomes (24/35, 68.6%) showed differences between DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1, usually as loss or gain of a small number of hexameric telomere (TTAGGG) or degenerate telomere-like repeats. In a smaller number of cases, a single base change converted one repeat type to another. Regions containing CTAGGG repeats were most prone to loss or gain of repeats. Where differences between DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 were detected in multiple iciHHV-6B genomes from the same integration group (boxed), the differences were rarely the same between individuals. This indicates that the differences arose after integration. Interestingly, 9q iciHHV-6B genomes did not display any variation between DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70452-fig6-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>First, the iciHHV-6B-associated telomeres were amplified using STELA with low input of genomic DNA per parallel reaction (500 pg/reaction) and in the presence of the DR1R primer that can generate products from a telomere at DR<sub>L</sub>-T1 (from normal, full-length iciHHV-6B) or DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 (following U-DR excision). Second, to distinguish between these STELA products, the PCR amplicons were subjected to nested PCR to amplify DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The sizes of the pvT1 amplicons indicated whether the STELA products in the primary PCR had been derived from telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub> or DR<sub>R</sub>, and selected sequencing was used to confirm they contained the expected DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 pattern of repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The size difference between the DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 amplicons is usually small, influencing the ability to size-separate the amplicons. Consequently, 10 iciHHV-6B samples, with larger pvT1 size differences, were selected and truncations at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 were detected in all. In summary, the frequency of newly formed telomeres at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 varied between samples (0.0002–0.0029 per cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Generation of DR-only iciHHV-6B by partial excision of full-length iciHHV6-B genomes in the germline</title><p>The frequency of truncations and new telomere formation at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 in sperm DNA from iciHHV-6B carriers raised the strong possibility that such events could explain how individuals may inherit integrations consisting only of DR (DR-only iciHHV-6A/6B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohye et al., 2014</xref>).

Comparison of pvT1 repeat patterns suggested shared ancestry between these individuals with DR-only iciHHV-6B and those with full-length iciHHV-6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate this, attempts were made to amplify and sequence the subtelomere-iciHHV-6B junction, based on previously described junction fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tweedy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) and using primers that anneal in the subtelomeric regions of various chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Using this approach, we found that the DR-only iciHHV-6B in SAL018 and KEN071 share the common 17p (major) subtelomere-iciHHV-6B junction that is also found in 801018, d44, and others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Similarly, the pattern of telomere and degenerate repeats across a subtelomere-iciHHV-6B junction (amplified by subtelomere primer 2p2) in the DR-only iciHHV-6B sample 308006 closely matched those in full-length iciHHV-6B individuals 401027 and 410005 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The existence of shared integration sites for the full-length and DR-only iciHHV-6B carriers at two different chromosome ends clearly establishes that the DR-only status has arisen independently, on at least two occasions, by loss of U and one copy of DR in the germline of an ancestor with a full-length iciHHV-6B genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Evidence of viral transmission from iciHHV-6B carrier mother to non-iciHHV-6B son</title><p>It has been shown that iciHHV-6A can reactivate in an immune-compromised setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Endo et al., 2014</xref>) and there is evidence of transplacental transmission of reactivated iciHHV-6A/6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gravel et al., 2013</xref>).

This has shown that most iciHHV-6A/6B genomes in populations are derived from a small number of ancient telomere-integration events. Here we have expanded the number of sequenced iciHHV-6A/6B genomes from individuals in Europe and North America and developed the web-based HHV-6 Explorer that can be used to interrogate diversity and functionality between inherited and acquired HHV-6A or HHV-6B genomes. The HHV-6 Explorer includes the sequence of 84 complete or nearly complete iciHHV-6A/6B genomes representative of the various known clades in the phylogenetic network and genome sequences from 28 HHV-6A/6B viruses circulating in populations. Using the HHV-6 Explorer, we displayed two mutations that introduced stop codons in U79 in three of seven iciHHV-6A samples in the 17p clade and in U14 in one of three iciHHV-6B samples in the 17p (minor) clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that each mutation arose after integration. The presence of an inactivating iciHHV-6A/6B mutation in some but not all descendants of a particular ancestral integration event adds a further complication to understanding the potential lifetime risk for individual iciHHV-6A/6B carriers.</p><p>The relationship between iciHHV-6A/6B carrier status and potential associated disease risk may also be influenced by interactions between the integrated viral genome and genes or chromatin on the chromosome carrying the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gravel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wood and Royle, 2017</xref>). It is therefore important to have a rapid method to distinguish between viral strains and integration sites, which is offered by the hypervariable pvT1 region in HHV-6B. pvT1 is a complex repeat region comprising a variety in degenerate repeats, variation in repeat number, and the interspersed nature of different repeats. Nevertheless, pvT1 length variation is mostly attributable to the diverse interspersion of (CTAGGG) and canonical (TTAGGG) telomere repeat sequences in the central region of pvT1 amplicons. Notably, short blocks of (CTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats are highly unstable in human telomeres in somatic and germline cells, probably due to replication errors and in vitro studies showed that (CTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats bind efficiently to POT1, a component of Shelterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barrientos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baumann and Cech, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lange, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loayza et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mendez-Bermudez et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, pvT1 in iciHHV-6B and acqHHV-6B will mutate at different rates and have interconnected but different evolutionary histories, influenced by viral genome integration and excision rates that are currently unknown. Consequently, comparative analysis of the DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 repeat patterns was achieved manually by dividing the pattern of repeats into the proximal, central, and distal regions with respect to the DR421 primer. Where possible, distinctive motifs that distinguish between the pvT1 repeat patterns of various ciHHV-6B clades were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) and these were informed by known relationships between iciHHV-6B genomes based on whole genome sequence similarity, subtelomere-iciHHV-6B junctions, and FISH. Furthermore, the presence of a particular motif in DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 in a single iciHHV-6B genome indicated that the pattern was present at integration, and this was a useful aid to defining the pvT1 repeat pattern for the clade. As pvT1 repeat patterns from additional samples with known phylogenetic relationships become available, an automated analysis of pvT1 is desirable. Nevertheless, from the data presented it is clear that DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 repeat patterns can be used in many cases as a rapid and inexpensive way to predict the phylogenetic clade and integration site of an iciHHV-6B genome.</p><p>DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 analysis is also an excellent tool for tracking acqHHV-6B transmission in families as shown by the evidence that community-acquired HHV-6B transmission usually occurs between family members, with maternal transmission most common. We showed that DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 repeat patterns can be used effectively to discriminate between HHV-6B strains circulating in communities (61/63 different DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 sequences in saliva from healthy non-iciHHV-6B donors in the UK). In the future, DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 analysis could be used to trace patterns of transmission more generally. This may be particularly important in the setting of organ and tissue transplants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hill, 2019</xref>). For example, reactivation of iciHHV-6B from a donor tissue could be monitored and differentiated from HHV-6B acquired by the recipient in early childhood or to identify cases of multiple infections by different strains of HHV-6B.</p><p>The iciHHV-6B and free HHV-6B viruses in communities must have evolutionary histories that are interlaced, but these are difficult to disentangle as there is little understanding of HHV-6B telomeric integration and iciHHV-6B excision and reactivation. The current picture indicates a modest number of ancient iciHHV-6B clades (in Europe and North America at least) some of which are accumulating mutations that could prevent full reactivation (discussed above). There is also at least one example of an iciHHV-6B genome with high-sequence homology to a group of genome sequences from acqHHV-6B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aswad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greninger et al., 2018</xref>), which complicates interpretation of HHV-6B phylogenetic relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forni et al., 2020</xref>). Indirectly this suggests that some modern circulating strains retain the capacity for germline integration into telomeres and inheritance or that iciHHV-6B can reactivate and be transmitted, re-entering the reservoir of circulating strains. We demonstrated that some copies of HHV-6B in saliva acquire a telomere, indicative of integration in somatic cells in vivo and as previously detected in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arbuckle et al., 2010</xref>). The viral load in the saliva samples was low, as seen in some other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leibovitch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Leibovitch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Turriziani et al., 2014</xref>), and the number of HHV-6B genomes with a telomere was small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), which is consistent with the majority of HHV-6B genomes present as viral particles in saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jarrett et al., 1990</xref>). The approach we used to detect telomeric integration in saliva could, in principle, be used to detect HHV-6B integration events in sperm from healthy non-iciHHV-6B men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Neofytou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Godet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kaspersen et al., 2012</xref>). This would address the outstanding question of whether current HHV-6B strains circulating in communities can integrate in the germline.</p><p>Previously we have proposed that iciHHV-6A/6B genomes can be excised from telomeres in a one- or two-step process as by-products of t-loop processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wood and Royle, 2017</xref>). In this study, we measured the frequency of iciHHV-6B excision events, by detection of novel telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 and for the first time at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1, in unrelated iciHHV-6B carriers and in different tissues and cell types. The frequencies of iciHHV-6B truncations at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 (range, 0.014–0.0031 per cell) and DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 (range, 0.0002–0.0029 per cell) are not directly comparable because they were ascertained by different approaches that have different efficiencies, but both are surprisingly high in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). This demonstrates that tissues in iciHHV-6B carriers must be mosaic for different compositions of the iciHHV-6B genome. The telomeres formed at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 were expected to be particularly short, limited to the length of the (TTAGGG) repeat array at T2. However, a cell with a small number of very short telomeres will elicit a telomere-mediated DNA damage response and entry into cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cesare et al., 2013</xref>; d'<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">d’Adda di Fagagna et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Lange, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Takai et al., 2003</xref>) so preventing proliferation of a cell with a potentially unstable residual iciHHV-6B genome. It is therefore remarkable that a high percentage of newly formed telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 were lengthened. The frequency of DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomere lengthening was highest in circulating white blood cells and in two pluripotent cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) consistent with lengthening by telomerase. From these observations and the increase in viral genome excision events in TSA-treated cells, we also propose that iciHHV-6A/6B genomes are more likely to be excised and reactivated in undifferentiated or pluripotent cells. By extrapolation, the potential for iciHHV-6A/6B genome excision, viral gene expression, or full reactivation has the potential to be deleterious during early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miura et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we present two lines of evidence that iciHHV-6B genome can be excised and re-enter the reservoir of circulating HHV-6B strains. First, we identified individuals with full-length iciHHV-6B or DR-only genomes that fall into the same clade in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). These integrated full-length iciHHV-6B or DR-only genomes share similar pvT1 repeat patterns and subterminal-iciHHV-6B junction sequences. This demonstrates that the different iciHHV-6B structures are carried in the same telomere-allele at the particular chromosome end, and it proves that these DR-only carriers have arisen by germline excision of U-DR in an ancestor. The fact that this has occurred independently at least twice suggests that this is a relatively common event, and this is supported by our evidence that new telomere formation at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 occurs at a measurable frequency in sperm DNA. Second, we show an example of probable reactivation of iciHHV-6B in a mother with transmission to her son, who carries a very low load of acqHHV-6B with the same distinctive DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 repeat pattern in his saliva.

As the copy number of acqHHV-6B was low and telomere integration events expected to be lower, various precautions were introduced for these experiments. STELA reactions were set up in a room previously unused for any STELA or HHV-6 experiments. In addition to avoid contamination with previously generated iciHHV-6A/6B STELA products, STELA primers with new barcodes (Telorette2BC28/Teltail2BC38) and a new a flanking primer (DR2RSTELA) were used. The DR2RSTELA primer anneals upstream of the DR1R primer used for other iciHHV-6A/6B STELA reactions, so preventing amplification of any previously generated STELA amplicons. STELA reactions were set up as above, but as the acqHHV-6B copy number was low in these samples, the quantity of genomic DNA added was increased to 2–5 ng per reaction and cycled 25 times as above. To test that the higher DNA input did not inhibit the potential to amplify an HHV-6B-associated telomere (if present), optimization experiments were undertaken. These included dilution of genomic DNA from an iciHHV-6B cell line (one copy per cell) with increasing quantities (0, 100, 500, 1000, and 5000 pg per PCR) of DNA from the HT1080 cell line (HHV-6A/6B negative) followed by STELA in multiple parallel reactions.

Mann–Whitney test was used to compare unpaired groups of ranked data obtained from assays conducted on DNA derived from the same biological sample type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and F</xref>). Wilcoxon test was used to compare paired groups of data obtained from treated and untreated samples. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (version 9.0, GraphPad Software). Outliers were not removed from data sets.

manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Human Herpesvirus 6A (HHV6A) and 6B are common herpesviruses that establish lifelong infection in latent form and can cause severe disease upon reactivation. They are spread by acquired infection of free virus and by germ-line transmission of inherited chromosomally-integrated HHV-6A/6B in telomeres. The authors develop an approach to analyse a hypervariable region of the HHV-6B genome and exploit it to investigate the relationship between acquired and inherited virus, presenting evidence that HHV-6B can readily transition between telomere-integrated and free virus forms. These findings enhance our understanding of the intricate interplay between chronic viruses and their host.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Variation in Human Herpesvirus 6B telomeric integration, excision and transmission between tissues and individuals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benedikt B. Kaufer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The issues raised by the reviewers are mostly technical and require clarifications and slight modifications but not additional experiments. Overall, the manuscript is written well but some aspects in the presentation (size of the figures, naming of samples, labeling) should be improved to ease reading of this complex work. The authors should also clarify the validation of the PCR methods used to measure viral genomes and potential limitations of the approach.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Figure 1: The authors show the repeats present in the HHV-6B pvT1 region by colored boxes. The figure would immensely benefit from a legend (color box with respective repeat – as done in Figure 3C). This would make it much easier to follow the repeat types.</p><p>2) Line 199 and 204: please indicate if you are talking about Figure 2A or 2B.</p><p>3) Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 also indicates that mutations arose in U12. Why is this not discussed in the text? It might also help to separate the panes (by A, B…). In addition, the font sizes is very hard to read, even after zooming in. Please improve readability.</p><p>4) Figure 3A: The authors should highlight the shared DRR-pvT1 repeat pattern of individuals with 9q iciHHV-6B and 17p iciHHV-6B (e.g. using stars or arrows).</p><p>5) Figure 4C is not cited in the text. Please ensure that all figure panels are cited.</p><p>6) The authors discovered telomeric integration in the saliva, which represents mostly lytic replication. Did the authors also try this approach using bone marrow samples or other tissues. This would be very exciting data and I would assume that the ratio would be closer to 2:1.</p><p>7) How old was the G4P1 son? Was he an infant/baby making it more likely that the isolated DNA in the saliva was somehow derived from the mother e.g. during nursing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The relationship between different sequenced virus samples is determined based on similarity between the sequence of repeating elements with the DRR-pvT1 region. While it seems to be consistent, no statistical analysis or thresholds for similarity is shown. This can be a powerful tool if precise methods are established.</p><p>– The left-to-right terminology chosen for the different parts of the DRR-pvT1 regions may create confusion as it conflicts with the direction of the DR-L and DR-R terminology.</p><p>– In figures 4-6 The authors use the rate of presence or absence of amplified iciHHV-6 telomere ends in multiple parallel PCR reactions to determine the rate of telomere integration, excision, and elongation. It is unclear what exactly each lane contains, whether it is technical repeats of the initial STELA PCR, or the nested PCR of diluted STELA. If the latter is true, it is unclear how can this method be used to directly quantify integration, as the authors report doing. Furthermore, this test uses the absence of a product as a measured results but does not contain an internal positive control, which makes it lacking.</p><p>The expected band sizes should also be described more clearly, in the figures and the text. For example, why is there a single size product in 5D and not multiple sizes like in 5B? Where are the short products in figure 5E? What are all the bands in 6B?</p><p>– Different samples are repeating in different sections of the manuscript under different contexts, and in relation to different other samples, and are not easily identified. The connections between the different sections and the samples and data presented should be made more clear.</p><p>– The methods section about identification of iciHHV-6 samples, does not specify which test was performed for BIOSTAT-CHF samples (was it sequencing?).

We optimised the method in our own laboratory using an iciHHV-6 cell line known to contain a single full-length copy of the viral genome (U<sub>1</sub>DR<sub>2</sub>); the HT1080 cell line without the viral genome and with water-only no-template controls and found the published method was also robust in our hands. We have expanded the explanation in the material and methods (lines 570 -591). We used this duplexed ddPCR assay to quantify the abundance of HHV-6B in saliva samples and by using triplicate ddPCR assays on each sample we increased the sensitivity and accuracy, as indicated in the Materials and methods and shown in Figure 4A (8/52 saliva (SAL) samples were negative for HHV-6B in all three replica ddPCR assays). We subsequently confirmed the presence of HHV-6B in 42/52 of these saliva samples using the nested PCR DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 assay, which is specific for HHV-6B. It is possible that HHV-6A may also be present in some of these samples, which is a potential limitation but this does not affect the conclusions we have drawn from the HHV-6B data presented.</p><p>As required, we also used the published HHV-6B DR6B, POL (U38) and human RPP30 hydrolysis probe ddPCR assays to establish the copy number of different regions of the HHV-6B genome in iciHHV-6B positive samples. We have edited the material and methods to make this clearer (Lines 594 to 599).</p><p>We developed a novel ddPCR assay to detect HHV-6B PAC1 sequences using an intercalating dye, Evagreen. We have expanded the description of the assay in the material and methods (Lines 600- 613) and included a statement about optimisation. We used this assay to determine the ratio of DR: PAC1 for samples with acqHHV-6B samples (Figure 4E).STELA is a well establish PCR-based method that has been used extensively to amplify full-length telomeres from specific chromosome ends. Telomere amplification by STELA is dependent on the presence of 3’ single stranded (TTAGGG)n overhang, which are essential features of telomeres. The chromosome specificity is determined by the primer located in subtelomeric sequences immediately adjacent to the telomeric repeats. We have added an outline of the STELA method (page 9 lines 255-261) and two references that outline the STELA method as it was first described (Baird <italic>et al.,</italic> 2003) and an example of how we have used the method (Jeyapalan <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008). STELA has been used to measure the average telomere length on a particular chromosome end in cell lines, human samples from various tissues, and to detect and measure the abundance of very short telomeres present as cells approach senescence or crisis. Previously, we adapted STELA to amplify full-length telomeres on the end of iciHHV-6A or -6B genomes, irrespective of the chromosome location, by anchoring one primer in the DR region (typically DR1) and we validated this approach using cell lines with and without iciHHV-6A/6B; with various control primers; and by demonstrating that the telomere on the end of the viral genome shortened at the same rate (base pairs per cell division) as other telomeres within the cell line (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). In this study we used STELA to verify the presence of iciHHV-6A/6B-associated telomeres for all the iciHHV-6A/6B samples available to us.</p><p>New to this study, we adapted the STELA approach to detect HHV-6B-associated telomeres in samples from individuals with low levels of acquired HHV-6B (acqHHV-6B). The problems we had to overcome were: the sensitivity required to detect rare molecules of HHV-6B (low abundance of acqHHV-6B is shown in Figure 4A) that may or may not have an associated telomere in the background of the human genomic DNA; the efficiency of the STELA method (it is less efficient than PCR amplification of short amplicons); the risk of contamination from previously generated HHV-6-STELA amplicons from other samples; mis-priming by the primers required for HHV-6B-STELA elsewhere the human genome (including all 92 telomeres); and mis-priming from within the HHV-6B genome, for example from T1. We took steps to control for artefacts and to optimise the assay as outlined and expanded in the Results section (lines 263-288) and in the Materials and methods (lines 734 -756).</p><p>Previously, we also demonstrated in two iciHHV-6B cell lines that we could detect very short telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 arising from the loss of the terminal DR, T1 region and associated telomere. We validated the approach using Exo1 digestion to remove single-strand overhangs from genomic DNA. This demonstrated that STELA products could be amplified from: the end of the full length viral genome; at the DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 internal truncation site; and from another telomere 12q only when the single strand overhangs were present (i.e genomic DNA without Exo1 digestion) (Huang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2014). In the present manuscript we used the same approach to detect telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 but for the first time in vivo. We showed that the frequency of telomere formation at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 varied between individuals and tissues. We also measured the frequency of lengthening of DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomeres. We investigated the structure of the lengthened molecules (1) by Southern hybridisation to show the absence of DR3 and DR8 (regions within the DRs) and (2) by Sanger sequencing, which demonstrated they contain only (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> repeats. It was not possible to sequence across the entirety of DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomeres that had been lengthened by several kilobases due to their repetitive nature. Nevertheless, sequence obtained from each end of very long DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomeres supported our conclusion that they are terminated by long arrays of (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub>. While this is a limitation, we believe the combination of the sequence and Southern blot analyses support our proposal that lengthening of the newly formed DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomeres likely occurs in cells with telomerase activity. Moreover, we demonstrate (Figure 5) that the proportion of lengthened telomeres at the DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 varies considerably between tissues/ cell types.</p><p>To detect truncations/new telomeres at the internal DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 site it was necessary to distinguish between STELA amplicons that originate from the full-length iciHHV-6B genome present in most cells and the infrequent STELA amplicons that arise from a truncation at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1. To overcome this we identified iciHHV-6B samples that showed a size difference between the pvT1 regions in DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-T1. This prior knowledge, combined with STELA using the DR1R primer and nested amplification of pvT1, enabled us to detect STELA amplicons that had arisen from a telomere at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1. We validated the approach by isolating and sequencing some pvT1 amplicons and demonstrated the pattern of repeats was as expected for DR<sub>R</sub> or DR<sub>L</sub> in the sample. This laborious validation was conducted on a minority of the DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR­<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 amplicons but included some reactions where both bands were present (gel slices were carefully excised to separate the two pvT1 bands prior to Sanger sequencing). The detection of truncations at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 is limited to samples where there is prior knowledge of a length difference between the pvT1 in DR<sub>R</sub> and DR<sub>L</sub>. In addition, the size difference between the amplicons is usually small, influencing the ability to size separate the amplicons. Consequently, only iciHHV-6B samples with large DR<sub>R</sub> vs DR<sub>L</sub> pvT1 size differences, were selected for analysis. We have added a statement in the Results section to address this point (lines 362-373) and referred to it again in the discussion (line 510).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Figure 1: The authors show the repeats present in the HHV-6B pvT1 region by colored boxes.

First, we needed to determine whether the donors had been exposed to the virus at some point and then move to detection of HHV-6B-associated telomeres. For these reasons we collected saliva samples from healthy adult volunteers. We have not had access to other tissues, such as bone marrow, but it would be interesting to investigate. We agree that the ratio of telomere-integrated to free virus is likely to vary between tissues that harbour latent virus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How old was the G4P1 son?

As far as we are aware, there are no available computer programs that align these types of repetitive sequences accurately. Previous work on tandem repeat sequences (our work on human telomeres and other groups on complex VNTRs (Variable Number of Tandem Repeats)) has shown that manual alignment can be used successfully to make comparisons. For example, in this work manual alignment allowed us to see immediately that the pvT1 distal region is the least variable, although not completely static (see Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Furthermore, pvT1 in iciHHV-6B and acqHHV-6B will mutate at different rates but have interconnected though different evolutionary histories, influenced by viral genome integration and excision rates (accompanied by full reactivation) that are currently unknown. These complicating features along with a limited number of pvT1 repeat patterns from some iciHHV-6B clades (shared integration sites) has limited our ability to set similarity thresholds or use statistical analysis with the data available. Nevertheless, we recognise the importance of the point raised here and so to address this point we have listed the distinctive features of DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 repeat maps among iciHHV-6B samples in the same clade (new Supplementary Table 3) and adjusted the text of the manuscript (lines 221-226). Formulation of the distinctive features was informed by known relationships between iciHHV-6B genomes based on whole genome sequence similarity, subtelomere-iciHHV-6B junctions, and FISH. In addition, the presence of a particular motif or variant repeat in both DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 and DR<sub>L</sub>-pvT1 in an individual iciHHV-6B genome indicated that it was present at integration, and this was a useful aid to defining distinctive features. We also include a statements that discuss how these pvT1 repeat patterns were compared and the desirability of an automated approach (lines 447-473).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The left-to-right terminology chosen for the different parts of the DRR-pvT1 regions may create confusion as it conflicts with the direction of the DR-L and DR-R terminology.</p></disp-quote><p>We see how confusion could arise so we have change the labels for the pvT1 sections to proximal, central and distal with respect to the DR421R primer used in nested PCR to amplify pvT1 from either DR<sub>R</sub> or DR<sub>L</sub>. The changes have been made to Figure 1, the manuscript (Lines 148-151) and the Figure 1 legend (lines 1134-1136).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figures 4-6 The authors use the rate of presence or absence of amplified iciHHV-6 telomere ends in multiple parallel PCR reactions to determine the rate of telomere integration, excision, and elongation. It is unclear what exactly each lane contains, whether it is technical repeats of the initial STELA PCR, or the nested PCR of diluted STELA. If the latter is true, it is unclear how can this method be used to directly quantify integration, as the authors report doing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that our explanations about how STELA was used are unclear. In brief, each STELA PCR is conducted on a very small aliquot of human DNA as this limits the number of ‘target’ molecules that could potentially be amplified. For STELA of a human telomere with two copies per cell the quantity of genomic DNA added to each PCR is typically 250-1000 pg (38-152 cell equivalents). Several parallel reactions (typically 5-10) are set up and the data collect across the reactions pooled for subsequent comparative or statistical analysis. If the quantity of genomic DNA added to each STELA is increased to 10 ng per reaction (typical input for a normal PCR) many telomeres are amplified and the pooled products are detected as a smear on the Southern blot.</p><p>In Figure 4, to detect HHV-6B-associated telomeres (if present) in the samples from individuals with low levels of acqHHV-6B (average 0.00145 copies per cell, line 252) we increased the quantity of DNA per STELA PCR. To establish how much DNA could be added per STELA PCR without inhibiting amplification from an HHV-6B-associated telomeres (if present) we conducted doping experiments by adding genomic DNA from an iciHHV-6B cell line (one copy per cell) with increasing quantities of DNA from the HT1080 cell line (HHV-6A/6B negative) followed by STELA in multiple parallel reactions. From these experiments we concluded that 2-5ng genomic DNA from a person with acqHHV-6B per STELA PCR was optimal.</p><p>In Figure 5, there was a different set of considerations when detecting truncations (with or without lengthening) at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 but as we found the frequency of truncations was high, 250-1000 pg genomic DNA was added to each STELA PCR. To isolate individual short DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 telomeres for sequencing STELA PCRs were set up with lower quantities of DNA.</p><p>In Figure 6, detection of truncations and new telomere formation at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 could not be achieved using STELA alone as the primers used can amplify telomeres present at DR<sub>L</sub>-T1 (the end of the full length iciHHV-6B genome) and new telomeres formed at the internal DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 following truncation here. Consequently, in these experiments STELA was used to amplify telomeres from both sites and subsequent analysis of the hypervariable pvT1 region was used to distinguish the origin of the products. A limitation of this approach is that it can only be conducted on sample that shown length variation between the pvT1 region in DR<sub>R</sub> and DR<sub>L</sub>.</p><p>We have made several changes to address these points raised by Reviewer 2. First, we have included a brief description of the STELA method that highlights how it differs from ‘regular’ PCR and then explained how STELA PCRs were set up to detect HHV-6B-associated telomeres in acqHHV-6B samples (lines 255-272). We have expanded a sentence to indicate that the acqHHV-6B integration frequencies should be interpreted cautiously (lines 286-288). We have also expanded our explanation of the method used, precautions taken and outlined optimisation experiments that were undertaken (lines 731 -756).</p><p>Similarly, we amended the text with regard to detection of truncations and newly formed telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 (lines 306-308) and DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 (lines 3602-373) and indicate a limitation of the approach to detect truncations at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1.</p><p>We have amended the legends for figures 4, 5 and 6 so that it is clearer what is shown in the Southern blots from the multiple parallel STELA reactions.</p><p>Figure 4 legend: page 34,</p><p>Figure 5 legend: page 35-36,</p><p>Figure 6 legend: page 36.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, this test uses the absence of a product as a measured results but does not contain an internal positive control, which makes it lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 has raised an important point about how to interpret STELA PCRs that are negative. Only the assay used to detect HHV-6B-associated telomeres in samples from individuals with acqHHV-6B (Figure 4) resulted in a majority of negative tests and so here we address the point raised with respect to that assay. During the development of the assay we considered this issue carefully but we were unable to devise a suitable internal PCR control that would be meaningful and yet not compromise the amplification for acqHHV-6B-associated telomeres, if present. We also predicted that acqHHV-6B-associated telomeres could be long and vary in length between molecules. A control amplicon (of any size) within the human genome would be present at a copy number that massively exceeded the copy number of acqHHV-6B within the sample and therefore was unsuitable. An alternative would be to design a control amplicon within the viral genome and use it in duplex PCRs however there was no way to test whether there would be interference between the pairs of primers or to establish the optimum cycling conditions. Importantly, if the control amplicon was shorter than an acqHHV-6B-associated telomere it would amplify more efficiently and out compete an acqHHV-6B-associated telomere amplicon (if present). Instead of including an internal control, we took steps to ensure that all the STELA PCRs were equivalent, whether or not an amplicon is generated. Consequently, the multiple parallel PCRs were set up as a large volume ‘mastermix’ that comprised all the reagents required for PCR and the genomic DNA from the selected donor. Following thorough mixing the master mix was aliquoted into 90 individual wells of 96 well PCR plates (10 ul per well) so partitioning the DNA into hundreds of parallel reactions that were scored separately. Consequently, generation of an amplicon in a small number of the PCRs partially serves as a control. In addition, as a positive control for the whole PCR run, a small volume of the ‘mastermix’ was taken out (before adding donor DNA) and used to make up six control reactions (per 96 well plate) with added iciHHV-6B genomic DNA. To calculate the percentage of acqHHV-6B genome with a telomere we used the number of STELA PCRs that were positive (generated an amplicon that hybridised to the radiolabelled (TTAGGG)<sub>n</sub> probe). Our estimations of the percentage of acqHHV-6B genomes with a telomere (Figure 4D and Sup Table 4) assume that a negative test did not contain a copy of acqHHV-6B with a telomere rather than such a molecule was present but failed to amplify. If this assumption is untrue for a proportion of the negative reactions the estimation acqHHV-6B genomes with a telomere will be underestimated but unfortunately it is not possible determine the error rate with the data available at this time.</p><p>We believe we addressed the uncertainties with respect to the frequencies of integrated acqHHV-6B genomes (page 9 lines 283-286) but in response to the point raised we have emphasised the need for caution by adding the sentence: ‘For these reasons the error rate associated with detection of acqHHV-6B-associated telomere is unknown and the integration frequencies should be interpreted cautiously.’ (page 9, lines 286-287).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The expected band sizes should also be described more clearly, in the figures and the text. For example, why is there a single size product in 5D and not multiple sizes like in 5B? Where are the short products in figure 5E? What are all the bands in 6B?</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript and Figure 5 legend to add information about the predicted size ranges of the novel telomere are DRL-T2 (page 10 lines 306-308; already stated line 333; and Figure 5 legend page 35, lines 1233-1234). The Southern blots in Figure 5E show the analysis of blood DNA from an iciHHV-6B carrier (401027) in which 63.7% of the novel telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 were lengthened (Supplementary Table 5). Given the high frequency of lengthened telomeres at DR<sub>L</sub>-T2 in this sample, it was just chance that short telomeres (in the 0.7-0.9kb range) were not detected in the reactions shown in these blots. Furthermore, in the original Figure 5E the Southern blot images were shown as cropped images because lower parts were blank. To address this point we have replaced the cropped images in Figure 5E with the full length blots and added the yellow and mauve lines to mark where short telomere at DRL-T2 would appear, if present.</p><p>Figure 6B demonstrates that we can also detect truncations and novel telomere formation at the internal DR<sub>R</sub>-T1. As outlined in Figure 6A and above, STELA with the flanking DR1R primer amplifies telomeres from full length copies of the iciHHV-6B genome (present at approximately 1 copy per cell) as well as novel telomeres formed at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1. Discrimination between the two types of amplicons can be achieved in samples where there is a length difference between pvT1 in DR<sub>R</sub> and DR<sub>L</sub>. In Figure 6B, the upper STELA Southern blot images show amplification and detection of telomeres from the end of full-length viral genome and small number of novel telomeres at DR<sub>R</sub>-T1. The lower ethidium bromide stained gel images show the secondary nested PCR of pvT1 from each of the STELA reactions. The reactions that contain an amplified pvT1 fragment from DR<sub>R</sub>-T1 are identified with a white dot.

Could some of the repeat variation arise due to PCR error and sequencing artifact?</p></disp-quote><p>This is extremely unlikely. We routinely PCR amplify repetitive sequences and find no issue with reproducibility if the PCR conditions are optimised and the cycle number kept low to avoid generation of ‘collapsed’ PCR artefacts. Furthermore, we do not clone the amplified products so the chance of generating a PCR induced Sanger sequence artefact is almost non-existent, unless it arises in the first one or two cycles. A good example of the reproducibility of the pvT1 assay is shown by our analysis of DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 in the three generations of the CEPH 1375 family (Figure 1C). Also, for many samples we have amplified the pvT1 regions in two or more independent reactions and reproducibly generate the same length product and pvT1 repeat map.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Is there any evidence for more than one strain per individual, and if so, how would this impact the analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not find any evidence of two different copies of acqHHV-6B in the human samples screened. As the copy number of acqHHV-6B was low, a second strain would have to be present at similar level and contain a DR<sub>R</sub>-pvT1 sequence with a different length to be detected. In summary our study was not set up to address this question and we cannot exclude the hypothetical possibility that more than one strain could be present.</p><p>While we agree that this is an interesting question, we do not see that the presence of another acqHHV-6B strain present at a very low level would affect the conclusions we have drawn. For example, a second strain of acqHHV-6B would be included in our copy number analysis by ddPCR and would also have potential to integrate and form de novo telomeres, therefore our estimated proportion of copies of HHV-6B that are integrated would not be affected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How do you distinguish viral genomic DNA from other forms of cell-free DNA that includes partial viral genomic fragments. Could FISH be used to confirm viral genome integrity?</p></disp-quote><p>We extract ‘bulk’ high molecular weight genomic DNA from the samples collected so we cannot categorically distinguish between various types of DNA. However, cell free DNA is fragmented (average length 167 nucleotides) and often single stranded, and both these features are likely to reduce the efficiency of recovering it in the extraction methods used. Furthermore, the short size of cell free DNA will prevent it from contributing to most assays presented.</p><p>We are not confident we understand the point raised about using FISH to confirm viral genome integrity. If it is with respect to determining whether an iciHHV-6B carrier has a full viral genome or DR-only, then yes FISH with appropriate probes could be used. But more simply and cheaply we used a PCR base approached for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. What is the explanation for the increase frequency of telomere integration in LCL and pluripotent cell line, and can this be experimentally tested?</p></disp-quote><p>With respect to this point we believe Reviewer 3 is referring to the data shown in Figure 5, which explores the frequencies of partial excisions (truncations) that result in loss of the terminal DR<sub>L</sub> and new telomere formation at DRL-T2. It is unclear at the moment why partial excision events are more frequent in LCLs and pluripotent cell lines. It could be related to chromatin organisation, which we attempted to address with the TSA analysis (Figure 5D). It could also be related to the chance of ‘capturing’ or ‘retaining’ a cell that has undergone an excision. A cell that has one or a few critically short telomeres is likely to exit from the cell cycle (senesce) but such cells may persist for a longer time in culture (e.g. LCLs). Notably the pluripotent cells had a high frequency of the partial excision, but also a high proportion of the new telomere were lengthened and this would allow the cell to survive.</p><p>Yes, there are some exciting possibilities to test various hypotheses, although neither LCLs nor pluripotent cells are easy to manipulate, for example by gene editing approaches.</p></body></sub-article></article>
