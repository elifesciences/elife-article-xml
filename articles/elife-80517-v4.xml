However, for most people, the severity of grief and its maladaptive effects subside over time via an understudied adaptive process. Like humans, socially monogamous prairie voles (<italic>Microtus ochrogaster</italic>) form opposite-sex pair bonds, and upon partner separation, show stress phenotypes that diminish over time. We test the hypothesis that extended partner separation diminishes pair bond-associated behaviors and causes pair bond transcriptional signatures to erode. Opposite-sex or same-sex paired males were cohoused for 2 weeks and then either remained paired or were separated for 48 hours or 4 weeks before collecting fresh nucleus accumbens tissue for RNAseq. In a separate cohort, we assessed partner-directed affiliation at these time points. We found that these behaviors persist despite prolonged separation in both same-sex and opposite-sex paired voles. Opposite-sex pair bonding led to changes in accumbal transcription that were stably maintained while animals remained paired but eroded following prolonged partner separation. Eroded genes are associated with gliogenesis and myelination, suggesting a previously undescribed role for glia in pair bonding and loss. Further, we pioneered neuron-specific translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles. Neuronally enriched transcriptional changes revealed dopaminergic-, mitochondrial-, and steroid hormone signaling-associated gene clusters sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. Our results suggest that partner separation erodes transcriptomic signatures of pair bonding despite core behavioral features of the bond remaining intact, revealing potential molecular processes priming a vole to be able to form a new bond.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Losing a spouse or life partner is a deeply traumatic event that can have long-term repercussions. Given enough time, however, most surviving partners are able to process their grief. The neural processes that enable people to adapt to their loss remain unknown.</p><p>To explore this question, scientists often turn to animals that form long-term mating based pair bonds and can be raised in the laboratory. Monogamous prairie voles enter lifelong partnerships where the two individuals live together, prefer to cuddle with each other, and take care of their pups as a team. After having lost their mate, they show signs of distress that eventually subside with time.</p><p>Sadino et al. examined the biological impact of partner loss in these animals by focusing on the nucleus accumbens, a brain region important for social connections. This involved tracking gene expression – which genes were switched on and off in this area – as the voles established their pair bonds, and then at different time points after one of the partners had been removed.</p><p>The experiments revealed that establishing a relationship leads to a stable shift in nucleus accumbens gene expression, which may help maintain bonds over time. In particular, genes related to glia (the non-neuronal cells which assist neurons in their tasks) see their expression levels increase, indicating a previously undescribed role for this cell type in regulating pair bonding. Having their partner removed led to an erosion of the gene expression pattern that had emerged during pair bonding; this may help the remaining vole adapt to its loss and go on to form a new bond. In addition, Sadino et al. explored the gene expression of only neurons in the nucleus accumbens and uncovered biological processes distinct from those that occur in glia after partner separation. Together, these results shed light on the genetic and neuronal mechanisms which underlie adaptation to loss; this knowledge could one day inform how to better support individuals during this time.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prairie vole</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>loss</kwd><kwd>pair bond</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Vole</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008759-17/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadino</surname><given-names>Julie M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001068</institution-id><institution>Dana Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donaldson</surname><given-names>Zoe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donaldson</surname><given-names>Zoe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2OD026143</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donaldson</surname><given-names>Zoe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH125423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donaldson</surname><given-names>Zoe R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pair bond induced transcriptional changes in the nucleus accumbens erode after long-term partner separation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The death of a romantic partner is cited as one of the most traumatic experiences in a person’s life and results in grief and corresponding indicators of mental and physiological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keyes et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Holmes and Rahe, 1967</xref>). However, for the majority of people acute grief subsides within approximately six months as the bereaved integrates and adapts to the loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shear et al., 2011</xref>). Most people will also eventually form a new pair bond, which provides a behavioral indicator of loss adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shear and Shair, 2005</xref>). The processes that enable such adaptation remain poorly understood but likely occur via the same neural systems that are uniquely engaged by pair bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Blocker and Ophir, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Socially monogamous prairie voles are a laboratory-amenable species that recapitulates many aspects of human social bonds, making them ideal for interrogating the neurobiology of bonding and loss. Pair bonding in this species results in a shift in sociobehavioral state where specific behaviors are only evident after the transition from living in a same-sex pair (i.e. family group) to an opposite-sex bonded pair. Pair bonded voles will prefer to affiliate with their partner, display selective aggression towards non-partner individuals, and exhibit robust and organized biparental care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Williams, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Getz et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Williams et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Winslow et al., 1993</xref>). Considering that other stable behavioral shifts, such as reproductive status and dominance hierarchies, are underwritten by changes in transcription, we aimed to determine if a mature pair bond—and the process of adapting to loss—are underwritten by stable changes in gene expression in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cardoso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zayed and Robinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tripp et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>While an extended network of brain regions mediates social processing and decision making, the nucleus accumbens (NAc)—a region important for reward, motivation, and action selection—is a critical hub that is engaged when forming a bond and is implicated in loss processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lim and Young, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>). In humans, holding hands with a romantic partner enhanced blood oxygenation levels (BOLD) in the NAc and successful adaptation to spousal loss is associated with a reduced partner-associated BOLD signal in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kreuder et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the NAc contributes to pair bonding and loss and broad scale changes in this brain region potentially mediate shifts in transcription which may be required to adapt to partner loss. Similarly, in prairie voles, pair bond-associated behavioral changes are underwritten by several known neuromolecular changes within the NAc which maintain and reinforce pair bonds over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Insel and Young, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Young and Wang, 2004</xref>). Further, when separated from their partner, prairie voles exhibit behavioral and physiological distress that mirrors what is seen upon bond disruption in humans and other species, such as titi monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 1995</xref>). These include increased circulating glucocortioids levels, activation of the HPA axis, increased anxiety, decreased pain thresholds, and autonomic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McNeal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grippo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bosch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pohl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Osako et al., 2018</xref>). However, we have previously shown that if a pair bonded prairie vole loses their partner, given enough time, they will form a new bond that supersedes the original bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harbert et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tamarin et al., 1990</xref>). As in humans, the ability to form a new bond indicates that prairie voles can adapt to partner loss.</p><p>Here, we map the trajectory of the pair bond transcriptional profile by comparing opposite-sex paired males to same-sex sibling male pairs. In the wild, sexually naive male voles can cohabitate with other males, especially siblings, although these relationships do not persist after males form an opposite-sex pair bond and establish a nest/territory with their partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Getz et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 1995</xref>). By comparing opposite-sex pair bonded voles to their same-sex paired counterparts before and after partner separation, we have an ethologically relevant means to isolate the unique biology of bonding and loss independent of those that support general affiliative interactions (e.g. peer relationships) or the stressful effects of social isolation more broadly. Thus, we compared behavior and NAc transcriptional profiles of opposite-sex pair bonded and same-sex cohoused naïve male voles to explicitly define the pair bond both behaviorally and transcriptionally. Then we examined how affiliative pair bond characteristics were altered by partner separation to test the hypothesis that pair bond transcriptional signatures and bond-associated behaviors would erode as a function of time since partner separation. We reasoned that these changes represent key components of loss adaptation that, together, may prime the vole to be able to form a new bond.</p><p>We found that pairing induced a reliable affiliative preference for a peer or a pair bonded partner, and that this preference is remarkably stable, persisting even after four weeks of separation. We further show that pair bond-associated changes in accumbal gene expression were consistent at two and six weeks post-pairing. However, once opposite-sex pairs are separated, the pair bond transcriptional signature erodes as a function of separation time. To further home in on the transcriptional changes associated with partner separation specifically in NAc neurons, we pioneered translating ribosomal affinity purification in voles (vTRAP). Using vTRAP, we identified clusters of genes associated with dopaminergic signaling, mitochondrial organization, and steroid hormone signaling whose expression patterns are sensitive to acute pair bond disruption and loss adaptation. In sum, our parallel behavioral and transcriptional data suggests that erosion of pair bond transcriptional signatures in the NAc precedes changes in affiliative partner preference, providing insight into time-dependent neuromolecular changes that may contribute to loss adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We determined how bonding and extended separation affects social behavior and NAc transcription in opposite-sex and same-sex paired males. We employed timepoints that are experimentally validated and ethologically relevant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For the separation timepoints, the ability to form a new bond after loss serves as a behavioral metric of loss adaptation.

Similarly, we anticipated that same-sex sibling pairs would have a partner preference at baseline due to familiarity but would exhibit a faster and more robust loss of partner preference when separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our initial hypothesis, we found that opposite-sex and same-sex paired males demonstrated a partner preference even after extended separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). In pairs that remained with their partners throughout the 6-week timeline, both opposite-sex and same-sex pairs form a selective preference for their partner after 2 weeks of pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, one sample t-test relative to 50%: opposite-sex p=0.00564, same–sex p=0.00922). The baseline partner preference for both opposite- and same-sex pairs is retained—and even moderately strengthened—after 4 additional weeks of cohabitation (one sample t-test relative to 50% for 48 hr PPT: opposite-sex p=0.0107, same-sex p=0.01478; for 4 weeks PPT: opposite-sex p=5.19 × 10<sup>-7</sup>, same-sex p=6.49 × 10<sup>–7</sup>, two-way RM-ANOVA in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Additionally, there was no significant difference in partner preference score due to either separation duration or partner type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; two-way RM-ANOVA with repeated measures for timepoint: short-term separation: Main effect of partner (opposite- vs same-sex): F<sub>(1,28)</sub> = 0.38, p=0.54; Main effect of time: F<sub>(1,28)</sub> = 0.22, p=0.64; Partner X time: F<sub>(1, 28)</sub>=1.87, p=0.18; long-term separation: Main effect of partner (opposite- vs same-sex): F<sub>(1,26)</sub> = 1.70, p=0.20; Main effect of time: F<sub>(1,26)</sub> = 0.16, p=0.70; Partner X time: F<sub>(1, 26)</sub>=0.057, p=0.81). Together, these results indicate that prairie voles are capable of forming an affiliative preference for an opposite- or same-sex partner and that preference remains intact despite prolonged separation.</p><p>Next, we examined how partner- and novel-directed affiliative behavior, respectively, changed over time. For males that remain paired there were no significant differences in novel huddle over time for either pairing type. Of note, partner huddle increases with extended co-housing in both pairing types indicting a strengthening of partner-directed affiliation (2-way RM-ANOVA: main effect of timepoint (4 wks:base): F<sub>(2, 42)</sub>=4.92, p=0.012, <italic>η</italic>=0.170) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase was not observed in opposite-sex or same-sex paired males that had been separated from their partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>; two-way RM-ANOVA in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This suggests that long-term separation effectively impedes the maturation and strengthening of the pair bond without necessarily dissolving the baseline preference. We also quantified how long it took to begin huddling in the partner preference test but failed to observe any consistent differences for partner or novel huddle latencies over time regardless of experimental condition or pairing type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>, log-rank test in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we quantified how much each animal’s partner preference and partner huddle changed between timepoints (endpoint minus baseline; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, stats in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These change scores revealed that partner preference and partner huddle were relatively stable between the baseline and short-term timepoint regardless pairing status or pairing type. However, at the long-term timepoint, we observed another indicator that separation impedes ongoing pair bond strengthening: opposite-sex males that remain paired exhibited increased partner huddle duration at 4 weeks relative to baseline, which was not observed in opposite-sex separated males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In contrast, in same sex paired males, ongoing pairing was not required for increased partner huddle at the long-term timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we assessed behavioral consistency across PPTs by determining the correlation of partner preference test metrics (huddle times, partner preference score, and chamber times) between baseline to short-term and baseline to long-term timepoints in all cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Pairing duration, separation, and partner type did not yield reliable differences in correlated patterns of behavior. Together, these results indicate that prairie voles form an affiliative preference for an opposite- or same-sex partner that remains intact despite prolonged separation. However, separation impedes the normal, strengthening of partner-directed affiliation that occurs over time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The pair bond transcriptional signature is stable in intact bonds</title><p>Changes in behavioral states, such as a shift in dominance or reproductive status, are supported by stable changes in transcription, although this has not been examined in the context of pair bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cardoso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zayed and Robinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tripp et al., 2018</xref>).

When ordering transcripts based on their log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange at the short-term timepoint, the global transcriptional differences for opposite- versus same-sex pairs were strikingly similar following either 2 or 6 weeks of pairing, suggesting stable pair bond associated transcription across these timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; Spearman’s Rho = 0.38, p=2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>). We further determined that the observed correlation across timepoints is stronger than what would be expected by chance. We shuffled each animal’s cohort identity at the long-term timepoint and calculated Rho values of the log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange of differential gene expression between the observed short-term pair bond and the shuffled long-term pair bond over 1000 iterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The cohort identity is a combination of three variables: pairing type (opposite-sex or same-sex), separation condition (remain paired or separated), and timepoint (short- or long-term). For example, long-term separated opposite-sex animals is one cohort identity of 8 total. This approach effectively randomized timepoint, partner type, and pairing status without disrupting underlying structure that exists within our transcriptional dataset due to correlations in expression across genes. Our observed Rho value was greater than 100% of iterations, indicating that the similarity in gene expression across short and long-term pairing timepoints is greater than would be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Next, we asked whether our observed association across timepoints was driven by moderately but consistently expressed genes. Eliminating transcripts whose expression difference fell within the middle two quartiles in the short-term group resulted in a greater Rho value (<italic>R</italic>=0.44, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>), indicating that the correlation across short- and long-term timepoints is more strongly driven by transcripts with larger expression differences between opposite- and same-sex pairs. To further interrogate the biological function of altered transcripts, we set nominal thresholds of log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange &gt;0.30 or&lt;–0.30, which are sufficient to identify replicable differences detectable via alternate methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Walker et al., 2018</xref>), along with a p-value threshold of p&lt;0.05 to identify up- and down-regulated gene lists (DEGs). This nominal p-value threshold was used with the aim of identifying gene families regulating molecular pathways responsive to bonding instead of specific gene candidates. Prior studies in animal brain tissue using this p-value have yielded biologically meaningful insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Walker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mukamel, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kronman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Walker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Labonté et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Peña et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Seney et al., 2018</xref>; DEGs based on these thresholds are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

This threshold free approach allows us to determine if similar global transcription patterns are observed between two comparisons. The resulting RRHO heatmap is arranged into quadrants based on the direction of gene expression and each point represents the significance derived from the number of overlapping genes via the hypergeometric distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We determined how similar global transcription is between short-term and long-term pair bonds by comparing differential gene expression in the opposite- vs same-sex 2-week paired to opposite-sex vs same-sex 6-week paired groups. We observed extensive concordance of transcriptional patterns between 2- and 6-week paired voles, further supporting that the transcriptional profile of pair bonds is stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Confirming that our observed RRHO signal was unlikely to be attributable to chance, we randomly shuffled cohort identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4E</xref>) and, separately, shuffled the gene ranking of the combined pair bond genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G</xref>), both of which ablated the RRHO signal. Since the pair bond transcriptional profiles are concordant at both time points, the 2-week and 6-week animals from each pairing type were pooled to create a single, well-powered opposite-sex- vs same-sex-paired comparison that defines the combined pair bond transcriptional signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).</p><p>To determine which biological pathways might underlie pair bonding we employed Gene Ontology (GO) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Gene lists for GO terms or IPA were generated either from DEG lists or from genes in concordant (UU or DD) RRHO quadrants. GO terms that passed a false discovery rate of p&lt;0.05 were retained while IPA terms that had activation scores of at least –2 or 2 and whose enrichment for genes predicted to be regulated was significant (p-value &lt;0.05) were kept (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Combined pair bond GO terms associated with the upregulated DEGs and the quadrant UU genes strongly implicate changes in glial cells and extracellular matrix organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), which is mirrored by activation of glioblastoma signaling via IPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). IPA additionally identified upregulation of Synaptogenesis, CREB signaling, and Endocannabinoid Neuronal Synapse pathways. All these pathways are consistent with pair bonding as a form of complex learning that is mediated by neuromodulatory signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Walum and Young, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loth and Donaldson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Modi and Young, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson and Young, 2017</xref>). Predicted upstream regulators of these pathways broadly support a role for learning and neuromodulation, including Creb1, Estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1), and various growth-factor and developmental genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Combined pair bond GO terms associated with the downregulated DEGs and the quadrant DD genes are implicated in nucleoside synthesis and synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). IPA indicates a suppression of corticotropin releasing hormone signaling, potentially reflecting the strong social buffering of stressors that occurs in pair bonded voles specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bosch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bosch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smith and Wang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

There were significantly more shared DEGs between the combined pair bond group and short-term separation group than would be expected by chance, but this was not observed when comparing the shared genes between the combined pair bond and long-term separation group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref> Fisher’s exact test: pair bond:short-term sep χ<sup>2</sup>=31.86, p=6.78 X 10<sup>–19</sup>; pair bond:long-term sep χ<sup>2</sup>=17.96, p=0.53). The difference in transcription between short- and long-term separation is particularly evident when comparing the global transcriptomes through the lens of pair bond transcription. Specifically, when genes are ordered based on their degree of down- or up-regulation in the pair bond group we found that gene expression was largely indistinguishable in short-term separated animals (Rho = 0.32, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>) and distinct from long-term separated animals (Rho = 0.048, p=1.6 × 10<sup>–7</sup>), indicating that the pair bond signature is largely eroded after prolonged separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We further assessed whether these correlations differed from chance via the previously employed permutation analysis. We found that the pair bond:short-term Rho value indicated a stronger association than would be expected by chance (p=0.0362) while the pair bond:long term separation association value was highly likely to occur by chance (p=0.41). Together, these results suggest that extended separation erodes nucleus accumbens pair bond transcription, a potentially crucial molecular process needed to adapt to partner loss.</p><p>To more comprehensively assess genome-wide changes to the pair bond signature following extended partner separation we again employed RRHO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We compared the ranked gene list of opposite- vs same-sex for the (1) combined pair bond gene signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top) versus either (2) short-term partner separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, middle) or (3) long-term partner separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, bottom). We found that the pair bond signature remains largely concordant after short-term separation as indicated by significant signal among upregulated genes (quadrant UU), and to a lesser extent, downregulated genes (quadrant DD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, following long-term separation, the pair bond gene signature is largely undetectable as indicated by a lack of significant signal throughout the RRHO plot. Plotting the long-term RRHO with an unadjusted p-value scale revealed few overlapping genes in the UU and DD quadrants (scale 1–16 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref> rather than 1–300 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The low level of overlap indicates that there is a residual, albeit greatly reduced, pair bond signature that is still detectable after long-term separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Additionally, we used the same control analyses as previously employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4G–I</xref>).</p><p>We next examined which genes are consistently present in the UU or DD quadrants between pair bonding and each separation timepoint. Specifically, we compared the UU and DD quadrants (inclusive of all transcripts in each quadrant) of the short-term (2 week) vs long-term (6 week) pair bond from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, the combined pair bond vs short-term separation in the left side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, and the combined pair bond vs long-term separation on the right side of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>. The degree of overlap in the UU quadrants was greatest between the combined pair bond vs short-term separation and least between the combined pair bond vs long-term separation, a result consistent with the most extensive erosion of pair bond transcription occurring after long-term separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>: all stats in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The same trend was observed for transcripts in the DD quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, all stats in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We next identified genes whose differential expression in pair bonded voles eroded as a function of separation time. We reasoned that such genes are involved in biological pathways that likely regulate adapting to partner loss and prime an animal to form a new pair bond. The genes that were no longer present in the pair bond:long-term separation intersection that were present in the pair bond:short-term separation intersection were deemed eroded genes. These eroded transcripts include 581 UU quadrant transcripts and 1,248 DD quadrant transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). We next filtered the genome-wide expression data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> by the eroded gene lists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). The eroded UU genes are strongly upregulated in a stable pair bond and show dramatic downregulation following long-term separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, the eroded UU genes and their associated biological processes may represent key aspects of adapting to partner loss. There was also a corresponding reduction in DD gene overlap between a stable pair bond and following separation, further supporting that bond-related changes in gene expression erode after long-term separation regardless the initial direction of expression during bonding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p>We next determined how separation-induced transcriptional changes affected pair bond associated biological processes. We used the pair bond associated GO terms from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> as a reference point to determine if these terms were still significantly associated with the underlying transcriptional profile following partner separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). We predicated two outcomes. First, separation would reduce the significance of the pair bond associated GO terms and second, pair bond genes whose expression eroded would be significantly represented by the original pair bond associated terms. The transcripts in the short-term separation UU quadrant were still significantly associated, though to a lesser degree, with the pair bond associated GO terms. After long-term separation, the underlying transcriptional signature is much less significantly associated with the pair bond GO terms. Further, the eroded transcripts are highly associated with the pair bond associated GO terms, including glial-associated terms. A potential role for glia was also implicated in the IPA identification of pathways for glioblastoma multiforme signaling and glioma signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Upstream regulators inducing the erosion of these glial-associated genes include Sox2, estrogen receptor, Erbb3, and Ctnnb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We observe a similar trend in the DD quadrants where the pair bond associated GO terms become less representative of the underlying transcriptional signature following long-term separation but are associated with the eroded genes, although to a lesser degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). IPA pathways activated in a stable pair bond (endocannabinoid signaling, synaptogenesis, and dopamine signaling) are significantly represented among the eroded DD genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Upstream regulators for the eroded DD transcripts include Hnf4a, Calmodulin, Hdac4, and Adora2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to gain more nuanced insight into the temporal trajectory of erosion, we also used RRHO to compare short-term to long-term partner separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast to the pattern of consistently upregulated genes between the pair bond and short-term separation, we observed high concordance of downregulated genes between separation timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A</xref>). We then identified transcripts in the UU and DD quadrants of the separation RRHO that exhibited the largest inversion of expression between pair bond and short-term separation (details in Materials and Methods). We reasoned that such transcripts represented potential gene sets that are rapidly eroded following partner separation and which remain eroded after long-term separation, representing a potential first wave transcriptional response to partner loss. We further asked which biological processes are represented by these consistently inverted genes via GO analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B, C</xref>). We found that UU pair bond genes that are downregulated following pair bond separation are associated with dopaminergic processes and DD pair bond genes that are upregulated are associated with neuronal rearrangement processes. Thus, this RRHO analysis enriches our interpretation of transcriptional erosion of pair bond signatures following partner separation by revealing temporally complex shifts in gene expression resulting from partner loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Neuronal-specific interrogation reveals gene clusters associated with pair bond disruption and loss adaptation</title><p>Our tissue-level analysis of gene expression strongly implicated a role for glia in bond formation and loss, and we reasoned that relevant neuronal transcriptional changes may have been masked by these prominent glial transcriptional signals. Thus, we specifically examined separation-induced neuronal transcriptional changes by pioneering translating ribosome affinity purification in voles (vTRAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Heiman et al., 2008</xref>).

We first identified neuronally-enriched transcripts by comparing the transcriptional profiles of the input fraction (equivalent to bulk RNA-seq) and pulldown fraction of the animals from the TRAP groups specified above. We predicted that the pulldown fraction would be enriched for neuronal markers and depleted in glial-associated transcripts. Differential expression analysis using the previously defined thresholds revealed that most transcripts are depleted in the pulldown fraction as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). GO terms support that hSyn-vTRAP successfully isolates neuronally-enriched transcripts and filters out genes associated with gliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

We filtered the dataset by our neuronal enriched gene list and plotted those gene’s expression in the rat nucleus accumbens, which confirmed that our genes are predominately expressed in neuronal cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>We next queried potential neuronal transcriptional changes in our tissue-level RNAseq data. To ensure that the tissue-level expression is representative of neuron-specific expression we compared the expression patterns of the neuronal enriched genes in the input and pulldown fractions of opposite- vs same-sex long-term separated males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The strong similarity in expression validates that bulk sequencing expression can be used to infer the neuronal expression of those same genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). As such, we filtered the tissue-level RNAseq dataset from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> by the neuronal enriched gene list of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> to track neuronal gene expression throughout partner loss. We then performed unsupervised clustering of all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, top) and neuronal enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, bottom). We identified three neuronal-enriched gene clusters that had particularly interesting expression patterns. Cluster 1 consists of genes that were upregulated in opposite-sex paired males during pair bonding and short-term separation and downregulated following long-term separation. GO terms associated with these genes include adult walking behavior, a term that contains the autism-associated gene Shank3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Durand et al., 2007</xref>). Cluster 2 transcripts are downregulated in pair bonded males and then robustly upregulated after short-term partner loss and, to a lesser extent, at the long-term timepoint, indicating an acute transcriptional response to pair bond disruption. The GO terms associated with these genes suggest an involvement of dopaminergic systems (Drd1a and Drd2) and learning processes potentially engaged to adapt to loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Finally, Cluster 3 contains genes that were downregulated in pair bonded males and became upregulated only after long-term opposite-sex partner separation, representing transcripts that may help prime the vole to form a new bond. The GO terms associated with this cluster are primarily implicated in cellular metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

Additionally, the direct comparison of opposite- versus same-sex paired animals provides an important control for the effects of social context – whether living with another animal or alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Arzate-Mejía et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wallace et al., 2009</xref>). By leveraging this comparison across our experiments, we demonstrated that pair bonding leads to consistent and persistent shifts in NAc transcription, which erode as a function of long-term partner separation. This suggests that substantial changes in accumbal gene expression may contribute to priming the vole to form a new bond but are not sufficient to erase an existing bond as measured by partner preference. In addition, we demonstrate the utility of vTRAP for interrogating neuron-specific responses to bonding and separation that are obscured when analyzing bulk sequencing results. Together, these results expand the utility of monogamous prairie voles for future behavioral and molecular-genetic studies of partner loss and loss adaptation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Separation disrupts the continued strengthening of pair bonds but does not diminish baseline partner preference</title><p>We observed overall similarity and persistence in social behaviors exhibited by opposite-sex and same-sex paired male prairie voles where both types displayed a partner preference despite prolonged separation. The partner preference test, as employed in our study, may be insufficient to capture the uniquely rewarding aspect of pair bonds compared with other affiliative relationships such as sibling relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>). In part, this may reflect the coarse but commonly employed metric of proximity to the partner used to measure preference, without analyzing the valence or content of specific social interactions. A more nuanced assessment that includes naturalistic behaviors and/or captures the selectively motivating aspects of a pair bond would further elucidate differences in partner-directed behavior as a function of separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brusman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goodwin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beery et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Vahaba et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>However, the metrics employed here revealed that opposite-sex animals that remained paired exhibited increased partner huddle duration between baseline and long-term timepoints while the separated animals do not. Thus, while partner separation does not erase an established bond, it does disrupt the observed increase in partner huddle duration of remain paired males.</p><p>Prior work demonstrates the dissolution of partner preference in male voles after four weeks of separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). Yet the apparent contradiction we observed in our experiments may be due to differences in study design. In particular, we paired animals for two weeks before separation while prior studies had much shorter periods of cohabitation pre-separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). As demonstrated here and in other studies, pair bonds strengthen and mature over extended cohabitation periods, which may contribute to the observed perseverance of partner preference for weeks after separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Scribner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brusman et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, our females were tubally ligated in order to prevent pregnancy without disrupting other hormonal signaling. There is no consensus regarding the effects of pregnancy on male pair bonding behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brusman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">DeVries et al., 1997</xref>). However, partner preference in males is not affected by female ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Curtis, 2010</xref>). Regardless, our results suggest that male voles remember and express selective affiliation despite prolonged isolation, though partner separation impedes the ongoing bond strengthening.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pair bonding results in consistent glia-associated transcriptional changes that erode following prolonged separation</title><p>Our studies begin to interrogate how dramatic shifts in socio-emotional context alter transcription in a mesolimbic hub—the NAc. We first asked whether bonding-induced gene expression is stable as long as pairs remain cohoused (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Resendez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Resendez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragona et al., 2003</xref>). Using three orthogonal analytical methods, we found remarkable consistency in the transcriptional pattern of opposite- vs same-sex pairs co-housed for 2 or 6 weeks. Prior work on social dominance suggests that such stable transcriptional changes are critical to maintain different behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cardoso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zayed and Robinson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tripp et al., 2018</xref>). However, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that a similar conceptual underpinning may maintain mature pair bonds.</p><p>Consistently upregulated transcripts in pair bonded males are associated with glia and extracellular matrix organization while downregulated transcripts are associated with nucleoside processes, synaptic plasticity, and vesicle trafficking. Together, these terms implicate processes central to neuronal remodeling and synaptic plasticity. Of note, while our analyses do identify a number of mitochondrial GO terms, these terms are not as strongly implicated in our analyses as in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duclot et al., 2020</xref>). Despite this, our study confirms a potential role for mitochondrial dynamics in the NAc in male prairie vole pair bonding. This is consistent with a model in which pair bonding and separation induce neuronal plasticity and synapse re-organization, which require large amounts of energy and induce mitochondrial redistribution within neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ülgen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>We next found that pair bond transcriptional signatures erode as a function of separation duration. RRHO analyses demonstrated that there is considerable reduction in concordant pair bond gene expression following long-term but not short-term separation. When we asked which transcripts and associated biological processes erode over this timeframe, we found that they largely corresponded with those evident in the pair bond transcriptional signature. Specifically, transcripts associated with glia, extracellular matrix organization, synapse organization, and vesicle docking are stably expressed in pair bonded males but eroded following long-term separation. The erosion of the pair bond transcriptional signature over time in opposite-sex separated males may be central to adapting to partner loss in order to form a new pair bond if given the opportunity. It remains unclear though, how these changes may reflect or alter the component processes of pair bonding, such as partner memory, reward association, and/or motivation.</p><p>Our analyses strongly indicate a role for glia in regulating pair bonding and the response to partner separation. Transcripts associated with gliogenesis, glial cell differentiation, and myelination are upregulated in stable pair bonds, potentially reflecting the importance of glial cells in sculpting and refining neural circuits in response to social experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Loth and Donaldson, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kopec et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Pohl et al., 2021</xref>). Similar GO terms—with the addition of oligodendrocyte differentiation—are associated with eroded pair bond transcripts after long-term partner separation. Hypomyelination and oligodendrocyte dysfunction are seen in mice and rats after chronic social defeat or chronic social isolation and in individuals with depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bonnefil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lehmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zhou et al., 2021</xref>). This appears reversible as social reintroduction rescued hypomyelination in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). One mechanism for social deprivation-mediated hypomyelination and impaired oligodendrocyte maturation is by reduced flux through Erbb3-based signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Makinodan et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, Erbb3 is one of 24 genes whose differential expression is conserved in taxonomically diverse monogamous species when compared to closely related non-monogamous relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Young et al., 2019</xref>). We find Erbb3 upregulated during pair bonding through short-term separation but it is no longer upregulated following long-term separation. Further, IPA analysis indicates that Erbb3 is an upstream regulator of the eroded genes. Thus, it is possible that long-term separation is downregulating Erbb3-associated pathways resulting in reduced myelination and disrupting oligodendrocytes specifically in opposite-sex-separated animals. An important future direction is whether bonding with a new partner re-engages these glial processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Neurons have distinct transcriptional responses to bonding and loss</title><p>While there is an emerging appreciation for the role of glia in mediating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thornton and Hughes, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bacmeister et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Auguste et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hughes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duncan and Emery, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2023</xref>), these effects are largely due to modulation of neuronal activity, and we reasoned that the prominence of glial-related terms may have masked important neuronal transcriptional changes in our dataset. To home in on neuronal transcriptional changes specifically, we developed vole-optimized translating ribosome affinity purification in prairie voles (vTRAP). We used DESeq, WGCNA, and a publicly available snRNAseq dataset to identify neuronal enriched genes, which show a 1.2–8.8 fold enrichment in neuronal pulldowns compared to the tissue-level sequencing data. We then queried expression changes specifically among these genes as a function of pair bonding and partner separation. With this enhanced sensitivity, we were able to identify three neuronal gene expression patterns that are differentially sensitive to partner loss. Notably, dopamine associated genes in cluster #2 are robustly upregulated in neurons after short-term partner loss, possibly reflecting a withdrawal-like state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Potretzke and Ryabinin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Young et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lieberwirth and Wang, 2016</xref>). This finding also underscores the discovery value of vTRAP because GO terms such as ‘response to amphetamine’, which indicates changes to dopaminergic genes, was a top 10 result, while the tissue level gene cluster predicts this GO term as the 34th result. Genes associated with anxiety and energy production in cluster #3 are upregulated only after long-term partner loss, possibly to facilitate seeking a new partner. Thus, together with our tissue level sequencing implicating the role of glia, vTRAP provides a more nuanced understanding of how specifically the pair bond neuronal transcriptional signature responds to partner separation over time.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>Pair bonding and loss are complex and multifaceted processes, engaging diverse neural circuits in temporal- and context-specific ways. Yet transcriptomics provides a single snapshot of gene expression at one point in time in one context. So while tissue-level transcriptional analysis is an excellent tool to capture an averaged biological state, one limitation of our approach is that it is not ideal for examining more temporally-dynamic processes, such as the rapid information-processing that occurs during social decision making.</p><p>A notable aspect of our results is that the substantial erosion of pair bond transcription in the NAc after long-term separation is not matched by a similar reduction in partner-directed affiliative behaviors, despite evidence that changes in gene expression in this brain region help maintain bonds over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aragona and Wang, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aragona et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aragona et al., 2003</xref>). This apparent mismatch between behavior and transcription has a few possible biological explanations. First, while our focus on the NAc is well justified, other brain regions are also important for bonding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lim and Young, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tripp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bosch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gobrogge et al., 2009</xref>). Specifically, the ventral tegmental area, medial pre-frontal cortex, and the hippocampus innervate the NAc and have known roles in social behavior. Transcriptional dynamics may differ within these regions, potentially contributing to bond persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Okuyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kogan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amadei et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, pair bond transcription may induce other long-term biological changes that erode more slowly. These include long-lasting epigenetic memory as well as proteomic and/or structural changes that may contribute to behavioral persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tuesta and Zhang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nestler et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, transcriptional changes in a key subset of cells, which may be undetectable in tissue-level RNAseq, could drive bond persistence. More refined approaches, such as single-nucleus RNAseq, could greatly enhance our understanding of the cell types regulating complex behavioral persistence. All three of these hypothesized mechanisms for bond persistence represent important future lines of inquiry.</p><p>Previous work from our lab has shown that, when given the opportunity, male voles can form a new, stable pair bond that supplants the original bond if first isolated from their previous partner for at least four weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harbert et al., 2020</xref>). However, in the current study design, male voles did not have an opportunity to find a new partner or form a new bond. Under such conditions, it may be advantageous to maintain behaviors that would enable the male to resume a bond if reunited with an absent partner. Speculatively, this framework optimizes reproductive opportunities by dually enabling a new bond to form <italic>or</italic> resuming an existing bond. It is likewise tempting to extrapolate this result into the context of human experience. We do not forget our previous bonds or their emotional valence; rather we integrate the loss in order to continue on with life.</p><p>Finally, oxytocin signaling in the NAc is required for pair bond formation and maintenance in male prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>). While nonapeptide systems were not the focus of the current study, an intriguing follow-up question is how much of the pair bond transcription and its maintenance is attributable to nonapeptide dynamics. Recent publication of pair bond formation in <italic>Oxtr</italic> null voles provides a unique opportunity to identify oxytocin-dependent and independent transcriptional changes that support pair bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berendzen and Manoli, 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In sum, we provide additional insights into the neurogenomic processes that promote and maintain pair bonds and leverage these findings to gain a unique understanding of how the brain adapts to loss. We show that, in the absence of new bonding opportunities, the original pair bond will persist for at least 4 weeks post-partner-separation. However, prior work indicates that there is still an adaptive process occurring within this time frame that primes a vole to form a new bond if available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harbert et al., 2020</xref>). Our work suggests that this adaptation is mediated at least in part by an erosion of bond-related transcription in mesolimbic systems that largely precedes bond dissolution at the behavioral level. Together, this work and future studies will help shed light on the pain associated with loss, as well as how we integrate grief in order to meaningfully reengage with life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Sexually naive adult prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster, N=219: 161 M, 58 F, P60 - P168 at experiment start) were bred in-house in a colony originating from a cross between voles obtained from colonies at Emory University and University of California Davis, both of which were established from wild animals collected in Illinois.

Remain Paired animals were kept with their partner while Separated animals were separated from their partner and moved to a fresh cage while their partner was immediately sacrificed to remove confounds of visual or olfactory cues. All animals remained in their individual cages undisturbed for either 48 hours (short-term separation) or 4 weeks (long-term separation) except for weekly cage changes done by the experimenter. After the appropriate separation time point, experimental animals were removed directly from their home cage for rapid decapitation and tissue harvesting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA preparation and sequencing</title><p>Tissue lysis and RNA isolation was adapted from Heiman and performed under RNase free conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heiman et al., 2014</xref>). On each tissue collection day, 2 animals from each experimental cohort were processed, with the exception of same-sex 4-week paired animals who were all collected on the same day. Animals were removed from home cages, rapid decapped, and both hemispheres of the nucleus accumbens were hand dissected using sterile, RNase free razor blades and pooled. The NAc coordinates for dissections were:+1.7 AP,+/-1 ML, –4.7 to –4.4 DV with the TRAP dissections additionally guided by GFP fluorescence visualized with a fluorescent dissecting scope. During dissection, tissue was kept wet with dissection buffer (HEPES KOH, pH 7.3 20 mM, 1 X HBSS, Glucose 35 mM, NaHCO3 4 mM, CHX 10 uL of 1000 X stock, DEPC-treated water up to 10 mL). Tissue was added to 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (DEPC-treated water, HEPES 20 mM, KCl 150 mM, MgCl2 (10 mM), DTT 5 µL of 1 M stock, CHX 10 µL of 1000 X stock, 1 protease inhibitor, RNasin 400 Units, and Superasin 800 Units), immediately homogenized using a Scilogex homogenizer, and kept on wet ice while the remaining animals for the day were processed. The homogenizer tip was thoroughly cleaned in between animals with DEPC-treated water and 70% ethanol to eliminate cross contamination between samples. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 4 °C, for 10 min at ~3000 Xg and supernatent was transferred to new, pre-chilled tubes. 10% NP-40 (AG Scientific: #P-1505) and 300 mM DHPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc: 850306 P-200 mg) were added to the supernatent and incubated on ice (4 °C) for 5 min.

RNA was then extracted and cleaned from the lysate supernatent using the Norgen Total RNA micro kit (cat. #) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was measured using an Agilent Tapestation prior to library preparation. RINs for all samples were &gt;7.3 (average 8.8).</p><p>For TRAP samples, dissections and Input fraction RNA were prepared as above with the addition of GFP-guided dissections using a fluorescent dissecting scope. To perform immunoprecipitation pulldowns, affinity matrices were prepared fresh day-of using 300 µL of 10 mg/mL Streptavidin MyOne T1 Dynabeads (Invitrogen), 150 µL of 1 µg/µL Biotinylated Protein L (Fisher Scientific), and 50 µg each of eGFP antibodies Htz-19C8 and Htz-19F7 (Memorial-Sloan Kettering Monoclonal Antibody Facility) 2 hr prior to adding Input RNA sample. A small sample of Input RNA was saved for next day clean up (~250 µL/sample) and frozen at –80 °C overnight. The remaining Input RNA (~1 mL) was added to the GFP-conjugated beads and rotated overnight (16–18 hr) at 4 °C. The next day, the flowthrough was saved and stored at –80 °C and bound mRNA was released from the beads using a series of high salt buffer washes (4 washes; 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 10% NP-40, RNase-free water, protease inhibitor tablets, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/µl cycloheximide). The beads were then incubated with the Norgen Total RNA micro kit SKP buffer (300 µL) for 10 min at room temperature. The Pulldown supernatant was then saved and processed as above using the kit manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>Library preparation for sequencing was done using the KAPA mRNA HyperPrep kit with polyA enrichment according to the manufacturer’s instructions for a 100–200 bp insert size and using 1.5 µM TruSeq3-SE adapters. 71 samples were pooled and 3 runs of NextSeq V2 high output 75 cycle (1X75) sequencing produced a total read depth of ~20 M reads/sample. The Illumina sequencing was performed at the BioFrontiers Institute Next-Gen Sequencing Core Facility of University of Colorado Boulder.

Additionally, each sequencing run was correlated to each other to ensure that there was not a significant difference in run composition. Reads were aligned to the prairie vole genome (Microtus_ochrogaster.MicOch1.0.dna.toplevel, released Feb 2017; accession GCA_000317375) using HiSat2 (2.1.0) with default options and individual runs for each animal were merged into a single sample using SAMtools (1.9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Danecek et al., 2021</xref>).

Genes with less than 10 read counts were filtered from downstream analysis and, where necessary, were normalized using transcripts per million (TPM). Where possible, all Ensembl IDs were converted to prairie vole gene IDs using BioMart. If no gene ID was found, the original Ensembl ID was retained. Only genes with greater than 10 counts were included in subsequent analyses (total genes = 21152, genes &gt;10 counts = 12128).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data analysis and visualization</title><p>All sequencing analysis was performed using R (v4.0.4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">R:The R project for statistical computing, 2022</xref>).

To determine differential gene expression between cohorts a DESeq dataset of all animals was made with the design ~ParentCode + AgeAtPairing + Cohort to correct for the effect of parentage and age at initial pairing. Other batch effects (processing day, processing order, RIN, etc.) did not have sufficient influence on the model to include. Each result was a pair-wise contrast between the appropriate cohorts with the opposite-sex condition as the experimental and the same-sex condition as the reference. Differential gene expression was defined as &gt;0.30 and&lt;−0.30 log2FoldChange and p-value &lt;0.05. This log2FoldChange threshold was used for two reasons. (1) A threshold of +/-0.20 can be successfully validated by qPCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Walker et al., 2018</xref>) but (2) we chose a slightly higher threshold as it allows for smaller gene lists that appear more biologically relevant by Gene Ontology analysis. Differential gene expression was visualized using EnhancedVolcano. To determine if there was statistically significant overlap between differentially expressed gene lists compared to all genes (n=12,128) we performed a Fisher’s exact test using the SuperExactTest (v1.0.7) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, we used Morpheus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus</ext-link>) heatmaps to compare the expression profiles of each DESeq comparison using scaled log2FoldChange values. For each heatmap, a reference dataset ordered the remaining datasets such that each column is the same gene and the color represents the scaled log<sub>2</sub>FoldChange in each DESeq comparison. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> the short-term pair bond was set as the reference and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, J and L</xref> the combined pair bond was set as the reference. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of relevant gene lists were performed using the R package enrichGO with <italic>Mus musculus</italic> ontology terms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Yu et al., 2012</xref>).

Next, two ranked gene lists are compared to each other using a hypergeometric distribution to determine the significance of the number of overlapping genes within defined sample populations. Sample populations are independently defined for each list. Each population consists of all of the genes that are ranked higher than a specified threshold. Thresholds successively move down a list at a user specified step size. For computation convenience, here we define our step size as 100 genes. However, the smallest possible step size is 1 gene and the largest possible step size is the number of genes found in the smallest list. The hypergeometric p-values resulting from comparing the List 1 genes (all genes above threshold x) to List 2 (all genes above threshold y) then populate a square matrix. As a result, the furthest bottom-left position of the matrix is the p-value of the overlap between genes ranked above the 1st threshold in each list and the furthest top-right position is the overlap between genes ranked above the last threshold in each list. As another example, the furthest bottom-right position is the p-value comparing all genes above the last threshold of List 1 to all genes above the 1st threshold of List 2. The final matrix of hypergeometric p-values is visualized as a heatmap where List 1 is along the x-axis and List 2 is along the y-axis and each point represents a p-value. The axes are arranged such that genes that are upregulated in both lists are in the bottom-left quadrant (quadrant UU) and genes that are downregulated in both lists are in the top-right quadrant (quadrant DD). Genes with opposite regulation in each condition, up in one list but down in the other, are along the opposite diagonal (quadrants UD and DU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To visualize RRHO our heatmaps with a consistent p-value scale we set the scale maximum = 300 and the minimum = 1.</p><p>The genes in each quadrant were extracted to form UU, DD, UD, and DU gene lists for further analysis. Using these gene lists, the significant overlap between quadrants were determined using the SuperExactTest package. Gene ontology and pathway analysis of these gene lists were performed using the R package enrichGO with <italic>Mus musculus</italic> ontology terms. Representative terms with an adjusted p-value of &lt;0.05 were hand selected. For the short-term vs long-term separation RRHO only UU and DD quadrant genes were used to filter the DESeq2 results of the pair bond, short-term separation, and long-term separation. We then further filtered the pair bond data by a log2FoldChange &lt;–0.30 for the UU genes and &gt;0.30 for the DD genes.</p><p>Additional information for RRHOs are in Figure S8. Unscaled p-value RRHOs can be found in Figure S8A-C. Since the p-value of the hypergeometirc distribution is sensitive to the number of genes, RRHO also plots a log-Odds ratio for all comparisons. Log-Odds ratio plots can be found in Figure S8D-F where the maximum scale was changed from 8 to 6 on all plots to better visualize values. Finally, to ensure that the signal we see in the RRHOs is not due to chance, we shuffled the ranked order of List 1 in each RRHO (Figure S8G-I). The resulting lack of signal throughout the RRHOs support that the signal we see in our experimental RRHOs is not due to chance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Pathway and upstream regulator analysis with ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA)</title><p>Ingenuity pathway analysis (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), was used to determine potential biological pathways and upstream regulators of DEGs and co-regulated genes identified using RRHO.

For both, outcomes were filtered to include only those that reached an activation z-score of +/-2 and a corrected p-value of &lt;0.05 (corrected by Benjamini Hochberg).

WGCNA analysis was done using the Input and Pulldown sequencing data from only animals in the vTRAP cohorts (opposite-sex remain paired 4 weeks, opposite-sex separated 4 weeks, and same-sex separated 4 weeks). A signed co-expression network was constructed using a power of 9 and minimum module size of 30 genes according to the author’s standard module-trait relationship workflow. No samples were designated as outliers using complete clustering. Gene modules were then correlated to either the trait Input or Pulldown to determine the gene clusters associated with each sample type. To determine which correlation direction (positive or negative) is associated with which sample type, the significantly positively or negatively correlated modules were grouped and analyzed by Enrichr for cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuleshov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Xie et al., 2021</xref>). The top term for the positively correlated modules was nucleus accumbens while the top term for the negatively correlated modules was spinal cord. Therefore, the positively correlated modules represent the Pulldown samples, and by extension, neuronally enriched genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Neuronal enriched genes throughout separation</title><p>To robustly define neuronally enriched genes we found the intersection of the vTRAP Input vs Pulldown enriched DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and the genes from the significantly, positively correlated WGCNA modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The resulting intersection—2365 genes— is referred to as ‘neuronal enriched genes’ and includes almost all of the vTRAP enriched DEGs. To further validate the neuronal enriched genes we analyzed this gene list using Enrichr for cell types. The top two terms are nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatum confirming the specificity of this gene list.</p><p>We next wanted to follow the expression of these neuronal enriched genes throughout separation. First, since we only had vTRAP samples from specific cohorts in our experiment, we ensured that neuronal gene expression can be inferred from bulk sequencing of the same genes. To validate this, we filtered the Input and Pulldown samples of the opposite-sex 4-week separated cohort and compared the expression of the neuronal enriched genes using Morpheus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The strong similarity in expression of the neuronal enriched genes using two different collection methods validated that bulk sequencing expression can be used to infer the neuron specific expression of those same genes. Second, to compare the expression patterns of the neuronal enriched genes to the bulk sequencing data we filtered the bulk data for only the neuronal genes. We then clustered the unfiltered bulk sequencing data, from 3F, and the neuronal enriched genes only bulk sequencing data using one minus Pearson correlation with complete linkage. For each neuronal cluster, we then found the corresponding cluster in the unfiltered expression data with the correspondence links visualized by a Sankey plot using the R package networkD3 (version 0.4)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allaire et al., 2017</xref>). Third, we identified three clusters in the neuronal enriched data that had differential expression based on separation duration. We analyzed each gene list using Gene Ontology as previously described and highlighted specific genes associated with top terms. Which clusters were spotlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> was determined by a combination of transcriptional patterns due to separation, which genes are in the cluster, and the resulting GO terms for each cluster. We identified clusters that represented three interesting patterns: (1.) down only after long-term pair bond separation (cluster 1) (2.) up due to acute pair separation (cluster 2) and (3.) up only after long-term pair bond separation (cluster 3).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All procedures were performed in accordance with standard ethical guidelines (National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Colorado Boulder (protocol #2435).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive statistical analyses and individual animal information.</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.19911541">10.6084/m9.figshare.19911541</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Margaret M McCarthy as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The disconnect between the behavioral responses in terms of endurance of the pair-bond, and the transcriptomics was of concern to the Reviewers. It was noted that there are subtle but perhaps important differences in the separation protocol used for the behavioral studies versus the transcriptomics. This combined with the behavioral data here not being consistent with the published literature undermines the current conclusions. The Reviewers felt that repeating the behavior but with the precise protocol used for the transcriptomics would allow for more direct comparison and strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>2) The value added by the use of TRAP was questionable. This approach should either be further validated or more strongly justified if it is to remain in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Some conclusions were overly anthropomorphized and an extensive literature on the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in pair-bonding in this species was neglected. Changes in wording and emphasis combined with some new material in the Discussion could easily address this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Prior work has implicated both the oxytocin and vasopressin systems in pair bonding, albeit in complicated ways, but there was both no discussion of that here nor an opportunity to provide a positive control since the nucleus accumbens does not include these systems. Perhaps the authors could discuss this as among the shortcomings.</p><p>2) Presumably the authors plan future studies using viral vectors to either over-express or repress candidate genes for manipulating the endurance of pair bonds. It is very unfortunate that the behavior did not correspond as expected. The authors' explanations for why this might be are legitimate but it does leave one wondering what to do next and highlights the challenge of such large sequencing studies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study was clearly a ton of work, and the authors marshall an impressive amount of data to address an important and understudied question. The combination of bioinformatics + bench work to get methods going in an emerging model is impressive.</p><p>It could help make the article more accessible to a wider readership if the authors could explain a little more clearly what vTRAP tells us that RNAseq doesn't. Why do we care about neuronal vs non-neuronal processes?</p><p>Some of the language about the transcriptomic results implies within-individual change although that can't be possible given that sampling is terminal, e.g. &quot;…stably maintained while animals remained paired but eroded…&quot; (abstract).</p><p>Interpretation of the transcriptional differences: clearly the transcriptional differences are not causal to the behavior that happened in the past. The decoupling of behavior and transcription offers some insights – the behavior remains the same (still shows behavioral signs of bonding) but the gene expression diverges; authors infer it has to do with the ability to establish a new bond but it's likely to be more heterogeneous? What about recovery from the loss, for example? Doesn't it seem likely that some of the DEGs reflect the ability to establish a new bond while others are probably about other processes, e.g. recovery?</p><p>Top left page 2: provide refs to support statements like &quot;considering that other stable behavioral shifts…are underwritten by changes in transcription&quot;</p><p>Why did the authors focus on males rather than females? The experimental design would be even better if they were brothers.</p><p>The sample size is ok with n=15, 16 pairs, but it would be helpful if the authors could provide some explicit acknowledgement of power (Figure 1).</p><p>R column, top of page 3: &quot;latency to query&quot;?</p><p>L column, page 3: need to explain why expected animals to have a preference for same-sex partners sooner before introducing the hypothesis.</p><p>L column, page 5: How to interpret opposite sex males initiated tumble fighting more quickly?</p><p>Page 5: please clearly state n for each treatment /time point group in the RNAseq analysis; presumably it's 50% of the n=15, 16 used in behavioral experiments?</p><p>Page 5, R column: which variables are being correlated here? &quot;we calculated Rho values between the observed short-term pair bond and the shuffled…&quot;</p><p>Page 5: how many individuals were excluded because they did not have baseline partner preference &gt;50%?</p><p>Page 7: need to know experimental design for sequencing earlier, L column &quot;on 8 groups of animals&quot; – please remind us n for each group.</p><p>The major comparison is between same vs opposite sex housed pairs; therefore differences between treatment groups could reflect pair bonding OR they could reflect something about the sex of the partner. What about an additional control? They don't just differ in whether or not pair-bonded, but also in whether or not pair-bonded/housed/interacted with a male or a female</p><p>How did the authors choose which male member of the same-sex pair was used as the focal?</p><p>Page 8 L column: could this be correlated with the interesting behavioral results at the pair/individual level, i.e. pairs that were more bonded showed more of an effect than pairs that were less bonded?</p><p>Page 8, L column &quot;the combined pair bond signature remains intact after short-term separation…&quot; implies within-individual sampling.</p><p>Page 8, R column: this is a creative way to analyze RNAseq data!</p><p>vTRAP: Page 12, L column: It's neat that the authors were able to filter out genes so they could focus on genes expressed in neurons, but it seems like a lot of trouble to do all this work with cre and viruses – did they really learn that much more?</p><p>Page 12, R column: &quot;the strong similarity in expression validates that bulk sequencing…&quot; right – so did you really need to go to all the trouble of vTRAP?</p><p>Discussion on page 13 focuses on usual suspects/candidate genes: so why go to all this trouble to do this genomic approach if what really interests you are genes we already know are important? why not just have started with those?</p><p>Page 13: text here emphasizes that vTRAP didn't teach us anything particularly new we couldn't have figured out from the bulk RNASeq data alone. Here the authors emphasize that it's included in this paper to illustrate the utility of the method and make it available to the wider community of vole researchers, which is great but…. Does it belong in this paper?</p><p>Page 13 L column: the direct comparison of opposite versus same-sex paired animals provides a control for the effects of social context (alone vs with a pair) but it introduces another confound, namely the sex of the partner.</p><p>Page 13, R column: &quot;correlation across partner preference behaviors…&quot; seems like there could also be an opportunity to look for correlations between gene expression and behavior.</p><p>Page 14, L column: &quot;transcripts associated with glia…&quot; so can the effects of the experience of pair bonding vs pair bonding itself be teased apart? The experience of pair bonding could influence subsequent behavior via e.g learning -- there could be a transcriptional signal of that. There could also be a transcription signature of remembering that particular partner – can you differentiate between these two?</p><p>Sometimes the language goes a little too far &quot;parsimonious with the human experience&quot; page 15.</p><p>Methods: Tell us a little more about the colonies and genetic variation within them; how inbred are they?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The methods state that prairie voles were treated differently in the behavioral and transcriptomics studies. This might be why the authors do not see a strong behavioral degradation of pair bond-related behavior after long-term separation but do see a strong transcriptional signature.

It was noted that there are subtle but perhaps important differences in the separation protocol used for the behavioral studies versus the transcriptomics. This combined with the behavioral data here not being consistent with the published literature undermines the current conclusions. The Reviewers felt that repeating the behavior but with the precise protocol used for the transcriptomics would allow for more direct comparison and strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>2) The value added by the use of TRAP was questionable. This approach should either be further validated or more strongly justified if it is to remain in the manuscript.</p><p>3) Some conclusions were overly anthropomorphized and an extensive literature on the roles of oxytocin and vasopressin in pair-bonding in this species was neglected. Changes in wording and emphasis combined with some new material in the Discussion could easily address this.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their thoughtful and constructive comments which have helped us improve our manuscript. In our revised manuscript, have respond to three main weaknesses:</p><p>1. We addressed the inconsistency in the experimental design across the behavior and the transcription experiments by repeating the behavior with an experimental timeline that more exactly matches that of the animals used in transcriptional studies and in which separated animals were housed in separate colony rooms. Briefly, we replicated our initial results and found that same- and opposite-sex pairs display a partner preference even after prolonged partner separation. However, by including an additional control group that was never separated, we also found that although partner directed huddle increased in animals that remain paired from two to six weeks, this was not true for animals that were separated, suggesting that separation disrupts normal bond strengthening. Thus while the behavior seems surprisingly robust in light of the observed transcriptional changes, we are confident that our core finding – that voles can maintain a preference despite prolonged separation – is indeed a reliable finding.</p><p>2. We further validated and justified our use of TRAP and our focus on the NAc as the sole brain region of investigation as articulated in more detail in the manuscript and below in our response to reviewers.</p><p>3. We revised the language throughout the manuscript, especially in the discussion, to reduce anthropomorphizing our results and interpretations. Below we have provided responses to specific concerns articulated by each reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Prior work has implicated both the oxytocin and vasopressin systems in pair bonding, albeit in complicated ways, but there was both no discussion of that here nor an opportunity to provide a positive control since the nucleus accumbens does not include these systems. Perhaps the authors could discuss this as among the shortcomings.</p></disp-quote><p>A primary goal of our approach was to expand work in prairie voles beyond the narrow focus on nonapeptide systems. Justifying our approach to use RNA sequencing for an unbiased investigation, it was recently shown that the oxytocin receptor is not genetically required for pair bonding thus suggesting OXT-independent mechanisms of attachment in voles (<italic>20</italic>). We agree that an interesting area of future research will be to determine the contribution of nonapeptides to the observed pair bond transcriptional signature, but it was not a primary goal of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Presumably the authors plan future studies using viral vectors to either over-express or repress candidate genes for manipulating the endurance of pair bonds. It is very unfortunate that the behavior did not correspond as expected. The authors' explanations for why this might be are legitimate but it does leave one wondering what to do next and highlights the challenge of such large sequencing studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The opportunity to examine large biological datasets provides both challenges and opportunities. It this case, we have gained valuable timing information regarding the stability of pair bond transcription and the erosion of transcriptional signatures and robustness of partner preference following loss. Yet we are studying a</p><p>complicated system where we need additional information before confidently choosing and manipulating targets. In addition by repeating our behavioral experiments by including animals that remain paired we now know that separation impedes the strengthening of bonds providing us with an opportunity to potentially manipulate bond maturation. Such work is currently underway in our lab but beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study was clearly a ton of work, and the authors marshall an impressive amount of data to address an important and understudied question. The combination of bioinformatics + bench work to get methods going in an emerging model is impressive.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It could help make the article more accessible to a wider readership if the authors could explain a little more clearly what vTRAP tells us that RNAseq doesn't. Why do we care about neuronal vs non-neuronal processes?</p></disp-quote><p>We feel that inclusion of TRAP adds substantially to this manuscript and to our understanding of the neuromolecular underpinnings of bonding and loss in the NAc. The value of this experiment is twofold. As noted by Reviewer 3, “the TRAP approach in prairie voles is novel and will provide a great resource to the research community.” The prairie vole community has just developed its first transgenic Cre lines, which could be paired with vTRAP to query bond-associated gene expression changes exclusively in Cre-expressing neurons (12). Second, we noticed a puzzle in our tissue-level data. The majority of cells in the NAc are neurons (13, 14), and the vast majority of pair bonding studies of this region have focused on neuronal phenotypes, but our transcriptional signatures were linked to changes in glial populations. Ultimately, changes in glia are likely to act via their interactions with neurons, and vTRAP enables us to query specifically the neuronal transcriptional changes within our data. Supporting that this provides novel insights into our datasets, when we cluster transcripts based on their expression profiles following short and long-term separation, we predict different GO terms from the tissue level and neuronally-enriched gene sets. For instance, the GO terms resulting from cluster 2 for neuronal genes (Fig 4) includes “response to amphetamine” within the top 10 results, but the same cluster of genes from tissue level sequencing predicts this GO term as the 34th result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the language about the transcriptomic results implies within-individual change although that can't be possible given that sampling is terminal, e.g. &quot;…stably maintained while animals remained paired but eroded…&quot; (abstract).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. It was not our intent to imply within animal changes but rather to clarify potential transcriptional signatures that characterize bonding and loss where some language signifying continuity is unavoidable (e.g. you cannot experience loss without a bond to lose). We have updated the verbiage throughout to clarify that our measurements are not evidence of within-animal change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation of the transcriptional differences: clearly the transcriptional differences are not causal to the behavior that happened in the past. The decoupling of behavior and transcription offers some insights – the behavior remains the same (still shows behavioral signs of bonding) but the gene expression diverges; authors infer it has to do with the ability to establish a new bond but it's likely to be more heterogeneous? What about recovery from the loss, for example? Doesn't it seem likely that some of the DEGs reflect the ability to establish a new bond while others are probably about other processes, e.g. recovery?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there appears to be a mismatch between the behavioral and transcriptional results. Because of this we repeated the behavior (please see public response to Reviewer 1) with separate cohorts of animals for each separation timepoint and the addition of a remain paired cohort that stayed with their partner throughout the six weeks of the experiment. When we compared opposite-sex paired males that remained with their partner to those that were separated from their partner we observed that separation impedes the continual strengthening of the pair bond. We interpreted this result to mean that upon separation the original pair bond is not lost per-say it is not being maintained in the way that it would be if the animals had stayed paired. Thus, the behavior now more closely resembles the transcriptional result of a residual pair bond signature that erodes over the course of separation. Future experiments will focus on a more nuanced understanding of how transcription can influence behavior to remain pliable in multiple social contexts. We addressed this comment in the discussion as follows:</p><p>“Pair bonding and loss are complex and multifaceted processes, engaging diverse neural circuits in temporal- and context-specific ways. Yet transcriptomics provides a single snapshot of gene expression at one point in time in one context. So while tissue-level transcriptional analysis is an excellent tool to capture an averaged biological state, one limitation of our approach is that it is not ideal for examining more temporally-dynamic processes, such as the rapid information-processing that occurs during social decision making.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Top left page 2: provide refs to support statements like &quot;considering that other stable behavioral shifts…are underwritten by changes in transcription&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this oversight to our attention.

Our identification of such “usual suspects” demonstrates that our results are consistent with the known biology of pair bonding. This dually validates prior work and provides opportunities to expand our understanding by looking at other features of our dataset. In particular, our genomic approach has expanded our understanding via: (1) identification of transcriptional patterns important for regulating behavioral states, (2) identification of upstream regulators that modulate such multi-gene expression patterns, and (3) insight into potential biological processes not previously implicated in pair bonding, such as oligodendrogenesis/myelination, which would be unlikely to result from focusing on candidate genes alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 14, L column: &quot;transcripts associated with glia…&quot; so can the effects of the experience of pair bonding vs pair bonding itself be teased apart?

And (2) bonding requires multiple component processes (social recognition memory, motivation, reward association, etc). Towards the former, we are currently investigating the hypothesis that gliogenesis/myelination may be required for bond formation/maturation, consistent with its role in other complex forms of learning and long-term memory (<italic>21</italic>–<italic>23</italic>). These results will be presented in a separate manuscript. Towards the latter, the behavioral test we employed (the partner preference test) is the gold standard to assessing pair bonds, but it cannot dissociate the different component processes that contribute to bonding.

Thus we repeated our behavioral assessment using a design that directly matches the one we used in our transcriptional assessment. Specifically, we included a set of “remain paired” controls, separated partners were kept in separate colony rooms to ensure no possible access to partner-associated sensory cues (visual, auditory, olfactory), and separate cohorts of animals were used for short- and long-term separation. This design avoided partner re-introduction during the short-term partner preference test. In short, we replicated our initial findings; prairie voles will display a partner preference for same- or opposite-sex partner even after prolonged separation. Of note, animals that remained paired showed an increase in partner-directed affiliation (huddle time), which was not observed in separated animals suggesting that separation impairs the normal strengthening of bonds with time.

Did I miss this? I feel that this is an important comparison to show.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. While we had looked at this in some of our initial analyses, we ultimately chose to focus on the question of what happens to the pair bond signature upon short- or long-term separation, thus omitting this secondary analysis. Based on the above question, we revisited this RRHO, which is now provided in Figure 3 —figure supplement 5. Notably, we see substantial overlap in the UU and DD quadrants in the short-term to long-term separation comparison. This pattern is particularly enriched for overlapping DD transcripts, which is the inverse of what we see in the pair bond::short term RRHO. One likely explanation for this potential overlap, especially in the DD quadrant, is that we are picking up on genes that have already eroded by the short-term separation timepoint and remain eroded after long-term separation. Supporting this interpretation, we took the UU and DD quadrant gene lists (referred to as stable separation genes) and filtered the DESeq2 results of the pair bond, short-term separation, and long-term separation (the same process as Figure 3H and I) for these genes. We identified an interesting pattern in that the genes that were most highly up- or downregulated in the pair bond showed a reversal of expression after short-term separation, correspondingly falling in the opposite UU or DD quadrant post-separation. Thus we filtered the stable separation genes for each condition by a log2FoldChange &lt; -0.30 in the UU quadrant and &gt; 0.30 in the DD quadrant and assessed the transcriptional state of these genes in the pair bond. Figure 3 —figure supplement 5B and C show that the genes that were most downregulated in the UU quadrant show a sharp inversion of expression after short-term separation that is maintained through long-term separation and vice-versa for the DD quadrant genes. Thus, there are subsets of transcripts that are up- or downregulated in pair bonded animals that are already exhibiting erosion after short-term separation. We further asked which biological processes are represented by the genes in Figure 3 —figure supplement 5D and E to investigate which processes are sensitive specifically to short-term separation. We found that UU genes that are then downregulated are associated with dopaminergic processes and DD genes that are then upregulated are associated with neuronal rearrangement processes. Thus, this RRHO analysis enriches our interpretation of transcriptional erosion of pair bond signatures following partner separation. Also related to point R3.2, overall we observed only slight to moderate erosion at the short-term timepoint, which was masked when relying exclusively on a strict p-value cutoff as in Supplemental Figure 6F. Rather, our rigorous experimental design, which has been noted as a strength of this manuscript, allows for more interrogation of the temporal complexity of these transcriptional signatures via threshold-free approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the volcano plots, it would be helpful to indicate the number of transcripts that are up or down-regulated on the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the number of upregulated and downregulated genes to each volcano plot.

We note that most labs rarely confirm Cre-dependence of vectors in more than one or two animals as the results, including those shown in Figure 4 —figure supplemental 2A, are typically definitive (i.e. no expression in the absence of Cre, expression in the presence of Cre). In addition to the images shown in Figure 4 —figure supplemental 2A, we used fluorescent guided dissection to harvest tissue/mRNA, serving as an additional visual confirmation of RPL10-GFP expression in the animals used to generate Figure 4. Additionally, a collaborating lab also confirmed that this vector also expresses in rats when Cre-recombinase is present. Finally, we performed two additional surgeries to confirm that TRAP is only expressed in the presence of Crerecombinase since the prior submission.</p><p>References</p><p>1. J. L. Scribner, E. A.
