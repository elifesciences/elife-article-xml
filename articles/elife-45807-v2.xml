On the forefront of this expansion is magnetogenetics, where ion channels are genetically engineered to be closely coupled to the iron-storage protein ferritin. Initial reports on magnetogenetics have sparked a vigorous debate on the plausibility of physical mechanisms of ion channel activation by means of external magnetic fields. The criticism leveled against magnetogenetics as being physically implausible is based on the specific assumptions about the magnetic spin configurations of iron in ferritin. I consider here a wider range of possible spin configurations of iron in ferritin and the consequences these might have in magnetogenetics. I propose several new magneto-mechanical and magneto-thermal mechanisms of ion channel activation that may clarify some of the mysteries that presently challenge our understanding of the reported biological experiments. Finally, I present some additional puzzles that will require further theoretical and experimental investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mouse</kwd><kwd>rat</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barbic</surname><given-names>Mladen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Several new magneto-mechanical and magneto-thermal mechanisms of ion channel activation in magnetogenetics are proposed that may explain some of the mysteries that challenge current understanding of the magnetogenetics experiments.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interaction of biological systems with magnetic fields has puzzled and fascinated the scientific community for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kirschvink and Gould, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kirschvink et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Walker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazylinski and Frankel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnsen and Lohmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Johnsen and Lohmann, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hore and Mouritsen, 2016</xref>). While experimental evidence for magnetic sense in animals seems uncontroversial, the mystery of biophysical mechanism of its action remains unresolved. Despite the challenges in deciphering the fundamental operating principles of magnetic control of biological ion channels, cells, and organisms, the attraction of influencing biological systems with magnetic fields has remained strong. This is mainly due to the fact that external DC and AC magnetic fields easily penetrate biological tissue, are easily generated by current carrying wires or permanent magnets, and their properties and engineering design tools are well understood. These features of magnetic fields are commonly used in medical diagnostics applications such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McRobbie et al., 2017</xref>), and there is a strong impetus to apply the same advantages of magnetic fields to control biological function, as is the case in Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Walsh and Cowey, 2000</xref>).</p><p>Coupling modern genetic engineering techniques with the magnetic fields to influence biological activity has the potential to be a particularly robust way to combine the strength of both methods in control of cellular function. This is the approach of a recent technique development, commonly termed magnetogenetics, where thermo-sensitive and mechano-sensitive ion channels are genetically engineered to be closely coupled to the iron-storage protein ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stanley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stanley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>). Initial reports that introduced this new technology have received significant attention and commentary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anikeeva and Jasanoff, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Nimpf and Keays, 2017</xref>), as well as considerable criticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meister, 2016</xref>). The plausibility of presented mechanisms of mechanical and thermal activation of ion channels has been challenged on physical grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meister, 2016</xref>), and the present state of reported experimental observations in magnetogenetics and basic magnetic physics arguments that challenge those observations remain in conflict.</p><p>The total energy of a spin system has terms related to the interaction of the individual spins with the external magnetic field, plus the interaction energy of the spins among themselves. The later contribution can be quite large, as occurs in ferromagnatism. This total energy must be compared with the thermal energy and, for interacting systems, the thermal energy may be too small to appreciably dephase the spins. Thus the possibility for experimenters to exploit the interaction of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo with external magnetic fields (~1T) is not unreasonable. Here, I present the case that the physical viability of magnetogenetics depends critically on many physical parameters of the basic control construct (iron-loaded ferritin protein coupled to the thermo-sensitive or mechano-sensitive ion channel in the cell membrane) that are presently not well known or understood, and therefore the physical possibility of magnetogenetics cannot yet be discounted and needs to be further explored. These critical parameters include the magnetism and magnetic spin configurations of iron atoms in the ferritin protein, as well as the realistic thermal, mechanical, and diamagnetic properties of ion channels and neural cell membranes coupled to the iron loaded ferritin. Additionally, I propose several new possible mechanisms of ion channel activation based on the magneto-caloric effect, mechanical cell membrane deformation by the diamagnetic force, and the mechano-thermal Einstein-de-Haas effect. I also discuss the fundamental magnetic moment fluctuations of the magnetic particle in ferritin and its presently unknown but potentially relevant effect on the ion channels in cell membranes. I emphasize that all of the arguments in this study are presented as theoretical exercises of what is in principle possible, both in terms of the magnetic materials synthesized within the ferritin protein and the experimentally applied settings. Further careful materials science and magnetometry studies need to be carried out to evaluate the viability of the described processes for in vivo magnetogenetics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Magnetism of iron in ferritin protein</title><p>The fundamental genetically engineered construct in magnetogenetics, as reported by the original articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stanley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stanley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Stanley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wheeler et al., 2016</xref>), is shown diagrammatically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Thermo-sensitive or mechano-sensitive ion channels of the TRP family of channels (TRPV1 and TRPV4) were genetically engineered to be closely coupled to the novel chimeric iron-loading protein ferritin. External DC or AC magnetic fields were applied to this construct in in vivo experimental settings, and it was preliminarily concluded that thermal or mechanical magnetic effects were likely responsible for the observed biological responses, as was intended by the genetic engineering methods. This interpretation has been challenged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meister (2016)</xref> who has argued that the presently known magnetic force, torque, and heating mechanisms are many orders of magnitude smaller than necessary to activate ion channels and that the fundamental thermal energy level, k<sub>B</sub>T, is much larger than the energy of any mechanism of magnetogenetics so far proposed. This criticism is fundamentally based on the assumptions on the number of iron atoms (N = 2400) in the ferritin protein and on the magnetic configuration in ferritin protein that assumes iron spins as a collection of independent non-interacting particles (paramagnetic configuration). Here, I explore what the physical consequences would be if those spin assumptions are expanded to include larger number of iron atoms in the ferritin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chasteen and Harrison, 1999</xref>) (N = 4500) and spin configurations that allow for more strongly coupled iron spins within the ferritin core (ferromagnetic configuration).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45807.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetically engineered construct in magnetogenetics.</title><p>Thermo-sensitive or mechano-sensitive ion channel is closely coupled to the iron-loading protein ferritin.

Assigning the magnetic moment value to the iron atom between 0μ<sub>B</sub> to 5μ<sub>B</sub> (where μ<sub>B</sub> is the Bohr magneton, μ<sub>B </sub>= 9.27x10<sup>−24</sup> Am<sup>2</sup>) and spin coupling configuration (paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic, antiferromagnetic, etc.) is highly variable and chemistry dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coey, 2010</xref>). It should also be pointed out that the systematic and complete analysis of magnetism of the iron loaded ferritin core in all the reported magneto-genetics articles has not been performed, and therefore the magnetism of the fundamental magneto- genetic ferritin construct is not presently known. It is generally believed that iron forms different mineral forms within ferritin (for example, magnetite Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or maghemite ɣFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>). The original enhanced iron-loading chimeric ferritin, reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Iordanova et al. (2010)</xref> was characterized only by NMR and MRI, and showed that one of the fused heavy H and light L subunits constructs (the L*H chimera) exhibited significantly enhanced iron loading ability. It is not clear from this report how many iron atoms are indeed loaded into the L*H chimera construct, what chemical structure iron forms in that construct, what the spin configuration of the iron atoms in that construct is, or if there is any shape or crystalline or any other magnetic anisotropy in the L*H ferritin (as the magnetic moment vs. magnetic field or magnetic moment vs. temperature measurements or chemical crystal analysis were not reported). Previous literature on such materials science, biomimetic synthesis, and magnetic investigations of iron loaded ferritin, both in physics and biology, is voluminous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">St. Pierre et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">St. Pierre et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Awschalom et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awschalom et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gider et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">St. Pierre, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tejada et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wong et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Quintana et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Quintana et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collingwood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quintana and Gutiérrez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Uchida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Plascencia-Villa et al., 2016</xref>) and it is clearly imperative that such experimental techniques be applied to better understand the magnetism of the reported constructs in magnetogenetics studies.</p><p>In my analysis, I use the commonly stated maximum possible number of iron atoms in ferritin N = 4500 and assume atomic moment of m<sub>Fe</sub> = 5μ<sub>B</sub> per iron atom (the highest value reported for iron in oxide form, Table 3.5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coey, 2010</xref>), with the understanding that the actual number of iron atoms in ferritin in all the magnetogenetics reports is not presently known.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> diagrammatically shows the three distinct spin coupling configurations of iron atoms in ferritin that I consider as reasonable possibilities. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> represents N irons spins in a conventional paramagnetic ferritin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Meister, 2016</xref>) where all the spins are magnetically independent from one another and non-interacting. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> shows the case of ferromagnetic coupling between N iron spins where all the spins are strongly coupled by the exchange interaction and magnetically behave as a single macro-spin in what is commonly termed a superparamagnetic state of the magnetic particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coey, 2010</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, I consider a state that lays in between these two extremes. In this configuration, the N iron spins are separated into n independent clusters of N/n exchange coupled spins, and I will call this spin configuration a clusterparamagnetic state. There have been numerous experimental investigations on ferritin, both structural and magnetic, that indicate that such spin structure might be the most probable one in some cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Haggis, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">St. Pierre et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brem et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gálvez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Martínez-Pérez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Castro et al., 2012</xref>). For simplicity of analysis, I will assume that all of the n magnetic clusters in this spin configuration of the particle have the same number N/n of iron spins, and that the magnetic moments of the n clusters within the ferritin particle are magnetically independent (non-interacting). It should be clear that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> represents the most general spin configuration with n clusters of N/n spins in each cluster, while the paramagnetic state of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> is a special case with n = N and the superparamagnetic state of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> is a special case where n = 1.

However, for the superparamagnetic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) spin arrangement (n = 1, black curve of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), the particle moment saturates at relatively low magnetic fields, well below 1 Tesla, where the magnetic moment has the value of m = 2×10<sup>−19</sup> (Am<sup>2</sup>), three orders of magnitude higher than for the paramagnetic state. This is the classic superparamagnetic particle behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bean and Jacobs, 1956</xref>) where N = 4500 spins are uniformly exchange coupled and act as a giant single paramagnetic spin.

In fact, there have been experimental reports on iron-loaded ferritin where the magnetization measurement closely follows the superparamagnetic curve (black line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bulte et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moskowitz et al., 1997</xref>).

I now consider a thermal mechanism that to my knowledge has not been considered for the clusterparamagnetic spin arrangement in magnetogenetics: the DC magneto-caloric effect in the iron-loaded ferritin particle. Magneto-caloric effect refers to the heating and cooling of magnetic materials by DC magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coey, 2010</xref>). It is fundamentally based on the physical principle that an ensemble of magnetic spins in zero magnetic field is fluctuating and therefore maximally randomized and in a high entropy state. Upon application of a polarizing magnetic field the magnetic spins align in the field which lowers the entropy of the spin ensemble. In an adiabatic process where there is no exchange of heat with the environment, this change in spin ensemble entropy has to be compensated for by the exchange of energy between the spin ensemble and the magnetite particle lattice, resulting in the change of temperature of the particle. This process of magnetic adiabatic cooling has been used in low-temperature physics for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giauque, 1927</xref>) to obtain milliKelvin temperatures in paramagnetic salt powders and sub-milliKelvin temperatures with nuclear spins in metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Simon, 1952</xref>). Although such magnetic adiabatic energy transfers are generally performed only at cryogenic temperatures, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McMichael et al.

It is a fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics that magnetic moment m of a particle is proportional to mechanical angular momentum L of that particle, m = ɣ·L, where ɣ is the gyromagnetic ratio, ɣ = e/m<sub>e</sub>, for spin angular momentum of iron (where e is charge of the electron and m<sub>e</sub> is mass of the electron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coey, 2010</xref>]). The Einstein-de Haas effect refers to the magneto-mechanical effect, required by the conservation of angular momentum, where a reversal of a magnetic moment of a sample by an applied magnetic field has to be accompanied by a corresponding change in mechanical angular momentum of that sample. This physical principle has been experimentally confirmed on both the macroscopic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scott, 1962</xref>) and microscopic samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wallis et al., 2006</xref>), and recently also on the molecular scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ganzhorn et al., 2016</xref>).

In the initial state, magnetic field is applied along the positive z-axis and the magnetic moment +m is aligned with the magnetic field. This moment caries mechanical angular momentum of L = +m/ɣ. As the magnetic field is reversed, the magnetic moment also reverses to -m value, which corresponds to the new mechanical angular momentum of L = -m/ɣ. This total change of angular momentum of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf11"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>ΔL = 2m/ɣ has to, by the law of conservation of angular momentum, be compensated for by the mechanical rotation of the magnetite particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chudnovsky, 1994</xref>) (the Einstein-de Haas effect).

It is interesting to compare this value to the maximum energy loss per cycle of 1 (J/kg) typically reported for magnetic hyperthermia applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hergt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hergt et al., 2006</xref>).

So I also consider the situation in which the spherical magnetite particle is fixed inside the ferritin protein and cannot freely rotate. In this situation the change in the magnetic moment direction of the magnetite particle from +m to -m which results in the change of the mechanical angular momentum L of the particle from +m/ɣ to -m/ɣ now has to impart a torque on the surrounding medium, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Γ</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where Δ<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is the time of reversal of the magnetite particle magnetic moment.

How this Einstein-de Haas torque would be transferred to the mechano-sensitive ion channel for activation is unknown and remains to be theoretically and experimentally explored.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Magnetic moment fluctuations of Iron-Loaded ferritin</title><p>I finally discuss a topic of ferritin particle magnetic moment fluctuations (the topic that has generally been omitted in the discussion of magnetogenetics) and its potential effect on the ion channels. As described earlier, for the potentially superparamagnetic spin arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) of the ferritin particle, the magnetic field near the particle surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) has a relatively large value of 0.65 Tesla. This magnetic field from the particle is not static, but is in fact fluctuating rapidly in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown, 1979</xref>), as I show schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>. The frequency of this fluctuation at physiological temperature is significant and measured to be in the GHz frequency range through low-frequency magnetic susceptibility, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kilcoyne and Cywinski, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Casalta et al., 1999</xref>). Such superparamagnetic moment fluctuations have also been experimentally observed on a single particle scale at low temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wernsdorfer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Piotrowski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hevroni et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the ion channel in the vicinity of the potentially superparamagnetic iron-loaded ferritin experiences large magnetic field gradients and Tesla-scale magnetic fields at GHz frequencies, as well as the corresponding GHz frequency diamagnetic forces and torques, as discussed earlier. Upon application of the external DC magnetic field, of say 1 Tesla, the magnetic moment saturates, and the ion channel experiences DC magnetic field, field gradient, diamagnetic force, and torque, as I show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>. I am presently not aware of any experimental or theoretical studies that have investigated cell membrane or ion channel behavior in such extreme conditions of combined high amplitude magnetic fields (Tesla-scale) and field gradients (10<sup>8</sup>–10<sup>9</sup> T/m scale) and ultra-high frequencies (1–10 GHz scale), and yet that would appear to be the environment in which the genetically engineered ion channels in magnetogenetics might be operating. Therefore, studying ion channel properties, both theoretically and experimentally, in those conditions where the timescale of ferritin magnetization dynamics and molecular physical reorientation would be warranted before final conclusions could be made about the possibilities and limitations of magnetogenetics.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45807.009</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Magnetic moment fluctuations.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In zero external magnetic field, the ion channel experiences Tesla-scale magnetic fields and large field gradients from the fluctuating superparamagnetic particle moment at GHz-scale frequencies, as well as the corresponding AC diamagnetic forces and torques.

Several of these interactions have energy scales on the order of or higher than the k<sub>B</sub>T level. I emphasize that the energies associated with these interactions depend strongly on the iron spin clustering assumptions within the ferritin particle and are valid only for applied DC laboratory magnetic fields in the range of 0.1–2 Tesla. Some, but by no means all, reported magnetogenetics experiments to date were performed in the conditions I describe in my analysis (many AC magnetic fields applied in reported magnetogenetics experiments were much weaker), and therefore further control and confirmation experiments with the reported magnetogenetics constructs are warranted. Many parameters that are critical to the full understanding of magnetogenetics remain unknown and include: (1) the exact iron magnetism, spin clustering configuration, spin dynamics, and magnetic anisotropy of the ferritin construct utilized so far in magnetogenetics studies, (2) the realistic mechanical and thermal nano-environment around the iron-loaded ferritin, (3) the diamagnetic (and perhaps even paramagnetic) properties of ion channels and cell membranes next to the iron-loaded ferritin, and (4) the functional properties of ion channels under the influence of simultaneously large amplitude and ultra-high-frequency magnetic fields and field gradients. Therefore, the experimental path forward clearly demands isolation of the used magnetogentics constructs and careful measurement of the above listed properties of such constructs. This would preferably be done on a single iron-loaded ferritin protein in order to avoid the confusion due to averaging of many ferritin particles. In addition to the mentioned scanning probe methods and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and crystallography that are already being performed on a single ferritin particle level, modern techniques of SQUID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cleuziou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vasyukov et al., 2013</xref>) and cantilever force and torque magnetometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stipe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tao et al., 2016</xref>) have achieved spectacular magnetic moment sensitivities (down to a single Bohr magneton). It would be exciting to apply them toward the characterization of single ferritin constructs reported in magnetogenetics to evaluate both their magnetic properties (as they are critical to the magnetogenetics topic in general) and the magneto-mechanical forces and torques that can be externally applied to them (as they critically relate to the magnetogenetics mechanisms I suggest as potentially plausible in particular). Importantly, these modern ultra-high sensitivity magnetometry techniques should also be utilized towards measuring the diamagnetic and paramagnetic susceptibilities of ion channels and lipid cell membranes in order to guide further experimental progress in magnetogenetics. TEM and FRET techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cost et al., 2015</xref>) could potentially be applied to investigate the described diamagnetic membrane nanodeformations next to iron-loaded ferritin protein upon application of magnetic fields. Finally, modern nanocalorimetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fon et al., 2005</xref>) and nanothermometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jaque and Vetrone, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">del Rosal et al., 2017</xref>) techniques have also advanced to the point that studies on individual iron-loaded ferritin thermal properties and temperature changes are in principle feasible in order to evaluate some of the proposed magneto-thermal mechanisms for magnetogenetics I suggest as potentially plausible.</p><p>It is entirely possible that additional magnetic effects on ion channels in neural cell membranes, such as the phase changes and deformations in lipid bilayers due to magnetic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yamaguchi and Tanimoto, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maret and Dransfeld, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tenforde and Liburdy, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kurashima et al., 2002</xref>), gradient magnetic field effects on the ion diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kinouchi et al., 1988</xref>) and the resting membrane potential of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zablotskii et al., 2016</xref>), as well as the induction of calcium influx in cells by nanomagnetic forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tay et al., 2016</xref>) could further influence magnetogenetic activation of cells.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Possible magneto-mechanical and magneto-thermal mechanisms of ion channel activation in magnetogenetics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, all experts in magnetic materials and magnetic interactions, and the evaluation has been overseen by Reviewing Editor and respondent David Kleinfeld, with Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. One outside individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Peter Littlewood (Reviewer #1).</p><p>As Reviewing Editor, I think this is an important contribution as it bears on the utility of novel perturbation techniques to probe neuronal systems. You further take issues with past analysis (Meister, 2016) for the mechanical activation via magneto-torques or, in conjunction with TRP channels, magnetic hysteresis for heat activation. In particular, the past analysis considered only the interactions of single spins with a magnetic field. All reviewers agree with this basic point, and that the present manuscript is a welcome contribution toward understanding physical limitations to neurological measurements. Yet all reviewers have provided pointed criticisms that will lead to an improved work.</p><p>Before we dive into the weeds, I would suggest that the manuscript could start with a simple statement about interacting magnetic systems. Perhaps a brief summary for your consideration could be &quot;The total energy of a spin system has terms related to the interaction of the individual spins with the external magnetic field, plus the interaction energy of the spins among themselves. The later contribution can be quite large, as occurs in ferromagnetism. This total energy must be compared with the thermal energy and, for interacting systems, the thermal energy may be too small to appreciably dephase the spins. Thus the possibility for experimenters to exploit the interaction of magnetic nanoparticles in vivo with reasonable (~ 1 T) external fields is not unreasonable&quot;. Also, and following reviewer comments, you need to explicitly say up front that you are arguing matters of principal, as the necessary materials have yet to be discovered or synthesized in vivo.</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of critical technical issues. I request that you answer each reviewer comment and modify the manuscript accordingly. A summary of the key issues includes:</p><p>1) Further discussion of the physics of ferritin, for which there is a substantial literature, and I would also argue for a discussion of the known classes of all iron/nickel/cobalt/rare earth-containing compounds that could be seized for use in Biology.</p><p>2) Analysts of the interaction of ferritin, and other molecules, that does not make use of a quasistatic approximation. As noted by Littlewood, the relaxation time is short, i.e., estimated at less than 100 fs, and is far shorter than the period for the RF excitation in many of the experimental papers that you discuss.</p><p>3) The discussion about prior experiments is fuzzy and needs to be clearly stated. As noted by reviewer 2, you agree that many claims seem unreasonable for the interactions between ferritin and the Earth's approximately 50 mT magnetic field. This disagreement should be stated clearly. You then raise the additional point that the effects of interactions could be seen in approximately 1 T magnetic fields. The later are readily obtained in the laboratory, even easily obtained for localized, pulsed fields. Make this new claim stand out clearly.</p><p>4) A discussion – even brief – on the prospects for materials with large interactions being synthesized.</p><p>5) A discussion of an experimental path forward would be very useful and powerful way to conclude the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper addresses a controversial topic of magnetogenetics, which has been roundly criticized as being physically unreasonable. The main criticism is that because the moment of a ferritin molecule is so small, the magnetic susceptibility at room temperature is tiny, and there is no plausible physical effect that could arise in the typical magnetic fields that have been applied. This paper starts by accepting the basic criticism of Meister, 2016, and then systematically looks for physical conditions that would overturn the criticism. The paper is well-written, thoughtful, and I have few complaints about the analysis which has been performed. I will suggest that there is an avenue of investigation that has been missed, however.</p><p>The paper points out that the magnetic structure of Fe compounds is complicated, and that indeed one can have antiferromagnetic, ferromagnetic, and indeed more complex magnetic ordering of Fe compounds. A hypothesis is presented that in fact the ferritin core might allow for ferromagnetic configurations so that a &quot;cluster&quot; ferromagnet is the ground state with a much larger moment than has been traditionally assumed for ferritin (and indeed measured in ex vivo). I can't comment on the biological plausibility of such an arrangement, except to note that it will require very different atomic arrangements in the molecule, more akin to magnetite than what is generally accepted for ferritin. But I agree that if this is accepted, then by having much larger ferromagnetic clusters, it’s not too hard to overcome the kT problem. So here I see the issue as an experimental one – isolate the ferritin and measure its magnetic properties.</p><p>Indeed, once one accepts that there is a FM core, one can also generate a magneto-caloric effect (although this is generally a much larger effect near the critical point of an AFM) as well as the Einstein-de Haas effect. What I will remark in general is that all of these effects are potentially relevant provided they are carefully tuned so that the magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal energy, and that is fundamentally the game here. As a theoretical exercise, this paper is fine.</p><p>I am puzzled, however, that this paper and previous discussions as well (no less Meister, 2016) don't focus at all on what we know about ferritin, which has been rather well studied as a physical molecule (if for non-biological reasons). Conventional &quot;horse-spleen ferritin&quot; seems to be a strong antiferromagnet (i.e. its effectively ordered up to apparently high temperatures) with a small uncompensated moment that is much smaller than the ordered antiferromagnetic moment. The physics of ferritin doesn't have much to do with its small residual magnetic moment. I've seen no studies that suggest that ferritin has the kind of cluster ferromagnetism suggested in this paper. In fact, ferritin is so strongly ordered at low temperatures that the only mechanism to &quot;flip&quot; the spin of this molecule below a few tens of Kelvin is quantum mechanical tunneling. Anyway, the magnetization dynamics of this system as an ex vivo molecule have had a lot of attention in the condensed matter physics literature – for example D. D. Awschalom et al., 1992., Tejada et al., 1997, but indeed there is quite a lot of literature that's not been addressed in this paper or the previous ones.</p><p>Because there is an accidentally(?) small overall magnetic moment, in an applied field the overall magnetic configuration can flip (assuming that the molecule itself is stationary, as we will see a generally good approximation). This has been measured. Fits to a simple Arrhenius plot (Kilcoyne and Cywinski, 1995) give an activation temperature of 318K and an characteristic attempt time of 9x10<sup>-12</sup> seconds. This comes from direct measurement up to a few kHz, and also Mossbauer – corresponding to probably 100 MHz. If this can be extrapolated to 300K (i.e. the system remains antiferromagnetically well ordered) then the characteristic frequency F<sub>0</sub> would be on the order of 30 GHz (or the characteristic time scale 30 fsec). This is quite a long time-scale on a molecular size – for example a sound wave in water propagates about 50 nm in 30 fs.</p><p>Anyway, the point is that on a time scale shorter than 1/F<sub>0</sub> the ferritin will be magnetically frozen, and in particular there will be populations of magnetization that (briefly) show hysteresis. This time scale is almost certainly shorter than the time scale for the molecule to physically reorient (by rotation, like a bar magnet) and it is not so different from the natural time scales for molecular motion on the relevant time scales for an ion channel. In consequence, I am not convinced by any analysis that assumes a quasi-static equilibrium population of &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; moments.</p><p>Since this is a very speculative topic, let me throw in something else. It's not at all implausible that the typical anti-ferromagnetic ordering temperature could be in the range of biological relevance. There are well-described physical systems where modest magnetic fields on the 1T scale modulate such phase transitions, and indeed have consequences in macroscopic properties such as giant magnetocaloric effects, and abrupt changes in conductivity and electrical screening (for example much studied in manganites). I find it interesting to note that the characteristic time scale for magnetic rearrangement in ferritin hits a microscopic scale just around room temperature, and – biology being what it is – perhaps this is not an accident.</p><p>What would be helpful on this topic would be a careful experimental materials science study of this system, rather than having too many more speculative theory papers. Coming back to the present paper, I think it’s useful, though in my view incomplete.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Mladen Barbic analyzes several physical mechanisms that could enable &quot;magnetogenetics&quot;-the control of neuronal activity with magnetic fields. The paper is somewhat of a response to &quot;Physical limits to magnetogenetics&quot; in <italic>eLife</italic> by Markus Meister. In that paper, Meister goes through a few convincing arguments that the magnetic fields, forces, and energies associated with magnetogenetic tools are orders of magnitude smaller than those necessary to sufficiently magnetize a ferritin protein or open an ion channel. Barbic's paper verifies many of Meister's arguments, using a more detailed approach to his calculations. Barbic argues though that if one considers the possibility of ferritin being superparamagnetic, then with strong, experimentally realizable, magnetic fields, one may reach the force values necessary to open ion channels. Meister does acknowledge the possibility of superparamagnetic ferritin but doesn't take it into account in his calculations. Perhaps oddly, Barbic does not refute Meister at all – indeed the previously reported experimental magnetogenetic studies still lie almost entirely outside of the parameter regime where Barbic suggests that external magnetic fields could open a channel coupled to ferritin.</p><p>In this way, Barbic's comparison to experiment is unsatisfying. He presents scenarios that parallel the experiments in some ways (for example, a single ferritin with 4500 Fe atoms coupled to an ion channel), but then argues that a response is plausible in a magnetic field that is notably stronger than the ones used in the same experiments (e.g. 1 Telsa vs. 50 mTesla in the experimental papers). What, then, does Barbic make of the experimental data, and how valuable are his comparisons to the experiments? Considering all these things, Barbic's paper, which is quite reasonable, has a strange effect: it presents itself as suggesting that experimental magnetogenetic results are plausible, but then shows arguments that, in my view, discredit the proposed mechanisms in the experimental magnetogenetics papers. I would urge Barbic to contend more specifically with the previous experimental results.</p><p>Despite what I said above, I think this paper is a contribution to the literature on magnetogenetics. It does computations where Meister provided back-of-the-envelope numbers and explores a much wider array of magnetization for ferritin particles. Moreover, it presents new physical mechanisms that could enable magnetogenetic manipulation with the systems that have already been created. Regarding the new mechanisms proposed by Barbic, I believe he should expand his analysis of diamagnetic forces and include more details, as I outline in the notes below. The magneto-caloric effect seems a bit less convincing. Similarly, the Einstein-de Haas discussion seemed somewhat plausible, but not exciting. Perhaps it would be interesting for the author to propose experiments that would test whether or not magnetogenetic effects are due to these physical mechanisms?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper discussed several magneto-mechanical and magneto-thermal mechanisms that the author theorized that may potentially account for the reported ion channel activation in magnetogenetics. There have been several recent reports of the ability to activate ion channels (e.g. TRPV1 and TRPV4) that are fused with ferritin using DC and AC magnetic fields. The mechanisms of these observed effects are actively being debated without a consensus being reached. Critically, some argued that the interaction between ferritin and the applied magnetic field is not sufficient to produce the needed heat or force for channel activation. In this paper, the author considered a number of hypothetical scenarios that may generate the needed heat or force. The nature of this consideration is theoretical; the discussion is timely. It provides some additional directions in searching for the underlying mechanisms for the reported effects.</p><p>1) The proposed mechanisms seem to all involve the application of a strong static magnetic field. In the cited literature Stanley et al., 2012, 2015, the vast majority of the experiments were done with RF waves at 100s KHz. About one half of the experiments in Stanley et al., 2016, were also done at RF frequencies; the rest were done at the fringe field (0.2-0.5T as reported) of a 3T MRI scanner. Wheeler et al., 2016, was done with static fields (&lt; 1T). Other related work used different types of magnetic fields, e.g. Hutson et al., 2017 was done at RF field at μT range, while Mosabbir and Truong, 2018, used a pulsed DC field at mT range. Since the proposed mechanisms require a strong static field, it will be necessary to make a distinction between these experimental conditions.</p><p>2) The work by Mosabbir and Truong, 2018, used a static electromagnet that was programmed to be 5 s on and 2 min off on the order of 10 mT. This field seems to be much smaller than what is needed for the proposed mechanisms.</p><p>3) The proposed mechanisms all require the ferritin to be highly loaded (if not full) with iron and the iron spins to be highly coupled to produce a large magnetic moment. The direct experimental evidence of such configurations seems to be lacking. If one were to go about testing this hypothesis, what experiments would the author suggest?</p><p>4) For the mechanism evoking Einstein-de Haas effect, the magnetogenetic experiments that have been reported so far involving mostly the application of slowly changing magnetic field that does not induce rapid flipping of spins. Further, when RF fields are applied, the magnetic field at mT or μT will likely not be strong enough to flip the spins all together. The quoted energy of 0.33x20<sup>-21</sup> J has to come from the RF waves which do not seem to have that kind of energy density.</p><p>5) In general, a suggestion of testable experiments would be helpful for evaluating each mechanism proposed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45807.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><italic>Before we dive into the weeds, I would suggest that the manuscript could start with a simple statement about interacting magnetic systems.

I now clearly state that the manuscript argues the topic as a matter of principle, also per reviewing editor’s suggestion.</p><p>2) I am in strong agreement with all the reviewers that the major challenge now in magnetogenetics is an experimental one of isolating and measuring ferritin structurally and magnetically, hopefully on a single particle level. I performed a wide literature search on the experimental methods that might be suitable for such a task, and the manuscript now includes an extensive discussion on the potential experimental path forward, per all the reviewers’ and editors’ requests. Where appropriate, I now clearly state what experimental technique might be particularly appropriate for testing some of my model predictions.</p><p>3) I now clearly state the experimental range of validity of my calculated estimates, and clearly state that some, but by no means all, previous experiments in magnetogenetics fall into that experimental range, and therefore require further careful experimental study and confirmation.</p><p>4) Upon receiving the reviewers’ request, I performed an extensive literature search on the previous physics and materials science findings on ferritin, and all of those relevant citations that the reviewers requested are now cited in the revised manuscript. Where appropriate, I now clearly state where the previous experimental findings relatively closely match my model system assumptions.</p><p>5) I now acknowledge the challenge of the magnetization dynamics of ferritin, per reviewer request. I have an extended discussion on the ferritin magnetization dynamics in the manuscript now, while acknowledging clearly that this speculative topic is heavily understudied in magnetogenetics and requires further investigation.</p><p>6) Per reviewer request, I now have a more extended discussion on the estimate of diamagnetic deformation, and I include a new more specific order of magnitude calculation based on the results from contact mechanics that elaborates on my model estimation and further justifies it. Per reviewer suggestion, I added further references that bolster that model suggestion.</p><p>7) Per reviewing editor request, I now include a brief discussion on the wider prospects of using synthesized materials with large interactions that might be possible with ferritin protein. I have added numerous citations to bolster that discussion and suggestion.</p><p>8) Where appropriate, as suggested by the reviewers, I have modified and simplified the relevant figures. I have added more labels that the reviewers pointed out were needed and removed some redundant or misleading lines and arrows in some of the figures that the reviewers pointed out were confusing.</p></body></sub-article></article>
