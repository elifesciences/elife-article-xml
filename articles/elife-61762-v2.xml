to transform into epithelial-like cells surrounding the implantation chamber forming an avascular zone called the primary decidual zone (PDZ). In the mouse, the PDZ forms a transient, size-dependent permeable barrier to protect the embryo from maternal circulating harmful agents. The process of decidualization is critical for pregnancy maintenance in mice and humans. Mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, show compromised PDZ with dysregulated angiogenic factors, resulting in the retention of blood vessels and macrophages. This phenotype is replicated in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> but not in <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice. In vitro decidualization models suggest that <italic>Cnr1</italic> levels substantially increase in mouse and human decidualizing stromal cells, and that neutralization of CB1 signaling suppresses decidualization and misregulates angiogenic factors. Taken together, we propose that implantation quality depends on appropriate angiogenic events driven by the integration of CB2 in endothelial cells and CB1 in decidual cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decidualization</kwd><kwd>endocannabinoid</kwd><kwd>CB1</kwd><kwd>primary decidual zone</kwd><kwd>CB2</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA006668</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>Sudhansu K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD068524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>Sudhansu K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD103475</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dey</surname><given-names>Sudhansu K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cannabinoid signaling is critical for integration of vascular system and uterine decidualization.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Decidualization is a critical pregnancy event that follows embryo implantation. During the initial stages of decidualization in mice, stromal cells transform into epithelioid cells (epithelial-like) surrounding the implanting embryo and form an avascular zone. This region is called the primary decidual zone (PDZ) and is critical to embryo development and successful pregnancy outcomes in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2012</xref>). The PDZ encircles the implantation chamber (crypt) on day 5 of pregnancy and is fully established by day 6. Because the PDZ is avascular, this zone is normally devoid of maternal immune cells, and protects embryos from circulating maternal insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tung et al., 1986</xref>). Recently we have shown that Scribble (Scrib), a scaffold protein and a component of the planar cell polarity (PCP), plays a key role in PDZ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). However, molecular regulation in the formation of the PDZ is still far from clear.</p><p>Natural cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol, the most potent psychoactive component) and endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoilglycerol) signal through two membrane receptors, CB1 (encoded by <italic>Cnr1</italic>) and CB2 (encoded by <italic>Cnr</italic>2). Both CB1 and CB2 are G-protein coupled receptors in the Gi/o and Gq families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pertwee et al., 2010</xref>). CB1 is mainly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), but also appears in peripheral tissues including the uterus, heart, testis, liver, and small intestine. By contrast, CB2 is mostly expressed in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berdyshev, 2000</xref>). We have recently shown that CB2 is also expressed in uterine endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Cnr2</italic> increases uterine edema before implantation and causes suboptimal implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our work has previously shown that elevated cannabinoid signaling is detrimental to early pregnancy events in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun and Dey, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we have shown that <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have compromised implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that silencing of endocannabinoid signaling is also detrimental to early pregnancy events. In the study, we showed that the litter sizes of double mutant mice, but not single mutant mice, are substantially smaller than wild-type (WT) mice. We also found that endothelial cells with <italic>Cnr2</italic> deletion play an important role in embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, resorption rate is lower in <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females than in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females during the midgestational stage, indicating a critical role of CB1 in early pregnancy. Since CB1 abundance is quite low in the uterus, its role in early pregnancy remains obscure.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the roles of endocannabinoid signaling in decidualization using mouse models with suppressed CB1 and CB2 and a primary culture of <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> stromal cells. The results show that double mutant mice have compromised PDZ formation, resulting in suboptimal pregnancy outcomes. Further investigation revealed that <italic>Cnr1</italic> is expressed in decidual cells. These results, combined with our previous knowledge of CB2 expression in endothelial cells, show for the first time that angiogenic actions incited by CB2 are integrated by CB1 in decidual cells to form the avascular PDZ, which is critical for pregnancy success.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females have suboptimal decidualization</title><p>Previously we showed that <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> uteri have defective decidualization and consequent increases in midgestational resorption rates. However, the mechanism by which the absence of CB1 and CB2 signaling compromises uterine decidualization remains unclear. To explore this further, WT and <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females were mated with WT males. Induction of <italic>Ptgs2,</italic> a rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandin formation, at the crypt (implantation chamber) epithelium and underlying stroma has been shown to be critical to initiate decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lim et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, we examined the expression of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> on day 5 of pregnancy to capture the influence of <italic>Ptgs2</italic>. The expression pattern and signal intensity of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> is comparable in WT and <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), indicating stimulation from embryo implantation is well received by <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> uteri. However, the in situ hybridization of <italic>Bmp2</italic>, a morphogen expressed by cells undergoing decidualization at the site of embryo implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paria et al., 2001</xref>), reveals that stromal cell decidualization is defective in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females on day 5 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Expression of <italic>Hoxa10</italic>, also critical for decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benson et al., 1996</xref>), shows a similar reduction in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Decidual defects in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> uteri continue on day 6 of pregnancy. The tridimensional (3D) structure of implantation sites reveals that, on day 6 of pregnancy, decidual responses in WT mice promote the uterine lumen to form an arch shape, whereas in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites, the lumen remains flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The domain of <italic>Bmp2</italic> positive signals is reduced in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In contrast, stromal cells after decidual transformation downregulate the expression of <italic>Bmp2</italic>. More decidualized cells around the implantation chamber negative for <italic>Bmp2</italic> signals are observed on day 6 of pregnancy in WT mice as compared to <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). With decidualization in progress, <italic>Ptgs2</italic> expression transitions from the antimesometrial side of the crypt to the mesometrial side in the WT crypt on day 6 of pregnancy. In <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites, cells on the lateral side of the implantation chamber show <italic>Ptgs2</italic> signals, suggesting impeded progress of decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females show normal responses to embryonic stimulation during implantation, but decidual process is compromised.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) In situ hybridization of <italic>Ptgs2</italic> in uteri on day 5 of pregnancy.

We observed that the distribution of hematopoietic cells, as revealed by a pan hematopoietic marker CD45, is comparable in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and WT uteri on day 4 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This observation is further confirmed by the distribution of macrophages, which are demarcated by a macrophage marker F4/80 staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Austyn and Gordon, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). These results suggest that hematopoietic cells normally enter the uterus of <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice before implantation. On day 6 of pregnancy, most hematopoietic cells migrate away from the implantation chamber in WT females, whereas some hematopoietic cells fail to do so in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, most macrophages are absent from the WT implantation chamber, but some macrophages remain around the <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> embryos, albeit at reduced number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The significant lingering of macrophages in the <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> endometrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) suggests that impeded decidual responses in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females fail to dispel macrophages efficiently. Collectively, the result suggests that the normally developed decidua protects the developing blastocyst from inflammatory insult from macrophages and that this safe-guard mechanism is compromised in double-mutant mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Macrophages are retained around implantation chambers of compromised deciduae in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Uterine leukocytes in pre-implantation are highlighted by CD45, which is expressed on all leukocytes.

As previously stated, the PDZ is an avascular zone comprised of stromal cells undergoing epithelial-like transformation and is impermeable to maternal immune cells; as such, this zone is indispensable to protect and support further embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tung et al., 1986</xref>). The finding that macrophages remain close to <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation chambers prompted us to examine the formation of the PDZ on day 6 of pregnancy. PDZ formation requires Scrib signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>), yet the Scrib positive domain is much reduced in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This result is also supported by the presence of blood vessels, revealed by immunostaining of FLK1, a reliable marker of blood vessels, in the <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> PDZ on day 6 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Consequently, defective PDZ formation results in more resorption later in pregnancy in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females.</p><p>Most previous work examining the roles of endocannabinoids in decidualization applied cannabinoids to stromal cells. Although some pharmacological studies using CB1 antagonists suggest CB1 mediates the effects of endocannabinoids on stromal cells, there is no genetic evidence to support this conclusion. Using stromal cells isolated from pregnant rats, a previous report showed that endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) interferes with stromal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic> application of AEA in pseudopregnant rats impaired decidualization with reduced levels of Cox1 and VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fonseca et al., 2015</xref>). There was evidence for a similar observation in humans. In this respect, AEA impairs cell proliferation and differentiation in the human endometrial stromal cell line and primary cultures of decidual fibroblasts from term pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almada et al., 2016</xref>). There is further evidence that oxidative metabolites of AEA by Cox2 may compromise the normal decidual process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almada et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the ectopic application of endocannabinoids, our study used mouse models with suppressed cannabinoid signaling. The studies cited above seem to contradict our current findings that cannabinoid signaling is detrimental to decidualization in rats and humans. However, we have shown previously that either amplified or silenced cannabinoid signaling can interfere with early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun and Dey, 2012</xref>). These results suggest that optimal endocannabinoid signaling contributes to pregnancy success, reinforcing our conclusion that normal decidualization requires appropriate cannabinoid signaling.</p><p>The function of ANGPT2 in angiogenesis largely depends on the presence of VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holash et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holash et al., 1999b</xref>) in that VEGF, ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 function cooperatively to promote angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asahara et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Visconti et al., 2002</xref>). ANGPT2 destabilizes the preexisting vasculature, which consequently responds to angiogenic stimuli. The activated vasculature is extended and stabilized by ANGPT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holash et al., 1999b</xref>). In the absence of VEGF, ANGPT2 destabilizes vasculature, which undergoes vascular regression. In implantation sites, VEGF and ANGPT1 have similar expression patterns on day 6 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Halder et al., 2000</xref>), but neither is present in the PDZ; only ANGPT2 is expressed in this zone. The consequent avascular zone in the PDZ is considered conducive to the implanting embryo. In the current study, <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression is retained in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> PDZ with reduced expression of <italic>Angpt2</italic>, so that vasculature and macrophages are still observed in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> PDZs.</p><p>Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key modulators of the transcriptional responses to hypoxic stress. HIFs are heterodimers of an α-subunit and a stable β-subunit (ARNT). Of the three isoforms, HIF1A and HIF2A are the most studied and structurally similar. HIF1A is considered to have a broader expression pattern in most cells, whereas HIF2A is selectively induced in certain cell types, including endothelial cells and renal interstitial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Keith et al., 2012</xref>). In our study, <italic>Hif1a</italic> is expressed mostly in stromal cells except for the PDZ cells of day 6 implantation sites, while <italic>Hif2a</italic> is induced in PDZ. The transcriptional regulation of HIFs on angiopoietins is specific to tissue and cell-type. For example, in primary human endothelial cells, HIF1A increases mRNA levels of <italic>ANGPT2</italic> and <italic>ANGPT4</italic> but not <italic>ANGPT1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamakawa et al., 2003</xref>). In the current study, the overlapping expression of <italic>Hif1a</italic> and <italic>Angpt1</italic>, in tandem with the similar expression pattern of <italic>Hif2a</italic> and <italic>Angpt2</italic>, suggests that HIF1A increases <italic>Angpt1</italic> expression in stromal cells and HIF2A induces <italic>Angpt2</italic> transcription in decidualized cells in the PDZ. Taken together, our study illuminates a major responsibility for endocannabinoid signaling in modulating vascular remodeling and integrity. This finding was exemplified in increased vascular leakage at <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> implantation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In conclusion, this investigation reveals that CB1 actions in decidual cells, combined with angiogenic activities driven by CB2, facilitate the formation of the avascular PDZ, which is critical for pregnancy success. Whether other signaling pathways join in this orchestration remains to be seen.</p><p>Decidualization is a complex process. Although there are unique differences, some common features of this process are evident in mice and humans. As such, decidualization in mice begins with implantation, whereas decidualization in humans occurs in each menstrual cycle, but becomes more intense like in mice, after implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cha et al., 2012</xref>). Our results suggest that the induction of CB1 is a common feature shared by mouse and human decidual cells, and blockage of CB1 compromises <italic>in vitro</italic> decidual responses in mice and humans. Whether the PDZ is formed in human implantation or other subhuman primates is not known. However, the epithelial plaque formed during early pregnancy in macaque may have a similar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Enders, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-E-cadherin (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# 3195S, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2291471">AB_2291471</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Whole mount IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 594 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat# 711-585-152, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340621">AB_2340621</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Whole mount IF(1:300)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Cytokeratin 8, TROMA-1 (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">Cat# TROMA-I, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_531826">AB_531826</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-CD45, (Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">Cat# 103101, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_312966">AB_312966</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIF1A (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">Cat# 36169T, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2799095">AB_2799095</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-HIF2A (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Novus</td><td valign="top">Cat# NB100-122SS, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10002593">AB_10002593</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-F4/80 <break/>(Rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Biolegend</td><td valign="top">Cat# MCA497R, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_323279">AB_323279</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-Scrib (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">Cat# sc-28737, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2184807">AB_2184807</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 594 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rat IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat#712-585-150, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340688">AB_2340688</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat# 711-545-152, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2313584">AB_2313584</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Cy2 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rat IgG (H+L)</td><td valign="top">Jackson Immuno Research</td><td valign="top">Cat# 712-225-153, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340674">AB_2340674</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary WT,<italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse uterine stromal cells</td><td valign="top">The current laboratory</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Primary mouse uterine stromal cells freshly isolated from mouse uteri</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Human uterine fibroblasts</td><td valign="top">Cincinnati Children’s Hospital</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">A gift from Handwerger laboratory.

In this regard, the results of work such as yours could be used by regulatory agencies, for example, in deciding about information to include on warning labels. Thus, the data in your paper has important scientific and practical value.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Pregnancy success in mice requires appropriate cannabinoid receptor signaling for primary decidua formation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation among the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All the reviewers found the work submitted for publication to be important and interesting. However, the suggested experiments would take significant time to perform.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Previously the investigators showed that <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>/Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit defective decidualization and are subfertile. Here they go on to explore the mechanism behind aberrant decidualization. They use a series of marker genes to show that the defect emerges during the postimplantation period in vivo and is attributable to malformation of the primary decidual zone. They also show that <italic>Cnr1</italic> is up regulated during and required for decidualization of mouse uterine stromal cells in vitro. Similarly, decidualization of human uterine stromal cells is accompanied by very substantial increases in CNR1 expression. A major strength of this work is the importance of understanding the role of these receptors in reproduction given the widespread use of marijuana. Weaknesses include the fact that many of the results are based on correlatives rather than direct functional relationships.</p><p>1) The number of animals that were employed for each experiment should be clearly stated.</p><p>2) Whenever possible more quantitative analyses would be desirable, for example, immunoblots to confirm altered expression of the proteins encoded by the marker genes. Added proof for abnormal vascularization of the primary decidual zone in the form of counting the vessels would be desirable. Similarly, quantifying macrophage retention would also be helpful. Also, the degree of contraction or expansion of marker expression could be measured.</p><p>3) The functional relationships that are drawn among Vegf, the Hifs and the Ang1/2 in situ hybridization patterns should be softened as Hif activity is regulated at the protein level.</p><p>4) The in vitro analyses are somewhat superficial. In addition to assaying the expression of molecules that correlate with decidualization, pictures of the cells that document the expected morphological changes would also be desirable.</p><p>5) The authors show a very impressive rise in CNR1 expression with decidualization of human uterine fibroblasts. However, they fail to show the importance of this receptor in the process by demonstrating the effects of its elimination.</p><p>6) The starting material for both the mouse and human in vitro experiments appeared to be decidua. Were the cells de-differentiated and how many different donors were employed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Li and coworkers investigates the role of cannabinoid receptor signaling in pregnancy. The tow cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 are expressed in uterine stroma cells and endothelial cells, respectively. They show that the double knockout of CB1 and CB2 result in impaired primary decidual zone development, increase invasion of immune cells and increased vascularization. They also show that CB1 is increased in human uterine fibroblasts that decidualize in vitro. They imply that the two receptor must coordinate the uterine fibroblast differentiation and endothelial cells act together for normal embryo implantation. This is an exciting finding and will generate general interest. However there are two issues that would strengthen this manuscript.</p><p>The manuscript should clearly define the phenotype of the single knockouts of CB1 and CB2 to show which parts of the double phenotype are present in the single and double and which phenotypes are novel with respect to the double knockout. This is with respect the expression of the marker genes observed. This would show that they separately regulate the vascularization and stroma cell decidualization and together these process are required or is there synergy between these two compartments. This should be discussed.</p><p>The authors imply a role of CB1 in human endometrial stroma fibroblast decidualization. They should employ knockdown of CB1 in these cells and show the impact on decidualization. This would increase the relevance of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Pregnancy success in mice requires appropriate cannabinoid receptor signaling for primary decidua formation&quot; by Li Y et al. evaluates the influence of cannabinoid signaling through <italic>Cnr1</italic> and <italic>Cnr2</italic> by forming primary decidual zone (PDZ) along with changes in angiogenic features in the decidual bed during pregnancy. The deficiency of these genes in mice, results in compromised primary decidualization, since it presents abnormal blood vessels formation and presence of macrophages into the implantation chambers.</p><p>The hypothesis that cannabinoid/endocannabinoid signalling, through <italic>Cnr1</italic> and <italic>Cnr2</italic>, compromises decidualization and embryo implantation success is straightforward and the double mutant model <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup> Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> used is appropriate. However, the experimental design used in each experiment is confuse and not consistent. The results explanations and the figures are a quite difficult to understand. There is a lack of detail about the experimental planing and the sample size used. The relevance and interpretation for the inclusion of in vitro decidualization of human uterine fibroblast experiment is not explained properly.</p><p>This reviewer has the following major comments and suggestions:</p><p>– For consistency, this work uses three different mice models <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>, Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and double mutant <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup>.</italic> However, it is very confusing to follow which model is used in each experimental part and the reason to do it. The authors should detail the mouse model used for each experiment and to justify their use.</p><p>– The experimental design is missing and should be included along the manuscript in the Results, Materials and methods, and figure legends. To understand this work the readers need to know mouse model or human samples used, sample size and replicates in each experiment. Those experiments performed using mice models should be included: days of female sacrifice (day 4, 5, 6 and 8), sample size for each sacrifice day, tissue collected, number of implantation sites analyzed, number of sections evaluated in each experiment of immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization. These details should be included along the manuscript to understand the results presented.</p><p>– The authors indicate along the manuscript that their finding about primary decidual zone formation is disrupted in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> females compromising their pregnancy outcomes. However, no data or result about pregnancy outcome is included. Introduction: &quot;In this study, we show that endothelial cells deleted of <italic>Cnr2</italic> have important roles in embryo implantation&quot;; &quot;Cnr1's critical role in early pregnancy&quot;, &quot;The results show that double mutant mice have compromised PDZ formation, resulting in suboptimal pregnancy outcome&quot;. However, no data or result about pregnancy outcome is included.</p><p>– Decidualization is the core process of the study. The authors should explain the biology of this process and its role in pregnancy in the Introduction section. In addition, the Introduction did not mention that the in vitro approach with human uterine fibroblast; however it is mentioned in the Abstract. Please include these experiments in the Introduction and its connection with the rest of the results.</p><p>– The experimental techniques are based on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. These experiments let us to observe the expression pattern and signal intensity between groups (wild type and <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice). However, all the findings showed are descriptive. The author should include a quantitative method to quantify these parameters and to apply a statistical analysis to corroborate if the differences observed are significant. It is crucial to strengthen the results.</p><p>– Materials and methods shows a description about RT-PCR but no experiment was included along the manuscript. It seems that these experiments were performed but are missing in the figures. Please, include this data that are very useful to corroborate the fluorescence in situ hybridization results, using a quantitative method as RT-PCR.</p><p>– The IF and in situ hybridization experiments should be performed using the same markers for the different days selected. For example, in the Figure 3A the staining CD45 and F4/F80 was performed in day 4 of pregnancy and Figure 3B F4/F80 and PECAM in day 6 of pregnancy. Please, show the same markers for the different days analysed.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Pregnancy success in mice requires appropriate cannabinoid receptor signaling for primary decidua formation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below in the individual reviews:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors did a good job of responding to my comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Pregnancy success in mice requires appropriate cannabinoid receptor signaling for primary decidua formation&quot; by Li Y et al. evaluates the influence of cannabinoid signaling through <italic>Cnr1</italic> and <italic>Cnr2</italic> by forming primary decidual zone (PDZ) along with changes in angiogenic features in the decidual bed during pregnancy. The deficiency of these genes in mice, results in compromised primary decidualization, since it presents abnormal blood vessels formation and presence of macrophages into the implantation chambers.</p><p>The authors have followed most of my recommendations and the paper has improved remarkably. Still some points need to be addressed:</p><p>– The authors use the sentence &quot;samples sizes are indicated in each figure&quot; in material and methods sections.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] A major strength of this work is the importance of understanding the role of these receptors in reproduction given the widespread use of marijuana. Weaknesses include the fact that many of the results are based on correlatives rather than direct functional relationships.</p><p>1) The number of animals that were employed for each experiment should be clearly stated.</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers of animals/samples in immunostaining and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments are now included in the revised figure legends (Figures 1-5). Sample sizes in quantitative PCR experiments are labeled in the bar diagrams (Figures 6-8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Whenever possible more quantitative analyses would be desirable, for example, immunoblots to confirm altered expression of the proteins encoded by the marker genes. Added proof for abnormal vascularization of the primary decidual zone in the form of counting the vessels would be desirable. Similarly, quantifying macrophage retention would also be helpful. Also, the degree of contraction or expansion of marker expression could be measured.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have performed quantitative analyses of several parameters. Counting blood vessels in uterine sections may not provide more meaningful information, because of changes in the limited domain of the primary decidual zone (PDZ) and due to different dimensions and sizes of uteri under different experimental conditions. Therefore, we have quantified blood vessels in the (PDZ) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have also quantified macrophage numbers in the endometrial domain (Figure 3D), as well as the suppression of Ang1 and Hif1a and induction of Ang2 and Hif2a signals in the PDZ (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). To address the reviewer’s concern regarding decidualization of Huf cells, morphological changes and decidual markers have been quantified (Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). To study the biological significance of CB1 induction of decidualization in Huf cells, we also added quantitative data of changes in angiogenic factors in human uterine fibroblasts before and after decidualization (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The functional relationships that are drawn among Vegf, the Hifs and the Ang1/2 in situ hybridization patterns should be softened as Hif activity is regulated at the protein level.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide the expression status of Hif proteins by immunofluorescence staining (Figures 5E and 5F), which corroborates the results of <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We have softened the functional relationship statement in the text of the revised manuscript (end of subsection “Retention of blood vessels in Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup> PDZ is associated with multiple angiogenic factors”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The in vitro analyses are somewhat superficial. In addition to assaying the expression of molecules that correlate with decidualization, pictures of the cells that document the expected morphological changes would also be desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added morphological images of Huf cells before and after decidualization (Figure 7D-F and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). To strengthen the results of in vitro analysis and address the function of CB1 in decidualization, the latter was suppressed by a CB1 receptor specific antagonist (SR141716A, SR1) during decidualization, and the changes in decidual responses, as well as angiogenic factors were examined (Figure 8). More details regarding this question are included in the next question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors show a very impressive rise in CNR1 expression with decidualization of human uterine fibroblasts. However, they fail to show the importance of this receptor in the process by demonstrating the effects of its elimination.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a legitimate question raised by the reviewer. To show the function of CB1 in decidualization, we used pharmacological inhibition through a specific CB1 receptor antagonist SR1. We found that neutralizing CB1 greatly reduces decidual response with respect to its marker genes and other angiogenic factors (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The starting material for both the mouse and human in vitro experiments appeared to be decidua. Were the cells de-differentiated and how many different donors were employed?</p></disp-quote><p>For mice, we used day 4 pregnant uteri to isolate purified stromal cells. For human experiments, we used uterine fibroblast cells purified from endometrial tissues obtained from women with typical menstrual cycle; predecidualization stromal cells were undifferentiated, but with decidualization cells are differentiated into decidual cells as indicated by decidual markers. Three donor mice were used in each group (Figure 6). Human uterine fibroblast cell line was generated by Dr. Stuart Handwerger and generously donated to us for future studies (PMID 7506205).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript should clearly define the phenotype of the single knockouts of CB1 and CB2 to show which parts of the double phenotype are present in the single and double and which phenotypes are novel with respect to the double knockout. This is with respect the expression of the marker genes observed. This would show that they separately regulate the vascularization and stroma cell decidualization and together these process are required or is there synergy between these two compartments. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, the phenotypic differences between single and double knockout (<italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice are now shown in Figure 5. Decidual defects observed in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are observed in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as well, but not in <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that normal decidualization requires CB1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors imply a role of CB1 in human endometrial stroma fibroblast decidualization. They should employ knockdown of CB1 in these cells and show the impact on decidualization. This would increase the relevance of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the constructive suggestion. We have responded to this question using a specific CB1 receptor antagonist SR1 (see our response to reviewer 1’s question 5.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This reviewer has the following major comments and suggestions:</p><p>– For consistency, this work uses three different mice models Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>, Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup> and double mutant Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup>. However, it is very confusing to follow which model is used in each experimental part and the reason to do it. The authors should detail the mouse model used for each experiment and to justify their use.</p></disp-quote><p>The mouse models and the justification for use are now described in the Results section. To mechanistically address the role of CB1 and CB2 in vascular permeability and stromal decidualization, we have added data of angiogenic factors in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (Figure 5). Decidual defects observed in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are observed in <italic>Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice as well, but not in <italic>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which suggests that normal stromal decidualization depends on CB1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The experimental design is missing and should be included along the manuscript in the Results, Materials and methods, and figure legends. To understand this work the readers need to know mouse model or human samples used, sample size and replicates in each experiment. Those experiments performed using mice models should be included: days of female sacrifice (day 4, 5, 6 and 8), sample size for each sacrifice day, tissue collected, number of implantation sites analyzed, number of sections evaluated in each experiment of immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization. These details should be included along the manuscript to understand the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>A part of the question is similar to questions 1 and 6 of reviewer 1, please refer to our responses under each of the questions. We have added a full description of the experimental design encompassing the work done in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors indicate along the manuscript that their finding about primary decidual zone formation is disrupted in Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup> females compromising their pregnancy outcomes. However, no data or result about pregnancy outcome is included. Introduction: &quot;In this study, we show that endothelial cells deleted of Cnr2 have important roles in embryo implantation&quot;; &quot;Cnr1's critical role in early pregnancy&quot;, &quot;The results show that double mutant mice have compromised PDZ formation, resulting in suboptimal pregnancy outcome&quot;. However, no data or result about pregnancy outcome is included.</p></disp-quote><p>The original data for pregnancy outcomes of each mouse model used in the current study were presented in Figure 1A-1C in the previous report (PMID: 30776303). As suggested by the reviewer, the pregnancy outcomes are now summarized in the manuscript (Introduction section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Decidualization is the core process of the study. The authors should explain the biology of this process and its role in pregnancy in the Introduction section. In addition, the Introduction did not mention that the in vitro approach with human uterine fibroblast; however it is mentioned in the Abstract. Please include these experiments in the Introduction and its connection with the rest of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a legitimate question and the information is now provided in the Introduction section. The approaches to differentiate human uterine fibroblasts are now included in the Materials and method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The experimental techniques are based on the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence. These experiments let us to observe the expression pattern and signal intensity between groups (wild type and Cnr1<sup>-/-</sup>Cnr2<sup>-/-</sup> mice). However, all the findings showed are descriptive. The author should include a quantitative method to quantify these parameters and to apply a statistical analysis to corroborate if the differences observed are significant. It is crucial to strengthen the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used semi-quantitative methods to bolster our results and observations with statistical analyses (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and subsequent interpretation. In addition, we have added more quantitative data using qPCR experiments to examine the role of CB1 during decidualization (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Materials and methods shows a description about RT-PCR but no experiment was included along the manuscript. It seems that these experiments were performed but are missing in the figures. Please, include this data that are very useful to corroborate the fluorescence in situ hybridization results, using a quantitative method as RT-PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figures 6 and original Figure 7 were generated using qPCR. As suggested, to confirm the in situ hybridization results, we performed protein immunofluorescence staining (Figure 5E and F) and qPCR of angiogenic factors in HuF cells before and after decidualization (Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The IF and in situ hybridization experiments should be performed using the same markers for the different days selected. For example, in the Figure 3A the staining CD45 and F4/F80 was performed in day 4 of pregnancy and Figure 3B F4/F80 and PECAM in day 6 of pregnancy. Please, show the same markers for the different days analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have included additional data of these markers on different days of pregnancy, except PECAM which is now excluded from the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have followed most of my recommendations and the paper has improved remarkably.
