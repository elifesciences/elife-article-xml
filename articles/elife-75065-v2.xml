However, the functional properties of L2 cells and how they contribute to odor coding are unclear. Here, we show in awake mice that L2 cells respond to odors early during single sniffs and that LEC is essential for rapid discrimination of both odor identity and intensity. Population analyses of L2 ensembles reveal that rate coding distinguishes odor identity, but firing rates are only weakly concentration dependent and changes in spike timing can represent odor intensity. L2 principal cells differ in afferent olfactory input and connectivity with inhibitory circuits and the relative timing of pyramidal and fan cell spikes provides a temporal code for odor intensity. Downstream, intensity is encoded purely by spike timing in hippocampal CA1. Together, these results reveal the unique processing of odor information by LEC subcircuits and highlight the importance of temporal coding in higher olfactory areas.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory</kwd><kwd>odor processing</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC04682</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isaacson</surname><given-names>Jeffry S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC015239</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Isaacson</surname><given-names>Jeffry S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological recordings reveal how cells encode odor identity and intensity in the lateral entorhinal cortex of awake mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Olfactory cues provide rich information about the environment critical for behaviors as diverse as food seeking, social interactions, and predator avoidance. These behaviors depend not only on the identification of specific odors, but also on the detection of odor concentration which is essential for odor-guided navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ache et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marin et al., 2021</xref>). In mammals, olfactory information is initially encoded by the firing activity of olfactory bulb (OB) mitral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson and Mainen, 2006</xref>). This information projects directly via the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) to the primary olfactory (piriform) cortex (PCx), a region thought to be critical for odor perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blazing and Franks, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson and Sullivan, 2011</xref>). Although the properties of circuits in OB and PCx governing olfaction have received considerable attention, much less is known about odor processing in higher brain areas. In this study, we explore the nature of odor coding in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), a higher region that transmits information to the hippocampus which underlies odor-dependent memories and navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Radvansky and Dombeck, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The LEC receives two main sources of olfactory input: direct projections from OB mitral cells via the LOT and indirect projections via PCx principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haberly and Price, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>). These inputs synapse onto two distinct types of layer 2 (L2) principal neurons: fan and pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canto and Witter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobro-Flatmoen and Witter, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tahvildari and Alonso, 2005</xref>). Fan cells in L2a have extensive apical dendritic arbors but lack basal dendrites, express reelin, and project via the lateral perforant path to granule cells in the dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vandrey et al., 2020</xref>). Pyramidal cells are concentrated in L2b, express calbindin, project to stratum lacunosum moleculare of hippocampal CA1, and send feedback projections to the PCx and OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). LEC neurons respond in an odor-specific fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woods et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu and Wilson, 2012</xref>) and calcium imaging in anesthetized mice revealed that fan cells respond more selectively to odors than pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). However, the role of LEC in odor discrimination has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapuis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017</xref>) and the coding of odor identity and intensity by fan and pyramidal cells in awake animals has not been established.</p><p>Rodents can make odor-guided behavioral decisions based on neural activity triggered by a single sniff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong and Rinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uchida and Mainen, 2003</xref>) and studies have shed light on odor coding features of the OB and PCx. Odor identity is represented by the spatiotemporal activity patterns of OB mitral cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chong and Rinberg, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>) and the spike timing of cells early after odor inhalation is especially important for odor discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gill et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). Changes in odor concentration can be decoded from both spike rate and the temporal profile of odor-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang and Isaacson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Margrie and Schaefer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sirotin et al., 2015</xref>). In PCx, odor identity is represented by distributed ensembles of active layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blazing and Franks, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roland et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stern et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). Calcium imaging in anesthetized mice revealed that while PCx population response patterns become markedly different over a 100-fold change in odor concentration, responses in a subset of neurons are insensitive to concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roland et al., 2017</xref>). PCx recordings in awake mice indicate that odor identity is encoded by ensembles of pyramidal cells active early during individual sniffs in a manner invariant to odor concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). In contrast, odor intensity could be determined from a subpopulation of later responding pyramidal cells whose firing latencies shift earlier as odor concentration increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use extracellular recordings in awake mice, odor-driven behavior, and brain slice experiments to determine how LEC L2 principal cells contribute to olfactory information processing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rapid odor-evoked activity during single sniffs in LEC</title><p>Previous work revealed distinct differences in the timing of odor-evoked activity in the OB and PCx during individual sniffs. While OB mitral cells fire spikes at odor-specific latencies that tile individual respiration cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bathellier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>), PCx pyramidal cells preferentially fire within the first 100 ms of odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). However, the timing of odor-evoked activity in LEC relative to respiration-coupled firing in the OB and PCx is unknown. To address this question, we made acute simultaneous recordings of multiunit activity using silicon probes in the OB mitral cell layer, L2/3 of anterior PCx, and L2 of LEC in awake, head-fixed mice (<italic>n</italic> = 6 recordings from five mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We monitored nasal airflow at the outlet of a custom built olfactometer and delivered monomolecular odors (<italic>n</italic> = 11) triggered by the exhalation phase of respiration (respiration cycle duration ~300 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This approach allowed us to precisely align all recordings to the onset of the first inhalation of the applied odor for each trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Consistent with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>), while odors evoked OB mitral cell activity during both early and late phases of a sniff (peaks at 43 and 232 ms, respectively), responses in PCx selectively occurred early (peak time 53 ms) after odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Interestingly, we found that simultaneously recorded activity in LEC also preferentially occurred early after odor inhalation (peak at 75 ms, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Experiments using channelrhodopsin-driven firing of OB mitral cells revealed similar shifts in the timing of early activity from OB to LEC suggesting that increasing latencies largely reflect axonal conduction times across regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rapid responses dominate odor-evoked activity in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) layer 2 (L2).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Experimental setup for triple recordings of odor-evoked activity in the olfactory bulb (OB), anterior PCx, and LEC of awake head-fixed mice.

We used transgenic mice (<italic>Gad2<sup>cre</sup></italic> × Ai32) selectively expressing ChR2 in inhibitory neurons and made bilateral optical windows over the LEC for photostimulation (Materials and methods). Mice were trained (&gt;75% correct responses) to lick left or right to distinguish odor identity (isoamyl acetate vs. limonene, both at 1% concentration). For each trial (≥4-s interval), odor application (1-s duration) began at the respiration exhalation phase so that behavior could be aligned to the onset of the first inhalation of each odor. Mice were free to report their choice (left or right lick) at any time within 2 s of odor onset and fiber-coupled LEDs (473 nm) targeting the LEC bilaterally were used to suppress cortical activity during odor delivery on a random subset (25%) of trials. We found that LEC is critical for discrimination of odor identity since LEC silencing reduced the fraction of correct responses to the chance level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>, LED off: 83.76 ± 3.17%, LED on: 57.06 ± 5.22%, p = 0.009, paired <italic>t</italic>-test, <italic>n</italic> = 6 mice).

Vectors were binned in 1-ms intervals to examine the trajectory of the first three principal components following odor inhalation. Responses rapidly became more dispersed (discriminable) in PCA space (i.e., 0- vs. 75-ms postinhalation onset) and reverted to the preodor condition by 200 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). We measured discriminability using the Euclidean distance in PCA space for the different odors. This confirmed that the biggest difference in population activity occurred during the early peak of LEC odor-evoked activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). We next trained a linear classifier to test the ability to decode odor identity from population activity. Using a sliding time window (integrating 50 ms of activity every 5 ms), the classifier distinguished odor identities with high accuracy (&gt;90 %) within 100 ms of odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). We found an equally high accuracy in odor identification when cells were characterized only based on whether they showed significant increases in firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Thus, simply knowing which cell ensembles are active across the population provide as much information about odors as cell firing rates. While decoding accuracy remained high over the duration of the respiration cycle, reducing the integration time window for the linear classifier revealed a more transient increase in accuracy locked to the early phase of odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that LEC population activity during later phases of individual sniffs best contains information about odor identity when activity is integrated over longer time windows. Classifier performance specifically during the rapid peak of odor-evoked activity (50- to 100-ms postinhalation) improved as the population of cells used for classification increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), however, high levels of accuracy (&gt;50%) were readily achieved with ensembles of &lt;250 L2 neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spike timing in LEC encodes odor intensity</title><p>Does early odor-evoked activity in LEC also contain information regarding odor intensity? To address this question, we analyzed activity of single L2 neurons in response to four concentrations (0.25%, 0.33%, 0.50%, and 1.00%) of the same set of 11 odors. This fourfold change in concentration is within the range we used for behavioral discrimination (0.25% and 1.0%).

Indeed, the Euclidean distances in PCA space between responses to different odor concentrations revealed a clear peak within 100 ms of odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). However, these values were much less than those obtained from PCA comparing different odors and increasing concentration only slightly increased the distances that distinguished between odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>).

When studying odor-evoked responses at higher temporal resolution, we found that the average time to peak firing of L2 cells shifted earlier as odor concentration increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>). We quantified this shift by determining the time of peak firing (relative to odor inhalation) for all cell–odor pairs across odor concentrations and found that peak times shifted earlier with increasing odor concentrations (<italic>ρ</italic> = −0.04, p &lt; 0.001, Spearman’s rank correlation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4j</xref>). We next considered the possibility that changes in spike timing across the L2 cell population altered the relative synchrony of odor-evoked activity in LEC. Indeed, pairwise peak time differences for odor responses became smaller as odor concentration increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked from ChR2-expressing LOT fibers (473 nm, 4-ms flash) were significantly larger in fan vs. pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, 136.7 ± 3 and 22.3 ± 5.5 pA, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 7 pairs, p = 0.02, paired <italic>t</italic>-test).

Projections from piriform cortex provide another source of olfactory input to the LEC. To study these inputs, we used LEC slices from mice injected in anterior PCx with adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving expression of ChR2. A subset of experiments were performed in the presence of tetrodotoxin (1 µM) and 4-aminopyridine (100 µM) to ensure monosynaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>).

We drove interneuron firing with different durations of LED illumination (2–32 ms) and fit the relationship between LED duration and inhibitory charge with a line to compare the slopes of the input/output relationship for each cell pair. Interestingly, these experiments revealed that fan cells received substantially less inhibition from PV cells than pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i–k</xref>) while both cell types received the same relative amount of SOM cell-mediated inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l–n</xref>).

We found that odors activate principal L2 cells early during individual sniffs and that LEC is essential for rapid odor-guided behavior. Odor identity was readily decoded from the firing rates of ensembles of L2 cells, but rate coding appeared less useful for discerning odor intensity. Interestingly, changes in odor concentration were well described by shifts in the timing and synchrony of L2 cell spikes. We found that the two types of L2 principal neurons, fan and pyramidal cells, differ in their functional properties. Slice recordings revealed stronger olfactory input and weaker PV cell inhibition of L2 fan cells compared to pyramidal cells and targeted in vivo recordings showed that spike timing differences between the cell types contribute to odor intensity coding in LEC. Interestingly, we found that CA1 discards any concentration-dependent firing rate changes inherited from LEC and represents odor intensity using a purely temporal code.</p><p>In awake animals, the timing of respiration-coupled activity driven by odors varies across brain regions. While population activity of OB mitral cells spans individual respiration cycles, L2/3 pyramidal cells in PCx respond to odors preferentially early after odor inhalation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>). Recurrent inhibition has been found to enforce the short time window for sniff-coupled activity elicited by odors in PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). Here, we show in LEC, which receives input from both the OB and PCx, that odor-evoked activity is also largely limited to an early window within 100 ms of odor inhalation. Like PCx, local feedback inhibition presumably curtails late odor-evoked activity in LEC.</p><p>Previous behavioral studies have differed regarding the importance of LEC for odor discrimination. Chemical inactivation using LEC muscimol infusion in rats was reported to impair discrimination of complex but not simple multiodor mixtures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chapuis et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that LEC is only required for behavior requiring difficult odor discrimination. In contrast, more recent work in mice found that LEC muscimol infusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2021</xref>) or optogenetic suppression of LEC inputs to CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2017</xref>) degraded performance in simple, two-odorant discrimination tasks. Moreover, the LEC and fan cells in particular appear to play a critical role in the learning of new olfactory cue–reward associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). We found that optogenetic suppression of the LEC abolished rapid behavioral discrimination of both odor identity and intensity, indicating that the LEC is essential for simple odor-guided behavior. Mice made decisions during the 2AFC task using information obtained early during single sniffs of odor. Thus, it is likely that L2 activity early during individual sniffs is critical for odor-driven behavior. Our experiments required simple discrimination of markedly different odorants or odor concentrations; we do not rule out the possibility that mice could integrate LEC activity over longer periods (even across multiple sniffs) during tasks requiring more difficult odor discrimination.</p><p>While acute optogenetic silencing of LEC disrupted performance in behavioral tasks requiring discrimination of odor identity and intensity, our findings do not necessarily prove that odor discrimination within the LEC is required for behavior. It could be the case that LEC is essential for the retrieval of learned odor–reward associations while discrimination is provided elsewhere (i.e., piriform cortex). Nonetheless, our results are consistent with LEC playing a critical role in odor-driven behavior. An additional caveat to experiments using optogenetic silencing, is that acute perturbations could disrupt behavior by removing ‘permissive’ activity for downstream structures, rather than implicating the target circuit as ‘instructive’ for the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolff and Ölveczky, 2018</xref>). Future experiments examining the effects of chronic LEC inactivation on odor discrimination will be useful to probe this possibility.</p><p>Given the timing of odor-guided behavior and odor-evoked activity in LEC, we studied how information regarding odor identity is encoded by rapid L2 cell responses. We find that different odors are represented by overlapping ensembles of active cells in LEC, similar to odor coding in PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blazing and Franks, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poo and Isaacson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Uchida et al., 2014</xref>). Population analyses established that a firing rate code distinguished odor identity in L2 and distinct odor representations emerged rapidly (&lt;100 ms) after inhalation. Interestingly, as in PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>), simply knowing whether cells were activated or not by odors was as effective as knowing actual firing rates when decoding odor identity from population activity.</p><p>Increases in odor concentration over a fourfold range caused modest increases in firing rate of L2 cells and population analyses revealed that increases in concentration could improve discrimination of odor identity. However, for individual odors, changes in firing rate worked relatively poorly for decoding odor intensity from population activity. Analyzing odor response kinetics revealed another way odor intensity is represented in LEC. We found that increases in concentration shifted the times of peak odor responses earlier during individual sniffs and spiking became more synchronized across cells. In anterior PCx, odor representations were reported to be ‘concentration invariant’ when rapid population responses were studied using firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). On the other hand, a subpopulation of PCx neurons whose latencies decreased as odor concentrations increased have been suggested to provide a temporal code for odor intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2017</xref>). In LEC, firing rate clearly provides some information, albeit limited, for determining odor intensity from population activity. However, temporal features of the population response can well represent intensity in LEC.</p><p>We studied LEC L2 microcircuits in more detail using voltage-clamp clamp recordings in brain slices. We found that the L2 principal neuron subtypes, fan and pyramidal cells, differed in their local and long-distance inputs. Fan cells receive contacts from more OB mitral cells than pyramidal cells. PCx inputs are also stronger onto fan cells. One simple explanation for these differences is the fact that fan cells have more extensive apical dendrites spreading through L1, where inputs converge from LOT and PCx. Intriguingly, fan cells also received markedly weaker inhibition from PV cells. This suggests that odors may produce stronger afferent excitation and weaker somatic inhibition in fan vs. pyramidal cells. Interestingly, a study using paired recordings to examine local connectivity in LEC slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nilssen et al., 2018</xref>) reported that fast spiking cell connectivity was more prevalent with fan (17 connections of 28 pairs, 61%) than pyramidal cells (3 of 11, 27%). Differences in the approach for targeting interneurons genetic targeting (ours) vs. electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nilssen et al., 2018</xref>) could account for the apparent discrepancy between the studies.</p><p>We studied odor-evoked responses of fan and pyramidal cells using optogenetic tagging in cre mice. If connections from OB mitral cells to LEC are distributed ‘randomly’ as proposed for the PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schaffer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>) the fact that fan cells receive more LOT input than pyramidal cells suggests that they might be more broadly tuned for odors. However, we found odor representations were actually sparser for fan compared to pyramidal cells. This observation is consistent with a recent calcium imaging study reporting that fan cells are more odor selective than pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>). Given the smaller size of the LOT at the level of the LEC, odor representations here are presumably less influenced by direct OB input than PCx. More studies examining the distribution of OB inputs in the LEC would help understand tuning properties in this region.</p><p>We found marked differences in the timing of sniff-coupled responses in fan and pyramidal cells as odor concentration changed. Fan cells always responded earlier than pyramidal cells and their peak response times were largely concentration invariant. In contrast, the peak response times of pyramidal cells consistently shifted earlier as concentration increased. The net effect was a concentration-dependent increase in the synchrony of spiking between the two cell populations. We suspect that the stronger olfactory input and weaker PV inhibition onto fan cells, rather than broadening odor tuning, leads to their earlier activation than pyramidal cells following odor inhalation. Spike timing only carries information in relation to a reference signal. Our data suggest that fan cells could provide such a reference signal and the synchrony of fan and pyramidal cell firing could be used by downstream areas to read out odor intensity.</p><p>Like L2 LEC cells, CA1 neurons preferentially responded early during individual sniffs. Interestingly, firing rates of CA1 cells were completely insensitive to changes in odor concentration. This means that CA1 discards any firing rate changes encoding odor intensity relayed by LEC. Rather, odor intensity was encoded purely by concentration-dependent shifts in spike timing resulting in higher levels of spike synchrony as concentration increased. Temporal coding is thought to contribute to a variety of hippocampal features such as episodic memory and spatial navigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dragoi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eichenbaum, 2014</xref>). The temporal coding of odor intensity in hippocampus is likely also critical for basic behaviors requiring navigation to odor sources.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All animal procedures were in accordance with protocols approved by the University of California, San Diego Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.

The skull above the LEC was exposed bilaterally by carefully detaching muscles from the lateral ridge of the skull. An area of bone (~750 µm diameter) over LEC was thinned and covered with transparent cyanoacrylate glue to create a window for LED illumination. This window location makes it unlikely that PCx or medial entorhinal cortex were photosuppressed and surface illumination should not impact deeper brain regions such as the ventral hippocampus. Post hoc diI marking of the window center confirmed its location over LEC. After implantation, mice received dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) before returning to their home cage. Behavioral experiments were conducted using Bpod State Machines (Sanworks). After &gt;7 days of recovery, mice were water deprived (1 ml/day) and accustomed to handling and head fixation. Subsequently, mice were trained to lick for water in response to odor stimulation and trained to discriminate odor identity (isoamyl acetate 1% [vol/vol] vs. limonene 1% [vol/vol] in mineral oil) or odor intensity (ethyl tiglate 0.25% vs. 1% [vol/vol] in mineral oil) for several days in a 2AFC task until they reached the criterion of 75% correct choices. Mice indicated their choices by licking one of two lick ports for a water reward (5 µl). Respiration was recorded with a pressure sensor at the nose. Trials were initiated with a 50-ms tone. A custom-made closed-loop olfactometer was used for precisely timed and stable odor stimulation triggered by respiration.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Naoshige Uchida as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you will see below, all the reviewers appreciate the rigor of single neuron recording and slice physiology experiments, and the importance of the results from these experiments. However, the reviewers noted some difficulties in interpreting the optogenetic experiments to demonstrate the importance of LEC in a simple odor discrimination. The reviewers discussed on this issue, and agreed that careful discussions on potential caveats of this experiment would be necessary before publication of this work in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. A recent study by Kei Igrashi's group (Lee et al., Nature, 2021) showed that inhibition of fan cells, but not pyramidal neurons, impaired learning of new associations. Silencing of neither, however, affected the performance in already learned associations. The task and manipulations are somewhat different from the present study so it is difficult to compare directly but this appears to raise some concern or points to interpretational difficulty of the present results.</p><p>2. As Reviewer 2 pointed out, the animals with optogenetic silencing exhibited rapid licking relative to odor onset, indicating that the animals are displaying fast guesses before processing odor information. It remains unclear why mice exhibited fast guesses but this raises the possibility that mice reacted before having the chance to process odor information. If this possibility cannot be excluded, it remains unclear whether the impaired performance in the odor discrimination and detection tasks is due to an impairment in odor processing/discrimination or due to some other reasons that prompted mice to react before properly processing an odor.</p><p>3. There is a possibility of off-target effects. We recognize that this is true in most of previous experiments using transient manipulations. Nonetheless, given the above concerns, it would be useful to discuss potential caveats of off-target effects in the context of the present experiment.</p><p>The reviewers thought that discussing all of these issues would be important so that the results of optogenetic experiments can be placed in proper contexts. We would like to encourage the authors to include thorough discussions on the above issues as well as other issues raised below concerning the interpretation of the optogenetic experiments. To address these issues, additional experiments can be useful and we would welcome such efforts. However, we do not consider additional experiments to be essential for this revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic>The more rapid behavioral discrimination of intensity (175 ms) vs. identity (225 ms) is interesting and reasonable re: Resulaj and Rinberg (2015 – i.e. fast, though not necessarily faster concentration discrimination), but not entirely expected from Abraham et al., (2010), Bolding and Franks (2017), or with the authors’ own results about the relative timing of identity vs. intensity information in LEC. Note that this result is not necessarily inconsistent with Bolding or with this study, because of the expectedly longer reaction vs. encoding times, but still the relative difference warrants some discussion.</p><p>The PCA trajectories are nice, and it's somewhat surprising that these returned to baseline by 200 ms. How much of the variance do the first three principal components account for?</p><p>As stated above, the slice physiology experiments are nice, are an important addition to the literature, but are descriptive and do not integrate especially meaningfully into the rest of the manuscript. Interestingly, fan cells resemble semilunar cells in PCx. Like SLs, fan cells receive stronger LOT inputs that PYRs, but unlike SLs, they also receive strong(er) intracortical inputs.</p><p>The concentration effects are small, but the concentration range is small (4-fold; c.f. 100-fold change in Bolding 2017, Roland 2017), which makes it even more remarkable that they were able to resolve their concentration-effects so clearly. This is more of an observation than a point of contention.</p><p>Figure 2, b and c – the authors should state that the red markers represent means +/- sem. The error bars are very hard to see.</p><p>The authors should discuss, even briefly, the role of the LEC in odor-cue association (e.g. Igarashi…Moser, 2014; Lee…Igarashi, 2021; etc).</p><p>Figure 3S3b – The rapid increase and decay of normalized decoding accuracy with a 2-ms window is cute but a bit contrived given how bad actual performance is (a)</p><p>Why did they need to inject flex-tdTomato into Ai14 mice?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Temporal coding relative to sniffing:</p><p>Since sniff-locked encoding is examined across a relatively long period of time after each inhalation (up to 300 ms), and head-fixed mice often breath much faster than 3-4 Hz, additional information would be useful to understand the interpretation of “short” vs “long” coding latencies.</p><p>A. Were any measures taken to correct for multiple sniffs being included in the “long” latency period? From Supp. Figure 1b it does appear that some trials would include a second sniff happening in the time period between 200-300 after the first sniff onset. This could contribute to noise in the late response that would not be present in the early response.</p><p>B. Would the short vs. long latency coding results look different if only sniff cycles without another sniff in the long latency bins were included in the analysis? What about separately analyzing “short” and “long” sniff cycles (similar to Shusterman, et al., 2018)?</p><p>C. Could the authors comment on why &lt;100 ms was chosen as an “early” spiking response relative to inhalation? It seems that what is considered early and late in the sniff cycle can vary across studies, so a rationale here would be useful.</p><p>Optogenetic block of LEC:</p><p>The advantage of optogenetics in this context is the precise control that the researchers have over when the disruption is applied to the LEC. The authors argue that early neural activity in the first sniff following odor application is essential for the animals’ performance on the task. They could directly test this by only blocking the LEC after this early phase. The prediction would be that on trials with “late” LEC block animals would have much improved performance compared to those that experience complete block. This technique has been used previously in the olfactory system (the “optogenetic masking” technique of Wilson, et al., 2017 is similar) to investigate “primacy coding” in the olfactory bulb and would greatly enhance the impact of the current work.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Rapid odor processing by layer 2 subcircuits in lateral entorhinal cortex” for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Laura Colgin (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors responded to the reviewers’ previous concerns mostly adequately. However, we have one request before accepting this manuscript.</p><p>Some issues such as the impact of fast guesses in performance appear to remain as an issue of further discussion, but the current manuscript provides the data for the readers to evaluate. We still would like to request one change regarding the analysis of sequential activity. As the authors’ new analysis in the rebuttal shows, the way the data is currently presented in the manuscript overestimates the extent of sequential activity. The authors’ new analysis using cross validation (sorting with the odd trials and plotting only the even trials) shows a lesser extent of sequence, with the LEC almost losing the sequential pattern. Although there are still some papers that use the authors’ original method (sorting with all trials and plotting all trials) in the field, this practice must be corrected. Therefore, we request that all of the sequential activity figures be replaced to the cross-validated ones (e.g. sorting by the odd trials, and plotting the even trials). Given the apparent loss of sequence in LEC, it would be useful if the authors provide some quantitative analysis of sequence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75065.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

It is correct that Lee et al., 2021 show that suppressing activity in either fan or pyramidal cells individually did not disrupt performance of learned odor associations. However, Extended Figure 8 of that study also shows that performance of learned odor associations drops to chance during LEC infusion of the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol. Thus, they find that a manipulation that suppresses activity in fan and pyramidal cells simultaneously completely disrupts odor discrimination. This is entirely consistent with our observation using optogenetic silencing and that is why we cited Lee et al., 2021 paper in the original Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We reanalyzed the excluded trials and found no difference in the fraction of trials with licks before the first odor inhalation with the LED on vs. LED off. Thus, our results are inconsistent with the idea that mice make rapid guesses (“ballistic licks”) triggered by the tone cue during LEC silencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Nonetheless, we have added to the Discussion caveats related to the interpretation of behavioral results based on acute optogenetic silencing:</p><p>“While acute optogenetic silencing of LEC disrupted performance in behavioral tasks requiring discrimination of odor identity and intensity, our findings do not necessarily prove that odor discrimination within the LEC is required for behavior. It could be the case that LEC is essential for the retrieval of learned odor-reward associations while discrimination is provided elsewhere (i.e. piriform cortex). Nonetheless, our results are consistent with LEC playing a critical role in odor-driven behavior. An additional caveat to experiments using optogenetic silencing, is that acute perturbations could disrupt behavior by removing “permissive” activity for downstream structures, rather than implicating the target circuit as “instructive” for the behavior (Wolff and Ölveczky, 2018). Future experiments examining the effects of chronic LEC inactivation on odor discrimination will be useful to probe this possibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The more rapid behavioral discrimination of intensity (175 ms) vs. identity (225 ms) is interesting and reasonable re: Resulaj and Rinberg (2015 – i.e. fast, though not necessarily faster concentration discrimination), but not entirely expected from Abraham et al., (2010), Bolding and Franks (2017), or with the authors' own results about the relative timing of identity vs. intensity information in LEC.
