heterozygote. The success of a driver relies on outcrossing (mating between individuals from distinct lineages) because drivers gain their advantage in heterozygotes. It is, therefore, curious that <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, a species reported to rarely outcross, harbors many meiotic drivers. To address this paradox, we measured mating phenotypes in <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates. We found that the propensity for cells from distinct clonal lineages to mate varies between natural isolates and can be affected both by cell density and by the available sexual partners. Additionally, we found that the observed levels of preferential mating between cells from the same clonal lineage can slow, but not prevent, the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> meiotic driver in the absence of additional fitness costs linked to the driver. These analyses reveal parameters critical to understanding the evolution of <italic>S. pombe</italic> and help explain the success of meiotic drivers in this species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The fission yeast, <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, is a haploid organism, meaning it has a single copy of each of its genes. <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells generally carry one copy of each chromosome and can reproduce clonally by duplicating these chromosomes and then dividing into two cells. However, when the yeast are starving, they can reproduce sexually. This involves two cells mating by fusing together to create a ‘diploid zygote’, which contains two copies of each gene. The zygote then undergoes ‘meiosis’, a special type of cell division in which the zygote first duplicates its genome and then divides twice. This results in four haploid spores which are analogous to sperm and eggs in humans that each contain one copy of the genome. The spores will grow and divide normally when conditions improve.</p><p>The genes carried by each of the haploid spores depend on the cells that formed the zygote. If the two ‘parent’ yeast had the same version or ‘allele’ of a gene, all four spores will have it in their genome. However, if the two parents have different alleles, only 50% of the offspring will carry each version. Although this is usually the case, there are certain alleles, called meiotic drivers, that are transmitted to all offspring even in situations where it is only carried by one parent. Meiotic drivers can be found in many organisms, including mammals, but their behavior is easiest to study in yeast.</p><p>Meiotic drivers known as killers achieve this by disposing of any ‘sister’ spores that do not inherit the same allele of this gene. This ‘killing’ can only happen when only one of the ‘parents’ carries the driver. This scenario is thought to rarely occur in species that inbreed, as inbreeding leads to both gene copies being the same. However, this does not appear to be the case for <italic>S. pombe</italic>, which contain a whole family of killer meiotic drivers, the <italic>wtf</italic> genes, despite also being reported to mainly inbreed.</p><p>To investigate this contradiction, López Hernández et al. isolated several genetically distinct populations of <italic>S.pombe</italic>. These isolates were grown together to determine how often the each one would outcross (mate with an individual from a different population) or inbreed. The results found that levels of inbreeding varied between isolates.</p><p>Next, López Hernández et al. used mathematical modelling and experimental evolution analyses to study how <italic>wtf</italic> drivers spread amongst these populations. This revealed that <italic>wtf</italic> genes spread faster in populations with more outcrossing. In some instances, the <italic>wtf</italic> driver was linked to a gene that could harm the population. In these cases, López Hernández et al. found than inbreeding could purge these drivers and stop them from spreading the dangerous alleles through the population.</p><p>López Hernández et al. establish a simple experimental system to model driver evolution and experimentally demonstrate how key parameters, such as outcrossing rates, affect the spread of these genes. Understanding how meiotic drivers spread is important, as these systems could potentially be used to modify populations important to humans, such as crops or disease vectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>meiosis</kwd><kwd>meiotic drive</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>genetic conflict</kwd><kwd>wtf</kwd><kwd>sporulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanders</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2GM132936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanders</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014185</institution-id><institution>Searle Scholars Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zanders</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mating phenotypes are diverse in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> and the natural variation can impact the spread of wtf meiotic drivers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mating behaviors have long been a focus of art, literature, and formal scientific inquiry. This interest stems, in part, from the remarkable importance of mate choice on the evolution of species. Outcrossing and inbreeding represent distinct mating strategies that both have potential evolutionary benefits and costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Glémin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Muller, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Otto and Lenormand, 2002</xref>). For example, outcrossing (mating between individuals from distinct lineages) can be beneficial because it can help purge deleterious alleles from a line of descent, but it can also be costly as it can promote the spread of selfish genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burt and Trivers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crow, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurst and Werren, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McDonald et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zeyl et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Meiotic drivers represent one type of selfish genetic element that relies on outcrossing to persist and spread in a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lindholm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sandler and Novitski, 1957</xref>). These loci can manipulate the process of gametogenesis to bias their own transmission into gametes at the expense of the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burt and Trivers, 2006</xref>). Meiotic drivers are often considered selfish or parasitic genes because they generally offer no fitness benefits to their hosts and are instead often deleterious or linked to deleterious alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Higgins et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klein et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rick, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schimenti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Taylor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wilkinson and Fry, 2001</xref>). As inbreeding is thought to inhibit the spread of selfish genes like drivers, drivers are predicted to be unsuccessful in species that rarely outcross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burt and Trivers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hurst and Werren, 2001</xref>). This assumption appears to be challenged in several fungal species, including the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Grognet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hammond et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Svedberg et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">van der Gaag et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vogan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Generally, <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells grow as haploids and their mating (fusion of two haploids of opposite mating type) generates diploid zygotes that can then undergo meiosis to generate haploid progeny known as spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Mating in <italic>S. pombe</italic> is widely thought to preferentially occur between daughter cells clonally derived from a common progenitor via a recent mitotic division, which we refer to as ‘same-clone mating’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billiard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Perrin, 2011</xref>). The support for this idea is described below. Despite this notion that <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells preferentially undergo same-clone mating (leading to inbreeding), <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates host multiple meiotic drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the wild, a minority of <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains are heterothallic, meaning they have a fixed mating type (<italic>h</italic>+ or <italic>h-</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nieuwenhuis and Immler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schlake and Gutz, 1993</xref>). Heterothallic <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains must mate with non-clonally related cells of the opposite mating type to complete sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leupold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nieuwenhuis and Immler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Osterwalder, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schlake and Gutz, 1993</xref>). However, most isolates of <italic>S. pombe</italic> are homothallic, that is, they can switch between the two mating types (<italic>h</italic>+ and <italic>h-</italic>) during clonal expansion via mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Egel and Eie, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klar, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Singh and Klar, 2003</xref>). Homothallism in <italic>S. pombe</italic> enables mating to occur between cells clonally derived from the same progenitor via mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billiard et al., 2012</xref>). Mating can even occur between two cells produced by a single mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>).</p><p>It is often assumed that homothallic fungi, like <italic>S. pombe</italic>, do not generally mate with non-clonally related cells. It is important to note, however, that homothallism in fungi does not inherently lead to mating between clonally related cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Giraud et al., 2008</xref>). Under some conditions, such as when gametes are dispersed and finding a mate is costly, homothallism can be a beneficial strategy for outcrossing species as it ensures gamete compatibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billiard et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, population genetic analyses of one homothallic fungus, <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic>, support that homothallism is compatible with frequent outcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attanayake et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Very little is known about the ecology of <italic>S. pombe</italic> in the wild, including how often <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells outcross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeffares, 2018</xref>). In the lab, the mating propensities of <italic>S. pombe</italic> have mostly been investigated in derivatives of a strain first isolated from French wine in 1921 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Osterwalder, 1924</xref>). In this work, we will refer to derivatives of this isolate as ‘<italic>Sp</italic>’. Distinct homothallic <italic>Sp</italic> strains can be induced to mate in the lab (i.e., outcrossed), but such crosses are significantly more challenging to execute than crosses between heterothallic isolates. The relative difficulty associated with outcrossing homothallic strains has been attributed to preferential same-clone mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekwall and Thon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forsburg and Rhind, 2006</xref>). Microscopy experiments have supported the idea that homothallic <italic>Sp</italic> haploids tend to undergo same-clone mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendezú and Martin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Leupold, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>). However, the precise level of same-clone mating when homothallic <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells are among nonclonal sexual partners has not, to our knowledge, been formally reported for any isolate.</p><p>Population genetic analyses have provided additional support for the notion that <italic>S. pombe</italic> inbreeds. There are two major <italic>S. pombe</italic> lineages that diverged between 2300 and 78,000 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>). Much of the sampled variation within the species represents different admixed hybrids of those two ancestral lineages resulting from an estimated 20–60 outcrossing events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>). This low outcrossing rate could result from limited opportunities to outcross, preferential same-clone mating, or a combination of the two. It is important to note, however, that the outcrossing rate estimates in <italic>S. pombe</italic> are likely low as pervasive meiotic drive and decreased recombination in heterozygotes suppress the genetic signatures that are used to infer outcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Accounting for all these factors to generate a more accurate <italic>S. pombe</italic> outcrossing rate from population genetic data is currently an insurmountable obstacle for several reasons. First, the landscape of meiotic drivers and their suppressors is complex in that more than four drivers and more than eight suppressors of drive could be present in a given heterozygote produced by outcrossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020a</xref>). Predicting how those factors will affect allele transmission is well beyond the capabilities of current population genetic models, even if the epistatic relationships within the drive systems were understood, which they currently are not. In addition to the drivers, <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates contain an array of chromosomal rearrangements and other unknown barriers to recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeffares et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, recombination rates are also inextricably linked to the complex drive landscape because the presence of drivers also affects the recombination rate within viable offspring, independent of chromosomal rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>Given those limitations, the current laboratory knowledge and outcrossing rate estimates suggest that drivers would infrequently have the opportunity to act in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Egel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ekwall and Thon, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Forsburg and Rhind, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gutz and Doe, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, the notion that <italic>S. pombe</italic> infrequently outcrosses has even been used to challenge the idea that <italic>S. pombe</italic> meiotic drivers are truly selfish genes that persist due to meiotic drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sweigart et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome houses numerous meiotic drive genes from the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>wtf</italic> drivers destroy the meiotic products (spores) that do not inherit the driver from a heterozygote.

Despite limited genetic diversity among isolates, we observed natural variation in inbreeding propensity and other mating phenotypes. Some natural isolates preferentially undergo same-clone mating in the presence of a potential outcrossing partner, whereas others mate more randomly. Additionally, we found that the level of same-clone mating can be altered by cell density and affected by the available sexual partners. This is important as it highlights that our measured values in the lab are not meant to indicate precise levels of outcrossing that would occur under unknown natural conditions.</p><p>To explore the effects that varying mating phenotypes could have on the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver in a population, we used both mathematical modeling and an experimental evolution approach. We found that, while the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver could be slowed by the observed levels of same-clone mating, the driver could still spread in the absence of linked deleterious traits. We incorporated our observations into a model in which rapid <italic>wtf</italic> gene evolution and occasional outcrossing facilitate the maintenance of <italic>wtf</italic> drivers.

We inferred the genotypes (homozygous or heterozygous) of each zygote and ascus (spore sac) based on their fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Homozygotes were produced by mating of two cells carrying the same fluorophore, while heterozygotes were produced by mating between a GFP-labeled and an mCherry-labeled cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

We then manually genotyped the progeny and used the fraction of recombinant progeny to calculate inbreeding coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We chose these isolates because they each contain different fractions of the two inferred ancestral <italic>S. pombe</italic> lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the strains we chose are homothallic, sporulated well, were non-clumping, and we were able to transform them with the GFP and mCherry markers described above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the measured inbreeding coefficients varied significantly between the different natural isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The phenotype of FY29043 was similar to <italic>Sp</italic>, but other <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates, including <italic>Sk</italic>, mated more randomly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Because crowding prevented us from assaying high-density cells using our microscopy approach, we used the genetic assay for each condition.

This is likely because cells plated at low density tended to be physically distant from potential sexual partners that were not part of the same clonally growing patch of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, a control population consisting of mixed heterothallic <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<italic>h</italic>+ and <italic>h-</italic> cells of two different genotypes mixed in equal proportions) that cannot mate within a clonal patch of cells showed near random mating between the two genotypes at all cell densities assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

This would promote cells mating outside their clonal lineage. One can see evidence consistent with this phenomenon in our experiments varying the cell density of homothallic <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>). Specifically, we observed more random mating when cells were at higher density, which likely results from more opportunity for cells to mate outside their clonal lineage. We aspired to directly compare mating type switching rates between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> cells, although such direct assays have not, to our knowledge, been done in any strain background.

As in the classic study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>, we used the first mating event as an imperfect proxy for when cells were capable of mating (i.e., they had a partner of the opposite mating type). For these assays, we tracked the fate of individual homothallic founder cells plated on SPA at low density (0.25× to our standard mating density used above) to quantify how many mitotic generations occurred prior to the first mating event. When the first mating event occurred, we recorded the proportion of the cells present that mated (prior to the appearance of cells from next mitotic generation). We also recorded the relationships between the cells that did mate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Specifically, we scored whether the mated cells were the product of a single mitotic division. Historically, these have been called ‘sister cells’ in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> mating literature, although we use the term ‘sibling cells’ to be gender neutral (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>). We did not consider cells that were born in mitotic generations past the one in which mating first occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). For example, if cells within a given lineage first mated at generation 3, we scored the relationships between those mated cells and recorded how many unmated cells remained at the end of generation 3 (even if descendants of the unmated cells eventually mated). We then did not consider that lineage any further, so lineages in which cells first mated at generation 2 are not represented in the generation 3 data.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Variation between mating behaviors in <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic showing cell divisions, switching, and mate choice in <italic>Sp</italic>.

A newly switched cell will be compatible to mate with close relatives, most typically its sibling cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>). Under the same switching model, a smaller portion of cells derived from a single division could be of opposite mating types and thus sexually compatible. For example, if one considers switchable cells (e.g., Ps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), they must divide only once to generate a pair of mating-competent cells. In <italic>Sp</italic> cells, we observed mating among the clonal descendants of some progenitor cells after a single mitotic division (i.e.<italic>,</italic> at generation 2). By the third generation, we observed mating among the descendants of more than half of the progenitor cells. Almost all the observed mating events were between sibling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). These observations are consistent with published work assaying mating patterns within lineages of clonal <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bendezú and Martin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Klar, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>).</p><p><italic>Sk</italic> cells plated at 0.25× density on SPA divided significantly more than <italic>Sp</italic> cells prior to the first mating (Wilcox rank sum test; p &lt; 0.005 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). <italic>Sk</italic> progenitor cells most frequently started mating at the fourth mitotic generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This phenotype is consistent with less mating-type switching as more generations would be required on average to produce a cell with the opposite mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>). In addition, many mating events were between non-sibling cells. This phenotype can also be explained indirectly by reduced mating-type switching. Specifically, after cells undergo several divisions, they generate non-linear cell clusters in which comparably more non-sibling cells are in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). This clustering could lead to more non-sibling mating than when cells are mating-competent after fewer divisions and the low number of cells are largely arranged linearly.</p><p>To better understand the differences between <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic>, we compared the sequence of the mating-type locus in the two isolates as many distinct alleles have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with previous work, we found that the mating-type regions of <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> are highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>). However, using a previously published mate-pair sequencing dataset, we discovered an ~5 kb insertion of nested <italic>Tf</italic> transposon sequences in the <italic>Sk</italic> mating-type region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>). We confirmed the presence of the insertion using PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). We also found evidence consistent with the same insertion in FY28981, which also mates more randomly than <italic>Sp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We did not, however, formally test if the insertion affects mating phenotypes. Even if it does have an effect, it is insufficient to explain all the mating variation we observed as FY29044 mates randomly, yet it lacks the insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To further explore the hypothesis that decreased mating-type switching efficiency in <italic>Sk</italic> could contribute to the mating differences we observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we carried out time-lapse analyses of cells, at our standard 1× cell mating density. We reasoned that at this density, any given cell is likely to have a cell of opposite mating type nearby, even if mating-type switching is infrequent. We again used mixed populations of GFP- and mCherry-expressing cells to facilitate the scoring of mating patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref> supplement 1). We found that the <italic>Sp</italic> cells predominantly mated in the second and third mitotic generations and most mating events were between sibling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>The mating behavior of <italic>Sk</italic> cells changed more dramatically between 0.25× density and the higher 1× density. Whereas <italic>Sk</italic> cells tended to first mate in the fourth generation at 0.25× density, at 1× density <italic>Sk</italic> cells, like <italic>Sp</italic>, generally mated in the second and third mitotic generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref> supplement 2). Additionally, we observed significantly reduced levels of mating between <italic>Sk</italic> sibling cells at 1× density relative to 0.25× (10% and 56%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and B</xref>). These phenotypes are consistent with reduced mating-type switching in <italic>Sk</italic>. Specifically, our data suggest that <italic>Sk</italic> cells do not need to undergo more divisions before they are competent to mate. Rather, the additional divisions that occurred at 0.25× density in <italic>Sk</italic> could have been necessary to produce a pair of cells with opposite mating types. At 1× density, additional divisions are not expected to be required as additional non-sibling compatible partners are available.</p><p>It is important to note, however, that our experiments combined with the previous work showing fewer switching-initiating DSBs in <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>), support, but do not conclusively demonstrate that mating-type switching occurs less frequently in <italic>Sk</italic>. In particular, our assays to understand switching frequencies use mating as a proxy for switching, which is not ideal. Therefore, reduced switching in <italic>Sk</italic> represents a promising model that remains to be tested. Still, our results conclusively demonstrate the key point that the mating phenotypes previously measured in <italic>Sp</italic> do not apply to all <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates. Despite very little genetic diversity, <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates maintain significant natural variation in key mating phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jeffares et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ascus variation</title><p>While assaying inbreeding cytologically, we noticed that the <italic>Sk</italic> natural isolate displayed tremendous diversity in ascus size and shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video2">Figure 2—video 2</xref>). This was due to high variability in the size of the mating projections, known as shmoos. <italic>Sk</italic> produced long shmoos only in response to cells of the opposite mating type and not as a response to nitrogen starvation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The long <italic>Sk</italic> shmoos motivated us to quantify asci length across all the natural isolates described above. We found that most isolates generated zygotes or asci that were ~10–15 μm, similar to <italic>Sp</italic>. The majority of <italic>Sk</italic> zygotes and asci also fell within this range, but ~25% of <italic>Sk</italic> zygotes and asci were longer than 15 μm, with some exceeding 30 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). We also assayed zygote/ascus length in an additional natural isolate in which we were unable to quantify inbreeding due to a clumping phenotype (FY29033). This isolate also showed populations of long asci, like <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we occasionally noticed a fused asci phenotype in <italic>Sk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Time-lapse analyses of mating patterns, described above, revealed these fused asci can result from an occasional disconnect between mitotic cycles and the physical separation of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>). This phenotype is reminiscent of <italic>adg1, adg2, adg3</italic>, and <italic>agn1</italic> mutants in <italic>Sp</italic> that have defects in cell fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso-Nuñez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould and Simanis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sipiczki, 2007</xref>). Although we observed this phenotype in all time-lapse experiments using <italic>Sk</italic> cells, the prevalence of this phenotype varied greatly between experiments. We rarely observed this phenotype in <italic>Sp</italic> cells. We did not analyze time-lapse images of the other natural isolates, where this phenotype is most easily observed, so it is unclear if this septation phenotype occurs in other natural isolates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mating phenotypes are affected by available mating partners</title><p>We next assayed if the mating preferences of <italic>S. pombe</italic> isolates <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> were invariable, or if they could be affected by the available mating partners due to mating incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seike et al., 2019b</xref>). To test this idea, we used both still and time-lapse imaging of cells mated at 1× density on SPA. For these experiments, we mixed fluorescently labeled <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> cells in equal frequencies.</p><p>We observed in experiments employing still images that the overall inbreeding coefficient of the mixed <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> population of cells was intermediate between single-isolate crosses and mixed crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In time-lapse experiments, we observed that <italic>Sk</italic> cells maintained low levels of mating between sibling cells in the mixed <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> population (9.2% compared to 9.8% in a homogeneous population; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Among the <italic>Sp</italic> cells, mating between sibling cells decreased significantly from 56.8% to 29.7% in the mixed mating environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; t-test, p = 0.04). Together, these results suggest that <italic>Sk</italic> cells can interfere with the ability of <italic>Sp</italic> cells to undergo same-clone mating. Although sibling cell mating preference changed, we did not observe a significant decrease in the mating efficiency of <italic>Sp</italic> cells in a mixed <italic>Sp</italic>/<italic>Sk</italic> population relative to a pure <italic>Sp</italic> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Instead, the mating efficiency in the mixed <italic>Sp</italic>/<italic>Sk</italic> population was intermediate of those observed in pure <italic>Sp</italic> and <italic>Sk</italic> populations, indicating these isolates do not affect each other’s ability to mate.</p><p>We were intrigued by the idea that long shmoos (mating projections) of <italic>Sk</italic> could contribute to its ability to disrupt <italic>Sp</italic> sibling mating. We were unable to address this idea directly. We did, however, find that <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> matings produce significantly longer zygotes/asci than either <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sk</italic> or <italic>Sp</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> matings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This was true even when we compared <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> zygote/ascus length to the length of heterozygous <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sk</italic> or heterozygous <italic>Sp</italic>/<italic>Sp</italic> zygotes/asci. While this result does not prove that long <italic>Sk</italic> shmoos disrupt <italic>Sp</italic> sibling mating, it does show that long shmoos tend to be used in these outcrossing events.</p><p>We next extended our analyses by assaying mating efficiency and inbreeding coefficients in all pairwise combinations of <italic>Sp</italic>, <italic>Sk</italic>, FY29043, and FY29044 using still images of mated cells. After adjusting for mating efficiencies and parental inbreeding coefficients (see Materials and methods), the phenotypes we observed in these crosses were mostly additive, in that they were intermediate to the pure parental strain phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The two exceptions were in the crosses between <italic>Sk</italic> and the isolates FY20943 and FY20944. <italic>Sk</italic> formed more <italic>Sk</italic>/<italic>Sk</italic> homozygotes than expected in the two crosses (one-tailed t-test, p = 0.043 and p = 0.038, respectively), suggesting that <italic>Sk</italic> cells may not be fully sexually compatible with FY20943 and FY20944 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, the magnitude of the effect was small in both cases and the statistical significance is lost after Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Overall, our observations indicate that mating phenotypes of a given isolate can be affected by different mating partners. Importantly, however, our results suggest mating incompatibilities are unlikely to have a major role in limiting outcrossing within <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Population genetics modeling of the effect of inbreeding on a <italic>wtf</italic> meiotic driver</title><p>We next wanted to test how the observed range of inbreeding coefficients would affect the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver in a population. To do this, we first used population genetic modeling. We used the meiotic drive model presented by J Crow, but we also introduced an inbreeding coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartl and Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crow, 1991</xref>) (see Materials and methods for a full description of the model). The model considers a population with two possible alleles at the queried locus and no genetic drift. We assumed a <italic>wtf</italic> driver would exhibit 98% drive (transmission to 98% of spores) in heterozygotes based on measured values for the <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>). We assumed that all genotypes have the same fitness during haploid cell growth. For diploid cells induced to produce spores, we assumed homozygotes have a fitness of 1 (e.g., maximal fitness), whereas <italic>wtf</italic> driver heterozygotes have a fitness of 0.51, since meiotic drive destroys nearly half of the spores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>). The inbreeding coefficient dictates the frequency of heterozygotes and thus the frequency at which the <italic>wtf</italic> driver can act. We varied the inbreeding coefficient (<italic>F</italic>) from 1 (all matings generate homozygotes) to –1 (all matings generate heterozygotes).</p><p>We used the model to calculate the predicted change in the frequency of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver after only one sexual generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also calculated the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver in a population from a 5% starting frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and from lower starting frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) over generations of sexual reproduction. If we used an inbreeding coefficient of 1, the frequency of the driver does not increase after sexual reproduction or spread in a population over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). No change in driver frequency was expected because no heterozygotes are produced under this condition, so no drive can occur. The <italic>wtf</italic> driver has the greatest advantage if the inbreeding coefficient is –1, as all matings generate heterozygotes. Under all other conditions, including the range of inbreeding coefficients we measured experimentally in <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates, some heterozygotes form. The <italic>wtf</italic> driver thus increases in frequency over generations of sexual reproduction, even when the driver starts at very low (anything greater than 0) frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crow, 1991</xref>). This model predicts that <italic>wtf</italic> drivers can spread under the modeled conditions if some non-same-clone mating occurs, even if it is infrequent.

We randomly selected surviving ‘haploids’ to populate the next generation to keep the population size fixed. We assumed that all genotypes have equal fitness during haploid cell growth. For mathematical simplicity, we assumed complete drive and a corresponding fitness of 0.5 in heterozygous diploids. We again assumed that both types of homozygous diploids had a fitness of 1. We also varied the inbreeding coefficient from 0 (random mating) to 1 (all matings generate homozygotes). Surprisingly, we found that the probability of a driver’s success was related to population size, similar to the recent results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martinossi-Allibert et al., 2021</xref>. Specifically, the driver was most likely to be maintained in the smaller populations and in populations with more random mating due to the driver’s positive effect on its own allele transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In larger populations in which the drivers started at a lower initial frequency, the drive allele generally took a long time to increase its frequency compared to the alternate allele, or it was lost due to drift.

This was likely because insertion of the markers disrupted the <italic>ura4</italic> gene and cells that excised the marker reverted the <italic>ura4</italic> mutation and thereby gained a fitness benefit. We therefore only considered fluorescent cells for our analyses and stopped the experiments when more than 95% cells lacked a fluorescent marker.

For both types of controls, we analyzed homothallic (inbreeding coefficient ~0.5) and mixed heterothallic (inbreeding coefficient ~0) cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We found in most cases that the number of mCherry-expressing cells increased at the expense of GFP-expressing cells over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). The notable exception was in heterothallic populations containing <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> linked to both fluorophore alleles, where we did not observe a different cost of the GFP allele compared to mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

To do this, we used the first six generations of data from our control crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) to fit a maximum likelihood model in which all parameters were fixed except the fitness values of GFP/mCherry heterozygotes and GFP/GFP homozygotes. We found that the fitness cost of the GFP in homozygotes was 0.234 (see Materials and methods). We found the dominance of the GFP cost was 0.083 (low fitness cost of GFP in GFP/mCherry heterozygotes). We then used these costs, calculated from our controls without meiotic drive, to calculate expected values in our experimental analyses in which drive can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>).</p><p>For our experiments competing <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> with an empty vector allele, we first assayed populations in which the alleles both started at 50% frequency. In homothallic (inbreeding coefficient ~0.5) populations, we observed that <italic>wtf4</italic> alleles spread in the population over several generations of sexual reproduction. The driver spread faster when linked to mCherry than when linked to GFP, presumably due to the aforementioned fitness costs linked to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). In both cases, the rate of spread of the allele was very close to our model’s predictions if we assumed an inbreeding coefficient of 0.5 (black lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>) and differed considerably from the model’s predictions assuming random mating (inbreeding coefficient = 0; gray lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).</p><p>We saw similar spread of <italic>wtf4</italic> in homothallic populations in a set of repeat experiments in which we sorted the cell populations twice to remove non-fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). In these experiments, we also assayed mixed heterothallic populations with an equal mix of GFP- and mCherry-marked cells from both mating types. As described above, these mixed heterothallic populations show random mating (inbreeding coefficient ~0) between GFP- and mCherry-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In the mixed heterothallic populations, the <italic>wtf4</italic> driver spread significantly faster than in homothallic cells. In generations 1–6, the spread of <italic>wtf4</italic> was very similar to that predicted by our model if we assumed random mating (inbreeding coefficient = 0). In later generations, our observations did not fit the model well. We suspect extensive loss of fluorescent cells, especially those with mCherry, and the resulting decrease in population size could contribute to this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We compared our data to a model in which driver heterozygotes have a fitness of 0.51, but we also considered variants of the model in which heterozygotes have fitness greater than 0.5, as can occur with spore killers in <italic>Podospora anserina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Vogan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martinossi-Allibert et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, an increase in driver heterozygote fitness could occur if the driving alleles benefit from drive beyond the benefits gained directly by killing spores bearing the alternate allele. For example, the surviving meiotic products could theoretically gain fitness during spore development by scavenging increased resources from the killed meiotic products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nauta and Hoekstra, 1993</xref>). We found that increasing heterozygote fitness beyond 0.51 decreased the fit of our data to the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting <italic>wtf</italic> drivers do not gain additional benefits beyond killing spores bearing the alternate allele.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate that our population genetics model with driver heterozygote fitness at 0.51 is good at describing the spread of <italic>wtf4</italic> in our experimental population, particularly in the first few generations.

While the linkage of individual drivers to deleterious alleles in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has not been extensively investigated, driving alleles in the <italic>Sk</italic> isolate are linked to a chromosomal translocation that decreases fitness in heterozygotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>). Similar chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 3, which houses most <italic>wtf</italic> genes, are common in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, so it is likely drivers are frequently linked to rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avelar et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore used the population genetic model to calculate the ability of a driver to spread when tightly linked to alleles with fitness costs ranging from 0 to 0.8.

As described above, this spread is slowed by inbreeding, but is not stopped until inbreeding coefficients reach 1 (no heterozygotes are produced). When the driver is burdened by additional fitness costs, it can still spread in a population. Importantly, however, as the fitness costs of linked deleterious alleles increase, the driver must start at a higher initial frequency to spread. If the fitness costs are recessive or close to recessive (dominance coefficient <italic>h</italic> near 0), a driver can invade at low frequencies in a randomly mating population, but a driver would require a higher initial frequency to spread in an inbreeding population (inbreeding coefficients &gt; 0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We sought to explore mating phenotypes in <italic>S. pombe</italic> to better understand the evolution of the <italic>wtf</italic> gene family found in this species. Although genetic variation within <italic>S. pombe</italic> is limited, past studies found variation in mating efficiency and uncovered genetic diversity of the mating-type locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rhind et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>). In this work, we assayed mating in an array of homothallic <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates under a variety of laboratory conditions. Similar to previous work, we found <italic>Sp</italic> mating efficiency close to 40% and observed variable mating efficiencies for natural isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merlini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seike et al., 2019a</xref>). In addition, we quantified the propensity of natural isolates to undergo same-clone mating when given the opportunity to mate with non-clonally related cells. We found this trait, as measured using an inbreeding coefficient, was variable between natural isolates and could be affected by cell density or available sexual partners.</p><p>All of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> natural isolates we studied are homothallic and thus capable of same-clone mating. Despite this, we found that all isolates underwent some non-same-clone mating. In addition, some isolates, like <italic>Sk</italic>, showed considerable non-same-clone mating (inbreeding coefficient near 0) under standard mating conditions. This provides additional data supporting homothallism is compatible with outcrossing between non-clonally related isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attanayake et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, <italic>S. pombe</italic> asci undergo a programmed degeneration process (endolysis) shortly after spore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Encinar del Dedo et al., 2009</xref>). This presumably frees spores to potentially distribute (in wind, water, or associated with animals) separate from the other spores produced in the same meiosis. The physical independence of <italic>S. pombe</italic> spores could also facilitate outcrossing in this homothallic fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Billiard et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We did not definitively identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the variation in mating phenotypes we observed. Our data is, however, consistent with a model in which less frequent mating-type switching in the <italic>Sk</italic> isolate contributes to more random mating in <italic>Sk</italic> than in the common lab isolate, <italic>Sp</italic>. Specifically, if switching is less frequent in <italic>Sk</italic>, sibling cells are less likely to be compatible to mate. Incompatibility of sibling cells opens the possibility for mating with other, perhaps non-clonally derived, cells in the population. Singh and Klar were the first to propose that <italic>Sk</italic> switched less frequently than <italic>Sp</italic> when they noticed less of the DNA break that initiates switching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Singh and Klar, 2002</xref>). We discovered a large, nested insertion of transposon sequences in the mating-type locus of <italic>Sk,</italic> and we posit that this insertion could contribute to reduced DNA break formation and, potentially, decreased mating-type switching. It is important to note, however, that not all strains that mate randomly share this transposon insertion. We also stress that, as in previous work (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miyata and Miyata, 1981</xref>), we did not directly assay switching rates and instead used mating events to infer information about switching. The long shmoos we observed in <italic>Sk</italic> may also contribute to more random mating in this isolate, as the long shmoo may increase the available number of partners within range.</p><p>Additional previously described natural variation that we did not functionally explore may also contribute to differences in inbreeding propensity in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. For example, heterothallic natural isolates are predicted to exclusively undergo non-same-clone mating with cells of the opposite mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, homothallic isolates with atypical mating-type loci with extra copies of the <italic>mat</italic> cassettes could grow into populations that are biased toward one mating type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nieuwenhuis and Immler, 2016</xref>). Indeed, we analyzed the presumably expressed mating-type locus (<italic>mat1</italic>) in several isolates for which we had nanopore sequencing data and found an approximate 3:1 excess of the <italic>h</italic>+ allele in FY29033 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The excess of one mating type is predicted to also facilitate non-same-clone mating.</p><p>It is important to note that our study does not address the actual frequency of outcrossing in <italic>S. pombe</italic> populations in the wild. Very little is known about the ecology of fission yeast, including how frequently genetically distinct isolates are found in close enough proximity to mate (e.g., closer than ~40 µm apart) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeffares, 2018</xref>). Outcrossing rates have been estimated using genomic data, but those estimates generally assume both that heterozygous recombination rates will match those observed in pure <italic>Sp</italic> and that allele transmission is Mendelian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farlow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tusso et al., 2019</xref>). Although these genomic estimates are reasonable, neither of these assumptions is consistent with empirical analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zanders et al., 2014</xref>).

Still, we do not consider this a fixed driver because the sequence of <italic>wtf4</italic> is different in each strain, which, in all cases tested, leads to a distinct drive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>).

The rapid evolution of <italic>wtf</italic> genes is driven largely by non-allelic gene conversion within the family and expansion or contraction of repetitive sequences within the coding sequences of the genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eickbush et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Because <italic>wtf</italic> genes generally provide no protection against <italic>wtf</italic> drivers with distinct sequences, the variation in <italic>wtf</italic> gene sequences has profound consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>). Even small sequence changes in <italic>wtf</italic> drivers can cause the birth and death of drivers. When a cell bearing a novel <italic>wtf</italic> driver mutation mates with a cell without the mutation, the driver is heterozygous, and thus, drive can occur and the novel allele can potentially spread through the otherwise largely homogeneous population. Given fission yeast cells have no inherent mobility, the novel drive alleles could arise within small isolated subpopulations (demes) in which drivers have an increased possibility of establishing, as was formally described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Martinossi-Allibert et al., 2021</xref>.</p><p>Previous work assayed the strength of drive and the associated fitness reduction due to heterozygous <italic>wtf</italic> drivers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bravo Núñez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bravo Núñez et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nuckolls et al., 2017</xref>). Those data, along with the inbreeding coefficients measured in this study, allowed us to mathematically model the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> meiotic driver in an <italic>S. pombe</italic> population. Our modeling showed that the inbreeding coefficients we observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> could slow the spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver. In the absence of drift, however, even the highest inbreeding coefficients we observed in <italic>S. pombe</italic> do not halt the spread of a driver, except in cases where the driver is found in low frequencies and linked to a deleterious allele. Given the tractability of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we were also able to test the predictions of the model experimentally. Overall, our experimental results were quite similar to the model’s predictions discussed above. This suggests that our model encompasses all critical parameters. In addition, our experiments show how the <italic>wtf</italic> drivers can persist and spread in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, even if outcrossing is infrequent. The variation of mating phenotypes also indicates that the rate of spread of a <italic>wtf</italic> driver is expected to vary between different populations of <italic>S. pombe</italic>.</p><p>Overall, our results are consistent with previous empirical and modeling studies of meiotic driver dynamics in populations.

We assumed no fitness differences between genotypes during haploid cell growth, complete drive (<italic>k</italic> = 1), gamete killing proportional to drive in heterozygotes, no linked deleterious alleles, and non-overlapping generations. We used characters of ‘0’ for non-driving cells and ‘1’ for driving cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Initially the population starts with population size (<italic>N</italic>). We next sampled a fixed population size (<italic>n</italic>) with replacement, assuming infinite gamete supply used for mating (e.g., as if mitotic expansion of the population occurred prior to mating). In our simulations <italic>N</italic> = <italic>n</italic>. We sampled mating groups without replacement for an inbreeding population (<italic>S<sub>pop</sub></italic>) with a fraction <italic>F</italic> and the rest of cells (n − <italic>S<sub>pop</sub></italic>) mate randomly. Populations that mate randomly are proportional to Hardy-Weinberg genotype frequencies with approximated integer values. Homozygotes (‘0,0’ and ‘1,1’) produce four progeny (‘0,0,0,0’ and ‘1,1,1,1’, respectively), while heterozygotes produce two progeny that inherit the drive allele (‘1,1’). When a fitness cost is associated with a genotype, we decimated the gametic products in proportion to the cost. The collection of 0’s and 1’s after this process constituted the next generation. We repeated 1000 generations for 1000 iterations for each tested condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Measuring allele frequencies for experimental evolution analyses</title><p>We performed the crosses and collected spores as described above. We then started the next generation by culturing 60 µL of spores from each cross in each of three different wells with 600 µL fresh YEL media in 96 deep-well-round-bottom plates (Axygen) and cultured for 24 hr at 1200 rpm at 32°C. We then transferred 60 µL from each culture to a new plate with 600 µL YEL and cultured for 12–14 hr at 1200 rpm at 32°C. We then pooled the culture replicates in an Eppendorf tube, spun down, and resuspended them in an equal volume of ddH<sub>2</sub>O. We then took 100 µL of this sample to assay via cytometry (described below). We also plated 200 µL of each sample on SPAS plates and incubated at 25°C for 5 days to allow the cells to mate and sporulate.</p><p>To detect and quantify fluorescent cells via flow cytometry, we used the ZE5 Cell Analyzer (Bio-Rad). We spun down 100 µL of each culture, washed the cell pellet with water, spun down again, and resuspended the cells in 200 µL of 1× PBS (phosphate buffered saline) with 1.5 μL 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma-Aldrich, 100 ng/mL). DAPI stains dead cells, so we considered DAPI-negative cells as live cells. To image DAPI, we used 355 nm laser excitation and a 447/60 nm detector. To image GFP, we excited using a 488 nm laser and detected emission with a 525/35 nm filter. To image mCherry, we excited using a 561 nm laser and detected emission with a 615/24 nm filter. We used 405 and 488 nm (FSC 405 and FSC 488) lasers for forward scatter and 488 nm laser for side scatter (SSC 488).</p><p>To quantify the frequency of GFP- or mCherry-positive cells, we analyzed the Flow Cytometry Standard files in R/Bioconductor using the packages FlowTrans and FlowClust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lo et al., 2009</xref>). We first separated the cells that had round and uniform shape and similar granularity. This step allowed us to detect a more uniform population of single cells. We then discarded DAPI-positive cells. To determine the GFP- and mCherry-positive cells, we used limits for each channel. The limits varied throughout the experiment due to reconfiguration in the flow cytometer. For every measurement, we corrected with standard samples of cells that only expressed either GFP or mCherry. Fluorescent GFP- and mCherry-positive cells always showed non-overlapping cell populations. We quantified cells that were not classified as non-fluorescent cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Fluorescent marker loss in experimental evolution</title><p>In the experimental evolution experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), a large proportion of cells lost their fluorescent marker over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>). We assume this is because we introduced the markers using an integrating plasmid that enters the genome following a single crossover event. Because of this, a single crossover can then pop the marker and the associated vector out of the genome. We repeatedly observed that the loss occurred faster with the mCherry markers. Consistent with this model, cells that lost fluorescence generally also lost the associated drug resistance marker present on the integrating vector.</p><p>We only considered fluorescent cells in our analyses. In the experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), we extended the evolution up to 10 generations. In other experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>), we removed non-fluorescent cells by cell sorting after generations 2 and 5. To sort cells, we first collected and cultured spores as described above with the first culture done for 12 hr. We then transferred 60 µL of germinated cells into 600 µL fresh YEL media. We used three cultures for each experimental line and pooled all in equal amounts to have 1.4 mL of each line. We spun each sample down and resuspended the cells in 5 mL ddH<sub>2</sub>O prior to sorting. We removed non-fluorescent cells and retained GFP-positive (488 nm laser for excitation and a filter 507 nm) and mCherry-positive (561 nm laser for excitation and a 582 nm filter) cells using the laser the BD FACSMelody cell sorter software. We collected 1.2 million cells for each line into 1× PBS. We then spun down the cells and resuspended the pellets in 200 µL YEL. We then took 60 µL from each sample and diluted the cells into 600 µL YEL and continued with the time course as described above. This restored fluorescently labeled cells populations as expected for homothallic and heterothallic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cell sorting did not affect our results as we observed the same patterns in replicate experiments in which we did not remove the non-fluorescent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Software flow cytometry data analysis and modeling scripts</title><p>Analysis performed to filter, measure, and compare flow cytometry with simulations are located in the Zanders Lab Github repository, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Zanders-Lab/Diverse_mating_phenotypes_impact_the_spread_of_wtf_meiotic_drivers_in_S.-pombe">https://github.com/Zanders-Lab/Diverse_mating_phenotypes_impact_the_spread_of_wtf_meiotic_drivers_in_S.-pombe</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zanders, 2021</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1625">http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpb-1625</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Inventor on patent application 834 serial 62/491,107 based on wtf killers</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Yeast strains used in this study.</title><p>Strains used and created in this study are listed.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70812-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Plasmids used in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70812-supp2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Oligo table.</title><p>Oligos used in this study.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70812-supp3-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70812-transrepform1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Original data underlying this manuscript can be accessed from the Stowers Original Data Repository at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpbxxxx">http://www.stowers.org/research/publications/libpbxxxx</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tatiana Giraud as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bart Nieuwenhuis (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As detailed in the reviews below, the major essential revisions are the following ones, requiring further modeling and experiments :</p><p>1) The introduction and discussion should be extensively revised to better use and define terms such as selfing, inbreeding and outcrossing and better place the study in its evolutionary context</p><p>2) Population genetic modeling should be used to make more ambitious predictions about the natural history of meiotic drive in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and other organisms.</p><p>3) The claim that mating-type switching frequencies affects outcrossing is not substantiated and the model cannot explain how drive overcomes drift after the rise of a novel allele. This should be formally modeled in a structural environment and/or tested experimentally</p><p>4) The inferences of the relative fitness cost of GFP should be toned down.</p><p>The referees also provide a list of excellent additional suggestions, which should be addressed as well if you choose to resubmit the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The whole introduction is based on the rationale that homothallism means selfing while heterothallism means outcrossing. There are several issues with such assumptions. First selfing and outcrossing will be understood by most readers of e<italic>Life</italic> as “diploid selfing/outcrossing”, as in plants and animals, while heterothallism does not prevent diploid selfing, and actually many heterothallic fungi undergo mostly diploid selfing (e.g. Microbotryum violacem, Neurospora tetrasperma, Podospora anserina). Conversely, homothallism does not prevent outcrossing and may not even have evolved to facilitated inbreeding but instead the opposite, universal compatibility under outcrossing. See below some references discussing these issues and some references showing that homothallic fungi do outcross and that many heterothallic fungi do self a lot. I would therefore not consider particularly surprising that <italic>S. pombe</italic> outcross enough for meiotic drivers to spread, although this indeed goes against the current view, based on the misconceptions above. The only good way to estimate outcrossing rates is by using population genetics or genomics on natural populations, as experiments will likely fail to mimic natural dispersal or conditions of mating. This is briefly discussed in the discussion but the whole introduction is misleading in my opinion. I understand this is a quite frequent view among scientists working on fungi (as they infer rates based on what they observe in Petri dishes and were often not evolutionary biologists), but the authors precisely miss the opportunity to state that this view is likely incorrect and to explain why, as this is precisely what they show. I did not understand why outcrossing in natural populations in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has not been estimated or at least discussed based on the genomic data in Jeffares et al. 2015. I think that framing the study into this evolutionary context will only make it stronger. I would also recommend to highlight much more the variation in the propensity of inbreeding among natural isolates and the existence of heterothallic strains. Is it frequently the case in nature?</p><p>doi: 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02495.x.</p><p>10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00153.x.</p><p>10.1128/EC.00440-07</p><p>10.1038/hdy.2014.37</p><p>10.1111/nph.17039</p><p>The “selfing” in the manuscript would be better be named as “same-clone mating”, whose evolutionary consequences are drastically different from more classical diploid selfing (10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02495.x).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As it stands, the population genetic modeling (Main Text lines 315-339, Methods lines 727-773, Figures3,5A) is used mainly to generate frequency trajectories of meiotic drivers against which the trajectories observed in the evolution experiments (Figures4,5B) can be compared. Of course, the similarity of the predicted and experimentally observed trajectories is exciting – I suspect that, based on results like these, pombe will soon become (if it is not already) the premier experimental system for meiotic drive. Still, it seems a missed opportunity, given the variation in mating behavior across strains that the authors have so carefully documented, not to use the population genetic modeling to link this variation with (perhaps even immediately testable) predictions about the natural history of drive in pombe. Below, I suggest some directions in which this might be achieved.</p><p>– The authors focus on the effect of inbreeding on the spread of a driver that starts at an appreciable frequency in the population (e.g., 5%, as in Figure 3B). They find that, while inbreeding slows down the spread of a driver from such frequencies, it does not prevent the driver's eventual spread to fixation. Based on this result, a reader might naively infer that inbreeding affects only the transient dynamics of meiotic drive, not whether a driver spreads to fixation or not; and therefore that strains with different levels of inbreeding will not necessarily have different numbers of fixed drivers.</p><p>However, a new driver appears by mutation as a single copy at its locus, and from this starting point, the driver's spread to fixation is not guaranteed – indeed, in the case of spore killers in fungi, it is always unlikely (Martinossi-Allibert et al. 2021). The probability that the driver will go on to achieve an appreciable frequency in the population (and therefore eventually to fix) is governed by the interplay between random stochastic drift at low copy numbers of the driver and the deterministic advantage enjoyed by the driver. Since the latter depends strongly on the degree of inbreeding, inbreeding will substantially affect the fixation probability, and therefore the substitution rate, of meiotic drivers in the various strains studied by the authors. For example, if outcrossing occurs once every 100,000 generations, then a driver starting at low copy number is subject to ~100,000 generations of random drift before it can benefit from its transmission advantage; in this long interval, the driver is very likely to have drifted to extinction. In contrast, in a strain that outcrosses every generation, a newly arisen driver exercises its transmission advantage immediately and regularly, and therefore has a much higher chance of escaping stochastic loss.</p><p>I believe that questions like these could be investigated using the authors' population genetic model simply by simulating stochastic versions of this model – say, under a Wright-Fisher process – and starting the simulations with a single copy of the driver. This exercise would, I suspect, yield potentially testable predictions about variation in the number of fixed wtf drivers across different strains. Of course, these predictions would be &quot;all else equal&quot;, but it would nevertheless be interesting just to see – given that strains do vary in the number of fixed wtf drivers (lines 490-491) – whether strains with lower levels of inbreeding harbor more fixed drivers.</p><p>– Turning to the transient dynamics of drivers on their way to fixation, it is striking in Figure 3B just how severely inbreeding affects the time required for fixation of a driver. It seems that the trajectories should be &quot;stretched&quot; according to the number of generations until each outcrossing event. Thus, in a strain that outcrosses once every 100,000 generations, a driver will take ~100,000x more generations to fix than it would in a strain that outcrosses every generation. This yields the prediction that, in strains with higher levels of inbreeding, although there should be fewer drivers fixed or spreading towards fixation (above), a greater fraction of these drivers should still be on their way to fixation, relative to a strain with lower levels of inbreeding. I.e., a greater fraction of drivers should still be polymorphic in strains that inbreed more frequently. (This prediction depends, I think, on the rate of appearance of drivers in the population relative to the average time a driver takes to fix.)</p><p>Empirically, are polymorphisms ever observed for wtf drivers? If not, why not? If so, do strains differ in the fraction of driver loci that are polymorphic vs fixed? If the answers to these questions are interesting, the authors might wish to use stochastic simulations of their population genetic model to obtain a more precise understanding of the predicted differences in polymorphism across strains.</p><p>– Finally, it has recently been suggested that, owing to inbreeding's effect in slowing the spread of meiotic drivers, the presence of meiotic drivers in a species might conversely select for greater degrees of inbreeding (Bull 2017). This selective force would appear to be especially strong in pombe, in which drivers are both pervasive and highly destructive. Perhaps the authors could discuss whether they believe that mating behavior across strains of pombe (and perhaps further afield) have been shaped by meiotic drivers?</p><p>References:</p><p>Bull JJ.

Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The referees found the manuscript improved, but had still serious concerns, in particular about the use of terms such as outcrossing, inbreeding and fitness costs. It is very important to use unambiguous and exact terms in science. Referee 3 further suggests some clarification, discussion and possibly simulations on fitness costs or benefits of the driving allele and on the effect of drift.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I found the manuscript much improved, and the additional analyses interesting.</p><p>However, I think that the use of “inbreeding” and “outcrossing” are still unclear and misleading. Many readers will just read this as typical inbreeding and outcrossing in plants and animals while the phenomena here are completely different. In addition, you sometimes use “outcrossing” as true outcrossing (eg L94, L114) and at many places one wonders in what sense you use the terms (in particular iin the model part). Science should use exact terms and avoid confusion and ambiguity. I think that “inbreeding” should be replaced by “same-clone mating” and “outcrossing” by something like “non-same-clone mating”. In addition, as said in my previous review, more emphasis should be put on the high rate of non-same-clone mating in homothallics, and how this goes against the (wrong) view in the fungal literature ; this is what is important for the spread of drivers. The emphasis is currently put on the lower rate of non-same-clone mating in heterothallics which is just its definition. These question should be specifically written in the introduction, refering to previous publication showing that homothallics do outcross (e.g., 10.1038/hdy.2014.37). The discussion should also more explicitly discuss the fact that, in natural conditions, dispersal may promote further non-same-clone mating and (true) outcrossing.</p><p>In addition, I found the answer to the previous comment below not convincing, this should be more explicitly discussed : “This method introduces a bias towards the correlation switching and selfing, because the latter is used as a proxy for the first.”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed my previous comments, in some cases carrying out interesting new analyses that have improved the manuscript. I appreciate that some of the questions raised in my previous report concerning the long-term population genetics of drive in pombe are beyond the scope of the present work, though I encourage the authors to consider these questions in future work since they are, I think, &quot;within reach&quot; and would lead to greater understanding of the fantastic system this group is developing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The revision of the authors has greatly improved the manuscript and has removed most of the questions I had placed with the previous version. The logic of the interaction between switching frequency, outcrossing and population dynamics are better explained and caveats to the conclusions are addressed. The addition of the information on the multiallelic wtf genes also helps with understanding how allele frequencies change over time and that an established allele does not mean fixation. Below a few additional comments on the new manuscript and some elaborations on my previous comments.</p><p>The authors have chosen to consistently use the term selfing to describe same clone mating. Even though they clearly define the use of their term, I disagree with this choice. To a population geneticist or evolutionary biologist this is confusing. The term 'same clone mating' is unambiguous and would be preferred.</p><p>It is unfortunate that direct measurements of mating types was not possible. Though sad that this effort was unsuccessful, it is personally comforting to hear, as in our hands tracking of switching using fluorescent markers has also been unsuccessful. It would be great if a measure would be possible and hopefully a good method will become available to directly assess switching.</p><p>From the reply to my comments 5 and 6 it is clear I did not express myself clearly. Specifically, the use of the fitness costs or benefits of the driving allele are not interpreted as I meant them. Let me elaborate on this. There are different moments where a cost can be incurred during the lifecycle of fission yeast. First during the haploid phase (e.g. germination, haploid mitosis), during mating and at the diploid phase (e.g. diploid mitosis, meiosis, sporogenesis). The fitness in the haploid phase (not modelled by the authors) is likely based on the genome of the individual, whereas mating and the diploid phase are affected by the two genomes. When I refer to the fitness cost/benefit, I always refer to the effect on an allele, as this is the unit of inheritance (similar to the change in p modelled by the authors). The 'cost of a driver' would be the negative effect the allele has on its reproduction, either during the haploid or diploid phase (changing w22 and/or w12 in the model). Killing per se is not a cost to the driver, as it does not reduce its own survival when heterozygous, it only affects the wild type allele. There is a cost to the diploid individual (fitness = 0.5), causing genomic conflict, but under full drive (k=1) this does not affect the driving allele and is thus not a cost to this allele. Drivers can become associated with deleterious mutations due to suppressed recombination, gene disruptions etc. as the authors also mention in line 599, however, to my knowledge such genetic associations have not been described in fission yeast. It might be good to explicitly mention the situation for fission yeast.</p><p>Also no reduction in haploid or diploid growth rate has been shown for drivers, or at least not for wtf4 (&quot;Outside of its role in meiotic drive, wtf4 has no apparent role in promoting fertility&quot;, pp. 13 Nuckolis et al. 2017) and therefore I consider these driving alleles neutral.</p><p>I asked before if there could be a direct benefit to driving alleles. The most obvious would be a benefit to germination rate/ spore survival due to potential resource allocation from the killed spores to the killers. This could improve fitness during the haploid phase (w1 &gt; w2), thereby increasing the allele frequency of the drivers before the next sexual phase. Such secondary effects of killing could greatly speed up the initial phase of invasion when the driver's frequency is low and killing thus slow, which helps to overcome the selection-drift barrier.</p><p>Staying with drift. It is nice to see the extension of the model using different population sizes (lines 500-512; Figure S3c). The results that show that drivers have a higher chance of establishment in smaller populations fit with prediction from the Wright-Fisher model where chance of fixation is directly proportional to the allele frequency. With smaller populations, the initial allele frequency increases (1/N) reducing the chance of loss by drift. It is not clear to me how the &quot;local patch&quot; dynamics as discussed in lines 741-746 affects the dynamics at the population level, where the allele frequencies of all the local patches are combined resulting in the initial population with large population sizes. If there is some form of population structure, of which there is probably some (Jeffares et al. 2015, Tusso et al. 2019) the allele frequencies might locally become higher increasing the chance of establishment of novel alleles. It would be interesting to see how multiple small demes with migration might affect speed of invasion and might affect dynamics of multiple drivers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70812.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As detailed in the reviews below, the major essential revisions are the following ones, requiring further modeling and experiments :</p><p>1) The introduction and discussion should be extensively revised to better use and define terms such as selfing, inbreeding and outcrossing and better place the study in its evolutionary context</p></disp-quote><p>We have made these revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Population genetic modeling should be used to make more ambitious predictions about the natural history of meiotic drive in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and other organisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the population genetic modeling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The claim that mating-type switching frequencies affects outcrossing is not substantiated and the model cannot explain how drive overcomes drift after the rise of a novel allele.

First selfing and outcrossing will be understood by most readers of eLife as “diploid selfing/outcrossing”, as in plants and animals, while heterothallism does not prevent diploid selfing, and actually many heterothallic fungi undergo mostly diploid selfing (e.g. Microbotryum violacem, Neurospora tetrasperma, Podospora anserina). Conversely, homothallism does not prevent outcrossing and may not even have evolved to facilitated inbreeding but instead the opposite, universal compatibility under outcrossing. See below some references discussing these issues and some references showing that homothallic fungi do outcross and that many heterothallic fungi do self a lot. I would therefore not consider particularly surprising that <italic>S. pombe</italic> outcross enough for meiotic drivers to spread, although this indeed goes against the current view, based on the misconceptions above.</p></disp-quote><p>Our revised introduction makes clearer that our focus is specifically on phenotypes of hetero- and homothallism in <italic>S. pombe.</italic> We also include references to support the fact that homothallism does not prevent outcrossing in <italic>S. pombe</italic> or other fungal species.

I understand this is a quite frequent view among scientists working on fungi (as they infer rates based on what they observe in Petri dishes and were often not evolutionary biologists), but the authors precisely miss the opportunity to state that this view is likely incorrect and to explain why, as this is precisely what they show. I did not understand why outcrossing in natural populations in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has not been estimated or at least discussed based on the genomic data in Jeffares et al. 2015. I think that framing the study into this evolutionary context will only make it stronger. I would also recommend to highlight much more the variation in the propensity of inbreeding among natural isolates and the existence of heterothallic strains. Is it frequently the case in nature?</p><p>doi: 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2012.02495.x.</p><p>10.1111/j.1469-185X.2010.00153.x.</p><p>10.1128/EC.00440-07</p><p>10.1038/hdy.2014.37</p><p>10.1111/nph.17039</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the introduction and discussion to address the use of population genetic analyses to predict outcrossing frequencies.

In our revision, we provide a more explicit explanation of <italic>S. pombe</italic> sexual reproduction and the terms we use in the introduction and provide a new figure to help illustrate the text (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>As it stands, the population genetic modeling (Main Text lines 315-339, Methods lines 727-773, Figures 3, 5A) is used mainly to generate frequency trajectories of meiotic drivers against which the trajectories observed in the evolution experiments (Figures4,5B) can be compared. Of course, the similarity of the predicted and experimentally observed trajectories is exciting – I suspect that, based on results like these, pombe will soon become (if it is not already) the premier experimental system for meiotic drive. Still, it seems a missed opportunity, given the variation in mating behavior across strains that the authors have so carefully documented, not to use the population genetic modeling to link this variation with (perhaps even immediately testable) predictions about the natural history of drive in pombe. Below, I suggest some directions in which this might be achieved.</p><p>– The authors focus on the effect of inbreeding on the spread of a driver that starts at an appreciable frequency in the population (e.g., 5%, as in Figure 3B). They find that, while inbreeding slows down the spread of a driver from such frequencies, it does not prevent the driver's eventual spread to fixation. Based on this result, a reader might naively infer that inbreeding affects only the transient dynamics of meiotic drive, not whether a driver spreads to fixation or not; and therefore that strains with different levels of inbreeding will not necessarily have different numbers of fixed drivers.</p><p>However, a new driver appears by mutation as a single copy at its locus, and from this starting point, the driver's spread to fixation is not guaranteed – indeed, in the case of spore killers in fungi, it is always unlikely (Martinossi-Allibert et al. 2021). The probability that the driver will go on to achieve an appreciable frequency in the population (and therefore eventually to fix) is governed by the interplay between random stochastic drift at low copy numbers of the driver and the deterministic advantage enjoyed by the driver. Since the latter depends strongly on the degree of inbreeding, inbreeding will substantially affect the fixation probability, and therefore the substitution rate, of meiotic drivers in the various strains studied by the authors. For example, if outcrossing occurs once every 100,000 generations, then a driver starting at low copy number is subject to ~100,000 generations of random drift before it can benefit from its transmission advantage; in this long interval, the driver is very likely to have drifted to extinction. In contrast, in a strain that outcrosses every generation, a newly arisen driver exercises its transmission advantage immediately and regularly, and therefore has a much higher chance of escaping stochastic loss.</p><p>I believe that questions like these could be investigated using the authors' population genetic model simply by simulating stochastic versions of this model – say, under a Wright-Fisher process – and starting the simulations with a single copy of the driver. This exercise would, I suspect, yield potentially testable predictions about variation in the number of fixed wtf drivers across different strains. Of course, these predictions would be &quot;all else equal&quot;, but it would nevertheless be interesting just to see – given that strains do vary in the number of fixed wtf drivers (lines 490-491) – whether strains with lower levels of inbreeding harbor more fixed drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion as it has expanded our research in exciting ways. We have now added simulation analyses to the paper that consider driver invasion in populations of various population sizes under varying degrees of outcrossing. We hope to expand these analyses in future work to address scenarios that consider: multiple meiotic drivers, suppressors, varying levels of linkage between the drivers/suppressors and compares the fate of drivers on chromosomes that tolerate to that of drivers on chromosomes that do not tolerate aneuploidy. These analyses are ongoing and we believe best suited for a separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Turning to the transient dynamics of drivers on their way to fixation, it is striking in Figure 3B just how severely inbreeding affects the time required for fixation of a driver. It seems that the trajectories should be &quot;stretched&quot; according to the number of generations until each outcrossing event. Thus, in a strain that outcrosses once every 100,000 generations, a driver will take ~100,000x more generations to fix than it would in a strain that outcrosses every generation. This yields the prediction that, in strains with higher levels of inbreeding, although there should be fewer drivers fixed or spreading towards fixation (above), a greater fraction of these drivers should still be on their way to fixation, relative to a strain with lower levels of inbreeding. I.e., a greater fraction of drivers should still be polymorphic in strains that inbreed more frequently. (This prediction depends, I think, on the rate of appearance of drivers in the population relative to the average time a driver takes to fix.)</p><p>Empirically, are polymorphisms ever observed for wtf drivers? If not, why not? If so, do strains differ in the fraction of driver loci that are polymorphic vs fixed? If the answers to these questions are interesting, the authors might wish to use stochastic simulations of their population genetic model to obtain a more precise understanding of the predicted differences in polymorphism across strains.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important, but complicated point that we omitted from the original submission that we now include in the discussion. There is one locus (<italic>wtf4</italic>) where all strains that have been surveyed contain a <italic>wtf</italic> meiotic driver, so some may consider that fixed. However, each of those strains contains a distinct allele of that gene, so they function as unique drivers. For example, <italic>Sk wtf4</italic> provides spores no protection against killing of <italic>Sp wtf4</italic> and vice versa. Because of that, we do not consider <italic>wtf4</italic> or any other <italic>wtf</italic> driver fixed in <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Instead, the mutation rate of <italic>wtf</italic> genes into functionally novel <italic>wtf</italic> genes seems to outpace the fixation rate of a driver.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, it has recently been suggested that, owing to inbreeding's effect in slowing the spread of meiotic drivers, the presence of meiotic drivers in a species might conversely select for greater degrees of inbreeding (Bull 2017). This selective force would appear to be especially strong in pombe, in which drivers are both pervasive and highly destructive. Perhaps the authors could discuss whether they believe that mating behavior across strains of pombe (and perhaps further afield) have been shaped by meiotic drivers?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and a good reference. Thank you for bringing it to our attention. We</p><p>have added discussion these points to the paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The referees found the manuscript improved, but had still serious concerns, in particular about the use of terms such as outcrossing, inbreeding and fitness costs. It is very important to use unambiguous and exact terms in science. Referee 3 further suggests some clarification, discussion and possibly simulations on fitness costs or benefits of the driving allele and on the effect of drift.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I found the manuscript much improved, and the additional analyses interesting.</p><p>However, I think that the use of “inbreeding” and “outcrossing” are still unclear and misleading. Many readers will just read this as typical inbreeding and outcrossing in plants and animals while the phenomena here are completely different. In addition, you sometimes use “outcrossing” as true outcrossing (eg L94, L114) and at many places one wonders in what sense you use the terms (in particular iin the model part). Science should use exact terms and avoid confusion and ambiguity. I think that “inbreeding” should be replaced by “same-clone mating” and “outcrossing” by something like “non-same-clone mating”.</p></disp-quote><p>We reviewed each occurrence of these terms and used ‘same-clone mating’ and ‘non-same-clone mating’ where appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, more emphasis should be put on the high rate of non-same-clone mating in homothallics, and how this goes against the (wrong) view in the fungal literature ; this is what is important for the spread of drivers. The emphasis is currently put on the lower rate of non-same-clone mating in heterothallics which is just its definition. These question should be specifically written in the introduction, refering to previous publication showing that homothallics do outcross (e.g., 10.1038/hdy.2014.37).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the introduction and discussion to further emphasize that outcrossing is possible in homothallics and to cite papers discussing and demonstrating homothallic outcrossing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion should also more explicitly discuss the fact that, in natural conditions, dispersal may promote further non-same-clone mating and (true) outcrossing.</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the discussion to introduce spore dispersal in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and how that could contribute to outcrossing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I found the answer to the previous comment below not convincing, this should be more explicitly discussed : “This method introduces a bias towards the correlation switching and selfing, because the latter is used as a proxy for the first.”</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the discussion to introduce spore dispersal in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and how that could contribute to outcrossing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The revision of the authors has greatly improved the manuscript and has removed most of the questions I had placed with the previous version. The logic of the interaction between switching frequency, outcrossing and population dynamics are better explained and caveats to the conclusions are addressed. The addition of the information on the multiallelic wtf genes also helps with understanding how allele frequencies change over time and that an established allele does not mean fixation. Below a few additional comments on the new manuscript and some elaborations on my previous comments.</p><p>The authors have chosen to consistently use the term selfing to describe same clone mating. Even though they clearly define the use of their term, I disagree with this choice. To a population geneticist or evolutionary biologist this is confusing. The term 'same clone mating' is unambiguous and would be preferred.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adopted the preferred terms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unfortunate that direct measurements of mating types was not possible. Though sad that this effort was unsuccessful, it is personally comforting to hear, as in our hands tracking of switching using fluorescent markers has also been unsuccessful. It would be great if a measure would be possible and hopefully a good method will become available to directly assess switching.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From the reply to my comments 5 and 6 it is clear I did not express myself clearly. Specifically, the use of the fitness costs or benefits of the driving allele are not interpreted as I meant them. Let me elaborate on this. There are different moments where a cost can be incurred during the lifecycle of fission yeast. First during the haploid phase (e.g. germination, haploid mitosis), during mating and at the diploid phase (e.g. diploid mitosis, meiosis, sporogenesis). The fitness in the haploid phase (not modelled by the authors) is likely based on the genome of the individual, whereas mating and the diploid phase are affected by the two genomes. When I refer to the fitness cost/benefit, I always refer to the effect on an allele, as this is the unit of inheritance (similar to the change in p modelled by the authors). The 'cost of a driver' would be the negative effect the allele has on its reproduction, either during the haploid or diploid phase (changing w22 and/or w12 in the model). Killing per se is not a cost to the driver, as it does not reduce its own survival when heterozygous, it only affects the wild type allele. There is a cost to the diploid individual (fitness = 0.5), causing genomic conflict, but under full drive (k=1) this does not affect the driving allele and is thus not a cost to this allele. Drivers can become associated with deleterious mutations due to suppressed recombination, gene disruptions etc. as the authors also mention in line 599, however, to my knowledge such genetic associations have not been described in fission yeast. It might be good to explicitly mention the situation for fission yeast.</p><p>Also no reduction in haploid or diploid growth rate has been shown for drivers, or at least not for wtf4 (&quot;Outside of its role in meiotic drive, wtf4 has no apparent role in promoting fertility&quot;, pp. 13 Nuckolis et al. 2017) and therefore I consider these driving alleles neutral.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these clarifications. We have clarified in the new draft that drive benefits the <italic>wtf</italic> drive allele, but is costly to the fitness of the genome as a whole because meiotic products bearing alleles not linked in cis to the driver are destroyed ~half the time by drive in heterozygotes (e.g. Crow 1991). We specify fitness that our fitness values apply to the diploid stage. We have also specifically addressed what is known about linkage of <italic>S. pombe</italic> drivers to deleterious alleles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I asked before if there could be a direct benefit to driving alleles. The most obvious would be a benefit to germination rate/ spore survival due to potential resource allocation from the killed spores to the killers. This could improve fitness during the haploid phase (w1 &gt; w2), thereby increasing the allele frequency of the drivers before the next sexual phase. Such secondary effects of killing could greatly speed up the initial phase of invasion when the driver's frequency is low and killing thus slow, which helps to overcome the selection-drift barrier.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a Figure 5-Supplementary figure 2 where we modeled a higher fitness of driver heterozygotes such that they gain additional fitness benefits beyond that enjoyed by killing the competing allele. The modeling under this assumption did not fit our data as well as assuming the drivers benefit is exclusively from spore killing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Staying with drift. It is nice to see the extension of the model using different population sizes (lines 500-512; Figure S3c). The results that show that drivers have a higher chance of establishment in smaller populations fit with prediction from the Wright-Fisher model where chance of fixation is directly proportional to the allele frequency. With smaller populations, the initial allele frequency increases (1/N) reducing the chance of loss by drift. It is not clear to me how the &quot;local patch&quot; dynamics as discussed in lines 741-746 affects the dynamics at the population level, where the allele frequencies of all the local patches are combined resulting in the initial population with large population sizes. If there is some form of population structure, of which there is probably some (Jeffares et al. 2015, Tusso et al. 2019) the allele frequencies might locally become higher increasing the chance of establishment of novel alleles. It would be interesting to see how multiple small demes with migration might affect speed of invasion and might affect dynamics of multiple drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intent was to highlight the same point you make about population structure allowing local allele frequencies to become higher and increase the probability of establishment. We reworded this section to make that clearer and also to highlight that Martinossi-Allibert et al. formally described this idea. We agree that testing this idea further is important and hope to pursue that experimentally in future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
