The olfactory (piriform, PCx) cortex contains two main types of principal neurons, semilunar (SL) and superficial pyramidal (PYR) cells. SLs and PYRs have distinct morphologies, local connectivity, biophysical properties, and downstream projection targets. Odor processing in PCx is thought to occur in two sequential stages. First, SLs receive and integrate olfactory bulb input and then PYRs receive, transform, and transmit SL input. To test this model, we recorded from populations of optogenetically identified SLs and PYRs in awake, head-fixed mice. Notably, silencing SLs did not alter PYR odor responses, and SLs and PYRs exhibited differences in odor tuning properties and response discriminability that were consistent with their distinct embeddings within a sensory-associative cortex. Our results therefore suggest that SLs and PYRs form parallel channels for differentially processing odor information in and through PCx.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>piriform cortex</kwd><kwd>sensory processing</kwd><kwd>Ntng1</kwd><kwd>parallel pathways</kwd><kwd>neural coding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC015525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franks</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC016782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franks</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19 NS112953</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franks</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vivo recordings from identified cell classes in the olfactory cortex of a novel transgenic mouse reveal that distinct classes of principal neurons operate largely in parallel and differentially process odor information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain contains a diverse array of neuron types that are each thought to play a specific role in neural circuit computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanes and Masland, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the specific role each neuron type plays will therefore provide mechanistic insight into what a neural circuit does and how it does it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>). Piriform cortex (PCx) is a three-layered allocortex with principal neurons primarily located in layer II. Superficial pyramidal (PYR) cells in deeper layer II receive afferent olfactory bulb (OB) inputs on their distal apical dendrites, dense excitatory intracortical inputs on their proximal apical dendrites, and top-down inputs from other brain regions on their basal dendrites. By contrast, semilunar (SL) cells in superficial layer II receive strong OB inputs on their distal apical dendrites, few, if any, excitatory intracortical inputs, and lack basal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heimer and Kalil, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Haberly, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bekkers and Suzuki, 2013</xref>).

Support for this sequential model stems from observations that SLs receive stronger OB inputs than PYRs but little or no intracortical excitatory inputs, and that SLs respond 2â4 ms earlier than PYRs following electrical stimulation of OB mitral cell axons in the lateral olfactory tract (LOT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ketchum and Haberly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiegand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2017</xref>). According to this model, SLs are thought to be the primary recipients of OB input, and their activity necessary to recruit PYRs. Alternatively, SLs and PYRs may form parallel processing streams, such as described in various sensory and motor neocortices, where principal neurons projecting to distinct downstream regions encode different features of a stimulus or are differentially modulated during task learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glickfeld et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Economo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williamson and Polley, 2019</xref>).

Finally, SLs and PYRs may be embedded within a parallel loop where mitral cells project onto both SLs and PYRs, and SLs additionally project onto PYRs, similar in organization to the entorhinal cortex-dentate gyrus-CA3 circuit in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>).</p><p>PCx is a sensory-associative cortex, containing both afferent OB inputs and recurrent or intracortical excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiegand et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>). The dual afferent and associative inputs provide PCx neurons the substrate to integrate elemental sensory information from the OB to form distributed odor-specific neuronal ensembles and transform these ensembles through the recurrent, associative network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poo and Isaacson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>). SLs and PYRs could represent the two ends of the PCx sensory-associative continuum, where SLs simply combine afferent OB inputs while PYRs form dynamic odor ensembles that can be transformed through the recurrent, associative network. If so, we might expect SL odor representations to reflect sensory information more faithfully and PYR odor representations to benefit from associative learning mechanisms and be more reliable and discriminable.</p><p>We recorded extracellularly from layer II PCx neurons in awake, head-fixed <italic>NetrinG1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> (<italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>) mice that selectively express Cre-recombinase in SLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>). This allowed us to distinguish SLs from PYRs in populations of layer II PCx neurons and to selectively manipulate SL activity. We found that neither optogenetic nor chemogenetic suppression of SLs affected PYR odor responses and that SLs and PYRs responded with similar latencies, arguing against the sequential model. SLs were more broadly tuned, and odors were more discriminable in PYRs than in SLs, suggesting that distinct principal neuron types in PCx differentially encode odors, and in ways that reflect their local connectivity profiles. Together, these findings support a parallel processing model, where SLs and PYRs both receive direct OB inputs and transform the information to varying degrees, perhaps for use in different behavioral contexts by their distinct downstream targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> transgenic mouse enables selective targeting of SLs in vivo</title><p>We recently generated a knock-in mouse line that expresses Cre-recombinase in Ntng1-expressing (Ntng1+) cells throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We then obtained whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from uninfected Ntng1+ and Ntng1- cells located away from the infection site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3c</xref>). We observed large, rapid inward currents in all recorded Ntng1- cells in response to brief (1 ms) light pulses but almost no inward currents in Ntng1+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3d and e</xref>). These light-evoked responses were completely blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX and CPP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3b</xref>). Thus, Ntng1+ cells make glutamatergic synapses onto Ntng1- cells, but not onto other Ntng1+ cells, consistent with the synaptic connectivity of SLs and PYRs. Taken together, the <italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse expresses Cre-recombinase in a subpopulation of PCx principal neurons whose laminar, morphological, intrinsic, and local connectivity properties are congruent with those of SLs. Therefore, henceforth we refer to Ntng1+ and Ntng1- cells within layer II of PCx as SLs and PYRs, respectively.</p><p>Although SLs do not receive excitatory inputs from other SLs, it is not known if they receive excitatory inputs from other, non-SL PCx neurons. We therefore obtained whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in mice focally injected with non-conditional AAVs to express ChR2 in all PCx neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3f</xref>). We observed even larger rapid inward currents in PYRs, consistent with the dense recurrent connectivity between PYRs. Interestingly, we now observed small inward currents in SLs, indicating that SLs do receive some intracortical excitatory inputs from other PCx neurons, although these were 5.4Ã weaker than inputs received by PYRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3g and h</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish between SLs and PYRs in vivo, we first injected Cre-dependent AAVs expressing the inhibitory opsin, Jaws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>), into anterior PCx of <italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>/Ai14 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4b</xref>). After allowing 3â4 weeks for Jaws expression, we recorded the extracellular spiking activity of layer II PCx neurons at the injected site in awake, head-fixed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>). We used an optogenetic tagging strategy to classify recorded cells as SLs. We presented a series of brief 635 nm light pulses (1000 pulses, 300 ms, 1 Hz) to suppress spiking in Ntng1+ cells. Cells were classified as SLs if their activity was reliably (i.e., spike rate greater during baseline than during the light-on period, two-tailed t-test, p&lt;1 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup>) and rapidly (i.e., suppression latency determined using change point analysis &lt;10 ms) suppressed by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j and k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>). Across all experiments, approximately half of the recorded cells were SLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4a</xref>). To minimize false negatives due to poor infection and/or mistargeted recordings, we omitted experiments in which less than 25% of cells were suppressed. We previously found that only 7% of all recorded PCx neurons, and fewer than 1% of layer II PCx neurons, were GABAergic inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). The remaining units were therefore classified as PYRs. SLs had higher spontaneous spike rates than PYRs (median SL: 1.99 Hz, n = 426 cells; median PYR: 1.03 Hz, n = 464 cells; p=5.08 Ã 10<sup>â13</sup>, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref>), indicating that we can resolve differences in spiking activity between SLs and PYRs. Importantly, our ability to tag neurons with very low spontaneous firing rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5d</xref>) indicate that our optogenetic tagging protocol was robust for identifying cells with low spontaneous firing rates.

Both SL and PYR responses were decorrelated between the early (trials 2â20) and later trials (trials 41â59), indicating that some changes in response patterns occur with time or following repeated odor presentations (SLs, early-early, 0.952 [0.943, 0.969]; late-early, 0.915 [0.897, 0.934]; p=0.0041; PYRs, early-early, 0.930 [0.910, 0.955]; late-early, 0.849 [0.815, 0.884]; p=6.67 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>). Additionally, in a separate set of mice injected with AAVs expressing mCherry and Arch, we administered CNO/C21 to account for any nonspecific, hm4di-independent effects of CNO/C21 (fraction of identified SLs, mean Â± SD: 0.545 Â± 0.229, n = 3 experiments, three mice). Similar to the previous control, we found that the response patterns changed between the baseline and CNO/C21 conditions in both SLs and PYRs (SLs, baseline-baseline, 0.953 [0.944 0.961]; CNO/C21-baseline, 0.852 [0.824, 0.880]; p=1.23 Ã 10<sup>â4</sup>; PYRs, baseline-baseline, 0.926 [0.893, 0.949]; CNO/C21-baseline, 0.747 [0.653, 0.823]; p=0.0052; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>).

SLs had significantly lower lifetime sparseness values than PYRs, indicating that SLs are less odor selective than PYRs (mean lifetime sparseness: SL, 0.434 [0.414, 0.458], n = 426 cells; PYR, 0.558 [0.536, 0.581], n = 464 cells; p=2.61 Ã 10<sup>â14</sup>, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

The SL population response to each odor was significantly less sparse than the PYR population response (SL, 0.686 [0.681, 0.691]; PYR, 0.755 [0.737, 0.771]; n = 10 odors; p=1.61 Ã 10<sup>â6</sup>, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

We used z-scored single-trial population response vectors to generate trial-by-trial correlation matrices for SLs and PYRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). We calculated the mean correlation across trials within each odor as a measure of response reliability, and the mean correlation between different odors as a measure of odor discriminability. By this metric, response reliability was similar between SLs and PYRs (SL, 0.474 [0.452, 0.497]; PYR, 0.499 [0.472, 0.525]; n = 10 odors; p=0.191, unpaired t-test), but odors were slightly more discriminable in PYR responses (SL, 0.266 [0.254, 0.279]; PYR, 0.238 [0.220, 0.253]; p=0.0193; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p><p>To further investigate the discriminability of odor responses, we performed principal components analysis (PCA) and, for visualization, projected SL and PYR z-scored pseudopopulation responses onto their first three principal components for each odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). We quantified the Euclidean distances between the means of the first six principal components of pairs of odors and found that odors were more separable in PYR responses than in SL responses (median distance: SL, 19.4; PYR, 27.4; n = 45 odor pairs; p=3.21 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup>, unpaired t-test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>). In PYRs but not SLs, odor responses to valeraldehyde, Î³-terpinene, and ethyl acetate were more distinct than their responses to the other presented odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and g</xref>), resulting in a larger spread in distances between pairs of odors in PYRs. Finally, we asked if a downstream decoder could more accurately identify odors based on PYR versus SL odor-evoked activity. However, odor classification accuracy, at all pseudopopulation sizes, was similar in SLs and PYRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>, left).</p><p>To summarize, odors were slightly more discriminable in PYRs than in SLs, consistent with the idea that the recurrent network decorrelates PYR responses to different odors. However, the trial-to-trial variability and the odor decoding performance of SLs and PYRs were equivalent. We additionally analyzed if and how the odor response properties of PYRs changed when SLs were suppressed and found no substantial effects, further suggesting that SLs and PYRs encode odor information in parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>If both SL and PYR responses derive solely from their sensory inputs, then similar odors should evoke similar responses in both cell types. Interestingly, however, we noticed some subtle but distinct differences in the off-diagonal structure of the correlation matrices for SL and PYR responses as well as in the confusion matrices of pairwise Euclidean distances between odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e and h</xref>). For example, valeraldehyde and Î³-terpinene responses were more strongly decorrelated from other odor responses in PYRs than in SLs. Also, methyl tiglate responses were more like ethyl tiglate than acetophenone in SLs, while the reverse was true in PYRs. These differences were similarly reflected in the confusion matrices showing predicted odors when decoding using just 25 randomly selected cells for SLs and PYRs (scale adjusted to emphasize classification errors) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>, right). These observations indicate that SLs and PYRs are transforming odor information from the OB differently, and that their outputs do not simply reflect their sensory inputs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The <italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse line allowed us to distinguish between SLs and PYRs and selectively suppress SLs in extracellular recordings of layer II PCx neurons in awake, head-fixed mice. We found that odor responses in SLs and PYRs are largely independent as suppressing SLs, both optogenetically and chemogenetically, did not weaken or alter the response pattern of PYRs. We additionally did not find differences in odor response latencies between SLs and PYRs. These results are not consistent with a sequential processing model in which SLs are the primary cortical recipients of OB input whose activity is required to drive PYR responses. We found that SLs are more broadly tuned, less sparse, and their population odor responses less discriminable compared to PYRs. Taken together, our data support a parallel processing model in which OB input drives both SL and PYR odor responses, which then perform different computations on this information before routing it to different downstream areas.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stimulus selectivity, discriminability, and response variability</title><p>Individual PCx neurons integrate convergent inputs from different combinations of glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apicella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>). SLs almost exclusively receive afferent OB inputs, while PYRs receive both afferent OB inputs and dense intracortical inputs from SLs and other PYRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>). If intracortical connectivity is random, then sensory information from the OB received by PCx neurons would be uniformly redistributed among PYRs via the recurrent network. Individual PYRs would therefore effectively sample a far larger subset of glomeruli than individual SLs, resulting in more broadly tuned and overlapping responses among PYRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>). Alternatively, coordinated activity within PCx could actively sculpt the recurrent circuitry so that PYRs that are regularly co-activated, because they respond to similar chemical features, become preferentially interconnected, resulting in more narrowly tuned, reliable, and discriminable responses than those in SLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberly, 2001</xref>). Our results are largely consistent with the latter model in that we found PYR responses to be more narrowly tuned and discriminable than those in SLs. A recent study showed that odor responses in layer III of PCx, which only contains PYRs, were more correlated between chemically similar odor stimuli than responses in layer II, which contain both SLs and PYRs, or the OB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>), providing further evidence for structured associative inputs. It was therefore surprising that PYR responses were not more reliable than SL responses.</p><p>Our findings on the stimulus selectivity and discriminability of SLs and PYRs are also comparable to those reported in two zebrafish odor centers downstream of the OB: cells in the ventral telencephalon (Vv) receive primarily OB inputs and exhibit broader stimulus tuning and more overlapping odor representations than those in the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), which is the teleost homolog of PCx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yaksi et al., 2009</xref>). Finally, in the control experiments for the DREADD suppression of SLs, we noticed that PYR responses seemed to change more with time and/or stimulus presentation than SL responses. This result is consistent with an activity-dependent sculpting of recurrent connectivity so that PYR responses evolve while SL responses continue to faithfully represent the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pashkovski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schoonover et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Interpreting effect size</title><p>Although the response properties of SLs and PYRs are consistent with a more sensory and a more associative network, respectively, the differences we observed were less pronounced than we expected. There are several possible explanations for this. First, although SLs and PYRs are the two main classes of principal neurons in layer II, some neurons have intermediate morphological and intrinsic properties that lie on a gradient from canonical SLs to canonical PYRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiegand et al., 2011</xref>). These cells, which may or may not be Ntng1+, could be diluting the differences that we observed. Additionally, although we have used multiple stringent selection criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>) to reliably identify SLs, and have omitted experiments with a low fraction of opto-tagged cells, it may still be possible that some SLs have been miscategorized as PYRs and vice versa. Second, although SLs receive stronger OB inputs than PYRs, this difference is relative and does not mean that OB inputs onto PYRs are weak or that PYRs are not directly driven by the OB, as this is sometimes interpreted. Third, unlike in slice recordings, the recurrent network and top-down inputs are preserved in in vivo recordings. Therefore, while SL activity is driven largely by sensory input, PYR activity is also influenced by ongoing background activity that provide non-olfactory inputs to PYRs, rendering their responses to odors more variable and less discriminable than might be expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Why did we find no difference in the response latencies of SLs and PYRs even though SLs responded approximately 2â4 ms earlier than PYRs in response to LOT stimulation in brain slice experiments or in anesthetized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ketchum and Haberly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki and Bekkers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiegand et al., 2011</xref>)? In vivo, ongoing recurrent and top-down inputs in awake animals may depolarize PYRs and thereby shorten their response latencies. More importantly, electrical LOT stimulation generates a single, synchronous barrage of afferent inputs into PCx. However, different mitral cells respond to odors with variable latencies that tile the entire ~300 ms sniff cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cury and Uchida, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shusterman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>), making it difficult to compare SL and PYR onset latencies to a given odor-activated input. Precise optogenetic stimulation of OB glomeruli with high temporal precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chong et al., 2020</xref>) can be used to address this question more directly.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential limitations of optogenetic and chemogenetic suppression</title><p>With optogenetics, we were able to effectively suppress the SLs we were recording from on alternating trials, thus providing a robust and ongoing comparison of PYR responses with and without SL input. However, PCx spans ~4 mm along its anterior-posterior axis and is a long-range recurrent network with neurons forming intracortical connections with neurons &gt;1 mm away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hagiwara et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, to effectively remove SL inputs onto PYRs, we needed to suppress SLs located far from the recording site. However, the spatial resolution of optogenetic suppression using 532 nm light, determined using a photobleaching assay, is slightly less than 1 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). To broaden the area of suppression, we used a thicker (400 Î¼m) optic fiber and Jaws, a red-light (635 nm)-activated opsin, as red light scatters less in tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>). We also injected the virus in 3â4 sites along the anterior-posterior axis of PCx to suppress axon terminals, at the recording site, of remote cell bodies outside of the light cone. Nevertheless, it is possible that we failed to disrupt PYR responses in <italic>light-on</italic> trials simply because we were not suppressing enough SLs across PCx. If so, we might expect that more complete SL suppression would decrease PYR responses and impair their odor decoding. However, odor decoding accuracy in PYRs trended upward on <italic>light-on</italic> trials in experiments with robust local SL suppression, indicating that SL suppression did affect PYRs, and suggesting that SLs were suppressed well beyond the recording area. Chemogenetics alleviates the spatial limitations of optogenetics, but the suppression of odor-evoked activity in SLs was less robust than in the optogenetic experiments. Additionally, we had to wait 20â30 min for cells to be suppressed, which allowed for shifts in odor representations. Novel techniques that enable more effective axon terminal suppression with high spatiotemporal precision and efficacy may enable a more robust interrogation of the effects of suppressing SLs on PYRs. These caveats notwithstanding, both the optogenetic and chemogenetic experiments showed effective SL suppression and indicated that SL suppression had little to no effect on PYR odor responses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Roles of SLs and PYRs in odor processing</title><p>Our data do not support a two-stage sequential activation model, where odor information from the OB is transmitted first to SLs and then from SLs to PYRs. Instead, both SLs and PYRs can be driven by OB input and appear to differentially process odor information, as indicated by their distinct tuning properties and by the differences we observed in the off-diagonal structure of their response correlation matrices. Interestingly, SLs preferentially project to the posterior PCx, posteromedial cortical amygdala, and lateral entorhinal cortex while PYRs project back to the OB, medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diodato et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazo et al., 2017</xref>). Because SLs are less driven by intracortical inputs, downstream regions receiving SL inputs may receive odor information that more closely reflects the stimulus. By contrast, PYRs integrate afferent OB input with inputs from SLs and other PYRs, as well as inputs from other brain areas to form contextual odor representations and provide a substrate for the storage of odor representations. Thus, the varying ratios of afferent versus associative connectivity between SLs and PYRs perhaps enable each cell type to extract distinct features of odor information and route this information to different downstream regions.</p><p>Although it may not be surprising that PYRs are able to respond to odors without SL input, our finding that PYR odor representations are essentially equivalent with and without SL input is nevertheless puzzling. Why might this be and what does this imply about the function of SL projections onto PYRs? Inputs onto PYRs from other PYRs are approximately five times stronger than inputs from SLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3e and h</xref>). It might be that under our very simplified conditions, with pure odors delivered at relatively high concentrations (0.3% vol./vol.), the contribution from SLs becomes insignificant and may be more apparent in more naturalistic odor environments. Alternatively, in the optogenetic experiments, we suppressed SLs hundreds of milliseconds before odor onset, which could be sufficient time for the network to re-equilibrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolding and Franks, 2018</xref>). Perhaps rapid suppression of SLs during or immediately before the odor would have a more pronounced effect. We also presented odors passively, in nonbehaving mice, and it is possible that differences between, and dependencies on, the different cell types might emerge in mice engaged in a behavioral task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). However, this seems unlikely given recent evidence that odor representations in PCx do not appear to encode odor value or be task-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gadziola et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Millman and Murthy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) and that any âtop-downâ effects would almost certainly influence PYR output more than SL. Finally, perhaps SLs and PYRs do not simply represent odor identity and we are looking at the wrong feature of the odor response. Future experiments will be required to resolve this, but our data make clear that odor processing in PCx does not occur through a two-stage process mediated first by SLs and then by PYRs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Parallel loops in PCx and hippocampus</title><p>Although we have proposed a parallel model for processing odor information in PCx, it is not strictly correct as PYRs receive input from both OB and SLs. This organization may be better described as a parallel-loop motif, as in the hippocampus. PCx and the hippocampus are analogous structures. Both are trilaminar paleocortices with extensive recurrent networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2016</xref>) that support unsupervised learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barkai et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haberly, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolls, 2013</xref>). In terms of morphology and connectivity, PYRs are analogous to CA3 pyramidal cells and SLs to dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells. The roles of DG and CA3 in the encoding of episodic memories are relatively well characterized; DG granule cells are thought to drive the acquisition of memories, but not retrieval, and perform pattern separation while CA3 pyramidal cells are thought to store and retrieve memories and perform pattern completion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Madar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>). It is important to note that although DG granule cells synapse onto CA3 pyramidal cells, the DG-CA3 circuit is not exclusively sequential. CA3 also receives direct input from the entorhinal cortex, and when DG projections to CA3 are silenced or ablated, the ability of CA3 to retrieve memories is unimpaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Kesner, 2004</xref>). In our previous study with the <italic>Ntng1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mouse line, we found that PYRs were more robust to degraded afferent OB inputs and exhibited more persistent odor-evoked activity after stimulus offset than SLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolding et al., 2020</xref>). Both features are consistent with an associative network performing computations that stabilize and enable reliable retrieval of odor ensembles, characteristic of a pattern completing network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rolls, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Inagaki et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is yet to be evidence implicating SLs, specifically, as pattern separators in the olfactory circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapuis and Wilson, 2011</xref>). A key property of DG granule cells that enable them to effectively decorrelate similar activity patterns is their sparseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>). However, we found that SLs had higher spontaneous spike rates, were individually more broadly tuned, and their population response less sparse than PYRs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our data do not support a sequential processing model for PCx in which odor information from OB is first integrated in SLs, and then routed from SLs to PYRs.

Afterward, they were moved to a stereotaxic frame and maintained on isoflurane anesthesia (0.5â2% in 0.8 L/min O<sub>2</sub>) throughout the procedure. A local anesthetic, bupivacaine, was injected under the skin over the skull and an incision was made along the midline to expose the skull. Between 1 and 4 burr holes, depending on the experiment, were made over PCx using coordinates relative to bregma. AAVs (either AAV5-hSyn-DIO-GFP, AAV8-hSyn-DIO-Jaws-eYFP or AAV5-hSyn-DIO-ArchT3.0-eYFP or AAV5-hSyn-DIO-hm4di-mCherry or AAV5-hSyn-FLEX-mCherry, all obtained from UNC Vector Core) were then delivered through a glass pipette using a Nanoject pump (Drummond) (200 nL/site at 60 nL/min). The following coordinates were used (in mm, AP 2.0, ML 2.15, DV 3.8; AP 1.3, ML 2.82, DV 3.95; AP 0.5, ML 3.5, DV 4.05; AP â0.6, ML 3.8, DV 4.10). After slowly retracting the pipette, burr holes were covered using KwikCast sealant and a custom titanium headpost was lowered onto the exposed skull and attached using Metabond (Parkell, Inc). Mice were placed on a heating pad for 30 min after surgery while they recovered from anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vitro electrophysiology and analysis</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and decapitated, and the cortex was quickly removed in ice-cold artificial CSF (aCSF). Parasagittal brain slices (300 Î¼m) were cut using a vibrating microtome (Leica) in a solution containing (in mM): 10 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 7 MgSO4, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 glucose, and 195 sucrose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Slices were incubated at 34Â°C for 30 min in aCSF containing 125 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 NaPyruvate. Slices were then maintained at room temperature until they were transferred to a recording chamber on an upright microscope (Olympus) equipped with a Ã40 objective.</p><p>For current-clamp recordings, patch electrodes (3â6 megohm) contained 130 K methylsulfonate, 5 mM NaCl, 10 HEPES, 12 phosphocreatine, 3 MgATP, 0.2 NaGTP, 0.1 EGTA, 0.05 AlexaFluor 594 cadaverine. For voltage-clamp experiments, electrodes contained 130 D-gluconic acid, 130 CsOH, 5 mM NaCl, 10 HEPES, 12 phosphocreatine, 3 MgATP, 0.2 NaGTP, 10 EGTA, 0.05 AlexaFluor 594 cadaverine. Voltage- and current-clamp responses were recorded with a MultiClamp 700B amplifier, filtered at 2â4 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz (Digidata 1440). Series resistance was typically ~10 megohm, always &lt;20 megohm, and was compensated at 80â95%. The bridge was balanced using the automated MultiClamp function in current-clamp recordings. Data were collected and analyzed offline using AxographX and IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics). Junction potentials were not corrected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Intrinsic properties</title><p>Recordings were targeted to SLs (tdTomato+) and PYRs (unlabeled) located in layer II. Cells were also visualized using a fluorescent indicator (Alexa 594 Cadaverine) to confirm that they were correctly identified as SL or PYR. Intrinsic properties were measured at current clamp in response to a series of 1-s-long current pulses stepped up in 50 pA increments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Synaptic connectivity</title><p>All experiments were performed 3â4 weeks after virus injection (AAV-hSyn-DIO-Chr2 or AAV-hSyn-ChR2). We recorded from uninfected SLs (tdTomato+) and PYRs (unlabeled) adjacent to the infection site. To ensure cells were uninfected, we first examined responses to weak, 1-s-long light pulses (470 nm, CoolLED) delivered through the Ã40 objective. Cells that exhibited large and sustained photocurrents were discarded. Uninfected cells were held at either â70 mV or +5 mV to isolate excitatory or inhibitory synaptic currents, respectively. Brief (1 ms, ~10 mW) pulses were delivered every 10 s to activate ChR2+ axon terminals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vivo extracellular recordings</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Electrode placement and data acquisition</title><p>Recordings were performed 3â6 weeks after virus injections. On the day of the recording, the Metabond and KwikCast covering the craniotomy made during virus injection was removed. A 32-site polytrode acute probe, either with a 50 Î¼m optic fiber attached (A1x32-Poly3-5mm-25s-177-OA32LP, Neuronexus, Ann Arbor, MI) or without (A1x32-Poly3-5mm-25s-177-A32, Neuronexus) was positioned over the craniotomy and lowered into one of the virus injection sites using a Patchstar Micromanipulator (Scientifica, UK). No additional craniotomies were made on the day of the recording, thus mice were never anesthetized. Recordings were targeted to 3.8â4.3 mm ventral to the brain surface, and the probe was lowered until a band of intense spiking activity, reflecting the densely packed layer II of PCx, was observed. Electrophysiological signals were acquired through an A32-OM32 adaptor (Neuronexus), digitized at 30 kHz at a CerePlex digital headstage (Blackrock Microsystems, Salt Lake City, UT) and recorded using a Cerebus multichannel data acquisition system (Blackrock Microsystems). Experimental events (e.g., odor delivery times, laser pulse times) and respiration signals were acquired at 2 kHz by analog inputs of the Cerebus system. Respiration was monitored using a microbridge mass airflow sensor (Honeywell AWM3300V) positioned opposite the animalâs nose.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Spike sorting</title><p>Individual units were isolated using Spyking-Circus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/spyking-circus">https://github.com/spyking-circus</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yger et al., 2018</xref>). Isolated clusters were manually curated to remove those with &gt;1% of interspike intervals (ISIs) violating the refractory period (&lt;2 ms) or that looked like noise artifacts. Pairs of clusters with similar waveforms and coordinated refractory periods in the cross-correlograms were merged into a single cluster. The odor response recording session and the opto-tagging recording session for each experiment were merged and sorted as one session and later split for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Opto-tagging</title><p>Opto-tagging was performed at the end of each experiment (or at the start for experiments using DREADDs). When the probe without the attached optic fiber was used, a separate 200 Î¼m or 400 Î¼m optic fiber (ThorLabs) was implanted at a 12Â° angle to the probe, and a distance of 500â600 Î¼m away from the probeâs ventral coordinate. The optic fiber was connected to a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY) and then to either a 532 nm or 635 nm laser (OptoEngine LLC, Midvale, UT) using a patch cable (ThorLabs). The mechanical shutter was controlled using TTL pulses sent from an analog output of the Cerebus system, which then allowed light pulses through the optic fiber. A series of 1000 pulses (300 ms, 1 Hz) were delivered to opto-tag cells. A limitation of using inhibitory opto-tagging is that spontaneously low-firing Ntng1+ cells may not be identified. To alleviate this issue, we delivered a high number of light pulses and recorded for ~18 min to ensure the spiking activity of spontaneously low-firing cells was sufficiently sampled. The same TTL pulse was also sent to an analog input channel on the Cerebus system to align light pulses with electrophysiological recordings post hoc. Another limitation of opto-tagging is we may incorrectly identify Jaws- cells that are synaptically connected to Jaws+ cells as light-responsive. We therefore added a selection criterion based on the time course of suppression of each cell. Latency to suppression was determined by change point analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wolff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>). PSTHs were generated for each unit using 2 ms bins spanning 100 ms before to 100 ms after laser onset, and a change point within that time was determined using MATLABâs âfindchangeptsâ function. A cell was categorized as light-responsive if (1) its trial-averaged baseline activity was significantly higher than that during the laser pulse (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p&lt;1 Ã 10<sup>â7</sup>), (2) the area under the receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curve was less than 0.5, and (3) the change point value was lesser than 10 ms from the laser on time. In 4/9 optogenetic suppression experiments, we delivered 60 light pulses that were triggered by a TTL pulse to the laser (i.e., no shutter), and thus we were not able to accurately determine change points. For these experiments, light-responsive cells were determined using the rank-sum test and auROC criteria, followed by manual curation. Units that exhibited fast suppression were categorized as light-responsive, while units that exhibited visibly slow or delayed suppression were categorized as non-light responsive.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Odor stimuli</title><p>The odor stimulus set consisted of 2-hexanone (Sigma, 02473), octanal (Aldrich, O5608), isoamyl acetate (Tokyo Chemical Industries, A0033), ethyl butyrate (Aldrich, E15701), valeraldehyde (Aldrich, 110132), ethyl tiglate (Alfa Aesar, A12029), acetophenone (Fluka, 00790), Î³-terpinene (Aldrich, 223190), ethyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich, 34858), and methyl tiglate (Alfa Aesar, A11964).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Odor delivery</title><p>Odors were delivered using a custom-built 16-valve olfactometer. House air was passed through a filter and then split three ways into three mass flow controllers (MFCs) (Aalborg, Orangeburg, NY). MFC1 flowed filtered air at a constant rate of 1 L/min while airflow through MFC2 and MFC3 were varied to vary the concentration of odors delivered while maintaining a total airflow out of the olfactometer at 1 L/min. Custom Arduino software was used to control odor solenoid opening and closing as well as to log which odor was delivered at each trial. Monomolecular odorants were diluted to 1% v./v. in mineral oil. Normally, a 1 L/min clean air stream from MFC1 was directed to the mouseâs nose. During a trial, air from either MFC2 or MFC3 was directed through one of the odor vials and the odorized air stream was directed to exhaust for an equilibration period of 6 s before rapid switching of a final valve, triggered on exhalation, redirected the odorized air to the nose and neutral air to exhaust. Odors or mineral oil blank control stimuli were presented for 1 s, and stimuli were presented every 10 s in random order. Odors were presented at 0.3% air dilution for the optogenetic and chemogenetic suppression experiments and at 1% for analyzing odor response latencies and properties.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Spontaneous firing rate</title><p>Spontaneous firing rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1l</xref> were determined by counting the number of spikes in a 4 s inter-trial window starting 4 s after odor offset. Spontaneous firing rates in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref> were determined by counting the number of spikes in a 500 ms window before odor presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Individual cell-odor responses</title><p>We omitted the first-odor trial in all analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jacobson et al., 2018</xref>). Individual trial-averaged cell-odor responses as a function of time were visualized by computing kernel density functions (KDFs) smoothed using a 10 ms Gaussian kernel (Chronux Toolkit). The reliability of responses was determined using the auROC metric. auROC values were computed from the U-statistic of the rank-sum test comparing spike counts of each cell-odor pair during the first sniff after odor presentation to spike counts during the sniff preceding odor presentation. auROC values were then converted to response indices using the formula: auROC * 2 â 1. A value of â1 or 1 indicates a suppressed or activated odor response that was perfectly distinguishable from the pre-odor baseline response while a value of 0 indicates no difference between the odor and pre-odor baseline response.</p><p>To determine response peaks, KDFs were first computed for each cell-odor pair and the maximum value within the specified time window was then determined as the peak. Significantly active cell-odor pairs were ones with a response index &gt; 0 and a p-value&lt;0.05 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) comparing spike counts in the first sniff with spike counts in the pre-odor sniff.

For peak latencies, KDFs were first computed from spike counts occurring in a 300 ms time window from inhalation onset using a 10 ms Gaussian kernel. Then, the time of the maximum value of the KDF was identified and taken as the latency to peak. For onset latencies, KDFs were similarly computed but for a time window of 600 ms, spanning 300 ms before inhalation onset (baseline) and 300 ms after. The mean firing rate and standard deviation were determined for the baseline period, and the time after inhalation onset at which the KDF first exceeded 2 SDs above the baseline was then taken as the onset latency.</p><p>Odor classification accuracy in a sliding window was determined using a linear multiclass SVM classifier using leave-one-out cross-validation, as described in the âPopulation decoding analysisâ section. Within each time window, the pseudopopulation spike count vector for one trial was omitted, the classifier trained on the remaining trials, and the odor presented during the omitted trial was predicted using the trained SVM. Classification within each window was repeated 100 times, and accuracies for each window are the average across all iterations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Sparseness</title><p>Lifetime sparseness describes the firing rate distribution of individual neurons to all of the odors presented and reflects the tuning width of neurons. A value of 1 indicates the cell responded to just one odor, and a value of 0 indicates the cellâs firing rate was distributed uniformly across all odors. Population sparseness is a measure of the density of responses of a population of cells, where a value of 1 indicates the population response to a given odor was driven by just one cell and a value of 0 indicates uniform contribution of all neurons in the population to a given odor response.

There are several suggestions below that can be addressed with textual revisions and minor additional data analysis. All reviewers, however, agree that the opto-tagging procedure requires more in-depth attention. While new experiments (e.g. excitatory opto-tagging) could be beneficial, they are not essential. To unambiguously delineate the applicability of the opto-tagging procedure, consider analysis of viral spread (and fraction of doubly-labelled cells where possible) to estimate efficiency of tagging, a more detailed analysis across population data including firing patterns and the type of light-evoked responses, analysis of spike waveforms to estimate the &quot;contamination&quot; with putative inhibitory interneurons, and a detailed discussion of the caveats and limitations of the opto-tagging procedure.

I found that the study was solid and makes a contribution to the understanding of the role of semilunar (SL) and pyramidal (PYR) cells within the circuit in piriform cortex by showing that the data are not consistent with a sequential model where the SL cells respond and integrate the odorant stimulus and transmit the information to the PYR cells that subsequently transform and transmit the information to other brain regions. My main concern is that it would be useful for the authors to make it clear how well they can optotag these units.</p><p>1. The patch clamp data show burst firing for the PYR cells, but not for the SL cells. Is this reflected in a peak at low interspike intervals (ISIs) in the ISI histogram for the firing of single PYR units in the extracellular recordings as found, for example, for PYR cells in CA1?</p><p>2. The authors use SEM as a measure of variability in the different figures. It is now recognized that SEM is not useful because it conveys little information on the difference between two distributions. A much more useful statistical measure is the 95% confidence interval that can be calculated by bootstrapping (see for example Halsey et al., The fickle P value generates irreproducible results. Nature methods 12, 179-185, 2015).</p><p>3. The validity of the results in the manuscript bank on reliable differentiation between units by optogenetic tagging with jaws. The example units in Figure 1 k are clearly different in their response to the optgenetic inhibition with jaws. However, reading the methods raises the question of how reliable the criteria were in differentiating two separable populations. The manuscript would benefit greatly from a supplementary figure with population data showing how reliable the optogenetic tagging of &quot;SL&quot; vs &quot;PYR&quot; cells was. Also, please show raw voltage traces. Is there a light-induced artifact?</p><p>4. I was surprised by the relatively small differences in the odor response properties between SL and PYR units shown in Figure 5. The number of units is small, but the histogram of the Euclidean distance appears to be bimodal for PYR units. Could this be due to cross-contamination of the &quot;SL&quot; and &quot;PYR&quot; unit classification? Or could it be that these two groups of cells are functionally heterogeneous within groups in terms of sparseness? Did the authors try to sort the responses using measures such as the burstiness of the cells? I would advise to change the title of the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors investigate the odor responses of two classes of principal excitatory neurons in olfactory cortex- semilunar neurons (SL) and pyramidal neurons (PYR). Previous in vitro work has suggested that these two classes are sequentially activated by olfactory bulb afferent input. SL neurons are recruited first, then PYR neurons are recruited by a combination of afferent input and SL input. The suggests a sequential structure for odor processing within the olfactory cortex. The present study tests this hypothesis in vivo, using a recently developed transgenic mouse line that allows for the selective targeting of SL neurons. The authors use optogenetic methods to distinguish SL from PYR neurons as well as optogenetic or chemogenetic silencing of SL neurons. Two main findings strongly support the interpretation that SL and PYR neurons are not sequentially activated during odor processing. First, silencing of SL neurons does not impair or change the odor response properties of PYR neurons. Second, the odor response latencies of SL or PYR neurons do not differ. A third finding that PYR and SL differentially represent olfactory information, is subtle. Altogether, the main conclusion of the study is that SL and PYR neurons are members of parallel networks for odor processing.</p><p>Overall the experiments and analyses presented in this study are designed and conducted well. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed and are complementary. Optogenetic and chemogenetic silencing were employed to mitigate the limitations of each technique on the interpretation of the findings. The authors discuss some of the caveats and limitations of these tools. The main results of silencing SL neurons using either technique support the interpretation that sequential activation of SL and PYR neurons is not required for PYR odor representations. A subsequent analysis of odor coding suggests that PYR neurons more sparsely represent odors and are more discriminating between odors compared to SL neurons. These differences between SL and PYR odor representations were statistically significant but somewhat small. The authors interpretation of these findings is that SL and PYR neurons act in parallel to differentially process olfactory information. An alternative interpretation is that SL and PYR have differential output projection and act in parallel to inform to different downstream brain targets. They may or may not convey similar information. These need not be mutually exclusive.</p><p>Recommendations for the authors:</p><p>1) The authors state that generally half of the recorded neurons in vivo were rapidly suppressed by optogenetic inactivation. Suppressed neurons were classified as SL while non-suppressed were classified as PYR. This raises a number of questions pertaining to the interpretation of cell type during in vivo recordings.</p><p>a. The authors state that they omitted experiments when less than 25% of cells were suppressed assuming this was due to poor infection or mistargeted recordings. While the positions of the optical fiber and recording electrode were verified post hoc, it does not appear that the quality of viral infection was quantified. It appears that high double labeling (tdTom/Jaws-YFP) is shown in Figure 2i, which is good. Was the proportion of SL cells expressing virus consistent across animals included in the study?</p><p>b. Were all non-suppressed neurons categorized as PYR? Presumably some responsive neurons are also inhibitory interneurons. Was any attempt made to spike sort based on waveform? What proportion of non-suppressed cells might be interneurons?</p><p>c. How much heterogeneity was there in the responses to optical inactivation of SL neurons. Was there any attempt to categorize or quantify the frequency of occurrence for these various responses? For example, suppressing SL cells could decrease excitatory drive to some classes of inhibitory interneuron which would also potentially appear suppressed, albeit with a different time course. Is it possible that slowly suppressed neurons that were also included in the PYR group are interneurons? Alternatively, In Figure 1k- lower middle panel, the neuron shown appears to be increasing responses at light offset (rebound spiking?) and slowly adapting between light pulses. What did the firing pattern of this neuron look like in the absence of light stimulation? None of the panels in Figure 1k show baseline spontaneous firing rates, since all start with light ON. While it is difficult to ascertain cell type from spike waveform alone, the caveat that some neurons in the PYR group may be inhibitory interneurons should at least be stated and discussed, if not somehow quantified.</p><p>2) The analysis extensively uses correlation coefficients, it is not clear how these are conducted. Were neuron vectors in one trial first averaged across the population, then the average vectors correlated between trials in light ON or light OFF conditions? This would result in a different outcome than averaging the ON-OFF correlations of vectors for individual neurons. Individualistic differences might be lost with population averaging prior to correlation. In general, more description in the methods section would be helpful for interpretation and reproduction of the findings and the metric (i.e. Pearson's Correlation) should be stated.</p><p>3) Was the cross-correlation between SL and PYR vectors on the same trial performed in addition to determining latency to response. It seems if one is looking for a temporal relationship between the two classes that might be a way to find it. Alternatively, it could show that there is no temporal dependence of PYR activity on SL activity which would support the main findings of the study.</p><p>4) The last paragraph of the Results section is a bit hand-waving. The results described are not really quantified and more observational. This does not seem to add much to the overall study.</p><p>5) The details of anesthesia for day-of recording preparations are absent. What anesthesia was used? How long was allowed for the animal to wake before recording?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Franks et al., ask a critical question about the olfactory cortex circuitry: How do two adjacent and connected cell classes interact in-vivo. They use a transgenic mouse line to express inhibitory opsins or DREADDs exclusively in SLs and show that silencing SLs has very little effect on the peak firing rate of odour activated non-SL pyramidal cells. This indicates that SLs are not a key contributor to PYR cell activity, which allows them to rule out a largely feedforward model of SLs feeding odour information to PYRs. in addition they find that odour response latencies are comparable, further supporting a parallel rather than serial circuit. Finally, they find that odour responses are themselves distinct in SLs and PYRs.</p><p>The experiments are well conducted and the conclusions are for the most part well supported by the experiments. However, I have a few concerns.</p><p>First, I have a technical concern regarding opto-tagging. The authors employ inhibitory opsins to identify SL cells using opto-tagging. The choice of inhibitory opsins is important because they subsequently inhibit the SL population with them. However, they use a fairly long 10ms window for identifying opto-tagged cells, which opens the possibility of the inhibition being synaptic rather than opto. Also, detecting a drop in activity from a low baseline is inherently difficult. One possible way of establishing that their results are not influenced by poor opto-tagging classification is to use excitatory tagging in a separate group of animals, and conduct the same characterisation analysis as Figure 5, and seeing if they obtain similar baseline firing rates and other response properties. Excitatory tagging would be advantageous, considering that SLs have very little connections among each other and weak connections to PYR cells, alleviating usual concerns of spillover in excitatory opto-tagging. This is not essential but should be considered.</p><p>Further, the authors find about twice the baseline firing rate of SLs, this could reflect that inhibitory opto-tagging in this case is biased to pick up higher firing rate cells, since with lower firing rate cells it will be difficult to detect small drops in firing rate. I do not understand why the authors claim the inhibitory tagging is not biasing to higher firing rate cells, just because their method categorises some low firing rate cells as opto-tagged.</p><p>In Figures 2 and 3, the authors suppress SLs and find that the peak firing rate of PYRs is unchanged in positively responding cells. My concern is that peak firing rate is a limited view of the cell's response. The authors could look at other metrics, such as the median or profile of response. Further, while the decoding analysis is excellent, it would be well complemented by an encoding analysis, where the authors could look at response properties such as stimulus selectivity and ask whether this changes. Indeed, the authors have explored these very metrics in Figure 5. It would be very insightful to compare these metrics of sparseness, selectivity, correlations etc while silencing SLs. Also, an important control that seems to be missing is the no-opsin light stimulation control. This control would be important when looking at the broader range of response metrics and establishing whether any changes observed are accounted for by light alone.</p><p>The authors make a major claim of the study in Figures 2 and 3 by restricting the analysis to odour activated cells only. I would find it useful to include the results for cells inhibited by odours also, and indeed the full distribution across the population.</p><p>In summary, as the authors mention in the discussion, it would be truly surprising if a cell population anatomically adjacent to and connected to PYRs has no discernible effect on the PYRs response properties. To establish such a surprising result would require a more comprehensive use of firing metrics and wider selection of cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73668.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see from the comments below, all reviewers agree that the work is important and well executed.

We were not able to recover tissue from all experimental animals, but we have included examples of local Jaws-YFP expression for 6 of 10 mice used for basic optotagging experiments (Figure 1. â S. 4); for 4 of 6 mice for optogenetic suppression (Figure 2 â S. 1); and for 4 of 4 mice for the chemogenetic suppression experiments (Figure 3 â S. 1). Our sections are quite thick (50 Î¼m) which makes accurately counting double-labeled cells difficult, but from these additional data it is abundantly clear that the example of double-labeled Ntng1+/Jaws-YFP cells as shown in Figure 1i is representative and that the vast majority of Ntng1+ cells (i.e. red cells) also express Jaws-YFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This means that any âcontaminationâ by inhibitory interneurons would be in the population of presumptive PYRs. We think it is unlikely that this is a substantive concern because in previous experiments with VGAT-ChR2 mice we have shown that only ~6% of all neurons we record in PCx are GABAergic, consistent with immunohistological analyses. Critically, most inhibitory neurons are in either layer I or layer III, and here we recorded specifically in layer II, where principal neurons are located. In previous work, we found only 7 out of 862 layer II neurons were GABAergic, Bolding and Franks, <italic>Science</italic> 2018.</p><p>We have found that analysis of spiking waveforms is not especially helpful at identifying inhibitory interneurons (see Bolding and Franks, <italic>eLife</italic> 2017). For one thing, only a relatively small fraction of PCx interneurons are fast-spiking (see Suzuki and Bekkers, <italic>Cerebral Cortex</italic> 2010). In support of this, we have now added an additional Supplemental figure with an analysis of spike waveforms for all Ntng1+ and Ntng1- cells which shows that different features of the spiking waveforms for these two populations are overlapping.</p><p>We have also added a discussion of these and other concerns about optotagging to the main text and the Methods sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I enjoyed reading this manuscript.

In fact, we checked this early on and did not find anything useful. However, to allay the reviewerâs concern, we have now added this analysis (Figure 1 â S5b). Because SLs have higher spontaneous firing rates than PYRs we determined burst indices by dividing the median ISI for each cell by its mean ISI to normalize for differences in spontaneous firing rates. Using this analysis, a strongly bursting cell will have a broader, or even a bimodal, distribution of normalized ISIs compared to a regularly spiking cell, which would have a narrower distribution centered on 1. Although some PYRs do appear to have lower burst indices than SLs, the distributions are largely overlapping and we cannot use burst index as a robust method to distinguish between SLs and PYRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

If SLs and PYRs had very different responses and there was cross-contamination of one of the populations, the result would be an intermediate distribution of odor responses. Instead, this bimodal distribution in Euclidean distances is due to some odors being more separable than others in PYR responses but, importantly, not in SLs. To further demonstrate this result, we have added matrices showing the Euclidean distances for each of the odor-pairs in principal components space (Figure 5h).</p><p>Please also note that it is not at all surprising that some pairs of odors might evoke more similar responses than other pairs. Most trivially, this would happen with structurally similar odor pairs vs. pairs of structurally distinct odors. However, in this case we would expect to see similarly bimodal distributions for SLs and PYRs. That we see this for PYRs and not for SLs is further evidence of differential processing of odor information by these two classes of cells.

Unfortunately, even though individual PYR cells receive many intracortical inputs, these are long-range and, consequently, the connectivity between any two PCx neurons is extremely low (&lt;&lt;1%, see Franks et al., 2011). In earlier experiments we examined cross-correlations between extracellularly recorded units and found very, very few instances of asymmetrical distributions consistent with connected pairs. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that we will learn much from examining cross-correlations between SLs and PYRs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The last paragraph of the Results section is a bit hand-waving. The results described are not really quantified and more observational. This does not seem to add much to the overall study.</p></disp-quote><p>The last paragraph discusses the idea that SLs and PYRs are differentially transforming odor information, implying distinct roles for these cell types in odor processing. In addition to the classification errors (Figure 5i), the new figure showing a bimodal distribution in population responses to odors in PYRs but not in SLs (Figure 5h) is striking. We therefore think this point is worth making.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The details of anesthesia for day-of recording preparations are absent. What anesthesia was used? How long was allowed for the animal to wake before recording?</p></disp-quote><p>Recordings were performed by lowering the probe into craniotomies that were made during virus injections 3 weeks prior to recording. Mice were not anesthetized at any time afterwards, including on recording days. After injecting the virus, craniotomies are covered with KwikCast and Metabond. Before recording, the Metabond is drilled away and the KwikCast covering the craniotomy is peeled off. We have added this information to the Methods section and we thank the reviewer for pointing out our omission of this important detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Franks et al., ask a critical question about the olfactory cortex circuitry: How do two adjacent and connected cell classes interact in-vivo. They use a transgenic mouse line to express inhibitory opsins or DREADDs exclusively in SLs and show that silencing SLs has very little effect on the peak firing rate of odour activated non-SL pyramidal cells. This indicates that SLs are not a key contributor to PYR cell activity, which allows them to rule out a largely feedforward model of SLs feeding odour information to PYRs. in addition they find that odour response latencies are comparable, further supporting a parallel rather than serial circuit. Finally, they find that odour responses are themselves distinct in SLs and PYRs.</p><p>The experiments are well conducted and the conclusions are for the most part well supported by the experiments. However, I have a few concerns.</p><p>First, I have a technical concern regarding opto-tagging. The authors employ inhibitory opsins to identify SL cells using opto-tagging. The choice of inhibitory opsins is important because they subsequently inhibit the SL population with them. However, they use a fairly long 10ms window for identifying opto-tagged cells, which opens the possibility of the inhibition being synaptic rather than opto. Also, detecting a drop in activity from a low baseline is inherently difficult. One possible way of establishing that their results are not influenced by poor opto-tagging classification is to use excitatory tagging in a separate group of animals, and conduct the same characterisation analysis as Figure 5, and seeing if they obtain similar baseline firing rates and other response properties. Excitatory tagging would be advantageous, considering that SLs have very little connections among each other and weak connections to PYR cells, alleviating usual concerns of spillover in excitatory opto-tagging. This is not essential but should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Activating large populations of SLs evokes a sufficiently large response in PYRs, as shown in our slice recording experiments where we activate the axons of ChR2-expressing Ntng1+ cells. Thus, excitatory opto-tagging will present its own set of challenges as it will be difficult to distinguish between Jaws+ cells and Jaws- cells that are synaptically connected to Jaws+ cells.</p><p>Inhibitory opto-tagging has been done in Rowland et al., 2018 and in Wolff et al., 2014 and has been determined to be a reliable method of cell identification. In Wolff et al., 2014, the changepoint cut-off was 7 ms and we have used a 10 ms cut-off by going through many of our recorded cells, plotting the changepoint and determining what would be a good cut-off. In the new supplemental figure (Figure 1 â S. 5), we show the firing rate for all cells as a function of time around the light pulse. SLs show strong and rapid suppression while PYRs do not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, the authors find about twice the baseline firing rate of SLs, this could reflect that inhibitory opto-tagging in this case is biased to pick up higher firing rate cells, since with lower firing rate cells it will be difficult to detect small drops in firing rate. I do not understand why the authors claim the inhibitory tagging is not biasing to higher firing rate cells, just because their method categorises some low firing rate cells as opto-tagged.</p></disp-quote><p>The overlapping distributions of firing rates between SLs and PYRs suggest that the opto-tagging is not significantly biased towards high firing rate cells. Please note that we present 1000 light pulses and record for ~18 minutes to make sure we sample enough spikes from even low firing cells. We also provide additional example cells with low spontaneous firing rates in Figure 1 â S. 5 that show that suppression in cells with low spontaneous firing rates (&lt;1 Hz) can be reliably detected and that these cells can be reliably categorized as SLs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2 and 3, the authors suppress SLs and find that the peak firing rate of PYRs is unchanged in positively responding cells. My concern is that peak firing rate is a limited view of the cell's response. The authors could look at other metrics, such as the median or profile of response.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to peak rate in positively responding cells, we examined population responses across all recorded cells. We did this for the correlational analyses, for the principal components analysis and for the decoding analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further, while the decoding analysis is excellent, it would be well complemented by an encoding analysis, where the authors could look at response properties such as stimulus selectivity and ask whether this changes. Indeed, the authors have explored these very metrics in Figure 5. It would be very insightful to compare these metrics of sparseness, selectivity, correlations etc while silencing SLs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion, and we have now compared odor response properties of PYRs in the light-off and light-on conditions. However, we find no substantial changes in the various metrics that we tested (Figure 5 â S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, an important control that seems to be missing is the no-opsin light stimulation control. This control would be important when looking at the broader range of response metrics and establishing whether any changes observed are accounted for by light alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Since we did not observe any change in PYR cell activity, we do not think a light stimulation control will be necessary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors make a major claim of the study in Figures 2 and 3 by restricting the analysis to odour activated cells only. I would find it useful to include the results for cells inhibited by odours also, and indeed the full distribution across the population.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this analysis. We did find a modest increase in firing rates in light-on trials for PYRs that were suppressed in the light-off trials. Furthermore, we only selected for activated cells when we compared response strengths in the light-off and light-on trials. For the population response correlations and the decoding analysis, we used the full spectrum of cell responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In summary, as the authors mention in the discussion, it would be truly surprising if a cell population anatomically adjacent to and connected to PYRs has no discernible effect on the PYRs response properties.</p></disp-quote><p>As we state in the Discussion, we agree that this result is somewhat surprising. It is precisely for this reason that we used two independent means of suppressing SLs (i.e. optogenetic suppression and chemogenetic suppression) and got the same result. We therefore think that determining why we fail to see an effect on PYRs is beyond the scope of this project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To establish such a surprising result would require a more comprehensive use of firing metrics and wider selection of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, our population analyses were not restricted to positively responding cells and our analyses are more comprehensive than the reviewer is giving us credit for.</p></body></sub-article></article>
