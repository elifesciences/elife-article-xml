regenerative process. Beyond cost and delayed graft availability, the patient-specific performance of engineered tissues poses serious concerns on their clinical translation ability. A more exciting paradigm consists in exploiting cell-laid, engineered extracellular matrices (eECMs), which can be used as off-the-shelf materials. Here, the regenerative capacity solely relies on the preservation of the eECM structure and embedded signals to instruct an endogenous repair. We recently described the possibility to exploit custom human stem cell lines for eECM manufacturing. In addition to the conferred standardization, the availability of such cell lines opened avenues for the design of tailored eECMs by applying dedicated genetic tools. In this study, we demonstrated the exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 as a high precision system for editing the composition and function of eECMs. Human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines were modified to knock out vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and assessed for their capacity to generate osteoinductive cartilage matrices. We report the successful editing of hMSCs, subsequently leading to targeted VEGF and RUNX2-knockout cartilage eECMs. Despite the absence of VEGF, eECMs retained full capacity to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification. Conversely, RUNX2-edited eECMs exhibited impaired hypertrophy, reduced ectopic ossification, and superior cartilage repair in a rat osteochondral defect. In summary, our approach can be harnessed to identify the necessary eECM factors driving endogenous repair. Our work paves the road toward the compositional eECMs editing and their exploitation in broad regenerative contexts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-01864_3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>948588</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003849</institution-id><institution>IngaBritt och Arne Lundbergs Forskningsstiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004817</institution-id><institution>Lund University Medical Faculty Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009780</institution-id><institution>Region Skåne</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bourgine</surname><given-names>Paul E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human extracellular matrices can be edited in their composition using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, leading to materials exhibiting tailored regenerative capacities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extracellular matrices (ECMs) are complex networks of proteins not only providing tissue structural and mechanical support, but also acting as growth factor storing and presenting entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonnans et al., 2014</xref>). As such, ECMs are receiving increasing attention in tissue engineering as templates capable of guiding homeostasis, remodeling, and regenerative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hussey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fattahi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mouw et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>ECMs can be derived from native tissue or organs (native ECMs [nECMs]) by applying a decellularization step which effectively removes the cellular fraction. The resulting nECMs are commonly used as biomaterials in regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assunção et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinderer et al., 2016</xref>), offering a natural biocompatible structure. However, they suffer from substantial batch-to-batch variation with their properties being largely affected by the tissue source and the decellularization process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assunção et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinderer et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, while displaying a high level of biological complexity and fidelity, the composition of nECMs cannot be tailored to specific needs.</p><p>A valuable option emerged from recent advances in bioengineering which led to the development of synthetic ECMs (sECMs). These tunable materials are predominantly composed of biopolymers such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), poly(lactic co-glycolic acid), and poly(ethylene glycol), which can be functionalized with bioactive substances such as peptides, growth factors, or enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fattahi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). The possible modulation of sECM’s composition and chemistry offers precise control over their mechanical properties, degradability, and temporal release of instructive molecules toward improved tissue repair. Despite holding great promises, their structure and function remain simplified compared to their native counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filippi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddy et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>With the aim of combining high biological fidelity and design flexibility, engineered ECMs (eECMs) have become a credible alternative. Those result from the exploitation of stem/progenitor populations capable of depositing ECMs under specific in vitro culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Decaris and Leach, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvestine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haumer et al., 2018</xref>), which can be subsequently isolated from the cellular fraction and exploited as a cell-laid product. Early studies were conducted using eECM derived from primary cells, exhibiting variable performance associated with the inter-donor variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sadr et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prewitz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Most recently, we demonstrated the possibility to standardize the production of eECMs through the engineering of dedicated human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell (hMSC) lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourgine et al., 2017</xref>). Precisely, the mesenchymal sword of Damocles bone morphogenetic type-2 (MSOD-B) line offered the generation of eECMs in the form of human cartilage templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigeot et al., 2021</xref>). Those cartilage templates can be further devitalized, lyophilized, and stored as an <italic>off-the-shelf</italic> tissue, retaining remarkable bone formation capacity by instructing endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grigoryan et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The exploitation of cell lines as an unlimited cell source for eECM generation offers unprecedented standardization in graft production and performance. Meanwhile, it also consists of a robust cellular platform facilitating their further genetic engineering, to achieve the production of eECMs tailored in composition and function. Toward this objective, CRISPR/Cas9 appears as a versatile and efficient gene-editing tool. While this technology has been extensively used for genetic screening or disease modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golchin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazrati et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geurts and Clevers, 2023</xref>), the possibility to edit hMSCs and study the compositional impact on deposited eECMs has not been investigated so far.</p><p>In this study, we aim at demonstrating that CRISPR/Cas9 can be applied as an editing tool for the engineering of custom eECMs. As proof-of-principle, our strategy relies on the CRISPR/Cas9-guided editing of the MSOD-B line for knocking out vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), respectively, a key pro-angiogenic protein and transcription factor critically involved in the endochondral ossification pathway. The resulting hMSC lines will be evaluated for their capacity to generate hypertrophic cartilage in vitro and instruct tailored skeletal tissue formation in vivo as cell-free and lyophilized templates. If successful, our study is expected to validate the use of CRISPR/Cas9 for eECMs edited in composition, while providing a novel platform toward decoding the necessary molecular signals driving effective tissue repair.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CRISPR/Cas9 editing of hMSC lines lead to efficient VEGF knockout in cartilage tissues</title><p>VEGF is a known master regulator of angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu and Olsen, 2016</xref>) and a key mediator of endochondral ossification. When reaching hypertrophy, chondrocytes highly express VEGF, prompting vasculature invasion and subsequent osteoprogenitor recruitment. This was proven to be essential for cartilage template remodeling into bone and bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duda et al., 2023</xref>). However, whether VEGF is a requirement to instruct ectopic endochondral ossification remains to be investigated. Here, we thus first aimed at engineering a hMSC line CRISPR/Cas9-edited for VEGF knockout and evaluate the corresponding impact on cartilage and endochondral bone formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, we exploited the MSOD-B as human cell line previously demonstrated as capable of endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigeot et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Specific guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting different regions of the VEGF gene but conserved across all isoforms of VEGF were designed based on a previously established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ran et al., 2013</xref>) toward modifying the MSOD-B line. Three gRNAs targeting exon 1 (VEGF_1.1, VEGF_1,2, VEGF_1.3), one targeting exon 2 (VEGF_2.1), and one targeting exon 8 (VEGF_8.1) were designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These gRNAs were cloned into the pU6-(BbsI)_CBh-Cas9-T2A-mCherry vector encoding the <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> Cas9 (SpCas9) machinery. Following transfection in MSOD-B cells, single cell clones were sorted based on the transient mCherry expression and expanded for characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Out of 163 single clones, 14 could be successfully expanded (8.5 %). From these clones, five were retrieved from the gRNA 1.1, six from gRNA 1.3, and three from gRNA 8.1. In order to assess a successful editing and directly correlate it to a knockout of VEGF, an ELISA was performed to measure the concentration of VEGF in the supernatant of expanded MSOD-B clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In non-edited cells (MSOD-B, control), 5000 pg/mL were secreted and detected by ELISA. From the successfully expanded clones, most of them showed reduced but non-abolished secretion of VEGF. However, two clones exhibited undetectable levels of VEGF, both resulting from the gRNA targeting the Exon1 of the VEGF gene. These clones were defined as MSOD-BΔV1 and MSOD-BΔV2 and further characterized for their capacity to form cartilage.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR/Cas9 editing of mesenchymal cell lines lead to efficient vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) knockout in cartilage tissues.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme depicting the generation of CRISPR/Cas9-edited mesenchymal sword of Damocles bone morphogenetic type-2 (MSOD-B) lines, and the subsequent in vitro and in vivo tissue formation assessment.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Masson’s trichrome indicated de novo bone formation in the defect area for both the MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The presence of fibrotic tissue as well as a reduced marrow compartment suggested an incomplete remodeling at that time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Upon tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining, we observed elevated osteoclastic activity in MSOD-B samples compared to MSOD-BΔR1, potentially indicating a reduced rate of active bone formation in MSOD-BΔR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The micro-CT quantification revealed a 30% repair of the damaged bone in the defect for both MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of interest, a significantly higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp) was observed in MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1, confirming an ongoing bone remodeling process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Using the ImageJ software, we quantified the trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) in MSOD-B and MSOD-BΔR1 constructs.

Interestingly, the MSOD-BΔR1 group exhibited a higher remnants of GAGs in the subchondral area and better integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, d, e, and f</xref> magnification) to the host tissue. Quantification of cartilage tissue within condyle surface area confirmed a poor-to-no repair in the MSOD-B group (1.05%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). In sharp contrast, the MSOD-BΔR1 implanted eECMs initiated a chondral regeneration reaching approximately 20.67% of the total healthy cartilage area. The integration and regeneration potential of engineered constructs was further evaluated by performing a semiquantitative histological assessment following a preexisting grading system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maehara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This approach allows for the systematic evaluation of critical repair tissue parameters, offering a comparative measure of the regenerative efficacy of the engineered constructs against healthy tissue benchmarks. In the assessment of stained femur condyle sections, cellular morphology and matrix staining of the MSOD-BΔR1 group (66% and 50%, respectively) were superior to the MSOD-B one (33% and 16%, respectively). Although both constructs exhibited reduced cartilage thickness and subchondral bone regeneration, MSOD-BΔR1 consistently outperformed the MSOD-B grafts (33.33% vs 8.33% and 25% vs 16.66%). Surface regularity and integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>) with adjacent cartilage also revealed better outcomes in MSOD-BΔR1 (41% and 50%) as opposed to MSOD-B (50% and 33%), further indicating an enhanced regenerative potential of the MSOD-BΔR1 constructs.</p><p>In conclusion, while both grafts yielded comparable bone regeneration within the osteochondral defects, only the RUNX2-deleted grafts supported a cartilage regeneration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We here report the possibility to edit the composition and function of eECM by CRISPR/Cas9 engineering of human mesenchymal lines. VEGF knockout led to successful in vitro formation of cartilage with targeted protein depletion. Upon implantation, this impacted the graft vascularization onset but not the endogenous instruction of the endochondral program. In turn, RUNX2 knockout prevented cartilage hypertrophy in vitro, significantly delaying ectopic bone and bone marrow formation in vivo. This strategy was validated in a functional osteochondral defect model, whereby prevention of cartilage hypertrophy by RUNX2 deletion improved cartilage regeneration.</p><p>A clear interdependency of angiogenesis and osteogenesis occurs upon bone formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kusumbe et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tuckermann and Adams, 2021</xref>). For this reason, VEGF-enrichment has been naturally proposed as a strategy to accelerate or increase bone graft vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Largo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Our study demonstrates that VEGF knocked-out cartilage templates retained full osteoinductive potential in a challenging ectopic environment. Those results are in sharp contrast with intramembranous strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behr et al., 2011</xref>), including our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bourgine et al., 2017</xref>), whereby grafts remain insufficient in promoting complete bone remodeling even upon VEGF-enrichment. This suggests that the first stage of host progenitor recruitment by our eECM is not VEGF dependent, although subsequent tissue vascularization and remodeling may be orchestrated in a second step by endogenous cell secretion. Other pro-angiogenic proteins embedded in the matrix may also have compensated for the lack of VEGF, such as BMP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigeot et al., 2021</xref>), known to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zuo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lowery and de Caestecker, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Conversely, RUNX2 deletion was shown to fully prevent cartilage hypertrophy, in line with published mouse models also reporting a lack of endochondral ossification and lethality at birth upon RUNX2 knockout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kamekura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komori et al., 1998</xref>). Here, MSOD-BΔR cartilage templates still exhibited osteoinductive capacity, but with cortical and trabecular structures largely reduced as compared to controls. Future work may clarify if this strictly results from the absence of COLX, or if an additional specific cartilage matrix component (e.g. matrix metalloproteinases) impaired the instruction of endochondral ossification.</p><p>The performance in a regenerative context was further evaluated in an immunocompetent rat osteochondral defect model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2020</xref>). We defined an early time point of 3 weeks as providing the opportunity to assess the early contribution of the grafts to both the cartilage and bone tissue regeneration. Strikingly, only the MSOD-BΔR could contribute to neo-chondrogenesis. We hypothesize that the absence of hypertrophic features prevented the template degradation and favored its integration to native cartilage. Despite the repair performance being limited to an approximate 20% of native cartilage restoration, this is remarkable in light of the BMP-2 content in our ECM prompting endochondral ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sekiya et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pelttari et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mueller and Tuan, 2008</xref>). In fact, preventing the in vivo remodeling of engineered cartilage templates remains challenging in the skeletal regeneration field, with bone marrow MSCs cartilage systematically reaching hypertrophy and subsequent ossification. The molecular mechanisms remain nonetheless elusive, warranting further studies comprising additional time points to decipher the repair dynamic as well as the long-term stability of newly formed tissue. It also prompts a comparison with other recently proposed <italic>off-the-shelf</italic> strategies, based on ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Browe et al., 2022</xref>) or synthetic scaffold materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steele et al., 2022</xref>), in order to comprehend the feasibility to exploit our grafts for stable cartilage/joint repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, while the relevance of CRISPR/Cas9 eECMs in cartilage repair remains to be further validated, our study demonstrates the relevance of genetically edited ECMs in regenerative contexts.</p><p>CRISPR/Cas9 editing of human mesenchymal cells has previously been explored for gene and cell therapy applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golchin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hazrati et al., 2022</xref>), for tailoring the immunomodulatory and/or differentiation capacity of engineered cells. However, no studies have described the exploitation of editing strategies for the generation of eECMs, whereby modified cells are absent from the final grafting product. Our work illustrates that this can be achieved by direct targeting of secreted factors typically embedded upon ECM deposition, as demonstrated with VEGF. Alternatively, we also propose the knockout of key transcription factors as a strategy for custom eECM generation by impacting their tissue developmental/maturation stages.</p><p>A clear implication of our work lies in the possibility to decipher the necessary factors capable of instructing de novo tissue formation. Those findings will be of high relevance for the design of eECMs tailored in composition. Beyond bone repair, our study also bears high relevance in other regenerative contexts. In fact, an exciting opportunity also lies in harnessing CRISPR/Cas9 for editing eECMs and tuned their immunogenicity. Key inflammatory components could be turned down, leading to improved efficacy of repair in line with the immuno-engineering principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xie et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our study describes the exploitation of eECMs in a lyophilized form, thus conferring an off-the-shelf storage solution. While the lyophilization and decellularization process can affect the ECM integrity, the resulting grafting products were demonstrated to retain regenerative properties. Together with the standardization of production conferred by stable cell sources, our concept offers exciting translational opportunities. In fact, instrumental to this work is the use of dedicated hMSC lines. The genetic modification of primary cells is laborious, and their limited lifespan ex vivo challenges their selection, characterization, and exploitation for tissue engineering applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aamodt and Grainger, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Siddappa et al., 2007</xref>). Here, the MSOD-B was harnessed as an unlimited cell source with robust differentiation potential. This confers a higher standardization potential, although cell line-derived product can also be subject to batch dependency. Our study reports a limited batch-to-batch variation but a stringent characterization of cell lines capacity may be required upon substantial passage. The editing of eECMs remains tedious in part due to the limited CRISPR/Cas9 efficiency and potential off-target effects, calling for a systematic clonal selection. In addition, while large CRISPR/Cas9 screening can be performed in other stem cell systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">LaFleur et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bock et al., 2022</xref>), the critical cell mass required for effective cartilage formation affects parallelization and leads to limited throughput. Nonetheless, after the identification and characterization process, the resulting cell lines can be banked and used for unlimited tissue manufacturing.</p><p>The MSOD-B line remains the only human cell source capable of priming endochondral ossification by engineering living or cell-free grafts. This was demonstrated to be driven by the combined low dose of BMP-2 embedded in the tissue (~40 ng/tissue) together with glycosaminoglycans and other thousands of identified ECM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigeot et al., 2021</xref>). The BMP-2 amount is thus far below the typical amount used in sECMs approaches for effective osteoinduction, falling in the microgram to milligram range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pigeot et al., 2021</xref>). This is one key advantage of eECM graft, exhibiting a biological complexity that so far has not been matched by sECMs. Ideally, the two approaches are complementary as the editing of eECMs could inform on the necessary but sufficient factors driving effective regeneration. Those would in turn be embedded in a sECMs strategy and offer a fast and possibly cost-effective solution.</p><p>To conclude, the present work offers a platform for decoding factors involved in tissue regeneration and generating tailored eECM. Here, illustrated in the context of skeletal repair, our study may offer similar opportunities in other regenerative situations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSOD-B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">University/Hospital of Basel</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pigeot S, Klein T, Gullotta F, et al. doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202103737">10.1002/adma.202103737</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Parental human mesenchymal stromal/stem cell line used for eECM production</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSOD-BΔV1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSOD-B (this paper)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MSOD-BΔV1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRISPR/Cas9‐edited derivative with VEGF knockout.

After 7 days of acclimation, the rats were anesthetized using 3% isoflurane. Then, the animals were placed on a 37°C warm heating pad in prone position. Once anesthetized, isoflurane was lowered to 2– 2.5%, and buprenorphine (Temgesic, 30 μg/kg; Indivior Europe Ltd., Dublin, Ireland) was injected subcutaneously for analgesia. The right hind limb of the animal was shaved and carefully disinfected, and an incision was made along the skin and soft tissue to expose the right knee. After cleaning the knee laterally from soft tissue, patella was displaced laterally to expose the distal femur. An articular cartilage defect with 2 mm depth and 1 mm diameter was created at the trochlear groove of femur. The defect was then push-fitted with the grafts, and not secured with any sutures. The wound was closed in a layered fashion using resorbable sutures (Vicryl 45-0, Ethicon, Somerville, USA) by closing the joint capsule, followed by the muscle tissue (continuous interlaced suture), followed by closing the skin (Donati suture). Animals started load bearing immediately after surgery.

The images were acquired using a digital microscope. These images were then segmented into tiles for detailed analysis. The binary vascular masks were generated using the Q-VAT’s automated capabilities, to distinguish vascular structures within the tissue. The tool then facilitated the separation of vessel measurements based on their diameters, allowing for a differentiated quantification of macro- and microvasculature. These binary masks were then processed to calculate the vascular density, which refers to the proportion of the tissue area occupied by vessels. This quantitative metric was evaluated for each tile, and the mean vascular density was computed across all tiles for each tissue sample. As part of the analysis, we applied Q-VAT to double- or triple-stained slides to quantify the overlapping percentage of vessels, comparing various time points to observe changes over the course of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>Agarose-embedded sections were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS supplemented with 20% donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 hr at room temperature for blocking and permeabilization.

We appreciate the highlighted novelty but overall disagree with key points from the provided assessment. The most important one being non the contested in vitro cartilage and endochondral ossification by engineered ECMs, for which we have provided compelling evidence. Of note, the reviewer points the “osteogenic” properties of our tissues; the wording is incorrect since cells are absent from the final grafts. Here, the term ”osteoinductivity” should be employed, in line with the model of ectopic ossification used to demonstrate de novo bone formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the revised version, the authors presented Safranin-O staining results of pellets prior to lyophilization.

We have provided evidence of Safranin-O positivity, GAGs quantification, as well as collagen type 2 and collagen type X stainings (also quantified). Frankly, those are gold standard assays in the field and we do not understand the reviewer point of view. We however agree that our grafts are not entirely composed of cartilage matrix. There are areas where cartilage is absent, in particular in the core of the tissues. This is expected from in vitro engineered cartilage pellets even from primary BM-MSCs donors. By selecting primary donors it is possible to obtain a superior cartilage formation. Our MSOD-B cells remain to-the-best-of-our -knowledge, the only human line capable of in vitro chondrogenesis, even if considered moderate.</p><p>We agree with the absence of cells in the core area of our tissues, as correctly pointed out by the reviewer.

The modified cells showed a decrease in vascularization when VEGF1 was decreased, and suggested an increase in cartilage formation.</p><p>In another study, matrix generated by these cells subsequently remodeled into a bone marrow organ. When RUNX2 was decreased, the cells did not mineralize in vitro, and their matrices expressed types I and II collagen but not type X collagen in vitro, in comparison with unedited cells. In vivo, the author claims that remodeling of the matrices into bone was somewhat inhibited. Lastly, they utilized matrices generated by RUNX2-edited cells to regenerate chondro-osteal defects. They suggest that the edited cells regenerated cartilage in comparison with unedited cells.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The notion that inducing changes in the ECM by genetically editing the cells is a novel one, as it has long been thought that ECM composition influences cell activity.</p><p>- If successful, it may be possible to make off the shelf ECMS to carry out different types of tissue repair.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The authors have not demonstrated robust cartilage formation (quantitation would be useful).</p><p>- Measuring total GAG content does not prove the presence of cartilage</p><p>- There are numerous overstatements about forming and implanting cartilage.</p><p>- Although it is implied, RUNX2 deletion did not improve cartilage formation by the modified cells.</p><p>- In the control line, MSOD-B there were variability in the amount of safranin O positive material in various histological panels in the figures.; more quantitation is needed.</p><p>- In the in vivo articular defect experiments, an untreated injured joint is needed as a negative control.</p><p>- Statements about bone generation are often not reflective of the microCT data presented.</p><p>- The discussion over-interprets the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the further assessment of our work. We respectfully disagree with most of the provided statements. The chondrogenicity of our graft is robustly demonstrated using multiple readouts, including quantitative ones. Beyond GAGs, we provided clear Safranin-O stainings, as well as collagen type 2 and X indicating presence of hypertrophic cartilage matrix. Those are the gold standards in the field and we thus do not understand the reviewer scepticism. We do agree that our grafts are fully composed of cartilage matrix, with areas (in the core) deprived of cartilage. This does not impact the core findings of our study and its conclusions, and we strongly feel our statements about forming in vitro cartilage fully stand.</p><p>We do not claim in the manuscript an increased cartilage formation following RUNX2 deletion. We report in vitro an impaired hypertrophy (collagen type X) and maintenance of collagen type 2 and GAGs content.</p><p>We are confident on our data regarding de novo bone formation bi priming endochondral ossification, confirmed both by stainings and microCT. We feel that our claims are well-supported.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors aimed to modify the characteristics of the extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by immortalized mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by employing the CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out specific genes. Initially, they established VEGF-KO cell lines, demonstrating that these cells retained chondrogenic and angiogenic properties. Additionally, lyophilized carriage tissues produced by these cells exhibited retained osteogenic properties.</p><p>Subsequently, the authors established RUNX2-KO cell lines, which exhibited reduced COLX expression during chondrogenic differentiation and notably diminished osteogenic properties in vitro. Transplantation of lyophilized carriage tissues produced by RUNX2-KO cell lines into osteochondral defects in rat knee joints resulted in the regeneration of articular cartilage tissues as well as bone tissues, a phenomenon not observed with tissues derived from parental cells. This suggests that gene-edited MSCs represent a valuable cell source for producing ECM with enhanced quality.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The enhanced cartilage regeneration observed with ECM derived from RUNX2-KO cells supports the authors' strategy of creating gene-edited MSCs capable of producing ECM with superior quality. Immortalized cell lines offer a limitless source of off-the-shelf material for tissue regeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interest in our work. We however want to clarify that the present manuscript does not report the generation of ECM with “superior quality”, but rather of modulated composition and thus function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Most data align with anticipated outcomes, offering limited novelty to advance scientific understanding. Methodologically, the chondrogenic differentiation properties of immortalized MSCs appeared deficient, evidenced by Safranin-O staining of 3D tissues and histological findings lacking robust evidence for endochondral differentiation. This presents a critical limitation, particularly as authors propose the implantation of cartilage tissues for in vivo experiments. Instead, the bulk of data stemmed from type I collagen scaffold with factors produced by MSCs stimulated by TGFβ.</p></disp-quote><p>The chondrogenic differentiation of our MSOD-B line and their capacity of undergoing endochondral ossification has been robustly demonstrated in previous studies (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021 and Grigoryan et al., Science Translational Medicine 2022). In the present manuscript, we thus compare the chondrogenic capacity of newly established VEGF-KO and RUNX-KO lines to those of MSOD-B cells. We demonstrate by qualitative (Safranin-O staining, Collagen type 2 and Collagen type X immuno-stainings) and quantitative (glycosaminoglycans assay) assays that the generated tissues consist in cartilage grafts of similar quality than the MSOD-B counterpart. Of note, the safranin-O stainings were performed on lyophilized tissues, which can alter the staining quality/intensity. We now provide additional stainings of generated tissues pre-lyophilization. This is implemented in Figure 1D, Figure 3D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The rationale behind establishing VEGF-KO cell lines remains unclear. What specific outcomes did the authors anticipate from this modification?</p></disp-quote><p>VEGF is a known master regulator of angiogenesis and a key mediator of endochondral ossification. It has also been extensively used in bone tissue engineering studies as a supplemented factor – primarily in the form of VEGFα – to increase the vascularization and thus outcome of bone formation of engineered grafts (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01606-9">https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-020-01606-9</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328216301752">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S8756328216301752</ext-link>). In our study, it was thus identified as a natural candidate to demonstrate the possibility to generate VEGF-KO cartilage and subsequently assess the functional impact on both the angiogenic and osteogenic potential of resulting cartilage tissue. This is now clarified in the manuscript (page 3, paragraph 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Insufficient depth was given to elucidate the disparity in osteogenic properties between those observed in ectopic bone formation and those observed in transplantation into osteochondral defects. While the regeneration of articular cartilage in RUNX2-KO ECM presents intriguing results, the study lacked an exploration into underlying mechanisms, such as histological analyses at earlier time points.</p></disp-quote><p>Using RUNX2-KO ECM, we aimed at demonstrating the impact on cartilage remodeling and bone formation. This was performed ectopically but also in the rat osteochondral defect as a regenerative set-up of higher clinical relevance. We agree with the reviewer that additional experimental groups and time-points (not only earlier but also longer ones) would offer a better mechanistic understanding of the ECM contribution to the joint repair. However, as stated in our manuscript this is a proof-of-concept study that successfully demonstrated the influence of the cartilage ECM modification on the in vivo skeletal regeneration. A follow-up study would need to be performed to complement existing evidence and strengthen the relevance of our approach for cartilage repair. This is now further emphasized in the discussion (page 11, paragraph 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The manuscript submitted by Sujeethkumar et al. describes an alternative approach to skeletal tissue repair using extracellular matrix (ECM) deposited by genetically modified mesenchymal stromal/stem cells. Here, they generate a loss of function mutations in VEGF or RUNX2 in a BMP2overexpressing MSC line and define the differences in the resulting tissue-engineered constructs following seeding onto a type I collagen matrix in vitro, and following lyophilization and subcutaneous and orthotopic implantation into mice and rats. Some strengths of this manuscript are the establishment of a platform by which modifications in cell-derived ECM can be evaluated both in vitro and in vivo, the demonstration that genetic modification of cells results in complexity of in vitro cell-derived ECM that elicits quantifiable results, and the admirable goal to improve endogenous cartilage repair. However, I recommend the authors clarify their conclusions and add more information regarding reproducibility, which was one limitation of primary-cell-derived ECMs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive evaluation of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overcoming the limitations of native/autologous/allogeneic ECMs such as complete decellularization and reduction of batch-to-batch variability was not specifically addressed in the data provided herein. For the maintenance of ECM organization and complexity following lyophilization, evidence of complete decellularization was not addressed, but could be easily evaluated using polarized light microscopy and quantification of human DNA for example in constructs pre and post-lyophilization.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer comments and acknowledge the lack of information in the first version of our manuscript. In line with our previous study (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021), the ectopic evaluation of our cartilage pellets was strictly done with lyophilized tissues using immunocompromised animals. Lyophilized tissues are thus considered devitalized, and not decellularized. Instead, the osteochondral defect experiment was performed with decellularized tissues in order to be able to implant the grafts in the rat immuno-competent model. This is now specified consistently throughout the manuscript. The decellularization process is also now incorporated accordingly in the method section (page 14, paragraph 2). We also provide quantifications of GAGs and DNAs from tissue pre- and post-decellularization (Supplementary figure 6A and 6B), described in the result section of the manuscript (page 9, paragraph 1). The decellularization step led to 97-98% of DNA removal.</p><p>Importantly, we do not claim full maintenance of ECM integrity following lyophilization nor decellularization. This is now clarified in the discussion (page 12, paragraph 2). However, we report their capacity to instruct skeletal regeneration in multiple contexts despite extensive processing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be ideal to see minimization of batch-to-batch variability using this approach, as mitigation of using a sole cell line is likely not sufficient (considering that the sole cell line-derived Matrigel does exhibit batch-to-batch and manufacturer-to-manufacturer variability). I recommend adding details regarding experimental design and outcomes not initially considered. Inter- and intraexperimental reproducibility was not adequately addressed. The size of in vitro-derived cartilage pellets was not quantified, and it is not clear that more than one independent 'differentiation' was performed from each gene-edited MSC line to generate in vitro replicates and constructs that were implanted in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the comment on variability/reproducibility concern. Using a cell line does confer higher robustness but indeed does not grant unlimited consistency of batch production. We now temper our claims in the discussion and mention the need to regularly recharacterize cell lines properties upon passages (page 12, paragraph 2). Using our edited lines, we have generated multiple batches of cartilage grafts for their in vitro characterization or in vivo performance assessment. We have now compiled batch variations of GAG content and pellet volume, provided as Supplementary figure 5. This revealed that batches are indeed not identical (nor each pellets), but the production remains consistent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of descriptive language in describing conclusions may mislead the reader and should be modified accordingly throughout the manuscript. For example, although this reviewer agrees with the comparative statements made by the authors regarding parental and gene-edited MSC lines, non-quantifiable terms such as 'frank' 'superior' (example, line 242) are inappropriate and should rather be discussed in terms of significance. Another example is 'rich-collagenous matrix,' which was not substantiated by uniform immunostaining for type II collagen (line 189).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the constructive suggestions. We have revised the language accordingly throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have similar recommendations regarding conclusive statements from the rat implantation model, which was appropriately used for the purpose of evaluating the response of native skeletal cells to the different cell-derived ECMs. Interpretations of these results should be described with more accuracy. For example, increased TRAP staining does not indicate reduced active bone formation (line 237). Many would not conclude that GAGs were retained in the RUNX2-KO line graft subchondral region based on the histology. Quantification of % chondral regeneration using histology is not accurate as it is greatly influenced by the location in the defect from which the section was taken. Chondral regeneration is usually semi-quantified from gross observations of the cartilage surface immediately following excision. The statements regarding integration (example line 290) are not founded by histological evidence, which should show high magnification of the periphery of the graft adjacent to the native tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised our language relative to the TRAP staining description (page 9, paragraph 2). We also agree with the reviewer on the semi-quantitative approach of our methodology, which we transparently disclosed both in the main text (page 9, paragraph 3) and method section (page 18, paragraph 2). The sectioning location does influence the analysis, but to prevent this we performed an assessment at different depth (top, middle, bottom for each sample). This is now implemented in our method section (page 18, paragraph 3). On the tissue integration, we now provide higher magnification images of the implant/host tissue area (Figure 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors have started off using an immortalized human cell line and then geneedited it to decrease the levels of VEGF1 (in order to influence vascularization), and the levels of Runx2 (to decrease chondro/osteogenesis).

This has been assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.</p><p>We agree with the Reviewer on the key role of BMP-2 in the remodeling process into bone and bone marrow, which we have extensively described in our previous publication (Pigeot et al., Advanced Materials 2021). However, the low amount of BMP-2 (in the dozens of nanogram/tissue range) embedded in the matrix is not sufficient per se to induce ectopic endochondral ossification.

But this presupposes that they actually induced the formation of bona fide cartilage, at least.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the suggestion. However, our study did not aim at understanding what ECM graft composition work best for cartilage nor bone regeneration respectively.
