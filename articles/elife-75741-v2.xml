replication timing program. Here, using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, we showed that Yap (Yes-associated protein 1), a downstream effector of the Hippo signalling pathway, is required for the control of DNA replication dynamics. We found that Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA replication and identified Rif1, a major regulator of the DNA replication timing program, as a novel Yap binding protein. Furthermore, we show that either Yap or Rif1 depletion accelerates DNA replication dynamics by increasing the number of activated replication origins. In <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, using a Trim-Away approach during cleavage stages devoid of transcription, we found that either Yap or Rif1 depletion triggers an acceleration of cell divisions, suggesting a shorter S-phase by alterations of the replication program. Finally, our data show that Rif1 knockdown leads to defects in the partitioning of early versus late replication foci in retinal stem cells, as we previously showed for Yap. Altogether, our findings unveil a non-transcriptional role for Yap in regulating replication dynamics. We propose that Yap and Rif1 function as brakes to control the DNA replication program in early embryos and post-embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippo/yap pathway</kwd><kwd>Rif1</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>retinal stem cells</kwd><kwd>trim-away</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007391</institution-id><institution>Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name><name><surname>Bronchain</surname><given-names>Odile</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Retina France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation Valentin Haüy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UNADEV</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perron</surname><given-names>Muriel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Conacyt</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>439641</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meléndez García</surname><given-names>Rodrigo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Yap interacts with Rif1, a major DNA replication timing factor, and functions as a brake to control the DNA replication program in <italic>Xenopus</italic> early embryos and post-embryonic stem cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prior to cell division, DNA must be entirely and accurately duplicated to be transmitted to the daughter cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fragkos et al., 2015</xref>). In metazoan cells, DNA replication initiates at several thousands of fairly specific sites called replication origins in a highly orchestrated manner in time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Machida et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prioleau and MacAlpine, 2016</xref>). In late mitosis and G1 phase, origins are first ‘licensed’ for replication by loading onto chromatin the six ORC (origin recognition complex) subunits, then Cdc6 (cell-division-cycle 6) and Cdt1 (chromatin licensing and DNA replication factor 1), and finally the MCM (mini-chromosome maintenance) 2–7 helicase complex, forming the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC, for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell and Kaguni, 2013</xref>). Pre-RC is subsequently activated during S-phase by cyclin- and Dbf4/Drf1-dependent kinases (CDKs and DDKs), which leads to the recruitment of many other factors, DNA unwinding and the start of DNA synthesis at origins. In eukaryotes, segments of chromosomes replicate in a timely organized manner throughout S-phase. It is now widely accepted that the genome is partitioned into different types of genomic regions of coordinated activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchal et al., 2019</xref>). During the first half of S-phase, the early-replicating chromatin, mainly transcriptionally active and localized to central regions of the nucleus, duplicates while late replicating chromatin, spatially located at the periphery of the nucleus, awaits until the second half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berezney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hiratani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ryba et al., 2010</xref>). This pattern of DNA replication, also called DNA replication timing (RT) program, has been found to be stable, somatically heritable, cell-type specific, and associated to a cellular phenotype. As such, the RT can be considered as an epigenetic mark and provides a specific cell state signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hiratani and Gilbert, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, a defined RT has been observed at very early stages in development, prior to the mid-blastula transition (MBT), in embryonic cells (also called blastomeres) undergoing rapid cell cycle consisting of only S/M phases that are typical of animals with external development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siefert et al., 2017</xref>). Due to the absence of most transcriptional activities in these early embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newport and Kirschner, 1982</xref>), the very rapid DNA synthesis during these cleavage divisions relies only on a stockpile of maternally supplied determinants. To date, little is known about the molecular cues that ensure faithful and complete DNA replication during early embryonic cell divisions.</p><p>Very few gene knockouts have been shown to trigger alterations in the RT program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dileep et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marchal et al., 2019</xref>). Until now, the replication timing regulatory factor 1, Rif1, is one of the very few trans-acting factors whose loss of function has been found to result in major RT modifications in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). Rif1 inhibits the firing of late origins by targeting PP1 (Protein Phosphatase 1) to those origins by counteracting Cdc7/Dbf4 dependent Mcm4 phosphorylation in budding yeast and <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alver et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davé et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiraga et al., 2014</xref>) and links nuclear organization to replication timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gnan et al., 2021</xref>). We previously identified Yap as another factor implicated in RT control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>). Yap is a downstream effector of the Hippo signalling pathway. It was initially identified as a primary regulator of organ growth due to its action on embryonic progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lian et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ramos and Camargo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Yap is mostly known to exert its function as a transcriptional co-activator acting via binding to the TEADs (transcriptional enhanced associated domain transcription factors) to control transcriptional programs involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Totaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>). We previously found that <italic>yap</italic> is specifically expressed in neural stem cells in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> retina and that its knockdown in these cells leads to an altered RT program, associated with a dramatic S-phase shortening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether Yap is directly involved in DNA replication dynamics and whether it could regulate DNA replication during early embryonic divisions in the absence of transcription remained to be investigated.</p><p>We first addressed this question by taking advantage of <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, a cell-free system that faithfully recapitulates all steps of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blow and Laskey, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blow and Laskey, 1986</xref>). We and others previously found that in this system activated replication origins are spaced 5–15 kb apart and clustered in early- and late-firing groups of origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Herrick et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marheineke and Hyrien, 2004</xref>). Here, we found that Yap is recruited onto chromatin at the onset of DNA replication in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts in a manner that is dependent on the pre-RC formation. We also showed that Yap and Rif1 co-immunoprecipitated. Furthermore, Yap depletion altered replication dynamics by increasing the number of activated origins similarly to Rif1 depletion. As previously shown in vivo for <italic>yap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>), we found that <italic>rif1</italic> is expressed in retinal stem and early progenitor cells and involved in their RT signature. Finally, targeted protein depletion at early stages of embryonic development using a Trim-Away strategy, revealed the crucial role of both Yap and Rif1 in controlling the speed of cell divisions before MBT in vivo. Altogether, our findings unveiled Yap implication in the regulation of replication origin activation and identified Rif1 as a novel partner. We propose that Yap, like Rif1, acts as a brake during replication to control the DNA replication program in early embryos and post-embryonic retinal stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yap is recruited to chromatin in a pre-RC-dependent manner in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts</title><p>Since Yap was described as a co-transcriptional factor, we wondered whether Yap was present in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts that are almost devoid of transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Shechter, 2016</xref>). By quantitative western blot, we found that Yap is present in S-phase egg extracts at a concentration of 11 ng/µl (169 nM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore further investigated the role of Yap during S-phase in this well-characterized in vitro replication system, where upon addition of sperm DNA to egg extracts, chromatin is assembled, replication proteins are imported, recruited on chromatin and nuclei synchronously start DNA replication. Thus, this in vitro system mimics the first embryonic S-phase. To know whether Yap interacts with chromatin during S-phase, we incubated sperm nuclei in egg extracts and collected purified chromatin fractions starting from pre-RC assembly up to ongoing DNA replication. This analysis revealed that Yap recruitment onto chromatin coincided with the loading of PCNA, an indicator of the recruitment of DNA polymerases and the start of DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Yap accumulation continues throughout S-phase progression. Our results also showed that Yap is recruited to chromatin after the MCM complex (Mcm2, Mcm7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To address whether the recruitment of Yap could be dependent on pre-RC assembly on chromatin, we added to the egg extracts recombinant geminin, an inhibitor of Cdt1 necessary for MCM loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGarry and Kirschner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tada et al., 2001</xref>). As a result, the binding of Yap on chromatin was severely delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Thus, Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA replication and its recruitment is dependent on functional pre-RC assembly in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extract system.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Yap is recruited to chromatin during DNA replication and the absence of Yap accelerates DNA synthesis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sperm nuclei were incubated in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts in the absence (Control) or presence of geminin (+Gem).

We were able to efficiently remove Yap from egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We then used those Yap-depleted (ΔYap) or Mock-depleted (ΔMock) egg extracts to directly visualize DNA synthesis by fluorescence microscopy after incubating sperm nuclei in the presence of rhodamine-dUTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Quantification of rhodamine fluorescence per nucleus after Yap depletion showed a significant increase in fluorescence intensity compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; mean increase of 1.5-fold in six independent experiments), whereas the number of rhodamine positive nuclei was very similar (98.8% in Mock- versus 100% in Yap-depleted extract). This suggests that Yap depletion increases DNA synthesis. We next monitored DNA replication by following <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation into DNA. Replication reactions in Mock- or Yap-depleted extracts were stopped at various time points during S-phase and accurate <sup>32</sup>P-incorporation into total DNA was measured by scintillation counting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>). We found in three independent experiments that Yap depletion increased absolute DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). To better visualize and characterize the replication dynamics, we also quantified nascent strand progression during S-phase after <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation using alkaline electrophoresis (see one out of eight experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To analyse these different experiments together, we defined four different intervals of percentages of incorporation, reflecting early (from 0% to 25% incorporation), mid (from 26% to 50%), late (from 51% to 75%), and very late (from 76 to 100%) S-phase. We then calculated the ratio of <sup>32</sup>P- incorporation between Yap- and Mock-depleted extracts for each interval. We found that Yap depletion increased DNA synthesis by an average of 1.8-fold during early S-phase, 1.7-fold during mid S-phase, 1.6-fold during late S-phase, and 1.2-fold during very late S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This increase in DNA replication after Yap depletion could result from an earlier entry into S-phase, because of a more rapid chromatin assembly, rather than an effect on DNA replication itself. However, we were able to rule out this hypothesis using our nascent strands analysis since at the very early S-phase we did not observe any precocious start of DNA synthesis after Yap depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Altogether, we found that Yap depletion leads to accelerated DNA synthesis, mainly during the early to mid-stages of S-phase, demonstrating that Yap negatively regulates the progression of DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Yap depletion increases replication origin firing</title><p>The higher rate of DNA synthesis observed in the absence of Yap could result from either an increase in origin firing, an increase in fork speed, or both. To directly monitor origin activation on single DNA molecules, we performed DNA combing experiments in Mock- and Yap-depleted extracts, and determined the replication content, fork density, distances between replication eyes and eye lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). After Yap depletion, DNA replication significantly increased during early and mid S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>; mean increase of 2.5 times), consistent with the quantification of <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>. Moreover, Yap depletion significantly increased the density of active replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>; mean increase of 1.8 times), demonstrating that the absence of Yap leads to an increase in activated replication origins. In parallel, we observed a significant decrease in eye-to-eye distances (ETED; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The increase in the overall fork density was more pronounced than the decrease in distances between neighbouring origins analysed at all time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This observation highlights a role for Yap in regulating origins activation inside not-yet-active groups that replicate later. Replication eye lengths (EL) were not significantly different after Yap depletion at very early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that fork speed remained unchanged. Larger eye sizes detected at later time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) are most probably due to fusions of eyes from neighbouring origins due to increased origin activation after Yap depletion since we were not able to detect larger nascent strands in Yap depleted extracts during very early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To further confirm the role of Yap in regulating origin activation, we analysed chromatin-bound replication proteins from Mock- and Yap-depleted replication reactions in early S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). We found that the initiation factor Cdc45 and elongation factor PCNA, both associated with active replication forks, were specifically enriched on chromatin after Yap depletion, consistent with an increase of active replication forks. Altogether, we conclude that Yap depletion leads to an increase in origin activation, suggesting that Yap plays a key role in limiting origin firing during DNA replication.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Egg extracts lacking Yap exhibit more active replication origins.</title><p>Sperm nuclei were incubated in egg extracts in the presence of biotin-dUTP and DNA combing was performed.

However, how replication dynamics changes after Rif1 depletion in this system has not been explored. To address this and to directly compare the effects of Rif1 depletion to Yap depletion, we immunodepleted Rif1 from egg extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and followed DNA replication after the incorporation of rhodamine dUTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that, as for Yap depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), rhodamine intensity was increased after Rif1 depletion, but to a higher degree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). Next, we analysed origin activation after Rif1 depletion by DNA combing. We incubated sperm nuclei in the presence of biotin-dUTP for different times spanning very early to mid S-phase and isolated DNA for fiber analysis in two independent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found that Rif1 depletion strongly increased mean DNA synthesis and fork density compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). We further noticed that these effects were more pronounced in early S-phase compared to mid S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, ΔRif1/ΔMock ratios). Therefore, Rif1 depletion led to a large increase in origin activation, especially during early S-phase. Since the percentage of unreplicated fibers decreases after Rif1 depletion compared to the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), this strongly suggests that the mean 3-fold increase in active forks we observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) is mostly due to origin activation in not-yet-activated replication clusters. We thus found that the effects of Rif1 and Yap depletions on replication dynamics are qualitatively similar since both depletions led to an early increase of entire replication cluster activations. Quantitatively, however, the mean increase of replicated fractions and fork densities were more important after Rif1 depletion (4.6-fold and 3-fold respectively), especially in early S-phase, than after Yap depletion (2.5-fold and 1.8-fold, respectively). Taken together, we conclude that Yap and Rif1 regulate replication dynamics in a similar way, likely operating through overlapping mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Rif1 depletion increases global fork density in egg extracts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of egg extracts after Mock- or Rif1-depletion using the indicated antibodies.

Indeed, during early development prior to the mid-blastula transition (MBT, stage 8), cells divide very rapidly, rather synchronously for a series of 12 divisions and present a cell cycle structure without gap phases. As a result, variations of the number of cells at a given time during this developmental period reflect alteration of the time spent in the S and M phases. We thus decided to deplete Yap from embryos and assess the outcomes on the rate of embryonic cell division. Since Yap protein is maternally expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we employed the recently developed Trim-Away technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clift et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clift et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weir et al., 2021</xref>) to directly trigger in vivo the degradation of Yap protein stockpile. The Trim-Away-mediated knockdown has previously been shown to be effective in <italic>Xenopus</italic> for another target using Trim21 mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weir et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we decided to use the Trim21 protein instead, to prevent delays inherent in the translation process. In addition, since we observed an increase in the level of Yap protein before MBT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we combined the Trim-Away approach with injections of <italic>yap</italic> translation blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) to prevent de novo protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We found that Yap degradation was effective from the eight-cell stage onwards using the Trim-Away approach and that the combined strategy (Trim-Away + MO) led to a stronger and prolonged Yap depletion from the eight-cell stage onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then monitored the progression of cell division before MBT. We found that Yap-depleted embryos have smaller and more numerous cells compared to controls at stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Yap-depleted). Conversely, embryos injected with <italic>yap</italic> mRNA (gain of function) have larger and less numerous cells than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, GOF). Importantly, the phenotype obtained after Yap-depletion was restored upon co-injection with MO-resistant <italic>yap</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, see rescue), demonstrating specificity. Of note, the severe abnormalities observed upon Yap-depletion at the neurula stage were also rescued, further supporting the specificity of our depletion strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Short pulse labelling experiments indeed allow the visualization of replication foci in nuclei. The spatial distribution of these foci evolves in a stereotyped manner during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>): from numerous small foci located throughout the nucleus in early S-phase, to few large punctuated ones in mid/late S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koberna et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Dierendonck et al., 1989</xref>).

To date, very few factors involved in the orchestration of this program have been identified. We have previously revealed that <italic>yap</italic> knockdown is associated with an altered RT program in <italic>Xenopus</italic> retinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>). Whether and how Yap could directly regulate DNA replication was however unknown. Here, we used the <italic>Xenopus</italic> in vitro replication system and early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos, where DNA transcription is absent, to study the role of Yap in S-phase, independently from its transcriptional function. Our study shows that Yap regulates DNA replication dynamics in these embryonic systems. First, we found that Yap is recruited to chromatin at the start of DNA synthesis, and this is dependent on the pre-replication complex assembly. Second, our data revealed a non-transcriptional role for Yap in the initiation of DNA replication. Third, we identified Rif1, a global regulator of the RT program, as a novel Yap partner. Finally, our in vitro and in vivo data suggest that Yap and Rif1 are similarly involved in both DNA replication dynamics and the spatial organization of DNA replication foci. We propose a model in which Yap and Rif1 would limit replication origin firing and as such act as brakes during S-phase to control the DNA replication program in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos and retinal stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Diagram illustrating Yap function in the control of DNA replication dynamics.</title><p>We found that Yap and Rif1 can interact (<bold>A</bold>) and are co-expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> early embryos as well as in retinal stem (RSC)/progenitor cells (P1) (<bold>B</bold>).

(<bold>D</bold>) We propose a model where Yap and Rif1 would ensure the proper orchestration of the RT program during early development. The schematic representation of the replication program was adapted from Gaboriaud J and Wu PJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaboriaud and Wu, 2019</xref>). Based on our assays in vitro in egg extracts and in vivo in early embryos, we propose that following Yap depletion (bottom panel), the number of firing origins is increased, and S-phase length is reduced compared to a wild-type situation (top panel).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75741-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The molecular control of the RT program remains elusive. Regarding key factors, Rif1 was the first mammalian factor shown to temporally control DNA replication, acting negatively on origin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cornacchia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yamazaki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). This function of Rif1 depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davé et al., 2014</xref>), which counteracts the DDK dependent activation of MCM2-7. On the other hand, Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) positively controls replication origin firing by negatively regulating Rif1-PP1 interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciardo et al., 2021b</xref>). Here, we found that Yap is a novel key component of this molecular machinery that regulates replication origin activation. First, we found that Yap and Rif1 physically interact. Whether this interaction could impact Rif1-PP1 association remains to be determined. Interestingly, it has previously been shown that PP1 interacts with and dephosphorylates Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting the potential existence of a Yap-Rif1-PP1 multi-protein complex. Second, we found that Yap depletion leads to defects in DNA replication dynamics similar to those obtained following Rif1 depletion in egg extracts. Finally, we also observed similar phenotypes following <italic>rif1</italic> or <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown in <italic>Xenopus</italic> early embryos (i.e. increase in cell cycle speed) and in retinal stem cells (i.e. increase in early-like replication foci patterns). It is thus tempting to speculate that Rif1 and Yap act in concert to regulate replication dynamics.</p><p>We observed that Yap is recruited to replication competent chromatin at the start of S-phase then accumulates over S-phase, consistent with a direct role in DNA replication regulation. This dynamic behaviour is similar to the observed increase of chromatin bound Rif1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kumar et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that Yap loading on chromatin depends on functional pre-RC assembly or DNA replication per se, since inhibition of pre-RC assembly also inhibits S-phase entry. We however do not know how Yap is recruited to chromatin in the first place since our proteomic analysis did not reveal a direct interaction with any members of the pre-RC complex. Therefore, Yap might be recruited by proteins involved in steps downstream of pre-RC assembly. We found that the increased rate in DNA synthesis after Yap depletion is due to an increase in replication origin activation, especially early in S-phase, strongly suggesting that Yap directly limits origin firing. Whether it prevents late origin firing in early S-phase cells or whether it inhibits dormant origin firing around active replication forks remains to be investigated. However, the increase in early-like foci patterns at the expense of late-like ones in retinal stem cells observed upon <italic>yap</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabochette et al., 2015</xref>) or <italic>rif1</italic> knockdown (this study) rather suggests an impact on the partition between early and late replication-firing. In Rif1-depleted Hela cells, the overall replication foci were similarly found to be extensively rearranged, with cells displaying predominantly early S-phase-like patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamazaki et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, our DNA combing analysis after Yap depletion demonstrated that the overall fork density was increased to a higher extent than local origin distances were decreased. This suggests that Yap controls origin firing more at the level of groups of origins, or replication clusters, than at the level of single origins, therefore regulating the temporal control of origin activation. Similarly, we found that in Rif1-depleted egg extracts, origin activation was more increased in early S-phase compared to mid S-phase, which points toward a role of Rif1 as a replication timing factor also in early <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. Although Rif1 seems to inhibit late origin activation to a greater extent than Yap, their physical interaction and the qualitatively similar effect on fork density suggests that Rif1 and Yap act in at least partially overlapping mechanisms.</p><p>In embryos, the increased speed of cell division during early embryonic cleavage cycles that we observed upon <italic>yap</italic> or <italic>rif1</italic> knockdown is consistent with a function of both factors in limiting the replication of late genomic regions, leading to a slowing down of S-phase. In retinal stem cells, however, Yap and Rif1 do not seem to function similarly on the cell cycle kinetics. Indeed, although knockdown phenotypes were similar in terms of early-late foci ratio regulation, only <italic>Yap</italic> knockdown led to a significant change in the proportion of S-phase cells among stem and progenitor cells (i.e. number of EdU + cells at the tip of the CMZ). How cell cycle kinetics is differentially regulated in both cases remains to be investigated. It is well known that Yap also transcriptionally regulates cell cycle genes, which may contribute to such different outcomes. Interestingly, among direct targets genes regulated by Yap, there are also essential factors involved in replication licensing, DNA synthesis and repair (e.g. <italic>CDC6</italic>, <italic>GINS1</italic>, <italic>MCM3</italic>, <italic>MCM7</italic>, <italic>POLA2</italic>, <italic>POLE3</italic>, <italic>TOP2A,</italic> and <italic>RAD18</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zanconato et al., 2015</xref>). Yap may thus likely impact replication dynamics at both the transcriptional and non-transcriptional levels in retinal stem cells.</p><p>Combined observations point to a role for Rif1 in higher order chromatin architecture and its relationship with the RT program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foti et al., 2016</xref>). Rif1 localizes to late-replicating sites of chromatin and acts as a remodeler of the three-dimensional (3D) genome organization and as such defines and restricts the interactions between replication-timing domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foti et al., 2016</xref>). Although the RT program can be established independently of the spatial distribution of replication foci, nuclear organization and RT are correlated and Rif1 is central in co-regulating both processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gnan et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, it should be noted that the depletion of Rif1 from egg extracts strongly increases the activation of entire replication clusters in early S-phase and this, within a system that was presumed to be physiologically at its maximum initiation rate. This raises the question of whether part of the structural role of Rif1 would be to limit the accessibility of replication factors to chromatin resulting in the observed temporal replication program. Whether Yap function in DNA replication could be linked to a role as an organizer of nuclear architecture, similar to Rif1, would thus be interesting to assess in the future. Recent studies invoke liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in the establishment of chromatin activity and the formation of chromatin compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rippe, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, Yap has been described to form liquid-like condensates in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2019</xref>). Whether higher level replication organization is impacted by LLPS is currently unknown, but several members of the pre-RC complex (Orc1, Cdc6, Cdt1) are also able to induce DNA dependent LLPS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Parker et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Not much is known about signalling pathways regulating the RT program or Rif1 activity. The ATM/53BP1 signalling pathway has been identified upstream of the RT and relays information onto Rif1 activity in response to DNA double-strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kumar and Cheok, 2014</xref>). Future work will be required to assess whether Yap activity in the context of DNA replication is regulated by the Hippo pathway. Interestingly, LATS1, another component of the Hippo pathway, has been involved in the ATR-mediated response to replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pefani et al., 2014</xref>). Several Hippo pathway components may thus regulate, independently or in concert, replication dynamics.</p><p>The role of Yap and Rif1 in the regulation of the RT program in early embryos opens new questions regarding the dynamics of RT changes during development. Although it was previously thought that the spatio-temporal replication program is not established until the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyrien et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sasaki et al., 1999</xref>), it was also demonstrated that the oocyte-type of 5S RNA genes replicate later than the somatic-types of 5S RNA genes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wolffe, 1993</xref>). It was then shown that the RT program in <italic>Xenopus</italic> in vitro system is not completely random, with large chromosomal domains being replicated in a reproducible manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labit et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, in zebrafish embryos, a genome-wide approach clearly established that a compressed, yet defined, RT program is evident before the MBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siefert et al., 2017</xref>). Further on, it was recently demonstrated that the replication program is regulated at the level of large domains by the replication checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciardo et al., 2021a</xref>) and by polo-like kinase 1 via the inhibition of Rif1/PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ciardo et al., 2021b</xref>). Altogether, those findings strongly suggest the existence of an embryonic RT program before the MBT. Remarkably, gradual changes in the RT program occur from the MBT and throughout development. The molecular control behind this dynamic is unknown. How Yap and Rif1 functions evolve at different stages and impact changes in the RT program at this important transition is therefore an interesting issue to be addressed in the future. To do so, the new combination of tools implemented in this study will be very valuable, as we have proven the efficient depletion of maternal proteins stockpiles while preventing their de novo synthesis by combining the Trim-Away technique with MO injections before MBT. In this context, <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos seem particularly suitable to shed light and dissect the molecular mechanisms at work during embryogenesis that underlie RT changes. Identifying and characterizing the factors controlling these changes during development will certainly have an impact on how we approach questions related to cellular reprogramming, stem cells and cancer biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human MCM2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bethyl lab, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# A300-191<break/>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_162709">AB_162709</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-<italic>Xenopus</italic> MCM7 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gift from R.

At each time point, 20 µl aliquots were diluted in 500 µl PBS and fixed by the addition of 500 µl paraformaldehyde 8%. Nuclei were spun onto coverslips through 1 ml of 20% sucrose cushion in PBS, and counterstained with Hoechst 33,258 as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jackson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Labit et al., 2008</xref>). Coverslips were imaged for Hoechst and rhodamine using Olympus BX63 fluorescence microscope to quantify the extent of the rhodamine-dUTP incorporation into DNA. Using Analyze Particles of the Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), areas of Hoechst stained nuclei were saved as ROI (region of interest). The rhodamine staining intensity of each ROI was measured as well as the background of each slide. For each nuclei, Corrected Total Fluorescence (CTF) was calculated using the following equations: CTF = Integrated Density of selected nuclei - (Area of selected nuclei X Mean fluorescence of background) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gavet and Pines, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Bulk DNA synthesis and alkaline agarose gel electrophoresis</title><p>Sperm nuclei (2000 nuclei/µl) were incubated in Mock or Yap depleted extracts and one-fiftieth volume of [α-<sup>32</sup>P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) and reactions were stopped at indicated time points. DNA was recovered after DNAzol treatment (Invitrogen protocol) followed by ethanol precipitation and specific incorporation was measured in cpm in a liquid scintillation analyzer (Tri-Carb4910 TR, Perkin Elmer). Total DNA synthesis (ng/µl) was calculated as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gillespie et al., 2012</xref>). For nascent strand analysis, DNA was separated on 1.1% alkaline agarose gels, and analysed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marheineke and Hyrien, 2001</xref>). From one extract to another, the replication extent (percent of replication) differs at a specific time point, because each egg extract replicates nuclei with its own replication kinetics. To compare different independent experiments performed using different egg extracts, the data points of each sample were normalized to maximum incorporation value. To include statistics, the scaled data points were grouped into 4 bins (0–25%=early; 26–50%=mid; 51–75%=late; 76–100%=very late S phase); mean and standard deviation were calculated for each bin and a Wilcoxon signed ranked test was used to assess statistically significant differences between the data in each bin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blot</title><p>For analysis of chromatin-bound proteins, we used a protocol slightly modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Räschle et al., 2008</xref>.

Chromatin was recovered through a 500 mM sucrose cushion in ELB buffer at 6780 g for 50 s at 4 °C, washed twice with 200 µl of 250 mM sucrose in ELB buffer, and resuspended in 20 µl SDS sample buffer. Western blots were conducted using standard procedures on <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo/tadpole protein extracts. Proteins were loaded, separated by 7.5%, 12%, or 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred into nitrocellulose or ImmobilonP membranes. Membranes were subsequently incubated with the indicated primary antibodies followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-labelled antibodies (1/10,000, Sigma-Aldrich or GE Healthcare, see Key Resources Table). Immunodetection was performed using Super Signal West Pico or Femto Chemiluminescence Kit (Pierce).

Biotin was detected with AlexaFluor594 conjugated streptavidin followed by anti-avidin biotinylated antibodies. This was repeated twice, then followed by mouse anti-human ssDNA antibody, AlexaFluor488 rabbit anti-mouse, and AlexaFluor488 goat anti-rabbit for enhancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gaggioli et al., 2013</xref>). Images of the combed DNA molecules were acquired and measured as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marheineke et al., 2009</xref>). The fields of view were chosen at random. Several hundred of DNA fibers were analysed for each experiment. Measurements on each molecule were made using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) and compiled using macros in Microsoft Excel. Replication eyes were defined as the incorporation tracks of biotin–dUTP. Replication eyes were considered to be the products of two replication forks, incorporation tracks at the extremities of DNA fibers were considered to be the products of one replication fork. Tracts of biotin-labelled DNA needed to be at least 1 kb to be considered significant and scored as eyes. When the label was discontinuous, the tract of unlabelled DNA needed to be at least 1 kb to be considered a real gap. The replication extent was determined as the sum of eye lengths divided by the total DNA length. Fork density was calculated as the total DNA divided by the total number of forks. The midpoints of replication eyes were defined as the origins of replication. Eye-to-eye distances (ETED), also known as inter-origin distances, were measured between the midpoints of adjacent replication eyes. Incorporation tracks at the extremities of DNA fibers were not regarded as replication eyes but were included in the determination of the replication extent or replicated fraction, calculated as the sum of all eye lengths (EL) divided by total DNA. Scatter plots of ETED and EL were obtained using GraphPad version 6.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A non-transcriptional function of Yap orchestrates the DNA replication program&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The quantification of the amount of YAP in Figure 1B is confusing. The legend of the chart states &quot;Control in light grey and presence of geminin in black&quot;, but the bar colors are of different shades of grey. It is not clear how to evaluate them. The graph should be improved by properly labeling the legend of the figure or, simply, by showing the relative amount of YAP intensity values relative to a loading control like H3, normalized to the 90 min control condition.</p><p>The higher rate of DNA synthesis observed in the absence of Yap in Figure 1D is not very evident from the gels in Figure 1- supplement 3B. The timing of the experiments is continuously changing throughout the figures. It is therefore difficult to compare them. Also, comparisons across different gels are difficult to interpret.</p><p>Most importantly, relative quantification on gel images cannot support the claim of increased DNA synthesis in the absence of YAP. To accurately quantify the replication of DNA added to the extract, the total amount of DNA synthesized must be quantified. This can be easily done by counting labeled nucleotide incorporation on precipitated DNA (TCA replication assay and other methods have been described by Mechali and Blow labs; see Gillespie et al., Methods Volume 57, Issue 2, June 2012, Pages 203-213). Without these data, the central claim of the paper is meaningless.</p><p>It is necessary to analyze the dynamics and the abundance of chromatin-bound replication proteins associated with the active replication fork after Yap depletion using chromatin binding assays. This would further confirm the increase in the fork density observed by DNA combing experiments.</p><p>2) Why are only 2 replicates instead of 3 provided in Figure 2? This is especially true for the conclusion that eye length is unaltered -it appears that there is a subset of eye length that is increased in 2F, which might reach significance if triplicates were performed.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that YAP and RIF1 work together, – it would be interesting to co-deplete YAP and RIF1. If YAP works solely through Rif1, it should not be more effective than loss of YAP alone.</p><p>Does loss of RIF1 affect YAP loading onto chromatin?</p><p>The efficiency of depletion for both RIF1 and YAP is different in Figure 4B and Figure 4A, supplement 1. Moreover, the combined use of the TRIM-away approach with injections of MO led to a stronger and prolonged YAP depletion but also triggered toxicity in the tadpoles, which display severe abnormalities. Therefore, the outcomes of these procedures are unlikely to be specific, unless the authors can provide a rescue experiment. Quantitation of the Western blots in panel A of Figure 4 supplement 1 is needed to be convincing that trim away and morpholino combined are more effective.</p><p>4) It is difficult to see the points the authors wish to communicate in Figure 6. If the authors add yellow and red arrows in B to C and D, this might make it clearer. There is almost no EdU in the YAP-MO -does this affect the ability to recognize the different patterns in this region of the eye?</p><p>5) The title of the manuscript is &quot;A non-transcriptional function of YAP orchestrates the DNA replication program&quot;. It is not clear that YAP &quot;orchestrates&quot; DNA replication – for this to be true, it would have to be signal responsive. Since the authors did not reveal any links to YAP activity (such as YAP phosphorylation or nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution) it is not &quot;orchestrating&quot; DNA replication. Please adjust the title accordingly and also provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation.</p><p>6) Statistics</p><p>Please indicate the statistical test in the legend of Figures 1B, 2E-F, 5C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75741.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The quantification of the amount of YAP in Figure 1B is confusing.

We think that it is important for the readers to visualize and to be able to compare the length of nascent strains between Mock- and Yap-depleted extracts, which is also a proof of experimental quality of the DNA synthesis in vitro, which is not visible in absolute quantification after scintillation counting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The timing of the experiments is continuously changing throughout the figures.

To overcome this problem and to compare different independent experiments performed using different egg extracts, the data points of each sample were normalized to maximum incorporation value.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most importantly, relative quantification on gel images cannot support the claim of increased DNA synthesis in the absence of YAP.

Without these data, the central claim of the paper is meaningless.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we do not agree that relative quantification on gel images cannot support the claim of increased DNA synthesis in the absence of Yap, we thank the reviewer for his suggestion since we now provide additional data clearly strengthening our conclusion.</p><p>Many studies, published in high standards journals and coming from different <italic>Xenopus</italic> replication laboratories have quantified DNA synthesised after <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation followed by separation by agarose gel electrophoresis using percentage of maximal incorporation or arbitrary units (Shechter <italic>et al.,</italic> 2004; Trenz <italic>et al.,</italic> 2008; Guo <italic>et al.,</italic> 2015; Walter and Newport, 1997; Suski et al., 2022, Nature). Nevertheless, as the referee suggested, we quantified the total amount of DNA synthesized in three new independent experiments. These new results, presented page 5, lines 34-39 and shown in Figure 1G, support our conclusion, as they also show that Yap depletion increases total DNA synthesis. Please note that the DNA combing results presented in Figure 2 already showed that replication is increased after Yap depletion when quantifying total replication percentages of all combed DNA. Finally, we also added another set of experiments to Figure 1 to further confirm these findings. We used the incorporation of rhodamine-dUTP followed by the quantification of the fluorescence intensity within nuclei. This nuclei-fluorescence based method is frequently used in proliferation assays to assess nucleotide incorporation resulting from the DNA replication process in other organisms. Our new results demonstrate that DNA synthesis is increased 1.5-fold in six biological replicates and represent a third independent method, in addition to DNA combing and <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP incorporation, showing that DNA synthesis is increased upon YAP depletion. These new results are now presented page 5, lines 2734 and shown in Figure 1D-F.</p><p>Considering all these additional data, we had to move and replace the alkaline gel from the original Figure 1D to Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is necessary to analyze the dynamics and the abundance of chromatin-bound replication proteins associated with the active replication fork after Yap depletion using chromatin binding assays. This would further confirm the increase in the fork density observed by DNA combing experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this suggestion and we added a western blot of chromatin bound proteins after Yap depletion. This shows that two replication proteins associated with the active replication fork, namely Cdc45 and PCNA, are enriched after Yap depletion compared to the control at the beginning of S-phase. This observation further supports the DNA combing results showing that more forks are active after YAP depletion. This new data is now presented page 6, lines 25-32 and displayed in Figure 2H.</p><p>We would like to stress here that with these additional methods added to the revised version, five different methods in total (Rhodamine-dUTP incorporation/nucleus, 32P-dCTP incorporation – total synthesis, 32P-dCTP incorporation – nascent strand analysis, DNA combing, western blotting for replication fork proteins) show that DNA synthesis and origin activation is increased after Yap depletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why are only 2 replicates instead of 3 provided in Figure 2?</p></disp-quote><p>Answer: We apologize for this confusing presentation. In Figure 2A, three fibers were shown as visual examples illustrating the results of this experiment (and not one fiber per replicate). We have two replicates with two different time points, as stated in the text each, and shown in the tables. We modified the legend of the figure to make this clearer<italic>.</italic></p><p>We also changed the fibers images (Figure 2A) to better illustrate the data set (see point below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is especially true for the conclusion that eye length is unaltered -it appears that there is a subset of eye length that is increased in 2F, which might reach significance if triplicates were performed.</p></disp-quote><p>The scatter plot in Figure 2F makes it look like that there are more eyes with larger sizes after Yap depletion, but please note that there are also more EL measured as stated in the legend (ΔMock n=182 versus ΔYap n=311). To highlight this important parameter, we added these numbers below the scatter plot in the revised Figure 2F, as we have done consistently for all of the experiments presented in the revised Figures. The means of these two EL distributions are indeed numerically different but since both distributions are not Gaussian (d'Agostino and Pearson test), only non-parametric tests can apply (Mann-Whitney or Kolmogorov Smirnow test). The results of the two non-parametric tests showed that the distributions are not significantly different as mentioned in the legend. However, we cannot rule out that after Yap depletion, some larger eyes may arise from fusions of forks or from a higher fork speed, but again, the tests applied to a high number of measurements show no significant statistical differences. For later time points, this issue is discussed in the original manuscript p9 and still now in the revised manuscript page 6, line 22-25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that YAP and RIF1 work together, – it would be interesting to co-deplete YAP and RIF1. If YAP works solely through Rif1, it should not be more effective than loss of YAP alone.</p></disp-quote><p>Double immunodepletions are technically very challenging. We did not manage to efficiently co-deplete Yap and Rif1 from egg extracts while maintaining a sufficient replication efficiency. We did however directly compare the effects of YAP depletion to those of Rif1 depletion alone. As for Yap depletion, we first quantified rhodamine-dUTP incorporation after Rif1 depletion by direct fluorescence microscopy that demonstrated a clear increase of DNA synthesis, consistent with Alver et al., 2017. Second, we performed 2 independent DNA combing experiments after Rif1 depletion with a large number of fibers analyzed (total 10 000) in egg extracts that show a marked increase in DNA replication and fork density like those seen after Yap depletion, spanning from very early to mid Sphase. Please note that this is also the first replication kinetics analysis by DNA combing after Rif1 depletion in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> in vitro system which clearly shows that Rif1 depletion leads to a strong increase of origin activation during early S-phase. We therefore found that Rif1 depletion and Yap depletion qualitatively show the same main effects: an increase of DNA synthesis and fork density, that are more pronounced in early S-phase. We also noticed quantitative differences in the direct fluorescence after rhodamine incorporation of whole nuclei and fork density, with stronger effects after Rif1 depletion compared to Yap depletion. This suggests that there might be an additional mechanism for Rif1 in regulating origin activation. These new data, presented page 7, lines 4-29, have been added in the form of an entire new Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Does loss of RIF1 affect YAP loading onto chromatin?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for this interesting question, which we addressed already after the preprint deposition of our manuscript on BioRxiv upon a request of a reader. We could not observe any major changes in Yap chromatin recruitment after Rif1 depletion nor the reverse in our conditions (Figure 1). However, since after Rif1 depletion we can still detect some residual Rif1 left on chromatin, we cannot completely exclude that this residual Rif1 is sufficient to recruit Yap. We were unable to further improve Rif1 depletion without severely compromising the replication capacity of the Rif1depleted egg extract. This difficulty could be explained by the abundance of Rif1 and/or its binding to insoluble nuclear structure. Since the result is not 100 % conclusive for us to be published, we prefer not to include it into the manuscript and we show the blots for information to the referees, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Rif1 depletion (A) or Yap depletion (B) does not inhibit Yap or Rif1 recruitment, respectively, onto chromatin in egg extracts.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75741-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The efficiency of depletion for both RIF1 and YAP is different in Figure 4B and Figure 4A, supplement 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that the efficiency of depletion is different in both figures. This is explained by the fact that the extent of the depletion varies from experiment to experiment. We work with different batches of in vitro fertilized embryos and extracts, so these differences simply reflect the technical/biological variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, the combined use of the TRIM-away approach with injections of MO led to a stronger and prolonged YAP depletion but also triggered toxicity in the tadpoles, which display severe abnormalities. Therefore, the outcomes of these procedures are unlikely to be specific, unless the authors can provide a rescue experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to point out that abnormal development is not always attributable to a toxic effect. Many losses of gene function result in malformations without being ascribed to toxicity or unspecific effects. However, we agree with the reviewers on the need to present a rescue experiment, which is now shown in new Figure 5C and new Figure 5—figure supplement 1B. In addition, we also provide gain-of-function (GOF), data for YAP in early embryos. In brief, we find that the Yap GOF leads to opposite outcomes than those of its depletion with embryos at the same stage of development, having fewer and larger cells than the control. Furthermore, we show that the effects of Yap depletion, i.e. embryos with more and smaller cells than the control at the same developmental stage, are rescued by the addition of mRNA encoding Yap to restore the protein level. This is true for both embryonic divisions (new Figure 5C) and development, as we obtained normal-looking neurula after Yap rescue (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). Overall, these data now clearly show that Yap is both sufficient and necessary to maintain the rate of embryonic divisions and that this phenotype is specific since it can be rescued by expressing Yap alone. These new data are presented pages 8, lines 2-10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantitation of the Western blots in panel A of Figure 4 supplement 1 is needed to be convincing that trim away and morpholino combined are more effective.</p></disp-quote><p>The quantification is now presented in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A. At the 2 -cell stage, we observe some fluctuations in the amounts of Yap between samples, the origin of which we do not fully understand. At the 4-cell stage, a reduction in Yap is observed regardless of the depletion strategy used. It is from the 8-cell stage onwards that differential effects between the depletion methods can be appreciated. From this point, the quantifications confirm that the TRIM-away and Morpholino combined are more effective than taken separately with regard to Yap (indicated by green arrows in Figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is difficult to see the points the authors wish to communicate in Figure 6. If the authors add yellow and red arrows in B to C and D, this might make it clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have added different coloured stars according to the replication patterns directly on the nuclei observed on the CMZ enlargements (new Figure 7BC).

The fluorescence intensity in the green-labelled nuclei in Figure 7 C after Yap MO does not appear different from that in the control-MO. Under these conditions, there is no reason to think that one pattern is more difficult to recognise than the other one.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The title of the manuscript is &quot;A non-transcriptional function of YAP orchestrates the DNA replication program&quot;. It is not clear that YAP &quot;orchestrates&quot; DNA replication – for this to be true, it would have to be signal responsive. Since the authors did not reveal any links to YAP activity (such as YAP phosphorylation or nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution) it is not &quot;orchestrating&quot; DNA replication. Please adjust the title accordingly and also provide a clear indication of the biological system under investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>By “orchestrate”, we had in mind an actor able to modulate the speed of execution of the replication process. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that this may be open to interpretation. We thus propose to replace “orchestrates” by “regulates”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Statistics</p><p>Please indicate the statistical test in the legend of Figures1B, 2E-F, 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added the statistical tests in the legends for these Figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
