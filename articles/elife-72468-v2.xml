Such a molecule provides a precision-medicine approach to target <italic>SCN8A</italic>-related epilepsy syndromes (<italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES), where gain-of-function (GoF) mutations lead to excess Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sodium current, or other indications where Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mediated hyper-excitability contributes to disease (Gardella and Møller, 2019; Johannesen et al., 2019; Veeramah et al., 2012). NBI-921352 is a potent inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (IC<sub>50</sub>0.051 µM), with exquisite selectivity over other sodium channel isoforms (selectivity ratios of 756 X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, 134 X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, 276 X for Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and &gt;583 Xfor Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5). NBI-921352is a state-dependent inhibitor, preferentially inhibiting inactivatedchannels. The state dependence leads to potent stabilization of inactivation, inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, including resurgent and persistent Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents, while sparing the closed/rested channels. The isoform-selective profile of NBI-921352 led to a robust inhibition of action-potential firing in glutamatergic excitatory pyramidal neurons, while sparing fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons, where Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 predominates. Oral administration of NBI-921352 prevented electrically induced seizures in a <italic>Scn8a</italic> GoF mouse,as well as in wild-type mouse and ratseizure models. NBI-921352 was effective in preventing seizures at lower brain and plasma concentrations than commonly prescribed sodium channel inhibitor anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lacosamide. NBI-921352 waswell tolerated at higher multiples of the effective plasma and brain concentrations than those ASMs. NBI-921352 is entering phase II proof-of-concept trials for the treatment of <italic>SCN8A-</italic>developmental epileptic encephalopathy (<italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE) and adult focal-onset seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group

2008</xref>).Mutations in the <italic>SCN8A</italic> gene result in malfunction of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 sodium channels and cause a spectrum of <italic>SCN8A</italic>-related syndromes in humans, and disruptions of mouse Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 likewise disrupt normal physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardella and Møller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johannesen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meisler, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Veeramah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagnon et al., 2015</xref>). Variants of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels can result in either gain or loss of function. Loss-of-function (LoF) variants in humans are generally associated with autism spectrum disorders with cognitive and developmental delay without epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Inglis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), but, in some cases, can lead to late-onset seizures.In mice, LoF variants of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 lead to motor impairment but increase seizure resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Gain-of-function (GoF) variants in human <italic>SCN8A</italic> generally result in early-onset <italic>SCN8A</italic>-related epilepsy syndromes (<italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES). The most severe of these epilepsy syndromes is <italic>SCN8A</italic> developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (<italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardella and Møller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johannesen et al., 2019</xref>). Most <italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES patients carry de novo heterozygous missense variants that lead to a gain of function of the Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channel, although inherited and bi-allelic variants have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardella and Møller, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wengert et al., 2019</xref>).<italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE patients present early in life with seizure onset usually occurring in the first year of life. After seizure onset, patients begin to miss developmental milestones and display additional symptoms, including cognitive and motor delay, hypotonia, and cortical blindness. <italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE individuals are predisposed to early death, including sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP). While <italic>SCN8A</italic>-RESpatients often have treatment-resistant seizures, many can achieve seizure reduction or seizure freedom upon treatment with anti-seizure medicines (ASMs) that non-selectively inhibit voltage-gated sodium channels, like phenytoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boerma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Braakman et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES patients may require doses that are higher than those prescribed for most epilepsy patients and, as a result, can be more prone to drug-related adverse events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boerma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardella and Møller, 2019</xref>). Even with high doses and multiple ASMs, many patients continue to have uncontrolled seizures as well as extensive comorbidities. The aggressive pharmacotherapy required to protect <italic>SCN8A</italic>patients from life-threatening seizures often comes with attendant side effects that would not be tolerated in less severely impacted populations.</p><p>Existing sodium channel inhibitor ASMs are nonselective, blocking all voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms at similar plasma or brain concentrations. This lack of selectivity likely limits the benefits of sodium channel inhibitors since LoF variants of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 are known toimpair inhibitory interneuron function and causegeneralized epilepsy with seizures plus (GEFS+) and <italic>SCN1A</italic>-DEE (Dravet Syndrome) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catterall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escayg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gennaro et al., 2003</xref>).Thus, inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 may counter the benefit of inhibiting the sodium channels of excitatory neurons. Inhibiting Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 currents is also undesirable since those channels are critical for facilitating contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscles, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ptácek et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rojas et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that a selective inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 could provide a safer and more effective treatment for patients with <italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES and might also be more broadly efficacious in more common forms of epilepsy. An extensive medicinal-chemistry effort produced NBI-921352, the firstpotent and selective inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neurocrine, 2019</xref>).

Charge movement in VSD4 has been linked to the voltage dependence of fast inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahern et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that the anionic aryl sulfonamide headgroup of NBI-921352 interacts with the fourth arginine in S4 of VSD4 and prevents return of VSD4 to the rested position and recovery from inactivation as seen for related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>). For these reasons, we expect that binding will be encouraged by VSD4 residing in the UP, inactivated, state.</p><p>We designed our voltage-clamp protocols to encourage high occupancy of inactivated states by holding at depolarized membrane potentials (–45 mV for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6). The isoforms that inactivate at the most negative membrane potentials (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7) accumulate excess slow inactivation at –45 mV, reducing the signal size. For these two isoforms, the membrane potential was held at –60 mV to preserve robust assay performance while fully inactivating the channels. Our investigation into the state dependence of NBI-921352 did not attempt to rigorously differentiate binding to open channels versus fast inactivated or fast inactivated versus slow inactivated states.</p><p>To query the state dependence of NBI-921352, we measured the apparent potency with two different voltage protocols that favor either the closed (rested) state or inactivatedstates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Holding the membrane potential at –120 mV induces most channels to reside in the resting state. Brief depolarizations to measure Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 current enabled the determination of an IC<sub>50</sub>of 36 µM (95% CI: 29–47 µM) for rested-state channels. Holding the membrane potential at –45 mV encourages channels to transition into inactivated states. Brief hyperpolarizations allow rapid recovery from inactivation for channels that are not bound to drug followed by a short 20ms test pulse to –20 mV to measure currents from unbound channels (see Materials and methods for details). Measuring the ability of NBI-921352 to inhibit reopening of activated channels leads to an apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.051 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>).

Some drugs or candidate drugs, like PRAX-330 and Riluzole, have been touted based on their preference for persistent currents, but this appears to be a feature of many of the compounds in the Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitor class since they are generally poor inhibitors of closed/rested state channels and bind preferentially to activated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Colombo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mason et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wengert and Patel, 2021</xref>).

In most conditions, normal Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels inactivate rapidly and nearly completely after opening. Persistent currents result from channels that are not stably inactivated – a common phenotype for epilepsy-inducing variants in Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, including N1768D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tidball et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wagnon et al., 2015</xref>). We found that NBI-921352 inhibited N1768D Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 persistent currents (measured as the non-inactivating current 10ms after initiation of the depolarizing test pulse) with a similar potency as for activated wild-type Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.059 µM (95% CI: 0.044–0.082 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A more traditional approach to measuring persistent currents is to step from a very hyperpolarized voltage (for example –120 mV) to a strong depolarization for 50ms or longer. This approach is not viable for NBI-921352 since equilibration of block after from such negative, non-physiological, voltages takes several seconds.</p><p>Resurgent currents occur after repolarizing following a strong depolarization as channels redistribute between closed, open, and inactivated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raman and Bean, 1997</xref>).

NBI-921352 also effectively inhibited resurgent currents from N1768D channels with apparent IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.037 µM (95% CI: 0.025–0.060 µM). While the resurgent currents cannot be measured with the same voltage protocols used to measure inactivated state inhibition, these data indicate that N1768D Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 resurgent currents are susceptible to inhibition by NBI-921352 and that inhibition occurs at similar concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>NBI-921352 preferentially inhibited excitatory pyramidal neurons and spared inhibitory interneurons</title><p>A primary goal of creating Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 selective inhibitors was to spare Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, the voltage-gated sodium channel that is most prevalent in inhibitory interneurons.

The diverse range of indications and systems affected by these drugs is a testament to their critical biological role in cellular excitability. A fundamental challenge for these currently marketed sodium channel drugs is that none of them are selective amongst the nine sodium channel isoforms. As a result, drugs targeting the sodium channels of the brain for epilepsy can inhibit both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, limiting their ability to restore balanced neuronal firing.</p><p>Reducing Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 current is proconvulsant due to the predominance of Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 in inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catterall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Claes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Escayg et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mistry et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yu et al., 2006</xref>), while the opposite is true for Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Shalom et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hawkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2007</xref>). Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 are more highly expressed in excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catterall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Encinas et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, these nonselective agents can block the channels associated withskeletal muscle (Na<sub>V</sub>1.4), cardiac tissue (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5), and peripheral neurons (Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.8, Na<sub>V</sub>1.9). Inhibiting these off-target channels can compromise muscular, cardiovascular,and sensory function. These risks are highlighted by the FDA’s recent drug-safety communication for the nonselective Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitor ASM lamotrigine. Lamotrigine has been linked to cardiac liabilities as a consequence of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">FDA, 2021</xref>). Likewise, Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitors intended as local anesthetics for trigeminal neuralgia or other pain syndromes and class I cardiac antiarrhythmic drugs are often dose limited by CNS adverse events like dizziness, sedation, and cognitive or motor impairment caused by inhibition of CNS Na<sub>V</sub> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caron and Libersa, 1997</xref>).</p><p>An obvious solution to this isoform selectivity challenge is to pursue a precision-medicine approach and create selective pharmacologic agents that preferentially target the sodium channels specific to the desired target tissue or cell type. This selective approach has been pursued for multiple channel isoforms - particularly for the peripheral Na<sub>V</sub>s associated with pain (Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.8). This approach has proven challenging because the nine isoforms of sodium channels, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1-Na<sub>V</sub>1.9, share a high degree of primary and tertiary structural similarity. Achieving selectivity with compounds that have tractable pharmaceutical properties has been particularly difficult.</p><p>Previous attempts to optimize Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitors for epilepsy have focused on either drug properties or channel-state dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first description of acentrally penetrant, isoform-selective Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitor for use in CNS indications, including epilepsy. NBI-921352 represents the first selective inhibitor of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 that is suitable for systemic oral administration.</p><p>The Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 selective profile of NBI-921352 was designed to inhibit activity in excitatory neurons while sparing firing in the inhibitory interneurons where Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 is preferentially expressed. We found that NBI-921352 did reduce firing in cortical excitatory pyramidal cells. In contrast, fast-firing inhibitory interneuron firing was not impaired and actually showed a trend toward increasing (although not statistically significant). The reason that interneuron action-potential firing might increase is unclear but could be a consequence of network effects that arise from interactions with other neurons synapsed onto the target neurons in the experiment. These data confirm that selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inhibitors can display differential inhibition of neurons in a manner that nonselective inhibitors, like carbamazepine, generally do not.</p><p>The distribution of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 to excitatory pyramidal neurons is not absolute, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 expression has also been found in inhibitory interneurons. This is most well established for Purkinje neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodruff-Pak et al., 2006</xref>). Deletion of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in Purkinje neurons in mice causes deficits in both cognition and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Levin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Woodruff-Pak et al., 2006</xref>). NaV1.6 is also highly expressed at the nodes of Ranvier of both central and peripheral neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boiko et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caldwell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herzog et al., 2003</xref>). We have found that selective inhibitors of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 can cause ataxia and motor symptoms when plasma and brain concentrations are very high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is unclear whether these effects are due to concentrations exceeding those that retain high selectivity, or whether high occupancy of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 is directly responsible. In either case, our data would suggest that selective inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 provides a robust window between the level of inhibition required to reduce seizure induction and the levels that impair normal behavior.</p><p><italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES patients most often carry de novo genetic variants. While some variants are known to be recurrent, many variants are represented by a single patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meisler, 2019</xref>). We therefore wanted to assure that NBI-921352 inhibition was not limited to wild-type Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. We tested nine distinct, patient-identified variants and found that 8 of them were inhibited by NBI-921352 at similar concentrations as wild-type channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). One variant, R1617Q, was found to be 6.8-fold less sensitive to inhibition than the wild-type channel. R1617Q has been identified in multiple <italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE patients and is in the domain IV voltage-sensor domain (VSD4). NBI-921352 is an aryl sulfonamide with structural similarity to the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 targeted aryl sulfonamides where the binding site has been identified as the Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 VSD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahuja et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McCormack et al., 2013</xref>). It is likely that the R1617Q directly or allosterically impairs the tight association of NBI-921252 with Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 due to its proximity to the binding site. Despite the reduction in potency, NBI-921352 remains markedly more potent than existing Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitor drugs on the R1617Q variant Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channel. This would suggest that while NBI-921352 may be an effective treatment for <italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE patients carrying R1617Q variants, higher plasma levels of the compound could be required for efficacy in those patients.</p><p>Many <italic>SCN8A</italic>-RES-associated variants produce their GoF effects by disrupting or destabilizing the inactivation-gating machinery of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels. This can lead to pathological persistent or resurgent currents that contribute to neuronal hyperexcitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pan and Cummins, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Most known small molecule inhibitors of Na<sub>V</sub> channels, except some marine toxins like tetrodotoxin, bind preferentially to inactivated gating states of the channels and stabilize the channels in inactivated, non-conductive conformations. This state dependence is manifested as a protocol dependence of the apparent drug potency. State dependence inhibition has been described in many ways. Use-dependent, frequency-dependent, resurgent current -selective, and persistent current-selective inhibition are all consequences of a preference for binding to inactivated channels. Stabilizing inactivated states of the channel reduces persistent and resurgent currents, and this feature has been suggested to contribute to the efficacy of many Na<sub>V</sub> targeted ASMs including phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide, cannabidiol, and lamotrigine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wengert and Patel, 2021</xref>).NBI-921352 is also highly state dependent, with a &gt; 750 fold preference for inactivated channels vs. rested, closed-state channels (sometimes referred to as <italic>peak current</italic>). Forcing all Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 channels into the closed state by applying voltages more hyperpolarized than physiological (–120 mV) results in very weak inhibition of the channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Biasing the channels toward inactivated states by holding the membrane potential more positive in a protocol designed to monitor currents recovered from the inactivated state, resurgent current, or persistent current protocol all yielded potent inhibition. In physiologic conditions, channels are distributed among closed, open, and inactivated states, thus allowing equilibration of potent inhibition of the channel by NBI-921352.</p><p>Based on structural similarities and biophysical behavior, we believe that NBI-921352 binds to the domain IV voltage sensor domain (VSD4), much like GX-936 binds to the chimeric NaV1.7 constructs in Ahuja et al. In this structure the VSD4 is captured in the up (activated) state. The down (rested) state of the voltage sensor is not available for high-affinity interaction with the compound. We expect that the high affinity binding events for NBI-921352 occur only when the VSD4 is in the up state, promoting inactivation. We believe this is the likely mechanism by which NBI-921352 traps channels in the inactivated state and reduces Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 currents.</p><p>Increasing the selectivity of a Na<sub>V</sub> inhibitor provides the expectation of an improved safety profile by reducing adverse events caused by off-target activity. An inherent risk of this approach is the potential loss of efficacy that could come from reduced polypharmacy. We have developed a potent, highly selective Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 inhibitor in NBI-921352. Our studies with NBI-921352 indicate that a Na<sub>V</sub>1.6-specific compound can retain a robust ability to prevent seizures in rodent models at modest plasma and brain concentrations, consistent with the important role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in seizure pathways. Our data also suggests that this selectivity profile does improve the tolerability of NBI-921352 relative to commonly employed nonselective sodium channel ASMs in rodents. Whether these results will translate to humans is not yet established, but Phase I clinical trials have shown that NBI-921352was well tolerated at plasma concentrations higher than were required for efficacy in the preclinical rodent studies described here. NBI-921352 is currently being developed for both <italic>SCN8A</italic>-DEE epilepsy and adult focal-onset seizures by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Neurocrine, 2019</xref>. Phase II clinical trials will soon evaluate the efficacy of NBI-921352 in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neurocrine, 2021</xref>). These clinical trials will provide the first evidence for whether the robust efficacy and tolerability demonstrated in rodents translates to human epilepsy patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

To measure inactivated state inhibition, the membrane potential was maintained at a voltage where inactivation is complete. For each Na<sub>V</sub> channel subtype, the V<sub>h</sub>used to quantify compound inhibition were as follows: Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 (-45 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 (-45 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.2 (-45 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.3 (-45 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (-60 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.7 (-60 mV), Na<sub>V</sub>1.4 (-45 mV). The mutant channel hNa<sub>V</sub>1.6<sup>N1768D</sup> was found to have accelerated run-down compared with wild-type hNa<sub>V</sub>1.6, so the holding potential was adjusted to –60 mV to provide sufficient signal window. The voltage was briefly repolarized to a negative voltage (–150 mV) for 20 ms for Na<sub>V</sub>1.5, Na<sub>V</sub>1.7, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4or for 60 ms for Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 to allow recovery from fast inactivation, followed by a test pulse to –20 or 0 mV for 10 ms to quantify the compound inhibition. The repolarization step allows compound-free channels to recover from fast inactivation, but compound-bound channels remain inhibited during the subsequent test step. For rested state ‘Peak’ current V<sub>h</sub>was set to –120 mV. Appropriate filters for minimum seal resistance were applied (typically &gt;500 MΩ membrane resistance), and series resistance was compensated at 100%. The pulse protocols were run at 1 Hz for hNa<sub>V</sub>1.7, hNa<sub>V</sub>1.5, hNa<sub>V</sub>1.3, and hNa<sub>V</sub>1.4 or 0.04 Hz for Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2.</p><p>To construct concentration response curves, baseline currents were established after 20 min in vehicle (0.5% DMSO). Full inhibition response amplitudes were determined by adding tetrodotoxin (TTX, 300 nM) or tetracaine for Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 (10 µM) to each well at the end of the experiment. Compounds were then exposed at a single concentration for 20 min. One-sixth of every experimental plate was dedicated to vehicle-only wells that enabled correction for nonspecific drift (i.e. rundown) of the signal in each experiment. For all channel subtypes, inhibition by the compound reached steady state within 20 min of incubation. The current inhibition values (I<sub>(CPD)</sub>) were normalized to both the vehicle (I<sub>control</sub>) and the full response defined by supramaximal TTX (I<sub>TTX</sub>) or tetracaine (for Na<sub>V</sub>1.5) addition responses according to Equation 1.<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>X</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This normalized inhibition was then further normalized to the span of the assay to account for the run-down seen in cells exposed to vehicle alone for 20 min as follows:</p><p>Equation 2<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>:</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>I<sub>norm, span</sub></italic> = the current response normalized to within the span of the assay.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>I<sub>norm(CPD)</sub></italic> = the normalized response in the presence of compound.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>I<sub>norm(VEH)</sub></italic> = the normalized response in the absence of compound.</p></list-item></list><p>This normalization ensures that the data ranges were between 0 and 1, and there is no rundown in the plots.

Phenytoin was formulated in physiologic saline and was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) using a 25-gauge needle at a dose volume of 10 mL/kg. All compounds were administered 2 hr prior to electrical seizure induction for all seizure models employed in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Bioanalytical assessment of plasma and brain concentrations</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Sample collection:</title><p>Approximately 0.5 mL of blood was collected from each mouse at the end of the assay via cardiac puncture under deep anesthesia. The blood samples were collected in a syringe and transferred to tubes containing EDTA. Blood was stored at 4 °C until centrifuged within 30 min of collection. Plasma was harvested and placed on dry ice and stored in a freezer set to maintain a temperature of –70°C to –80°C until analysis. Brains were harvested immediately after blood collection and placed on dry ice prior to storage in a freezer set to maintain a temperature of –70°C to –80°C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Plasma samples:</title><p>Extraction of plasma samples was carried out by protein precipitation using acetonitrile. Plasma samples (50 µL) were mixed with 50 µL of internal standard (IS) solution in water followed by addition of 10 µL of concentrated ortho-phosphoric acid and 200 µL of acetonitrile. Samples were vortexed for 30 seconds, centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min, decanted in to a 96-well plate, and further centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min. The samples were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Brain samples:</title><p>Prior to extraction, pre-weighed whole brains were homogenized in 1:1 acetonitrile/water (v/v) (4 mL per mouse brain) using an IKA T18 ULTRA-TURRAX Homogenizer at the setting of 4 for approximately 2 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min and 50 µL of the supernatant were treated exactly as described above for plasma samples. Fifty µL of the brain homogenate were then treated exactly as the plasma samples described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Standards and quality control (QC) samples:</title><p>K<sub>2</sub>EDTA Blank mouse plasma purchased from Valley Biomedical, California, USA was used to prepare standards and QC samples for plasma quantitation and as surrogates for brain homogenate quantitation. Calibration samples ranged from 2.34 ng/mL to 4800 ng/mL. QC samples concentration included 14 ng/mL (QC-L), 255 ng/mL (QC-M), and 3600 ng/mL (QC-H). Standards and QC samples were processed the same way as the sample extracts described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Analytical methods and statistics for plasma and tissue samples:</title><p>Samples were analyzed by UHPLC-ESI MS/MS using a TQ-5500 Sciex triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a Shimadzu Nexera UHPLC pump and auto-sampler system using an ACE C18 PFP, 2.50 × 50 mm, 1.7 µm particle size column and gradient elution consisting of solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) starting at 20% B from 0 min to 0.4 min and then increased to 100% B from 0.4 min to 0.6 min. At 2.0 min, the mobile phase composition was switched back to 60% B for 1 min. The flow rate used throughout the experiment was 0.4 min/mL. The analyte, NBI-921352, and the IS were detected by electrospray in the positive ion mode using the following transitions: m/z 460/91 for NBI-921352 and m/z 503/341 m/z for the IS. The UHPLC-ESI MS/MS system was controlled by Analyst 1.6.</p><p>Sample concentrations were determined using a linear calibration function, weighted 1 /X, generated by the regression of analyte to IS peak area ratios in the standard samples to their respective concentrations. Acceptance criteria for the analytical run required that the back calculated values of the standards and the QC samples fell within ±20% of their nominal values, except for the lowest standard or lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), for which the acceptance criterion was ±25%. At least 6 out of 12 standard points had to show back-calculated values within ±20% of their nominal concentrations for the calibration to be accepted. At least three QC samples, one at each level, had to show back-calculated values within ±20% of their nominal concentrations for the whole sample batch to be valid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Animals</title><p>After delivery, animals were allowed sufficient time to acclimate prior to testing (~1 week).

The modified 6 Hz seizure assay in <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic>heterozygous mice was adapted from the traditional 6 Hz assay psychomotor seizure assay to provide a measure of in vivo on target (Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mediated) efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barton et al., 2001</xref>). The modified assay used a low frequency (6 Hz) but long-duration stimulation (3 s) to induce seizures. We identified 12 mA and a 0.3-ms pulse interval as a suitable current for testing in <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic> mice, since it differentiated mutant and wild-type (WT) mice. An electroshock (6 Hz, 12 mA) was delivered for 3 s (at 0.3-ms pulse interval) by corneal electrodes (Electro Convulsive Therapy Unit 57,800 from Ugo Basile). Immediately prior to the electroshock, the animals’ eyes were anesthetized with a drop of Alcaine (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride). Upon corneal stimulation, WT mice experienced mild seizure behaviors such as facial clonus, forelimb clonus, Straub tail, rearing, and falling, but did not experience a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTC) with hindlimb extension. <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic> animals, however, in addition to mild seizure behaviors, experienced a GTC with hindlimb extension. The modified assay showed a clear differentiation of seizure behavior between WT and <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic> mice exhibited GTC with hindlimb extension but not WT mice.</p><p>For the single-dose and repeated-dose efficacy experiments, <italic>Scn8a<sup>N1768D/+</sup></italic> animals were dosed PO with vehicle or NBI-921352 two hours before the administration of the electric stimulation.

An animal displaying GTC with hindlimb extension was considered not protected and is then scored ‘1’. The experimenter scoring the seizure behavior was blinded to the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DC-Maximal electroshock seizure assay in rodents</title><p>The maximal electroshock seizure (MES) assay has been extensively used in the search for anticonvulsant substances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Löscher et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Piredda et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">White et al., 1995</xref>). The MES assay is sensitive to nonselective NaV inhibitors. It is considered a model for generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures and provides an assessment of seizure spread. Briefly, an electroshock of direct current (DC) was delivered by corneal electrodes (Electro Convulsive Therapy Unit 57,800 from Ugo Basile). The parameters of stimulation were different between mice and rats. In CF1 mice aged 9–12 weeks, a direct current of 50 mA (60 Hz) was delivered for 0.2 s (pulse width of 0.5ms), whereas in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats aged 5–6 weeks, a direct current of 150 mA (60 Hz) was delivered for 0.3 s (pulse width of 0.5ms). Immediately prior to the electroshock, the animals’ eyes were anesthetized with a drop of Alcaine (0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride). Upon corneal stimulation, naive animals experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTC) with hindlimb extension.</p><p>For the efficacy experiments, single dose and repeated dose, animals were dosed PO with vehicle or NBI-921352 2 hr before the administration of the electric stimulation. An animal was considered protected in the assay in the absence of a GTC with hindlimb extension and is then scored ‘0’. An animal displaying GTC with hindlimb extension was considered not protected and is then scored ‘1’. The experimenter scoring the seizure behavior was blinded to the treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Blinding of in vivo efficacy experiments</title><p>On each testing day, individual treatment groups were assigned a random label (e.g. A, B, C, etc.) by the technical staff administering the compound. To ensure blinding, the technical staff member performing drug administration differed from the person performing the test. Therefore, the experimenter conducting testing was blinded to treatment group (e.g. drug or vehicle treatment, dose, and time point).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Randomization of in vivo efficacy experiments</title><p>Randomization of animals into various treatment groups occurred on a per-animal (e.g. rather than a per-cage) basis.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Theodore Cummins (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that some of the points noted below are related and should be addressed comprehensively.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The compound was not tested against Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels. It may be unlikely that NBI-921352 would inhibit either of these as they are more divergent in the likely binding region than the other isoforms test, this is not a given and is a slight weakness. While testing these two isoforms is not impossible, it may not be necessary. But the lack of data at least needs to be discussed.</p><p>2) To facilitate the binding/action of NBI-921352, a depolarized holding potential (-45 mV) was used in the voltage-clamp recording for most VGSC isoforms (except Nav1.7 and Nav1.5) and Nav1.6 variants (except N1768D). This EP protocol was used for Nav1.1, Nav1.2, and Nav1.6, the three major VGSC isoforms in the central nervous system, and therefore, the comparison among those three isoforms should be reliable, despite the depolarized holding potential (-45 mV). However, it is unlikely for neurons to experience such sustained depolarizing state (-45 mV) under physiological conditions, and therefore, the selectivity of NBI-921352 on Nav1.6 vs other VGSCs under physiological conditions could be different compared to the values reported here. It is better to hold cells at physiologically relevant membrane potentials or using action potential waveforms derived from real AP recordings of pyramidal neurons or interneurons. The authors should discuss these limitations, and possible impact on their assessment of selectivity against other VGSCs in their native cellular backgrounds.</p><p>3) While the electrophysiological data clearly show that NBI-921352 shows voltage-dependence and likely state dependence, the study lacks an assay of use-dependence using repetitive higher frequency depolarizations. Something like 10 or 20 Hz pulsing might be informative.</p><p>4) In several places it is stated that NBI-921352 preferentially inhibits activated (inactivated or open) channels. There is no direct assay looking at inhibition of open but not-inactivated channels, so this conclusion is potentially misleading. The authors could try something like a WCW non-inactivating construct, but I think just rewording those places where it says inactivated or open to maybe &quot;inactivating and possibly also open&quot; would be reasonable.</p><p>5) Different voltage-clamp protocols were adopted among different sodium channel isoforms (lines 406-418) to measure IC50 concentrations of the drug, which requires clarification/justification. Since NBI-921352 is &quot;a state-dependent inhibitor&quot; (line 30) and &quot;requires several seconds to equilibrate with activated channels&quot; (line 401), the difference in holding potentials (-60 mV vs -45 mV), recovery period (20 ms vs 60 ms at -150 mV), and data acquisition rates (1 Hz vs 0.04 Hz) may alter the binding/interaction of NBI-921352 with tested channels, and therefore, introduce bias in the comparison of selectivity among VGSCs. The authors should explain their rationale for choosing these protocols and address the potential confounding effects in data analysis.</p><p>6) The statement that a preference for persistent currents is, &quot;in fact, a feature of all the compounds in the Nav inhibitor class&quot; is not justified by either data presented in the study or by an appropriate reference. The &quot;in fact&quot; is particularly not justified since it really states a bias that would need to be bolstered by hard data. Not much in biology is proven as a fact. This bold statement may have some validity, but it is not really important to the major conclusions of the study.</p><p>7) It is stated that NBI-921352 is rapidly cleared in mice, but it is unclear if this is different in humans, which could limit the translational potential. It would help the reader if this was discussed.</p><p>8) Lines 248-249 states unequivocally that the efficacy and adverse events of Nav inhibitors is driven by action in the CNS. There is no citation for this and it comes across as another bias. It seems intuitive that the anti-seizure activity is dependent on CNS activity, but this is not demonstrated in the current study. Adverse events could involve sodium channels in muscle and/or the peripheral nervous system. Therefore this statement should be modified.</p><p>9) Details on what behaviors were monitored and how they were monitored for figure 7 need to be included or else the bars and discussion on this aspect of the study should be removed.</p><p>10) Nav1.6 is highly expressed in Purkinje neurons and motor neurons, and plays important roles in motor system. Did the authors observe any motor impairment in the behavior studies? It would have been informative to examine the effect of NBI-921352 on AP firing and resurgent currents in Purkinje neurons. As Nav1.6 is the major isoform found at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers, including motor neurons axons, it is critical to know if NBI-921352 alters motor neuron and/or motor activity.</p><p>11) Three seizure models were used to evaluate the effect of NBI-921352 on electrically induced seizure. The data shows that NBI-921352 prevented the GTC with hindlimb extension in all three assays, demonstrating its potential to become an antiepileptic drug. In an earlier work from the same group (J Med Chem 2019; 62: 9618-9641), a modified Racine scale (0-5) was used to score the severity of different seizure activities, while only GTC with hindlimb extension (score 5 in Racine scale) is considered as seizure in this study. Is there any reason to choose this evaluation criteria instead of Racine scale used in previous work?</p><p>12) The authors tested seizure behaviors after repeated dosing of the drug, but claimed that there was no statistically significant difference between single-dose group vs repeated-dose group (lines 238-246). I was unable to find the description of statistical analysis method for behavioral studies in the manuscript.</p><p>13) There are several problems in the brain slice recording experiments. First, paired student t-test was used to compare the AP firing before and after drug treatment, which is inappropriate. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA should be used here, or use area under curve rather than number of APs for statistical analysis. Second, despite the dominant effect of Nav1.1 in inhibitory interneurons, Nav1.6 is also expressed in interneurons, and to confirm selectivity in the mouse model, it is better to examine the effect of NBI-921352 on AP firing in Nav1.6-knockout neurons. Third, the experiments lack a vehicle control data set. Fourth, the number of cells for each group is low (3-4 cells), more recordings should be performed.</p><p>14) Please add a section of statistical analysis in Materials and methods, and list the statistical analysis method used in each experiment.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;NBI-921352, a First-in-Class, Na V 1.6 Selective, Sodium Channel Inhibitor That Prevents Seizures in Scn8a Gain-of- Function Mice, and Wild-Type Mice and Rats&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. The reviewer 1 pointed out the lack of NBI-921352 data on Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, and the authors performed limited study on hNav1.8 co-expressed with β3 in CHO cells.</p><p>I am not clear why the authors selected CHO cells as the expression system, as it is known that expression of Nav1.8 is poor in CHO and HEK293 cells, even in the presence of β subunits (Nature 2002, 417: 653-656). The ND7/23 is a more commonly used system for Nav1.8 expression (for example, Toxins 2021, 13:501). I have obtained decent Nav1.8 currents (over 10 nA, with properties similar to those measured in DRG neurons) in ND7/23 cells, but barely saw Nav1.8 currents in HEK 293 cells co-transfected with hNav1.8 and β3. It is unclear how good the Nav1.8 expression was in CHO cells in authors' hands, the authors should include raw traces of Nav1.8 in Figure 1-Supplement 3 to demonstrate the reliable Nav1.8 expression in this assay. If the expression of Nav1.8 is not good, I would recommend removing the Nav1.8 data, though the authors still need to explain the lack of data on those two isoforms and discuss possible effect of NBI-921352.</p><p>Typos: there are quite some typos in figure legend of Figure 1-Supplement 3. For example, line 1045, &quot;% Block (Tonic) = (1 ITPI,NBI921352 / ITPl,Control) X 100%&quot;, should &quot;ITPl&quot; be &quot;ITP1&quot;? And the calculation should be &quot;(1-ITP1,NBI921352/ITP1,Control) x 100%&quot;? Same typo is shown in line 1046.</p><p>In line 1049, &quot;% Block (inactivation state) -&quot;, should &quot;-&quot; be &quot;=&quot;?</p><p>2. I have concerns on different holding potentials being used in determining IC50 of NBI-921352 for different isoforms. The authors responded that &quot;We chose to focus on what we refer to as &quot;molecular selectivity,&quot; the fundamental ability for a compound to bind to the channel and stabilize the high affinity conformation. We accomplish this by choosing voltages that promote the same fraction of channels to be in the high affinity (inactivated) state.&quot; I wonder how the authors determined that &quot;-45 mV&quot; is the potential for NBI-921352 to bind and reach the high affinity conformation of Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6, and &quot;-60 mV&quot; for Nav1.7 and Nav1.5, there is no justification of this in the manuscript. In addition, when a medicine is applied to a patient, the adverse effect is determined by its affinity and effect on all targeted channels/molecules physiological or pathological conditions, therefore, the relative selectivity of NBI-921352 determined using the same protocol/condition would be more meaningful for clinical practice.</p><p>The new data that NBI-921352 showed similar potency in Nav1.6 channel at -62 mV when compared to that at -45 mV is important, this data suggests that the IC50 of NBI-921352 is not significantly changed by the holding potential (or membrane potential) between -62 mV and -45 mV. Although I don't agree with the authors' explanation, I will not ask for extra experiments. However, unless the authors provide convincing evidence that the two holding potentials (-45 mV and -60 mV) used in this study do allow different isoforms to be in their &quot;highest affinity state (inactivated)&quot;, the explanation in Page 6 (line 124 to line 138) needs to be modified/removed.</p><p>Typo: line 137, &quot;is this assay&quot; should be &quot;in this assay&quot;.</p><p>3. Regarding to the state of channels that NBI-921352 preferentially inhibits, the abstract wrote &quot;NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor, preferentially inhibiting inactivated channels&quot;, while the figure legend 3 shows &quot;NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor of NaV1.6 and preferentially inhibited activated (open or inactivated) channels&quot;. In main text (page 20, line 424-426), &quot;NBI-921352 is also highly state dependent, with a &gt;750-fold preference for activated channels vs. rested, closed-state channels (sometimes referred to as peak current)&quot;. Which state does NBI-921352 preferentially act?</p><p>4. The figure legend 5 is confusing (page 63, line 1159-1169), please rephrase the sentences.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72468.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The compound was not tested against Nav1.8 and Nav1.9 channels.

The authors should discuss these limitations, and possible impact on their assessment of selectivity against other VGSCs in their native cellular backgrounds.</p></disp-quote><p>There are pros and cons to any method of determining selectivity and we acknowledge that none of them are ideal for all purposes. We chose to focus on what we refer to as “molecular selectivity,” the fundamental ability for a compound to bind to the channel and stabilize the high affinity conformation. We accomplish this by choosing voltages that promote the same fraction of channels to be in the high affinity (inactivated) state. This contrasts with “functional selectivity” that may be largely driven by the distinct state-dependence of different isoforms. Our approach avoids assumptions about what the physiologically relevant voltage is since that voltage can vary depending on the tissue or cell type. For any given isoform there may be multiple physiologically relevant voltages.</p><p>Consistent with this philosophy, we bias all the channels to be in their highest affinity state (inactivated) and then use this maximal potency to compare selectivity. At more hyperpolarized, voltages, potency for all isoforms will tend to be somewhat less. We are adding more explanation of our rationale to the text, and we are adding supplemental data giving more insight into the impact of voltage on potency.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows the potency of NBI-921352 after holding at a membrane potential nearer the physiologic range (-62mV). Potency at this voltage (IC<sub>50</sub> = 53 nM) was similar to that at fully inactivated potentials evaluated in the primary potency assay described shown in Figure 1. For this reason, we anticipate that the selectivity ratios described in the manuscript will be similar to those in physiologic conditions.</p><p>A note to this effect has been added to the Results section. See line 126.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While the electrophysiological data clearly show that NBI-921352 shows voltage-dependence and likely state dependence, the study lacks an assay of use-dependence using repetitive higher frequency depolarizations. Something like 10 or 20 Hz pulsing might be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in the process of preparing a manuscript on related compounds that will show a more detailed evaluation of the kinetics and state dependence of inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6. We have not yet explored this behavior as thoroughly with NBI-921352, and we feel that a more fulsome treatment of the biophysics may distract from the selectivity and pharmacology that we intend as the focus for the present work. We do know from our work in progress that block equilibrates over several seconds, and thus we do not expect a great deal of use-dependence at physiologically relevant firing rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In several places it is stated that NBI-921352 preferentially inhibits activated (inactivated or open) channels. There is no direct assay looking at inhibition of open but not-inactivated channels, so this conclusion is potentially misleading. The authors could try something like a WCW non-inactivating construct, but I think just rewording those places where it says inactivated or open to maybe &quot;inactivating and possibly also open&quot; would be reasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>Our data suggests preferential binding to inactivated states, but as the reviewer rightly points out, we cannot rule out (or in) binding to open states. Our intent with the “inactivated or open” wording was to account for this possibility. We are changing the wording to that recommended by the reviewer in hopes of clarifying this point. Our experience with constructs that impair fast inactivation (like WCW) have not been helpful for clarifying this issue because we find that these changes accelerate slow inactivation, and our compounds do not appear to clearly distinguish between slow and fast inactivated channels. Changes throughout document to replace “inactivated or open.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Different voltage-clamp protocols were adopted among different sodium channel isoforms (lines 406-418) to measure IC50 concentrations of the drug, which requires clarification/justification. Since NBI-921352 is &quot;a state-dependent inhibitor&quot; (line 30) and &quot;requires several seconds to equilibrate with activated channels&quot; (line 401), the difference in holding potentials (-60 mV vs -45 mV), recovery period (20 ms vs 60 ms at -150 mV), and data acquisition rates (1 Hz vs 0.04 Hz) may alter the binding/interaction of NBI-921352 with tested channels, and therefore, introduce bias in the comparison of selectivity among VGSCs. The authors should explain their rationale for choosing these protocols and address the potential confounding effects in data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>This question relates to the same underlying issues as Essential Question #2. I believe that the changes we made for #2 will also address this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The statement that a preference for persistent currents is, &quot;in fact, a feature of all the compounds in the Nav inhibitor class&quot; is not justified by either data presented in the study or by an appropriate reference. The &quot;in fact&quot; is particularly not justified since it really states a bias that would need to be bolstered by hard data. Not much in biology is proven as a fact. This bold statement may have some validity, but it is not really important to the major conclusions of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered our language to allow for the uncertainty pointed out by the Reviewer. See line 191.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is stated that NBI-921352 is rapidly cleared in mice, but it is unclear if this is different in humans, which could limit the translational potential. It would help the reader if this was discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Rodents, both rats and mice, rapidly eliminate NBI-921352, but the compound is much more stable in humans, where the half-life of elimination is approximately 8.5 hours. We have added this information to the Results section. See line 277.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Lines 248-249 states unequivocally that the efficacy and adverse events of Nav inhibitors is driven by action in the CNS. There is no citation for this and it comes across as another bias. It seems intuitive that the anti-seizure activity is dependent on CNS activity, but this is not demonstrated in the current study. Adverse events could involve sodium channels in muscle and/or the peripheral nervous system. Therefore this statement should be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have modified the language to account for this uncertainty. See line 322.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Details on what behaviors were monitored and how they were monitored for figure 7 need to be included or else the bars and discussion on this aspect of the study should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Animals were observed by the scientist(s) responsible for dosing for the first 30 minutes after dosing for and again at the time of assay (2 hrs post dose) for signs of abnormal behavior. Abnormal behavioral signs were noted for all compounds – tremor, ataxia and hypoactivity – when plasma concentrations were sufficiently high. The lowest concentration at which such behavioral signs were noted in any of the animals tested is illustrated by the dotted line in figure 7. We have added more detail to the methods (see line 790) to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Nav1.6 is highly expressed in Purkinje neurons and motor neurons, and plays important roles in motor system. Did the authors observe any motor impairment in the behavior studies? It would have been informative to examine the effect of NBI-921352 on AP firing and resurgent currents in Purkinje neurons. As Nav1.6 is the major isoform found at nodes of Ranvier in myelinated fibers, including motor neurons axons, it is critical to know if NBI-921352 alters motor neuron and/or motor activity.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in the response to Essential Revision #9, we did see signs of motor impairment at sufficiently high plasma concentrations of NBI-921352. While we cannot assure that these motor effects are due to inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6, we agree that it is consistent with the known role of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 in the Purkinje neurons and in the nodes of Ranvier of motor neurons. Mice with sufficient knock down of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 by genetic interventions are also known to exhibit motor dysfunction. Our data suggest that seizure protection occurs at lower concentrations/occupancy than those that induce ataxia. We believe that sparing other central Na<sub>V</sub>’s (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.2) improves the profile of these inhibitors, but we do expect to see ontarget (Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 mediated) toxicity when receptor occupancy becomes too high. See additional discussion beginning at line 408.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Three seizure models were used to evaluate the effect of NBI-921352 on electrically induced seizure. The data shows that NBI-921352 prevented the GTC with hindlimb extension in all three assays, demonstrating its potential to become an antiepileptic drug. In an earlier work from the same group (J Med Chem 2019; 62: 9618-9641), a modified Racine scale (0-5) was used to score the severity of different seizure activities, while only GTC with hindlimb extension (score 5 in Racine scale) is considered as seizure in this study. Is there any reason to choose this evaluation criteria instead of Racine scale used in previous work?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that both the Racine endpoint shown in Focken et al., 2019, and The GTC with hindlimb extension endpoint shown here are both valid. Our experience with this assay has been that the seizure phenotype is rather binary. That is, individual animals show very little seizure behavior prior to the GTC with hindlimb extension. As a result, we have found, based on studies with NBI-921352 and other compounds not shown here, that there is little difference in the efficacy measured by the method shown here versus the Racine evaluation used in the previous work. We chose to use the GTC with Hindlimb extension endpoint in this presentation to more easily compare and discuss the results in SCN8A mice to those presented for wild-type mice and rats in the DC-MES assays.</p><p>We have added the Racine score evaluation for these experiments in Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2, and 3 to enable comparison with the SCN8A mouse fraction seizing results shown in the primary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) The authors tested seizure behaviors after repeated dosing of the drug, but claimed that there was no statistically significant difference between single-dose group vs repeated-dose group (lines 238-246). I was unable to find the description of statistical analysis method for behavioral studies in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We are including supplementary figures (Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2, and 3) to better illustrate the statistical evaluation of the dose response data sets for all the experiments, and we have amended the text to indicate this. See Methods line 798, and the legends for Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 6, and Figure 6—figure supplements 1, 2, and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) There are several problems in the brain slice recording experiments. First, paired student t-test was used to compare the AP firing before and after drug treatment, which is inappropriate. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA should be used here, or use area under curve rather than number of APs for statistical analysis. Second, despite the dominant effect of Nav1.1 in inhibitory interneurons, Nav1.6 is also expressed in interneurons, and to confirm selectivity in the mouse model, it is better to examine the effect of NBI-921352 on AP firing in Nav1.6-knockout neurons. Third, the experiments lack a vehicle control data set. Fourth, the number of cells for each group is low (3-4 cells), more recordings should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the statistical analysis to an area under the curve analysis as suggested by the reviewer. See text line 234, Figure 4 legend and transparency Excel data file. Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 knockout experiments would be of interest, but we do not have access to those neurons. We agree that cells would be desirable. Unfortunately, the pandemic disrupted these slice experiments. Subsequently, NBI-921352 advanced in its clinical development. This creates additional challenges and costs to adhere to regulatory reporting requirements and has prevented us from extending this dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Please add a section of statistical analysis in Materials and methods, and list the statistical analysis method used in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We’ve added statistical methods to the methods and to the figure legends where appropriate.

The reviewer 1 pointed out the lack of NBI-921352 data on Nav1.8 and Nav1.9, and the authors performed limited study on hNav1.8 co-expressed with β3 in CHO cells.</p><p>I am not clear why the authors selected CHO cells as the expression system, as it is known that expression of Nav1.8 is poor in CHO and HEK293 cells, even in the presence of β subunits (Nature 2002, 417: 653-656). The ND7/23 is a more commonly-used system for Nav1.8 expression (for example, Toxins 2021, 13:501). I have obtained decent Nav1.8 currents (over 10 nA, with properties similar to those measured in DRG neurons) in ND7/23 cells, but barely saw Nav1.8 currents in HEK 293 cells co-transfected with hNav1.8 and β3. It is unclear how good the Nav1.8 expression was in CHO cells in authors' hands, the authors should include raw traces of Nav1.8 in Figure 1-Supplement 3 to demonstrate the reliable Nav1.8 expression in this assay. If the expression of Nav1.8 is not good, I would recommend removing the Nav1.8 data, though the authors still need to explain the lack of data on those two isoforms and discuss possible effect of NBI-921352.</p><p>Typos: there are quite some typos in figure legend of Figure 1-Supplement 3.

Regarding to the state of channels that NBI-921352 preferentially inhibits, the abstract wrote &quot;NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor, preferentially inhibiting inactivated channels&quot;, while the figure legend 3 shows &quot;NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor of NaV1.6 and preferentially inhibited activated (open or inactivated) channels&quot;. In main text (page 20, line 424-426), &quot;NBI-921352 is also highly state dependent, with a &gt;750-fold preference for activated channels vs. rested, closed-state channels (sometimes referred to as peak current)&quot;. Which state does NBI-921352 preferentially act?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that NBI-921352 preferentially binds to inactivated channels. This is based on the failure of the compound to potently block rested (closed) channels. Also, the presumed binding site (the UP, activated, conformation of the Domain IV voltage sensor, VSD4) only becomes available once VSD4 has reacted to the membrane field to trigger channel inactivation (see Ahuja et al., 2015, McCormack et al., 2013). We have not done detailed studies to exclude the possibility that open channels can be bound, though it seems unlikely to be a major driver of inhibition based on the limited time that the channels are in open, relative to inactivated, states. While the assays are designed with a bias toward inactivated states, we have not attempted to differentiate between fast and slow inactivated state inhibition. Our main objective for this manuscript is to define the importance of selective inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.6 for treating epilepsy. We expect further clarification of the interaction of drug binding and channel gating will be a topic for future work.</p><p>We have corrected the language in the manuscript and in the legend for Figure 3 to make clear that NBI-921352 targets inactivated states but that resolution between open, fast inactivated, and slow inactivated states was not attempted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I have concerns on different holding potentials being used in determining IC50 of NBI-921352 for different isoforms. The authors responded that &quot;We chose to focus on what we refer to as &quot;molecular selectivity,&quot; the fundamental ability for a compound to bind to the channel and stabilize the high affinity conformation. We accomplish this by choosing voltages that promote the same fraction of channels to be in the high affinity (inactivated) state.&quot; I wonder how the authors determined that &quot;-45 mV&quot; is the potential for NBI-921352 to bind and reach the high affinity conformation of Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, and 1.6, and &quot;-60 mV&quot; for Nav1.7 and Nav1.5, there is no justification of this in the manuscript. In addition, when a medicine is applied to a patient, the adverse effect is determined by its affinity and effect on all targeted channels/molecules physiological or pathological conditions, therefore, the relative selectivity of NBI-921352 determined using the same protocol/condition would be more meaningful for clinical practice.</p><p>The new data that NBI-921352 showed similar potency in Nav1.6 channel at -62 mV when compared to that at -45 mV is important, this data suggests that the IC50 of NBI-921352 is not significantly changed by the holding potential (or membrane potential) between -62 mV and -45 mV. Although I don't agree with the authors' explanation, I will not ask for extra experiments. However, unless the authors provide convincing evidence that the two holding potentials (-45 mV and -60 mV) used in this study do allow different isoforms to be in their &quot;highest affinity state (inactivated)&quot;, the explanation in Page 6 (line 124 to line 138) needs to be modified/removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We were fortunate that the voltage dependence of gating for the channels most relevant to our seizure studies (the CNS channels) aligned well enough to enable a common voltage protocol for all 4 CNS Na<sub>V</sub> channel isoforms. The conclusions on the advantage of selective inhibition of NaV1.6 for treating epilepsy are most dependent upon this selectivity profile and for these isoforms molecular selectivity and functional selectivity coincide.</p><p>As indicated in the response to question 3, NBI-921352 prefers inactivated channels. To create a robust assay suitable for screening compounds (about 2000) over the course of several years, we sought to create assays that were highly robust and reproducible over time. We have found that this is sometimes not possible with a single voltage protocol for every channel of interest.</p><p>To achieve robust and sensitive assays, we hold the membrane potential positive enough to ensure that most channels are inactivated. We then briefly step to a hyperpolarized potential (150 mV) that allows fast inactivated channels to recover but doesn’t allow for recovery from slow inactivation. If drug binding stabilizes the inactivated state sufficiently then drug bound channels also do not recover – leading to current inhibition. Holding at potentials that are too depolarized leads to an accumulation of slow inactivated channels and causes rundown. This reduces the size of the current signal and increases the challenge of separating gating drift from compound inhibition. These issues can compromise the fidelity and reproducibility of the inhibition assay. We empirically determined that the voltages used here result in full inactivation and are stable enough to enable robust measures over the duration of the assay.</p><p>For most isoforms (Na<sub>V</sub>1.1, Na<sub>V</sub>1.2, Na<sub>V</sub>1.3, Na<sub>V</sub>1.4, and Na<sub>V</sub>1.6) -45 mV was found to have complete inactivation and a stable recovered current amplitude. The isoforms that inactivate at the most negative potentials (Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 and Na<sub>V</sub>1.7) needed a more negative holding potential (60 mV) to preserve robust assay performance while fully inactivating the channels.</p><p>While unlikely to impact efficacy, Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 inhibition is important from a safety perspective as inhibition of Na<sub>V</sub>1.5 would introduce risk of cardiac events. Cardiac cells generally have more negative resting membrane potentials (around -90 mV) than neurons so inhibition in cardiac tissue will likely be less potent than inhibition in our assay.</p><p>We have removed the section (lines 124-138) indicated by the reviewer and instead added more text on protocols to the beginning of the section, “NBI-921352 is a state-dependent inhibitor” to improve the clarity of our methods and rationale for the readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typo: line 137, &quot;is this assay&quot; should be &quot;in this assay&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>This typo was removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
