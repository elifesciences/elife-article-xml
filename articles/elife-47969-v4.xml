mechanical and inflammatory processes interact in a complex manner, often resulting in exaggerated physiological, in particular, inflammatory responses to exogenous triggers. We hypothesize that this may be explained by respiratory disease-related systems instability and loss of adaptability to changing environmental conditions, manifested in highly fluctuating biomarkers and symptoms. Using time series of inflammatory (eosinophils, neutrophils, FeNO), clinical and lung function biomarkers (PEF, FVC,FEV<sub>1</sub>), we estimated this loss of adaptive capacity (AC) during an experimental rhinovirus infection in 24 healthy and asthmatic human volunteers. Loss of AC was estimated by comparing similarities between pre- and post-challenge time series. Unlike healthy participants, the asthmatic’s post-viral-challenge state resembled more other rhinovirus-infected asthmatics than their own pre-viral-challenge state (hypergeometric-test: p=0.029). This reveals loss of AC and supports the concept that in asthma, biological processes underlying inflammatory and physiological responses are unstable, contributing to loss of control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptive capacity</kwd><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>rhinovirus</kwd><kwd>homeokinesis</kwd><kwd>biomarker fluctuation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008593</institution-id><institution>European Respiratory Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Respire 2 (MCF-7077-2014)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Anirban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007560</institution-id><institution>Chiesi Pharmaceuticals</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Anirban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>H2020 Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Respire 2 (MCF-7077-2014)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Anirban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017_14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinha</surname><given-names>Anirban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fluctuation of biomarkers is a novel way of studying system stability during stable and unstable states of health and disease, revealing the systems' ability to cope with external perturbations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The quantitative study of physiologic systems, such as the respiratory system, has revealed their ability to maintain a highly organized internal environment that is fluctuating within certain limits, despite being constantly exposed to a variable external environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Que et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tirone and Brunicardi, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palmer and Clegg, 2016</xref>). The term homeokinesis has been coined to describe this ability, substituting the concept of homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldstein and Kopin, 2017</xref>) to emphasize that fluctuations in the internal environment are normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Macklem, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Macklem and Seely, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yates, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glass, 2001</xref>). Homeokinesis is at the core of the observed adaptability, that is, adaptive capacity, of physiologic systems in response to changing environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberger et al., 2002</xref>). It is part of the remarkable complexity characteristic of such systems, which is believed to originate from non-linear interactions and feedback-loops between their constitutive parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberger et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garfinkel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldberger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Que, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Over the past decades a considerable research effort has been invested into mathematically analyzing the fluctuation behavior of physiologic time series with the aim of characterizing the normal homeokinetic variability of physiologic systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garfinkel, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glass and Mackey, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldberger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glass and Kaplan, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amigó and Small, 2017</xref>). One of the most counterintuitive findings has been that both excessive and too little variation are indicative of pathological modifications and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Que et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberger et al., 2002</xref> and references therein). Within this paradigm, a chronic disease, such as asthma, may be understood as changes in the system that render it either too rigid or overly unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, such disease or aging related changes of the system are accompanied by a loss of adaptive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goldberger et al., 2002</xref>). However, whether this can be detected in asthmatics using longitudinal measurements, that is time series, of asthma-related biomarkers has never been investigated.</p><p>The aim of this study is to test whether in asthmatics the adaptive capacity to a standardized environmental perturbation, such as an experimental viral challenge, is altered in comparison to healthy subjects.</p><p>In this prospective, longitudinally designed study comprising healthy and asthmatic subjects, we measured time series of a set of standard lung functional and inflammatory/immune biomarkers two months prior to and one month following an experimental rhinovirus 16 (RV16) infection induced by controlled and deliberate inoculation of healthy and asthmatic volunteers. This choice was driven by the fact that rhinovirus (RV) infections in asthmatics have been found to be among the most prominent external triggers of acute worsening of asthma symptoms, asthma exacerbations, and of loss of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Johnston et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nicholson et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Quantifying a loss of adaptive capacity, that is, an impairment in the ability to cope with external perturbations, in a physiologic system will depend on how adaptive capacity is defined. This, in turn, depends on the physiological context. For instance, researchers have directly linked the capacity of rats to adapt to environmental heat stresses to the ability of the animal’s liver cells to rapidly express the heat shock protein HSP70 in high quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hall et al., 2000</xref>). Other scientists have suggested ‘the capacity of a physiological system to bring itself autonomously back to the normal homeostatic range after a challenge’ as a more workable definition of adaptive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orešic and Vidal-Puig, 2014</xref>). While still very general, the latter definition seems more suitable in a (patho-) physiological context in which the specific molecular mechanisms behind the adaptation processes cannot be easily laid out. Indeed, in geriatric medicine this definition has been widely used, and the term homeostenosis was introduced to describe aging related loss of adaptive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Taffett, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fossion et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yashin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fried et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Based on these ideas, we define adaptive capacity as the ability of a physiological system to autonomously return to the normal homeokinetic range after an external challenge. We implemented this definition quantitatively in our study by comparing the participants’ pre- and post-viral-challenge time series of measurements of the aforementioned biomarkers. We hypothesized that, for a given biomarker, the post-viral-challenge time series of a study participant with an unimpaired adaptive capacity would resemble the same subject’s pre-viral-challenge time series. Conversely, the post-viral-challenge time series of a study participant with an impaired adaptive capacity would be relatively distinct from the same subject’s pre-viral-challenge time series. In order to test this hypothesis, hierarchical clustering was used to group time series according to their relative similarity in an unassuming, data-driven manner.</p><p>With this approach we found experimental evidence for the loss of adaptive capacity of the human respiratory system due to asthma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental rhinovirus challenge while monitoring cohort participants</title><p>In all cohort participants (12 healthy and 12 asthmatic volunteers), the biomarkers/parameters listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> below were measured during two months before, and during one month immediately after deliberate experimental inoculation with rhinovirus, resulting in pre- and post-viral-challenge time series of each biomarker/parameter.

The pre- and post-challenge time series (also referred to as uninfected participant and infected participant, respectively) of individual biomarker time series from all participants (both healthy and asthmatics) were clustered using the EMD as the distance metric between the time series. The outcomes for the levels of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), and the percentage of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid are presented here, whereas the results for the other biomarkers are presented in the Appendix.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Time series of exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO)</title><p>Findings are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. The corresponding dendrogram is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In brief, we found three clusters. Cluster 1 consists of four time series stemming from two asthmatics. As can be read off of the dendrogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below, and of the distance matrix depicted in Panel C of Figure 2 (see Materials and methods section below), these two participants are prominently different from the rest (regarding their FeNO time series), and might be regarded as outliers. Cluster 2 contains more healthy participants than expected by chance. In other words, Cluster 2 is <italic>enriched</italic> in healthy participants. Conversely, due to the balanced design of the cohort (equal numbers of healthy and of asthmatic participants), Cluster 2 is also <italic>depleted</italic> of asthmatic participants, that is it contains fewer asthmatic participants than expected by chance. And finally, Cluster 3, which is enriched in asthmatic participants. While all, but one, of the time series from healthy participants are grouped together in Cluster 2, the vast majority of time series from asthmatic participants are split into two different Clusters, namely Clusters 1 and 3. This suggest a higher heterogeneity among the asthmatics. In Cluster 2, the tendency for infected participants to be clustered together with their corresponding uninfected counterpart is statistically significant (p-value=0.007, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> below). This is not the case for Cluster 3. The difference in this regard between Cluster 2 (mainly healthy participants) and Cluster 3 (mainly asthmatic participants) is further underpinned by the fact that, on average, the cophenetic distances (see Materials and methods section for the definition of cophenetic distance) between the infected cluster members and their uninfected counterparts are statistically significantly lower in Cluster 2 when compared to Cluster 3 (p-value=0.033, one-tailed Mann-Whitney-U-test, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cluster dendrogram obtained via hierarchical clustering of the participants’ pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO.</title><p>The distance between any two-time series was calculated using the EMD.

The empirical p-values for the proportion of pre- and post-pairs were calculated using simulated permutations (see Materials and methods section). A participant is fully represented in a given cluster if both their pre- and post-challenge time series of measurements are contained in the cluster. For example, the healthy participant ‘P08H’ is fully represented in Cluster 2, as both their pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO measurements are members of Cluster 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below). Partial representation corresponds to the scenario in which only one of the two time series (pre- and post-challenge) is a member of the cluster. For instance, the asthmatic participant &quot; P07A’ is only partially represented in Cluster 2, because their pre-challenge time series of FeNO measurements is part of Cluster 2, whereas their post-challenge time series of FeNO belongs to Cluster 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> below).

As can be read off of the dendrogram depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>, these time series are prominently different from all the other time series, and might be regarded as outliers. Cluster 2 is enriched in healthy participants. And finally, Cluster 3, which is enriched in asthmatic participants. As seen in the analysis of FeNO, while the vast majority of the time series from healthy participants are grouped together in Cluster 2, most of the time series from asthmatic participants are split into two different Clusters, namely Clusters 1 and 3. This suggest a higher heterogeneity among the asthmatics. However, Cluster 1 in the eosinophil analysis and Cluster 1 in the FeNO analysis only have one asthmatic patient in common. Again, in Cluster 2, the tendency for infected participants to be clustered together with their corresponding uninfected counterpart is statistically significant (p-value=0.001, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> below). This is not the case for Clusters 1 and 3. The difference in this regard between Cluster 2 (mainly healthy participants) and Cluster 3 (mainly asthmatic participants) is further substantiated by the fact that, on average, the cophenetic distances between the infected cluster members and their uninfected counterparts are statistically significantly lower in Cluster 2 when compared to Cluster 3 (p-value=8.96e-05, one-tailed Mann-Whitney-U-test, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Composition, enrichment analysis, and grouping characteristics of the clusters found by comparison of each participant’s pre- and post-challenge time series of percentage of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid.</title><p>Enrichment is marked in bold letters, depletion in italics; the corresponding p-values were calculated using the hypergeometric test.

Briefly, in terms of autocorrelation, the lung function parameters PEF (% predicted), FVC, and FEV1/FVC discriminate significantly between the pre- and post-infection status in both healthy and asthmatic participants. Indeed, for these three parameters, there is a moderate positive autocorrelation before the challenge, which then disappears after the challenge. Furthermore, in terms of autocorrelation, only FeNO discriminates significantly between healthy and asthmatic participants, and it does so only after the challenge. More specifically, only asthmatics exhibit a moderate autocorrelation of their FeNO time series after the challenge. However, after a multiple pairwise-comparison correction aimed at controlling the false discovery rate, only the parameters FVC and FEV1/FVC discriminate significantly between the pre- and post-infection status in both healthy and asthmatic participants, while the other findings lose their statistical significance.

However, prior to doing that, the efficacy of the inoculation with RV16 needed to be established. Indeed, the results of blood antibody tests (RV16 seroconversion) along with RV Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) conducted on nasal lavage fluid taken from every participant after the inoculation indicated that 11 out of 12 healthy participants and 12 out of 12 asthmatics were effectively infected with the RV16 after inoculation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). According to the above mentioned laboratory tests, one healthy participant did not become infected.

Consequently, this participant was included in the analyses.</p><p>We then explored, for each of the biomarkers measured (listed in the first column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>), for how many participants a statistically significant within-subject change upon infection can be observed (‘responders’, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). To this end, two criteria for ‘responders’ were implemented. The first criterion, which regards time series as univariate empirical distributions of the biomarker at hand, aimed at detecting distributional changes in a given biomarker induced by the viral challenge: Here, each participant’s pre- and post-challenge time series of each biomarker were compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The second criterion aimed at detecting short-term and transient relative changes induced by the viral challenge in the context of the relative changes observed prior to the challenge. Here, throughout the entire period of observation, we assessed the relative change of each biomarker taking place within time intervals of 10 days.

To this end, we hypothesized that a loss of adaptive capacity could be experimentally demonstrated by detection of a similarity diminution between the pre- and post-perturbation dynamics of the system. Using a data-driven clustering approach, we have shown that, in particular, FeNO and eosinophil time series were similar prior to and following the challenge in healthy subjects, suggesting stable homeokinetic behavior. In asthmatics, however, this similarity was predominantly reduced, suggesting a marked impact of the asthmatic condition on dynamic properties of the respiratory system, consistent with more unstable behavior and loss of adaptive capacity following the perturbation with viral infection. This loss of self-similarity is not merely the result of a larger response to the virus infection. Rather, we detected changes in the overall biomarker fluctuation dynamics elicited by the viral challenge that render asthmatics more similar to other infected asthmatic participants than to their uninfected counterparts.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental evidence supporting our hypothesis of a loss of adaptive capacity of the respiratory system in asthma</title><p>Our hypothesis in this study is based on the following question: For which type of participant, healthy or asthmatic, and for which biomarker is the disruption introduced by the viral challenge strong enough to render infected individuals more similar among themselves than to their uninfected counterparts? Our cluster analysis of the pre- and post-challenge time series of the percentage of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid resulted in two main clusters: Cluster 2, which is statistically significantly enriched in healthy participants, and Cluster 3, which is mainly composed of asthmatic participants. In Cluster 2, the tendency for infected participants to be clustered together with their corresponding uninfected counterpart is statistically significant and clearly higher than in Cluster 3. In the clustering of the pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO we found Cluster 2, mainly composed of healthy participants, and Cluster 3, made of nearly 95% asthmatics. Furthermore, within Cluster 3 we found a statistically significant separation of pre- and post-challenge time series. No such separation was found within Cluster 2. For both biomarkers (percentage of eosinophils in nasal lavage fluid and FeNO), the difference in this regard between Cluster 2 (mainly healthy participants) and Cluster 3 (mainly asthmatic participants) is further substantiated by the fact that, on average, the cophenetic distances between the infected cluster members and their uninfected counterparts are statistically significantly lower in Cluster 2 when compared to Cluster 3.</p><p>In our clustering based on time series of cell density in nasal lavage fluid, there is a statistically significant separation of pre- and post-challenge time series.

This tendency was, however, not observed, when similarity was measured in terms of the biomarker dynamics of lung function parameters, and of neutrophil cell density in nasal lavage fluid.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Physiological interpretation of the group differences in autocorrelation properties of the biomarker time series</title><p>We and others have previously shown that time series of lung function over days display a weak intrinsic autocorrelation over long- and short-time scales in asthmatic and healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delgado-Eckert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thamrin et al., 2016</xref>). Lung function is correlated with lung function values of previous days; these correlation properties are related to severity of asthma and disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thamrin et al., 2016</xref>). It has been hypothesized that such correlation properties are related to the balance between disease stability and adaptability of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2011</xref>). We and others have previously shown that external stimuli such as medication can alter these correlation properties dependent on the applied drug action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thamrin et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we provide first evidence that viral stimuli can also alter these correlation properties. In both healthy and asthmatic subjects, correlation of daily lung function was weakened by the viral challenge of the respiratory system. We hypothesize that following the viral challenge, the lung mechanical system properties are less deterministic consistent with a lower stability of the respiratory system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Asthma as a chronic disease: Causal chain of mechanisms or complex system behavior?</title><p>The classical analytical approach in asthma research is the identification of individual mechanisms (e.g., airway obstruction) or a series of mechanisms involved in the disease process (e.g. viral trigger → inflammation → bronchial hyperreactivity→ airway obstruction→ respiratory symptoms). However, epidemiological observations have questioned such a simple causal relationship between these mechanisms. For example, our previous work demonstrates that the strength of the trigger is often not proportional to the degree of response and symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frey and Suki, 2008</xref>). Also, the degree of inflammation, airway obstruction and bronchial responsiveness are often not closely related. Response to triggers (e.g., environmental pollutants) can occur with time lags and also in various degrees of intensity depending on the pre-existing conditions of the respiratory system (e.g. increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness following allergic sensitization or viral infection). Such a behavior is better explained by complex system behavior of a chronic disease. However, so far, the latter is difficult to capture and remained a theoretical concept.</p><p>We believe that the current experiment provided significant evidence to support the existence of such system behavior in asthma. In a well-established human challenge model, the respiratory system was challenged with a standardized (viral) stimulus, an established approach to test the behavior of complex network systems. We made the following observations: First, prior and after the challenge a set of lung functional and inflammatory asthma-biomarkers showed temporal fluctuations, in both healthy and asthmatic human subjects. There was a large inter and intra-individual variation. Second, the temporal relationship between inflammatory and lung functional biomarkers and symptoms was weak, not supporting the concept of simple proportional interactions of the above-mentioned causal chain of mechanisms. Third, despite these fluctuations and despite the absence of a strong response to the viral challenge in a distinct mechanistic biomarker, we identified differences between healthy and asthmatic humans in these dynamic variations. This indicates that the complex interactions of inflammatory and lung functional parameters and thus the control of biological responses relevant to the respiratory system must be different in asthma. Our data support the hypothesis of a loss of adaptive capacity in asthma, which impedes the fast return to the pre-challenge stable dynamic steady state. We hypothesize that some clinical phenomena are consistent with such loss of adaptive capacity, such as, for example increased morbidity and prolonged respiratory symptoms after viral infection in asthmatics, persistent bronchial hyperresponsiveness after viral challenge, or slower return of airway obstruction following viral challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busse et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Variable and heterogeneous effect of the viral challenge on lung function and inflammatory/immune biomarkers</title><p>We carried out a quantitative characterization of individual response to the viral perturbation. This was done using two computational/statistical approaches. One approach aimed to capture the changes elicited by the viral challenge taking place over longer time periods (comparison of the pre- and post-challenge time series, viewed as empirical distributions), whereas the other assessed relative short-term changes occurring at shorter time scales (comparison of the magnitude of relative changes observed during 10 day time intervals).</p><p>There is a clear macroscopic/functional manifestation of the kindling RV infection, as reflected at the level of distributional changes induced by the viral challenge on lung function parameters. Indeed, with respect to this criterion, 50% or more statistically significant responders in each of the two groups (healthy and asthmatics) were found (see rows 1–4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref> above). Notably, significant differences found between pre- and post-challenge time series were, in general, not attributable to changes in the variance, as verified using Levene’s test (results not shown). Nevertheless, for most participants the lung function parameters did not show short-term/transient relative changes induced by the viral challenge that were statistically significantly different in magnitude from short-term changes observed during the pre-challenge phase (see columns 4 and 5, and rows 1–4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref> above, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the changes in lung function elicited by the viral challenge are, both for healthy and asthmatic participants, subtle, spread over comparatively longer time periods, and unlike a transient decline. This is in line with the results of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Seemungal et al., 2001</xref>), which concluded that after RV challenge lung function in asthmatic subjects did change, but did not decline dramatically in comparison to the changes observed in healthy controls. In contrast, our analyses indicate that changes in the inflammatory or immunological biomarkers at the cellular or molecular level are short-term and transient in nature (see rows 5–8 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref> above, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Nevertheless, for these parameters fewer responders were found, when compared to the lung function parameters. However, our results also hint at a relatively short time scale of response of these inflammatory/immunological biomarkers. Thus, the sampling frequency used in this study may not entirely capture the rapidly changing magnitudes. The observed differences in the type of response between the lung function and the inflammatory/immunological biomarkers may be a manifestation of the interplay of different temporal and spatial scales.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Potential physiological and inflammatory mechanisms responsible for the biomarker dynamics observed in the group of asthmatics and the resulting reduction in adaptive capacity</title><p>One potential explanation for the differences in biomarker dynamics observed between healthy and asthmatic participants could be the level of airway obstruction. Indeed, Dames et al. quantitatively assessed the overall variability and complexity of airflow time series in patients with COPD during resting breathing. They found that airflow pattern complexity was reduced proportionally to airway obstruction measured with spirometric indices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dames et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Changes at the level of airway smooth muscle (ASM) could also be associated with differences in the dynamics of system properties based on mechanical or environmental triggers affecting airway responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brook, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Noble et al., 2012</xref>). Lack of appropriate ASM-stretch has been associated with pathological incapacities of the asthmatic airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Slats et al., 2007</xref>), which may mechanistically explain the inability to return back to homeokinetic range in asthma after a viral infection.</p><p>Inflammatory mediators and pathways involved in asthma could also explain the observed fluctuations in biomarker dynamics. With respect to the inflammatory biomarker dynamics it is well known that the production of inflammatory mediators is strictly controlled to ensure a limited but effective inflammatory response. To that end, most mRNAs encoding inflammatory mediators contain regulatory motifs like AU-rich elements in their 3’-untranslated region, which affect both transcriptional control, mRNA half-life and translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hao and Baltimore, 2009</xref>). Changes in these regulatory mechanisms are likely to lead to less well-controlled inflammatory responses and in fact beyond that as the expression of many response genes are controlled by these regulatory motifs. We have recently shown that this translational control of AU-rich containing mRNAs in primary bronchial epithelial cells from mild and severe asthma patients compared to that from healthy controls is defective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ravi et al., 2019</xref>). This led to exaggerated ex vivo production of, for example mediators driving neutrophilic inflammation, which correlated with the in vivo neutrophilic inflammation. In a follow-up study (A. Ravi et al, submitted) we showed that a RV16 challenge worsened this defect and with that the neutrophilic inflammation whereas this was not the case in healthy controls. The strong correlations between this defect and neutrophilic inflammation are suggestive of causality although formal proof is still lacking. This defect in the bronchial epithelial cells in asthma may underlie loss of adaptive capacity in response to a RV16 challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>Our findings need to be judged in light of the limitations of our study. One of the limitations is that we only included mild asthmatics and therefore our findings may not be directly translatable to moderate and severe asthma. A similar study setting for severe asthma is not feasible because it is ethically not acceptable to challenge those asthma patients with RV16 and in addition severe asthmatics are likely to be on corticosteroid treatment therefore introducing a confounding factor. Another possible shortcoming of this study is the relatively small sample size. However, this drawback is compensated for by the unprecedented high sampling frequency at which the participants were screened in our study.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Conclusion and implications</title><p>We presented evidence supporting the notion that a chronic disease such as asthma may alter the properties of a homeokinetic physiologic system in a way that compromises its capacity to appropriately react to a possibly harmful environmental stimulus. This loss of adaptive capacity in the asthmatic lung may be understood as changes that render the system overly unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2011</xref>). As a proof of concept, such changes in homeokinetic system properties would provide evidence supporting the idea that not only singular factors in isolation, but their interaction and also system properties, such as the interactions between their constituent parts, may contribute to disease dynamics and phenotype stability.</p><p>This systems-level understanding of chronic asthma may open up new avenues for better understanding of asthma and other chronic dynamic diseases. Already in this small sample size, it is obvious that there is remarkable individual temporal variability in inflammatory and physiological biomarkers, not only in disease but also in health. Thus, dynamic fluctuations of physiological processes around an equilibrium state, including their related biomarkers, are an intrinsic feature of the respiratory system. Moreover, even in health there are strong inter-individual differences in these dynamic characteristics. Nevertheless, within a given healthy subject, fluctuations remain similar following the virus challenge, indicating that, these dynamic fluctuations seem to be in a stable dynamic equilibrium state in health. This characteristic is lost in asthma.</p><p>Future studies involving time series of biomarker measurements may help us understand this system instability in chronic asthma or other airway diseases, even in the absence of severe airway inflammation or obstruction. Furthermore, future therapeutic approaches may want to focus on maintaining a stable homeokinetic equilibrium of the respiratory system, rather than just normalizing single physiological or inflammatory biomarkers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This study was approved by the medical ethical committee from the Amsterdam University Medical Center and registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5426/NL5317).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participant cohort</title><p>Twelve non-smoking, atopic (as determined by positive skin prick test to common aeroallergens), mild to moderate asthmatic subjects (based on ATS/ERS criteria), not using steroids were chosen for inclusion.

All participants were screened for the presence of respiratory viruses just before the challenge, to rule out a concomitant infection resulting in a cold (see Appendix for more details). Those participants with a positive outcome of this test were excluded from the study. An experimental RV16 infection was induced by using a relatively low-dose inoculum of 100 TCID50 (Tissue Culture Infective Dose determining the amount of virus required to cause cytopathy in 50% of the cells) to mimic a natural exposure. The study protocol along with the viral dose used and its safety have been approved by the institutional Medical Ethics Committee in Amsterdam University Medical Centre, the details of which have been included in Appendix. Data from our previous study show that a low dose is sufficient to induce mild cold-symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mallia et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, this low-dose inoculum previously resulted in a slight decrease of FEV1 (loss of asthma control) in asthmatic patients between day 4 and 6 after RV16 exposure, whereas no decrease has been observed in healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grünberg et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Refer to Appendix for further details.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical and computational analysis</title><p>Statistical tests resulting in a p-value less or equal to 0.05 were regarded as significant.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Assessment of differences: Pre- vs. post-viral-challenge</title><p>For each participant, their time series of a given biomarker prior to and after the viral challenge were compared.

The resulting pair-wise distances between distributions were then used for hierarchical clustering of pre- and post-challenge distributions. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and the Appendix for more details. Our clustering approach makes use of the entire time series (distributions) of values measured before and after the challenge, respectively, and does not amalgamate the information into a single magnitude (e.g., the mean value). This method unveils subtle differences and similarities between the participants’ measurements that are less likely to be captured by conventional methods based on averages.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Analysis of biomarker time series in healthy and asthmatic populations using the &quot;Earth Mover's Distance&quot; metric.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depicts two pre-challenge time series of FeNO obtained from a healthy (blue curve), and from an asthmatic (red curve) participant, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Each of the time series is represented as empirical distribution. This representation of the two time series allows for the calculation of a distance or ‘dissimilarity’ between the two by means of the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD). The EMD-comparison of all possible pairs of time series (both pre- and post-challenge) results in a symmetric matrix of pair-wise distances, as shown in (<bold>C</bold>) using a color-coded (violet to green) heat-map. Each row in this matrix corresponds to one time series. The color bar on the left hand side of the matrix encodes the ‘type’ of time series: Cyan marks a pre-challenge time series originating from a healthy participant; Blue marks a post-challenge time series originating from a healthy participant; Pink marks a pre-challenge time series originating from an asthmatic participant; Red marks a post-challenge time series originating from an asthmatic participant. The information stored in the matrix of pair-wise distances is then used within an agglomerative clustering algorithm in order to group the time series in different clusters. The outcome of this procedure is represented using a dendrogram as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> above.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47969-fig2-v4.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Calculation of short-term/transient changes</title><p>For each participant individually, and for each biomarker, throughout the entire period of observation, the biomarker’s relative change in value taking place within time intervals of 10 days was calculated. This choice of time interval length was made based on published literature whereby 5 days post exposure to respiratory viruses was shown to be critical. Hence a 10 day window for comparison would include 5 days before challenge to contrast with 5 days after challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Denlinger et al., 2011</xref>). This was done throughout the entire period of observation considering all possible time intervals consisting of 10 consecutive days. In order to assess the statistical significance of the short-term relative changes possibly elicited by the viral challenge, the magnitude (that is, the absolute value) of relative changes observed during 10 day time intervals starting at least 10 days prior to the challenge were compared, by means of a Mann-Whitney-U-test, to the magnitude of relative changes that took place during 10 day time intervals that contained the day of the challenge. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and the Appendix for more details.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Estimation of short term responses in biomarker time series induced by viral challenge.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical representation of a biomarker time series <italic>t<sub>i</sub></italic>. For the calculation of short-term/transient changes, a gliding interval or window is moved, one day at a time, along the time series.

(<bold>B</bold>) A healthy participant’s time series of short-term relative changes in FeNO is depicted. A gliding interval of size 10 days was used to calculate it from the participant’s time series of FeNO measurements. The start position of the gliding window is expressed relative to the day of the viral challenge, which is marked as day 0. When the position of the gliding window was such that the day of the viral challenge was contained within the gliding window, the corresponding value of the relative change is marked in red. In order to assess the statistical significance of the short-term relative changes possibly elicited by the viral challenge, the relative change values located to the left of those marked in red were compared to the values marked in red by means of a Mann-Whitney-U-test. Visual inspection of the time series in B correctly suggests that the outcome of this test is not significant. The reason being that the relative changes within time intervals of 10 days observed prior to the viral challenge are comparable to changes observed within intervals of the same length containing the day of the viral challenge. (<bold>C</bold>) Depicting data from a different healthy participant, the situation is clearly different, as verified by a significant outcome of the corresponding Mann-Whitney-U-test. In such cases, the participant is called a ‘responder’ with respect to the ‘relative change within 10 days criterion’.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-47969-fig3-v4.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Characterization of the dendrogram clusters</title><p>In order to evaluate the discriminatory power of a given biomarker, the clusters found in the clustering dendrogram were tested for enrichment in or depletion of healthy or asthmatic participants, and/or for enrichment in or depletion of pre- or post-challenge distributions. Statistically significant enrichment or depletion were established using the hypergeometric test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubner et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>The relative location of leaves in the clustering dendrogram was quantitatively evaluated using the cophenetic distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sokal and Rohlf, 1962</xref>). The cophenetic distance between two leaves of a dendrogram is defined as the height of the dendrogram at which the two largest branches that individually contain the two leaves merge into a single branch.</p><p>For every cohort participant and any given biomarker there is a pre-challenge and a post-challenge time series, which we call the participant’s pre- and post-pair. If the disruption caused by the viral challenge is not strong enough, the pre- and post-challenge distributions of a given participant will tend to cluster together. Therefore, a cluster in which pre- and post-pairs are closely located in terms of the cophenetic distance within the dendrogram, represents a subgroup of participants for which the viral challenge caused a relatively weaker disruption, at least with respect to the biomarker under scrutiny.</p><p>Two dendrogram leaves are called neighbors if their mutual cophenetic distance is equal to the minimum of all cophenetic distances from one of the leaves to all the other leaves in the dendrogram. If this condition is fulfilled for both leaves simultaneously, then the two leaves form a two-element cluster in the dendrogram. If the condition is only fulfilled for one of the leaves, the two are still considered neighbors, even if this is not always visually obvious from inspecting the dendrogram (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig16">Appendix 1—figure 16</xref>).</p><p>Under the null-hypothesis that the branching in the dendrogram is the result of a purely random process, the number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs to be expected just by chance within a given cluster can be estimated by simply permuting the labels of the leaves in the dendrogram and counting the number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs.

For example, the healthy participant ‘P08H’ is fully represented in Cluster 2, as both their pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO measurements are members of Cluster 2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> above). Partial representation corresponds to the scenario in which only one of the two time series (pre- and post-challenge) is a member of the cluster. For instance, the asthmatic participant &quot; P07A’ is only partially represented in Cluster 2, because their pre-challenge time series of FeNO measurements is part of Cluster 2, whereas their post-challenge time series of FeNO belongs to Cluster 3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> above).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Autocorrelation of time series</title><p>The autocorrelation of a given time series was calculated using the sample Pearson correlation coefficient of the original time series and the time series resulting after forward-shifting the original time series by the lag utilized.

However, given that the post-viral challenge time series are very short (eleven data points or fewer), resampling would be strongly affected by small sample size effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Isaksson et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we only applied bootstrapping to the pre-challenge time series. Moreover, we resorted to soft bootstrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mucha and Bartel, 2014</xref>) (see Materials and methods below for more details) in order to increase the likelihood that least frequent values in the time series would be chosen during the resampling procedure. The results from 1000 soft bootstrapping iterations were as follows:</p><p>In 100% of the resulting soft bootstrap dendrograms, Cluster 1 (‘outliers’ cluster) was found. Moreover, two additional clusters, one, Cluster 2’, significantly enriched in time series stemming from heathy participants, and another, Cluster 3’, significantly enriched in time series stemming from asthmatic participants were found in 100% of the resulting soft bootstrap dendrograms. In other words, there was always a bootstrap counterpart to clusters 1,2, and three as found in the dendrogram obtained using the original, unperturbed data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in the Main Manuscript).</p><p>In 51.4% of the soft bootstrap dendrograms, Cluster 3’ (the cluster enriched in time series stemming from asthmatic participants) contained a subcluster enriched in post-challenge time series.

This comparison was conducted using a two-way ANOVA, when the data fulfilled the statistical requirements for the conduction of such a test. The latter requirements are normality (tested for using the Shapiro test) and homoscedasticity (tested for using Levene’s test). For those biomarkers or derived magnitudes that did not fulfill the condition of homoscedasticity, the groups were compared pair-wise using the t-test or the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, depending on whether normality and homoscedasticity were given or not. Moreover, the comparison between pre- and post-challenge groups was conducted using the paired versions of the aforementioned tests.

A definite sample size for all biomarkers measured was not possible to be accurately determined. Conventionally, power calculations are based on comparison of groups using a single magnitude. This study was different in this regard, as multiple measurements were incorporated in a longitudinal setting to assess the temporal dynamics of different biomarkers before and after challenge with rhinovirus. Hence a proper a priori power estimation was not feasible due to not yet developed statistical tools.</p><p>However, A sample size of 12/12, based on previous studies with lesser data points, was calculated to identify biomarkers that have a strong, clinically relevant, sensitivity to the changes of disease stability over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turner et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turner et al., 2006b</xref>). This sample size could probably miss capturing the changes in biomarkers with weak effect sizes. Nevertheless, this sample size has for all biomarkers screened provided evidence on long time variability, correlation and cross-correlation between biomarker properties, and susceptibility to strong viral external challenges. These three dimensions are a first estimate to understand the degree of variability and complexity of any disease process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10-2"><title>2. Study Design</title><p>The project represents a prospective observational, follow up study including patients with asthma and healthy controls with an experimental rhinovirus intervention in between.</p><sec id="s10-2-1"><title>2.1 Screening Visit</title><p>First, the subjects were asked to sign an informed consent form after which they were examined for inclusion and exclusion criteria along with medical history and scoring of adverse events and concomitant medication.

Hence ACQ was used on a daily basis to record the daily changes in symptoms. Subjects complete the diary on rising in the morning and retiring at bedtime.</p></sec><sec id="s10-3-2"><title>3.1.2 Skin prick test</title><p>Allergy skin prick tests were performed based on the position paper by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dreborg and Frew, 1993</xref>). The test was done by placing a drop of each of the 12 solutions containing common aeroallergens on the skin, followed by needle pricks by small SPT-lancets. Histamine was used as a positive control and saline solution as a negative control. The test result was considered positive if the skin develops a red, itchy area, called a ‘wheal’, with an average diameter of at least 3 mm, 15 min after the prick. The outline of all wheals was marked with a water-soluble marker and transferred to a test result from using adhesive tape, so as to facilitate measuring of the diameter of the wheal. All test result forms were archived. If the patient has been using anti-allergic medications, they were instructed to stop 3 days prior to the test in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s10-3-3"><title>3.1.3 Spirometry</title><p>Spirometry was performed using a daily calibrated spirometer according to European Respiratory Society (ERS) recommendations. Spirometry was done only once on the screening visit at the clinic. There was no use of bronchodilators (pre/post measurements) in the study. The subjects were asked not to use reliever medications at least 6 hr before the test starts in the clinic. An experienced lung function analyst from the AMC performed the lung function tests throughout the study to reach optimal performance and to enhance reproducibility. Spirometry (FEV1) results were printed out and documented. Home monitoring of morning and evening lung function were done by Peak Expiratory Flow Meter (PEF, Micro Diary, CareFusion).</p><p>Waking and bedtime FEV1 separately are of interest due to the exaggerated diurnal airflow variation seen in asthmatics.

Except for the calculation of transient changes, the time series were treated as empirical distributions, thus disregarding the chronological order of the measurements.</p><p>The empirical distribution of any biomarker before and after viral challenge was compared using Kolmogorov Smirnov test. A participant is considered a responder with respect to a given biomarker if the outcome of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results in a p-value&lt;=0.05. Differences in the variance between the pre- and post-challenge distributions were assessed using Levene’s test.</p><p>The empirical distributions of a given biomarker, prior to and after the viral challenge, were compared to each other using the Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the Main Manuscript. The resulting pair-wise distances between distributions were then used for hierarchical clustering of pre- and post-challenge distributions. Our clustering approach makes use of the entire collection (distribution) of values measured before and after the challenge, respectively, and does not amalgamate the information into a single magnitude (e.g., the mean value). This method unveils subtler differences and similarities between the participants’ measurements that are less likely to be captured by conventional methods based on averages. Therefore, this part of our methodology is based on the distributional properties of each participant’s measurements and neglects the time dimension.</p></sec><sec id="s10-4-2"><title>4.2 Clustering approach</title><p>In our approach, for each biomarker, the measurements collected before and after the viral challenge were used to construct the individual empirical distribution of measurements for each study participant, before and after the challenge, respectively.</p><p>We performed agglomerative hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gan et al., 2007</xref>) of the aforementioned empirical distributions of biomarkers. Within the hierarchical clustering algorithm, the distances between the distributions were calculated using the Earth Mover’s Distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rubner et al., 1998</xref>), and the agglomeration procedure was done according to Ward’s minimum variance method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gan et al., 2007</xref>). Intuitively speaking, the Earth Mover’s Distance contemplates the pair of distributions to be compared as piles of sand and measures the effort that it would take to shovel one distribution into the shape and position of the other (see below for a more detailed description of this method).</p></sec><sec id="s10-4-3"><title>4.3 Calculation of short-term/transient changes</title><p>For each participant individually, throughout the entire period of observation, the relative change of each biomarker taking place within time intervals of 10 days was calculated. This was done throughout the entire period of observation considering all possible time intervals consisting of 10 consecutive days, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in the Main Manuscript. The rationale for this is as follows. Any changes taking place within a period of 10 days that contained the day of the viral challenge need to be interpreted and understood in the context of any changes taking place within a period of about 10 days during the entire pre-challenge phase of the study.</p><p>For each participant, the day of the challenge (i.e., the day of the inoculation) was labeled as ‘day 0’. All days between recruitment and the day of the challenge were labeled with negative integer numbers. All days between the day of the challenge and the participant’s final visit were labeled with positive integer numbers. Given that measurements were not conducted every day on a given participant (see study design above), for each biomarker considered in this study and for each participant separately, interpolation was used in order to have, for every biomarker one value for every day. Except for the total cell count in nasal lavage fluid, and the percentages of eosinophils and neutrophils in nasal lavage fluid, which were linearly interpolated, all biomarker time series were interpolated using cubic splines with natural boundary conditions (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartels et al., 1995</xref>). These interpolated values were only used for the assessment of the short-term/transient response.</p><p>The time interval of 10 days was decided based on prior knowledge where differences in signals from biomarkers (lung function etc.) usually take not less than a week to subside</p><p>As a sensitivity analysis, the same calculations were repeated using a 7 day time interval (data not shown). The outcomes were very similar to the ones obtained using the 10 day interval.</p><p>Consequently, a 10 day time period was considered optimal to calculate the short term/transient changes.</p></sec><sec id="s10-4-4"><title>4.4 Characterization of the dendrogram clusters</title><p>The clusters obtained using the clustering dendrogram were tested for enrichment in or depletion of healthy or asthmatic participants, and/or for enrichment in or depletion of pre- or post-challenge distributions.</p><p>The relative location of leaves in the clustering dendrogram was quantitatively evaluated using the cophenetic distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sokal and Rohlf, 1962</xref>). The cophenetic distance between two leaves of a dendrogram is defined as the height of the dendrogram at which the two largest branches that individually contain the two leaves merge into a single branch.</p><p>For every cohort participant and any given biomarker there is a pre-challenge and a post-challenge time series, which we call the participant’s pre- and post-pair. If the disruption caused by the viral challenge is not strong enough, the pre- and post-challenge distributions of a given participant will tend to cluster together. Therefore, a cluster in which pre- and post-pairs are closely located in terms of the cophenetic distance within the dendrogram, represents a subgroup of participants for which the viral challenge caused a relatively weaker disruption, at least with respect to the biomarker under scrutiny.</p><p>Two dendrogram leaves are called neighbors if their mutual cophenetic distance is equal to the minimum of all cophenetic distances from one of the leaves to all the other leaves in the dendrogram. If this condition is fulfilled for both leaves simultaneously, then the two leaves form a two-element cluster in the dendrogram. If the condition is only fulfilled for one of the leaves, the two are still considered neighbors, even if this is not always visually obvious from inspecting the dendrogram (see Figure below).</p><p>Under the null-hypothesis that the branching in the dendrogram is the result of a purely random process, the number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs to be expected just by chance within a given cluster can be estimated by simply permuting the labels of the leaves in the dendrogram and counting the number of neighboring pre- and post-pairs. This permutation test is used for calculating the empirical p-values displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref> in the Main Manuscript.</p><fig id="app1fig16" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 16.</label><caption><title>Panel A: Cluster dendrogram obtained via hierarchical clustering of the participants’ pre- and post-challenge time series of FeNO.</title><p>The distance between any two-time series was calculated using the EMD. Rectangles mark the clusters identified. Panel B displays a more detailed view of the second cluster. According to the definition of neighboring leaves provided in the text above, the leaves P03H_Uninf and P03H_Inf are neighbors in this dendrogram (highlighted in red). The reason for this is that the cophenetic distance from leaf P03H_Uninf to leaf P03H_Inf is equal to the minimum of all distances from leaf P03H_Uninf to all other leaves in the dendrogram. This is not the case for the leaf P03H_Inf. However, the fact that this condition holds for at least one of the two leaves renders them neighboring. Leaves P08H_Inf and P08H_Uninf, and P11H_Inf and P11H_Uninf, are neighbors, respectively (the latter pair is not marked in color). P08A_Inf and P08A_Uninf are also neighbors; In this case, the minimum condition is fulfilled by both leaves for of this leaf-pair.

of a number of phenotypic markers (both physiologic and biologic) related to asthma, following viral challenge in normal versus asthmatic subjects. Cluster analysis shows that the normals tended to retain the same characteristics after challenge that they exhibited prior to challenge, while the times series data from the asthmatics changed significantly after challenge. The authors interpret these findings as indicative of a general systems response to viral challenge that demonstrates a failure of restorative control in the asthmatics (termed homeokinesis).</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Loss of adaptive capacity in asthmatics revealed by biomarker fluctuation dynamics on experimental rhinovirus challenge&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main issue with the paper is that the reviewers and editors would like to become convinced that the major conclusions are of sufficient interest and in some way useful. Statements like &quot;loss of adaptive capacity&quot; and &quot;failure of homeokinesis&quot; may sound compelling in a general sense, they do not actually mean anything specific, and are thus unhelpful in elucidating the nature of asthma (see also comment 3).</p><p>2) Although the manuscript is of potential interest, in its current form it is still very difficult to follow. Data presentation, Introduction and Discussion should be thoroughly improved to make it more understandable to the non-expert reader. For example the Introduction should be rewritten.

However, it is not clear what we have actually learned from this study. The time-series methods used are empirical in the sense that, while they can suggest that something is different between groups, little insight is provided about the mechanistic bases for these differences. For example, it is stated in the Discussion that &quot;…these homeokinetic system characteristics of the lung likely contribute to the stability and dynamic phenotype of asthmatic disease.&quot; This seems to be a general statement one might make about any disease, but how it does it help us to understand asthma in particular. The fact that &quot;FeNO and eosinophil time series were similar prior to and following the challenge in healthy subjects&quot; is hardly a surprise given that asthma is typically characterized by type 2 allergic inflammation; there is clearly something about asthmatic subjects that makes them respond in this way when normal individuals do not, but saying that this is due to a failure of adaptive capacity is essentially just saying that there is something wrong with them. What we need to know is exactly what it is that is wrong with them, and concepts like loss of adaptive capacity and failure of homeokinesis do not seem to help much in this regard.</p><p>4) Perhaps some more conventional time-series analyses could be helpful. For example, it is stated that the difference found between the pre and post challenge time series were &quot;not attributable to changes in the variance&quot;, which raises the question as what there were attributable to. There are two general possibilities – either the amplitude structures of the series (i.e., their histograms) were different, or their correlation structures (i.e., power spectra) were different (or perhaps both). Knowing more about this could help generate hypotheses about what was going on in the asthmatic subjects. For example, if the data in the asthmatic subjects were more strongly auto-correlated then maybe this would be indicative of some process related to a biorhythm. In any case, what is needed in this study is an analysis that leads to hypothesis about specific biologic mechanisms operative in asthma.</p><p>5) Discussion, second paragraph: &quot;…provocation tests in asthma…implicitly rely on the assumption of loss of adaptive capacity…&quot; We do not agree with this statement. Provocation tests in asthma rely on the fact that asthmatic subjects response more vigorously to airway challenge than do non-asthmatic subjects for a variety of reasons related to responsiveness of the airway smooth muscle, increased mucus secretions, and possibly airway wall remodeling. What does adaptive capacity have to do with this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47969.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main issue with the paper is that the reviewers and editors would like to become convinced that the major conclusions are of sufficient interest and in some way useful.

With this study we did not intend to achieve the ambitious goal of elucidating the nature of asthma by means of finding mechanistic explanations.

By definition, an experimental assessment of a physiological system’s level of adaptive capacity needs to be interventional, i.e., using an external perturbation. Consequently, the time series that we measured within this study are inevitably non-stationary after the viral challenge. On the other hand, most of the conventional time-series analysis methods require that the time series being analyzed is stationary (see, e.g., Manuca R. et al., Stationarity and nonstationarity in time series analysis, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, Volume 99, Issues 2–3, 1996, Pages 134-161, ISSN 0167-2789). These circumstances limit the range of methodological approaches that can be applied. However, as the reviewer correctly points out, the histograms of the time series, that is, the empirical distribution of the data in a given time series is a meaningful quantitative way of looking at changes in the overall dynamics of the system being observed. This is precisely what we do when we use the Earth Mover’s Distance, which calculates the dissimilarity between two given time series in terms of the differences between their corresponding empirical distributions.</p><p>Moreover, we would like to thank the reviewer for their suggestion of looking at the autocorrelation properties of the time series. We carried out this analysis and indeed found a statistically significant difference between the healthy group and the asthmatics group in terms of the autocorrelation properties of FeNO time series after the challenge. Furthermore, for three lung function parameters there is a moderate positive autocorrelation before the challenge, which then disappears after the challenge. These findings are now described in a whole new sub-section in the Results section entitled “Autocorrelation properties of the biomarker time series”.</p><p>Finally, we try to discuss possible biological mechanisms operative in asthma in a new subsection of the Discussion entitled “Physiological interpretation of the group differences in autocorrelation properties of the biomarker time series”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion, second paragraph: &quot;…provocation tests in asthma…implicitly rely on the assumption of loss of adaptive capacity…&quot; We do not agree with this statement. Provocation tests in asthma rely on the fact that asthmatic subjects response more vigorously to airway challenge than do non-asthmatic subjects for a variety of reasons related to responsiveness of the airway smooth muscle, increased mucus secretions, and possibly airway wall remodeling. What does adaptive capacity have to do with this.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. Even though we could argue that changes in responsiveness of the airway smooth muscle are a representation of a loss of adaptive capacity, we are taking the message that we need to be more specific here. In order to avoid confusion, we have removed this statement. Instead, as indicated above, we have added a more general discussion on the potential mechanistic background of our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
