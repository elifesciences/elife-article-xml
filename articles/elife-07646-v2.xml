(mRNAs) targeted for repression. An enigmatic feature of many conserved mammalian miRNA target sites is that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 confers enhanced target repression independently of base pairing potential to the miRNA. In this study, we show that human Argonaute2 (Ago2) possesses a solvated surface pocket that specifically binds adenine nucleobases in the 1 position (t1) of target RNAs. t1A nucleotides are recognized indirectly through a hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules that preferentially interacts with the N6 amine on adenine. t1A nucleotides are not utilized during the initial binding of Ago2 to its target, but instead function by increasing the dwell time on target RNA. We also show that N6 adenosine methylation blocks t1A recognition, revealing a possible mechanism for modulation of miRNA target site potency.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07646.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07646.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Stretches of DNA known as genes provide the instructions to make the proteins and RNA molecules a cell needs to work. To make a protein, the gene is used as a template to make a type of RNA molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA), which is subsequently ‘translated’ into a protein. Most genes do not need to produce proteins all of the time, and so cells have several ways of stopping proteins from being made. For example, the Argonaute family of proteins prevents mRNA molecules from being translated into proteins.</p><p>Argonautes are guided to their targets by short RNA molecules called microRNAs. RNA molecules are made up of a sequence of building blocks known as nucleotides, each of which can only bind to one other type of nucleotide. If part of the nucleotide sequence of a microRNA molecule corresponds with part of the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA, the two RNA molecules will bind to each other. This enables the microRNA and the Argonaute protein to prevent the mRNA being translated. If the mRNA has an adenine nucleotide in a particular position (called ‘t1’) near the binding region in the mRNA sequence, Argonaute proteins will prevent translation more effectively. An adenine nucleotide in the t1 position is also known as a t1A nucleotide.</p><p>In 2014, researchers revealed the structure of a human Argonaute protein called Argonaute2 when it is bound to a microRNA-mRNA pair. This revealed that t1A nucleotides—but not other nucleotide types in the t1 position—interact with a ‘pocket’ in the Argonaute protein. However, it was not clear how the adenine nucleotide is recognized.</p><p>Now, Schirle et al.—including several of the researchers involved in the 2014 work—use a technique called X-ray crystallography to examine how the t1A nucleotide interacts with Argonaute2 in more detail. This revealed that the Argonaute2 pocket contains many water molecules that form an organized network. This network interacts with part of the t1A nucleotide and helps to lock Argonaute2 onto its microRNA target sites. The discovery of the pocket and how t1A is recognized may now be used to design more effective ‘anti-miRs’—synthetic microRNA inhibitors that can treat diseases in which microRNAs work incorrectly, a feature common to many forms of cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07646.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07646.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>microRNA</kwd><kwd>Argonaute</kwd><kwd>RNA silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM104475, P41-GM103403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacRae</surname><given-names>Ian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>309509</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Joo</surname><given-names>Chirlmin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000015</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-76SF00515, DE-AC02-05CH11231, DE-AC02-06CH11357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacRae</surname><given-names>Ian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schirle</surname><given-names>Nicole T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sheu-Gruttadauria</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Argonaute proteins directly contact adenosine nucleotides in some miRNA target sites, leading to enhanced repression of the target mRNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of regulatory molecules with diverse biological functions in plants and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lagos-Quintana et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee and Ambros, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reinhart et al., 2002</xref>). Over two thousand unique human miRNA sequences have been reported and more than half of all protein-coding human genes are predicted to contain a conserved miRNA recognition site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Friedman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011</xref>). miRNAs function as guides for Argonaute proteins, which use the sequence information encoded in each miRNA to identify complementary sties in mRNAs targeted for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meister et al., 2004</xref>). Argonautes then recruit additional silencing factors that mediate translational repression and degradation of the targeted mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Pioneering studies in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> showed that perfect complementarity between miRNAs and their targets is not necessary for silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wightman et al., 1993</xref>). Examination of regulatory elements in fly mRNAs then revealed a striking degree of complementarity to the 5′ ends of subset of conserved miRNAs, suggesting that base paring interactions with nucleotides towards the 5′ end of the miRNA are particularly important for target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lai, 2002</xref>). Indeed, phylogenetic analysis showed that pairing to the miRNA ‘seed region’ (nt 2–7 or 2–8, from the miRNA 5′ end) is the most evolutionarily conserved feature of miRNA targets in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>), and complementarity to the miRNA seed is generally sufficient to elicit significant levels of target recognition and repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doench and Sharp, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2005</xref>). Careful comparison of miRNA seed-matched sites in the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of human, mouse, rat, dog, and chicken genomes also revealed that an adenosine (A) nucleotide opposite miRNA nucleotide-1 is a conserved feature of many vertebrate miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). These t1A nucleotides confer enhanced repression of miRNA targets beyond pairing to the seed region alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Selbach et al., 2008</xref>). Curiously, unlike the seed-matched region, t1A nucleotides function independently of the identity of miRNA nucleotide-1, indicating that t1A recognition occurs through a mechanism that is distinct from base pairing with the miRNA guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baek et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported crystal structures of human Argonaute2 (Ago2) bound to a guide RNA and short, seed-paired target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schirle et al., 2014</xref>). These structures revealed that Ago2 cradles the duplex formed by miRNA nucleotides 2–7 and the complementary target RNA, explaining why seed pairing is critical for recognition of miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also noted that t1A nucleotides interact with a surface pocket formed at the interface of the L2 and MID domains of Ago2, and proposed that this additional interaction may contribute to the affinity of Ago2 for miRNA target sites. However, the t1-nucleotide binding pocket is large enough to accommodate any of the four natural RNA bases, and the contacts between Ago2 and t1A appear to be almost entirely non-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear how A nucleotides in the t1 position of miRNA targets are recognized and confer enhanced repression. In this study, we show that the t1-nucleotide binding pocket in Ago2 preferentially interacts with A nucleotides through water-mediated contacts to adenosine N6 amine. Adding a methyl group to the t1A N6 amine reduces target affinity, raising the possibility that adenosine methylation could, in principle, lead to partial derepression of miRNA targets containing 7mer-A1 or 8mer sites. We also present data indicating that t1A is not used in the initial search for target sites, but instead provides an anchor that helps retain Ago2 on seed-matched sites on target RNAs.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the t1 nucleotide binding pocket.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Linear schematic of the Argonaute2 (Ago2) primary structure.

The overall conformation of Ago2 is nearly identical in the four different t1 structures, indicating that identity of the t1 nucleotide does not affect the structure of the protein. Inspection of target RNA omit maps, in which the target RNAs were excluded from refinement, revealed little or no well-defined electron density for all of the non-A nucleotides, indicating that the non-A t1 nucleotides were mostly disordered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, the target omit map from the t1A data set had clearly defined density for the t1A inside the t1-nucleotide binding pocket. Moreover, although residual electron density was observed for t1G and t1C nucleotides, binding experiments using the same target RNAs show that these interactions do not contribute substantially to target affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We conclude that, although the t1-binding site is large enough to accommodate any of the four natural RNA bases, adenine is the only nucleobase that associates stably enough to contribute to overall target affinity.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Crystallographic and refinement statistics for wild-type Ago2-guide-target complexes</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07646.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07646.004</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Target RNA</th><th>t1-C</th><th>t1-G</th><th>t1-U</th><th>t1-DAP</th><th>t1-Inosine</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>PDB code</td><td>4Z4C</td><td>4Z4D</td><td>4Z4E</td><td>4Z4F</td><td>4Z4G</td></tr><tr><td>Space group</td><td>P12<sub>1</sub>1</td><td>P12<sub>1</sub>1</td><td>P12<sub>1</sub>1</td><td>P12<sub>1</sub>1</td><td>P12<sub>1</sub>1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Unit cell dimensions</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>a</italic> (Å)</td><td>55.69</td><td>55.74</td><td>55.64</td><td>55.86</td><td>55.66</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>b</italic> (Å)</td><td>116.56</td><td>117.02</td><td>116.84</td><td>116.60</td><td>117.0</td></tr><tr><td> <italic>c</italic> (Å)</td><td>69.61</td><td>69.87</td><td>69.74</td><td>70.38</td><td>70.1</td></tr><tr><td> β (°)</td><td>92.43</td><td>92.43</td><td>92.43</td><td>92.52</td><td>92.40</td></tr><tr><td>Ago2 per ASU</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Data collection</td></tr><tr><td> Wavelength (Å)</td><td>0.97945</td><td>0.97950</td><td>0.97918</td><td>0.97950</td><td>0.97950</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>38.85–2.30 (2.38–2.30)</td><td>39.01–1.60 (1.63–1.60)</td><td>55.60–1.80 (1.90–1.80)</td><td>38.86–2.80 (2.95–2.80)</td><td>39.01–2.70 (2.83–2.70)</td></tr><tr><td> Total reflections</td><td>133,678</td><td>532,622</td><td>351,634</td><td>65,587</td><td>75,249</td></tr><tr><td> Unique reflections</td><td>38,614</td><td>113775</td><td>82,071</td><td>21,078</td><td>24,061</td></tr><tr><td> Completeness (%)</td><td>98.4 (96.3)</td><td>96.8 (93.5)</td><td>99.7 (99.7)</td><td>95.0 (92.6)</td><td>97.2 (91.9)</td></tr><tr><td> Redundancy</td><td>3.5 (3.4)</td><td>4.7 (4.6)</td><td>4.3 (3.7)</td><td>3.1 (3.0)</td><td>3.1 (2.9)</td></tr><tr><td> I/σI</td><td>13.1 (2.2)</td><td>13.7 (2.0)</td><td>10.3 (1.9)</td><td>9.9 (2.4)</td><td>9.6 (2.2)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>merge</sub></td><td>7.7 (53.0)</td><td>5.5 (74.9)</td><td>9.8 (81.9)</td><td>9.8 (57.7)</td><td>8.4 (48.2)</td></tr><tr><td> R<sub>pim</sub></td><td>7.3 (49.2)</td><td>3.1 (59.0)</td><td>5.3 (47.4)</td><td>9.7 (57.1)</td><td>6.4 (36.3)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6">Refinement</td></tr><tr><td> Resolution (Å)</td><td>35.30–2.30</td><td>39.01–1.60</td><td>40.27–1.80</td><td>35.47–2.80</td><td>35.41–2.70</td></tr><tr><td> R-<sub>free</sub>/R-<sub>factor</sub></td><td>21.86/16.93</td><td>18.90/16.31</td><td>18.54/15.75</td><td>23.30/18.39</td><td>22.44/17.86</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"> R.M.S. deviation</td></tr><tr><td>  Bond distances (Å)</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.014</td><td>0.007</td><td>0.006</td><td>0.008</td></tr><tr><td>  Bond angles (°)</td><td>1.454</td><td>1.460</td><td>1.131</td><td>0.903</td><td>0.989</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"> Number of atoms</td></tr><tr><td>  Non-hydrogen, protein</td><td>6429</td><td>6469</td><td>6429</td><td>6421</td><td>6404</td></tr><tr><td>  Non-hydrogen, RNA</td><td>568</td><td>580</td><td>552</td><td>571</td><td>572</td></tr><tr><td>  Phenol</td><td>28</td><td>28</td><td>28</td><td>21</td><td>28</td></tr><tr><td>  Isopropanol</td><td>4</td><td>20</td><td>8</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>  Phosphate</td><td>10</td><td>0</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>  Mg</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>  Water</td><td>279</td><td>554</td><td>545</td><td>16</td><td>105</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6"> Ramachandran Plot</td></tr><tr><td>  Most favored regions</td><td>95.33%</td><td>96.79%</td><td>96.97%</td><td>94.93%</td><td>95.17%</td></tr><tr><td>  Additionally allowed</td><td>4.54%</td><td>3.21%</td><td>3.03%</td><td>4.94%</td><td>4.83%</td></tr><tr><td>  Generously llowed</td><td>0.13%</td><td>0.00%</td><td>0.00%</td><td>0.13%</td><td>0.00%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The t1 nucleotide binding pocket specifically recognizes adenosine Strong electron density was observed for adenosine in the t1-binding pocket, but not t1C, G, or U.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) T1A target RNA omit map contoured at 3σ (grey mesh).

We dissected the influence of these two elements on t1-binding by examining interactions with target RNAs with either inosine (I) or 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP) in the t1 position. DAP has an N6 amine (like adenine), and an N2 amine (like guanine). Conversely, inosine has an O6 carbonyl (like guanine), but lacks an N2 amine (like adenine). Ago2 bound the t1I target with an affinity similar to t1G (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) and no electron density was observed for the t1I nucleotide target omit maps, indicating that removal of the guanine N2 amine is insufficient to promote interactions with the t1-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, we observed unambiguous electron density for the t1DAP nucleotide, which bound Ago2 in the same position and <italic>anti</italic> conformation as t1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, the affinity of the t1DAP target is ∼1.7-fold greater than that of the equivalent t1A target, indicating that Ago2 has a modest, though significant, preference for t1DAP over t1A (p-value = 0.0025; two-tailed, unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). We conclude that the purine N6 and N2 amines both have positive effects on t1-binding, and that the N6 amine is the major determinant for distinguishing the t1A purine ring from tG. Consistent with this idea, adding a methyl group to the t1A N6 amine reduced target affinity to that of a non-t1A target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A purine N6 amine is required for t1 nucleotide recognition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structures of adenosine, 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), guanosine, and inosine (I) nucelobases.

Because the serine alcohol can function as both a hydrogen bond acceptor and donor, it is unlikely that this interaction alone can discriminate a purine N6 amine from an O6 carbonyl. Inspection of the atoms surrounding Ser-561 revealed no set of interactions that could conceivably steer the hydrogen-bonding capacity of the serine alcohol. However, examination of the solvent surrounding the t1A nucleobase identified four ordered water molecules in a hydrogen-bonding network that could selectively interact with purine N6 amines. In this model, both hydrogen atoms in water ‘A’ are engaged in hydrogen bonds with the main chain carbonyls of Lys-440 and Met-437 (and possibly the main chain carbonyl of Asp-480), leaving only lone pair electrons available for interactions with water ‘B’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Water B must therefore donate one hydrogen atom to establish a hydrogen bond with water A. The second hydrogen atom in water B is likely involved in a hydrogen bond with the main chain carbonyl of Ile-477. Thus, our model suggests that Ago2 uses main chain carbonyls inside the t1-binding pocket to direct the hydrogen atoms on water B away from the purine 6-position, leaving only lone pair electrons available for establishing interactions with t1 nucleotides. In the proposed orientation, the lone pair electrons on water B are positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from purine N6 amines and to repel O6 carbonyls. Waters ‘C’ and ‘D’ likely provide an additional layer of selectivity through interactions with the unprotonated N1 amine on t1A, and may interact with the purine N2 amine, which does not directly contact Ago2.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Water-mediated recognition of t1A.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Water network within the t1-binding pocket.

Measuring the time of the first arrival revealed that Ago2 recognizes the three targets at similar rates (<italic>k</italic><sub>on(obs)</sub> = 0.040 ± 0.009, 0.033 ± 0.004, and 0.041 ± 0.008 s<sup>−1</sup> nM<sup>−1</sup> for t1U, t1A, and t1DAP targets, respectively), demonstrating that t1-nucleotide identity has little, if any, effect on the association of Ago2 with target RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In contrast, the average dwell time (Δ<italic>τ</italic>) of Ago2 on the t1A and t1DAP targets was more than threefold longer than on the t1U target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The combined results suggest that t1A nucleotides are not used for initial target site recognition, but instead function primarily by enhancing the stability of the Ago2:target interaction after seed-pairing.</p><p>We note that, although the Δ<italic>τ</italic> distribution of t1U is well described by a single-exponential decay (Δ<italic>τ</italic> = 1.64 ± 0.11 s, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.994), the Δ<italic>τ</italic> distributions of t1A and t1DAP deviate noticeably from ideal (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.972 and 0.961 for t1A and t1DAP, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, gray lines). This observation indicates that t1A and t1DAP binding events consist of at least two discrete populations. Assuming only two populations exist, we fit each data set to a double-exponential decay and calculated that about half of the binding events (49.8% ± 6.2% and 44.6% ± 4.4% for t1A and t1DAP, respectively) had dwell times closely matching that of the t1U target (Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> (t1A) = 1.61 ± 0.29 s; Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> (t1DAP) = 1.97 ± 0.24).

The simplest explanation for these observations is that, when using limited seed-pairing as in our experimental setup, Ago2 dissociates from the target RNA without stably engaging t1A about half of the time. However, in cases in which Ago2 does engage t1A, the affinity of the interaction is increased substantially. This effect is exaggerated with t1DAP, which stabilizes the association further still. Notably, the t1A nucleobase inserts into the t1-binding pocket at an angle nearly orthogonal to the trajectory of the paired target RNA as it extends into the central cleft of Ago2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Based on this observation, we suggest that t1A binding increases the dwell time on target RNAs by anchoring Ago2 to seed-paired target sites and inhibiting dissociation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we provide evidence that human Ago2 contains a t1-nucleotide binding pocket that specifically recognizes adenine nucleobases through water-mediated contacts. Our model is reminiscent of interactions in the <italic>trp</italic> operator/repressor complex, which also uses an ordered network of hydrogen-bonded water molecules to achieve nucleobase recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otwinowski et al., 1988</xref>). We also show that the adenosine N6 amine is a key determinant of specificity and that the addition of a methyl group to the N6 amine blocks t1A recognition. Taken with the finding that m6A modifications are enriched in mammalian mRNA 3′ UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>), this result raises the intriguing possibility that, in some cases, miRNA targets may be partially derepressed via adenosine methylation at 7mer-A1 and 8mer sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Insights into t1 recognition by Ago2 can also be extended to other eukaryotic members of the Argonaute protein family. The amino acids making up the t1-binding site in Ago2 are conserved in all four human Argonaute proteins, and the structure of the t1-binding pocket in Ago2 is nearly identical to the same region in the structure of human Ago1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faehnle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakanishi et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, two ordered water molecules corresponding to waters A and B were observed in the structure of human Ago1 crystallized in the absence of target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nakanishi et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore suggest that all four human Argonautes likely recognize t1A nucleotides using the same mechanism. Additionally, recent studies indicate that some members of the Piwi clade of Argonaute proteins also display t1-nucleotide preferences. Specifically, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein Aubergine, the silkmoth protein Siwi, and the mouse protein Mili preferentially cleave targets bearing a t1A; while mouse protein Miwi2 prefers targets with a t1 purine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). We note that most Piwi proteins displaying t1 preferences have conserved residues lining the t1-binding site (with the notable exception of Mili, which appears to lack several residues homologous to the t1A-binding residues in Ago2). In contrast, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and silkmoth Ago3, which do not display t1 preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2014</xref>), lack homology in key residues making up the t1-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, both t1A and t1U nucleotides are conserved features of many miRNA target sites, indicating that the Argonaute proteins Alg-1 and Alg-2 also have t1 nucleotide preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jan et al., 2011</xref>). Curiously, there are only two minor differences between residues making up the human Ago2 t1-binding pocket and the equivalent residues in Alg-1 and Alg-2 (Asn-429 and Arg-479 in Ago2). Conceivably, these substitutions could reorganize the t1-pocket water network to recognize both adenine and uracil nucleobases. Alternatively, we suggest that Alg-1 and Alg-2 may specifically bind t1A, and that conservation of miRNA sites with t1U is connected to recognition by one or more of the other <italic>C. elegans</italic> Argonaute proteins.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.012</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Conservation in the t1A-binding pocket.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of the Ago2 t1A-binding pocket with major structural elements indicated.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Phillip Zamore (Reviewing Editor), Yukihide Tomari, and David Bartel (peer reviewers).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Despite the presence of a complementary guide g1 nucleotide, the t1 target nucleotide is typically recognized by Argonaute proteins rather than base pairing. In mammals, miRNA target sites often have an adenosine (A) across from the first nucleotide of the guide miRNAs. Such a “t1A” preference is observed also for a subset of PIWI proteins in flies and mice. Recent crystal structures of human Ago2 revealed the existence of a surface pocket at the interface of the L2 linker and the MID domain, which can accommodate the t1 nucleotide. However, the pocket is apparently too large to discriminate among the four nucleotides, so it has been unclear why t1A is specifically preferred. In this manuscript, Schirle et al. report the structures of human Ago2 bound to target RNAs with various nucleotides at the t1 position. MacRae and colleagues find report that a network of water molecules in the t1A pocket provides the specificity for recognizing adenine, especially via its N6 amine. Using single-molecule imaging, the authors suggest that the t1A nucleotide is not used for the initial association with target, but instead slows dissociation of RISC from the target. Finally, the authors identify a base analog, di-aminopurine, that binds more tightly than adenine, leading them to suggest that novel bases could be designed to provide additional specificity to anti-miRNA drugs. The manuscript would be improved by addressing the points below, but otherwise is entirely appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) “[S]liding off of target sites” implies a specific physical model in which Ago2 departs from its seed-matched binding site but not the RNA itself.

If a double-exponential is, in fact, justified, what is the meaning of the t1A single-molecule data fitting a double exponential? That is, what is the physical basis for the 16% of RISC that is slow-to-dissociate?

The simplest explanation is that the two populations represent binding events in which Ago2 either does or does not stably engage t1A before dissociating. This model is supported by: 1) the observation that the dwell time of the short-lived t1A binding events (Δτ<sub>1</sub> = 1.61 sec) closely matches the dwell time of t1U (Δτ = 1.64 sec); and, 2) the long-lived dwell time (Δτ<sub>2</sub> = 8.69 sec) can be increased further still by replacing t1A with t1DAP (Δτ<sub>2</sub> = 12.87 sec); and, 3) t1A and t1DAP do not influence on-rates, demonstrating that their effects on affinity manifest after seed-pairing.</p><p>Separately, we note that in the first submission we used incorrect formulas for estimating the percentages of Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> and Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub> populations within a double exponential decay. Specifically, in the initial submission, we used wrong equations for the percentages, <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>/(<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>) and <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>/(<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>), where <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub> are the coefficients of exponentials. This estimate resulted in 16% for the slow-to-dissociate population. With correct equations, <italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>Δ<italic>τA</italic> and <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub><italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>A</italic><sub>1</sub>Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>1</sub> + <italic>A</italic><sub>2</sub>Δ<italic>τ</italic><sub>2</sub>, we calculate that the slow-to-dissociate population constitutes ∼50% of the binding events. This change does not alter our interpretation of the slow-to-dissociate population. Rather, it indicates that the t1A influences the dissociation pathway to a larger extent than we initially estimated. The correct formulas are described in a new section in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) Given that the water molecules are critical in the wild-type t1A structure, the omit map for the four water molecules should be shown (for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref> <italic>or 4A). The authors should also note whether the four water molecules are observed in the non-t1A structures. In other words, is the hydrogen-bonding network of water molecules formed independently of or in coordination with t1A binding?</italic></p><p>As suggested, we added a water-omit map calculated from the t1-A dataset to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. We also note that ordered water molecules corresponding to waters A, B and D are clearly observed in the t1-U electron density map. Taken with the observation of water molecules equivalent to A and B in the crystal structure of Ago1 in the absence of target RNA (Nakanishi, et al., Cell Reports 2013; PDB ID 4KXT), it appears that Ago organizes t1-binding pocket water molecules, at least to some extent, prior to t1-A binding.</p><p><italic>4) At the end of the subsection “A purine N6 amine is required for t1 recognition”, the authors state that the N2 amine has a positive effect on t1 binding but do not describe what kind of interactions are made between the N2 amine and Ago2. Do the authors observe the similar interactions for the N2 amine of t1G?</italic></p><p>The N2 amine does not directly contact Ago2 and thus it is difficult to explain the observed increases in dwell time and affinity. Our currently favored explanation is that the N2 amine may make positive interactions with water C, possibly moving it into hydrogen-bonding distance of water B. This idea is based on a positive difference density peak, which may correspond to the repositioned water C, observed in the t1-G data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). We speculate that a similar change in solvent position may occur with t1-DAP binding. Unfortunately, the t1-DAP dataset is relatively low resolution (2.8 Å) and we were not able to model any water molecules in the t1-pocket with confidence. Without direct observation of repositioned water molecules in the t1-DAP structure, we are hesitant to put this model forward and thus simply added the sentence: “Waters “C” and “D” likely provide an additional layer of selectivity through interactions with the unprotonated N1 amine on t1-A, and may interact with the purine N2 amine, which does not directly contact Ago2” to state that N2 does not contact Ago2”.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07646.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Electron density maps surrounding the t1-G nucleotide.</title><p>2Fo-Fc map is shown contoured at 1σ(blue mesh).

We found that a t1-m6A target RNA had an affinity similar to that of equivalent non-t1-A targets (see updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), indicating that the modification effectively blocks t1-A recognition. This result further supports the idea that the N6 amine is a key determinant in t1-A recognition and raises the intriguing possibility that adenosine methylation could lead to partial derepression of miRNA targets containing 7mer-A1 or 8mer sites.</p><p><italic>5) At the end of the subsection “Disruption of the water network extinguishes t1-A recognition“ and in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5A</italic></xref><italic>, it is difficult to see the positional relationship between T481 and t1A, which probably could be better shown in a separate figure.</italic></p><p>We apologize for this shortcoming and added panel E to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to specifically illustrate the spatial relationship between T481 and t1A.</p><p><italic>6) It would be good to test by single-molecule analysis that the A481T mutant and/or t1-Inosine do not increase the dwell time</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for this thoughtful suggestion. We conducted a slightly different experiment and measured association/dissociation rates of a target RNA with t1-DAP, with dual purposes of further aligning the bulk and single molecule studies, as well as providing insights into why t1-DAP binds better than t1-A. Consistent with the bulk studies, single molecule measurements showed an increase in affinity for t1-DAP over t1-A. The increase in affinity comes entirely from an increase in the average dwell time, with the on-rate unaffected by the additional N2 amine. These results support the notion that t1-nucleotides are not used in the initial target search.</p><p><italic>7) The</italic> k<sub>on</sub> <italic>and</italic> k<sub>off</sub> <italic>values from the single-molecule data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref> <italic>result in KD values 50-fold higher than those determined from the ensemble assays (</italic><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"><italic>Table 2</italic></xref><italic>).

The target RNAs used in the ensemble and the single molecule experiments are different from each other in several respects. The ensemble assays used very short target RNAs (11 nt) that pair to guide nt 2–9, which provided the best diffracting crystals. Our rational was that using the same RNAs for binding experiments and structure determination would be the best way to correlate structural findings with affinity measurements. The single molecule experiments, on the other hand, required longer target RNAs (69 nt) for reliable photophysics (to establish an optimum distance between donor and acceptor dyes) that paired to guide nt 2–7 (to work in an affinity range where dwell times could be accurately measured). We added a footnote to the subsection “t1A interactions increase the dwell time of Ago2 on miRNA target sites” to direct the reader to these differences.</p><p>We also note that, despite substantially different experimental setups and differences in target RNA sequence, length and guide-complementarity, all measured affinities fall within the low nM range. More importantly (for the focus of this study), the relative effects of t1-nucleotide identity are consistent between diverse experiments, and thus appear to be largely independent of these factors.</p><p><italic>8) It is not apparent how the behavior depicted in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6D</italic></xref> <italic>is used to calculate the k</italic><sub><italic>on</italic></sub> <italic>for RISC-target association.
