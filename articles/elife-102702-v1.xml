Here, we monitored auditory cortex activity during the local-global paradigm, a protocol nesting different regularity levels in sound sequences. We observed that mice encode local predictions based on stimulus occurrence and stimulus transition probabilities, because auditory responses are boosted upon prediction violation. This boosting was due to both short-term adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise mechanism resisting anesthesia. In parallel, and only in wakefulness, VIP interneurons responded to the omission of the locally expected sound repeat at the sequence ending, thus providing a chunking signal potentially useful for establishing global sequence structure. When this global structure was violated, by either shortening the sequence or ending it with a locally expected but globally unexpected sound transition, activity slightly increased in VIP and PV neurons, respectively. Hence, distinct cellular mechanisms predict different regularity levels in sound sequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory cortex</kwd><kwd>predictive coding</kwd><kwd>sequence prediction</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>omission responses</kwd><kwd>global violations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC CoG 770841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019671</institution-id><institution>Fondation Pour l'Audition</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FPA IDA02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPF202005011970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagur</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Infernoise</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bagur</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019671</institution-id><institution>Fondation Pour l'Audition</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RD-2023-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019671</institution-id><institution>Fondation Pour l'Audition</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APA 2016-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bathellier</surname><given-names>Brice</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Responses to local and global violations in sound sequences are prediction errors and not simply the consequence of stimulus-specific adaptation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to predict incoming sensory inputs at different timescales is a key cognitive function both in humans and animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>).

While the first evidence of sequence violation responses were based on the repetition of the same stimulus, e.g., in the so-called oddball or stimulus-specific adaptation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lao-Rodríguez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Näätänen et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Squires et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taaseh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ulanovsky et al., 2003</xref>), a large range of experiments also revealed predictive processes for sequences of two or more stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asokan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). Different levels of prediction complexity were conceptualized in parallel with these experiments, allowing to uncover the brain signatures of different predictive processing levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</xref>). The simplest form of prediction relates to the occurrence probability of a single stimulus, irrespective of other stimuli. Occurrence probability can be captured by stimulus-specific adaptation mechanisms, in which a variable, such as synaptic strength or neural excitability is updated by each stimulus occurrence and keeps a short-term memory of the occurrence thanks to a long relaxation time constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tsodyks and Markram, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Varela et al., 1997</xref>). Numerous studies indicate that stimulus-specific adaptation mechanisms play an important role in the violation responses observed in oddball paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hamm and Yuste, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>). At a higher complexity level, some predictions require the knowledge of the probability of a stimulus conditioned on the occurrence of one or more earlier events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balsam and Gallistel, 2009</xref>). In many cases, these relationships can be effectively captured by local transition probabilities between successive stimuli (probability of stimulus N given the identity of stimulus N-1). In such cases, violation responses in the brain largely reflect violations of learned first-order local transition probabilities, as observed both in humans and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaposvari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maheu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyniel et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, at an even higher level, some sequence structures are defined globally, meaning that the occurrence of a stimulus is fully predicted if and only if multiple previous stimuli are taken into account, possibly including information about the number of stimuli within identified chunks of stimuli interleaved by sequence interruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, the ability to chunk sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ericcson et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fonollosa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Graybiel, 1998</xref>) is an important part of predictive processing.</p><p>These different levels of regularity are all present in the local-global paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). In this paradigm, two distinct tones (denoted X and Y) are presented within short sequences of five tones (either XXXXX or XXXXY), which are themselves repeated multiple times in two different types of blocks: in one block (denoted XX for simplicity), the frequent sequence is XXXXX, and in the other block (denoted XY), the frequent sequence is XXXXY. This paradigm leads to both local and global expectations. The local expectation arises from the frequent transition X&gt;X, which is violated at the end of XXXXY sequences. The global expectation arises from the frequent sequence, which is violated by occasionally presenting a rare unexpected sequence (XXXXX instead of XXXXY, or vice-versa). In XX block, hearing XXXXX XXXXX … XXXXY violates both a local and a global expectation, while in XY blocks, hearing XXXXY XXXXY … XXXXX violates only the global expectation that the sequence should terminate with a different sound Y. This paradigm also modulates stimulus probability (one sound X is more frequent than the other sound Y) and thereby produces stimulus-specific adaptation.</p><p>The local-global paradigm has been applied extensively to show that violations at different complexity levels produce brain responses with different cortical localization, timing, and sensitivity to changes in consciousness and attention. Global violations produce late responses in temporal and prefrontal cortices of awake humans and non-human primates, accompanied by top-down inputs to the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bellet et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Karoui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mazancieux et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uhrig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>). Those global violation responses are strongly affected when the subject is anesthetized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nourski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tasserie et al., 2022</xref>), sleeps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>), or is instructed to divert his attention away from the stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>). By contrast, stimulus-specific adaptation and responses to violations of local predictions (transition probabilities between successive stimuli) are fast, dominate in sensory cortices, largely resist inattention, sleep, or anesthesia, and can even occur in deep subcortical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parras et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). This set of results suggests the existence of distinct mechanisms for a hierarchy of prediction levels. Yet, in the absence of a neural circuit-scale analysis of the hierarchy of violation responses, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these key predictive mechanisms remain largely elusive.</p><p>Here, we performed two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels electrophysiology in the auditory cortex of awake and anesthetized mice, during the local-global paradigm. We show that even if responses purely attributable to global violations are weak, the auditory cortex captures different types of sequence violations based on several parallel mechanisms. Local transitions are signaled by an increase of the sound response amplitude magnified if the transition is globally unexpected. This modulation relies on two anesthesia-resistant mechanisms: stimulus-specific adaptation and an adaptation-independent surprise response operating on long-time scales. In parallel, VIP interneurons signal stimulus omissions and sequence terminations in an anesthesia-sensitive manner, while PV interneurons weakly signal global violation. Together, these results indicate that the mouse brain learns several levels of regularities in auditory sequences thanks to a set of mechanisms distributed in the local cortical circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequence violations are broadly signaled in the mouse auditory cortex</title><p>We adapted the local-global paradigm to awake, passively listening mice, which were head-fixed and held in a tube to allow for simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging of the auditory cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Tones within a sequence were 50 ms long, and their onsets were regularly spaced by a 237.5 ms time interval. We presented four different blocks of 125 sequences interspaced by 1.5 s of silence.

Two blocks with common AAAA and BBBB sequences were used to control for rare omission sequences in the five-tone blocks. Two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2/3 neurons in the auditory cortex was performed continuously during each block yielding fluorescence variations produced by sounds across several hundred GCAMP6s expressing neurons across large 1 × 1 mm field-of-views (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In order to estimate firing rate modulations in the neurons, we used a simple linear deconvolution technique which is robust for indicators with a long decay time constant like GCAMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deneux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneux et al., 2016</xref>). This method yielded sufficient temporal resolution to partially isolate individual tone responses in a given five-tone sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). With this method, we collected responses to the four different sequences in each of the two possible conditions (common or rare) and to omission sequences for 8514 neurons across 12 sessions and four mice. Three different depths (150 µm, 250 µm, and 350 µm) were recorded in each mouse on three separate days.</p><p>Averaging deconvolved signals across all sampled neurons, we observed that the population response after the last sound was larger when a sequence is rare than when a sequence is common, but only for AAAAB and BBBBA sequences, which have a local transition at the last sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). In the absence of a local transition (AAAAA or BBBBB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>) or for omission sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the population response level was not significantly different for rare <italic>vs</italic> common sequences. Therefore, we observed a global violation response at the population level in the layer 2/3 neurons only when the global violation was coupled to a local violation (local + global) and not in absence of a local violation (pure global). The local + global violation response was seen in 10 to 20% of the recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which provided enough information to discriminate between rare and common sequences in single trials with cross-validated linear classifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Intrigued by the absence of a response to the pure global violation seen in humans and non-human primates, all using electrophysiological techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Uhrig et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>), we performed recordings using Neuropixels probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), also targeted to mainly layer 2–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Theoretically, calcium imaging with a sensor expressed based on the synapsin promotor and extracellular recordings samples the same broad population of neurons. However, sampling biases across techniques are likely. For example, rapidly firing interneurons produce weak calcium signals that may not be efficiently detected in calcium imaging, while their dense firing is likely efficiently detected in spike sorting. We, therefore, did not expect identical results from each methodology. We isolated 559 single units in eight recordings in four mice during which only BBBBA and BBBBB blocks were presented (see Materials and methods). Pooling together the activity of these units, we observed a clear local + global violation response consistent with calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>). However, surprisingly, we also observed a weak but significant pure global violation response appearing both at the population level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>) and in a significant fraction of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). This response occurred more than 200 ms after the last sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), and provided enough information to discriminate between rare and common sequences above the chance level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Local violations selectively modulate the responses of neurons tuned to the violating sound</title><p>To identify functional cell types involved in the signaling of sequence structure violations in a hypothesis-free manner, we performed a clustering analysis using the correlation between temporal response profiles across all conditions as a metric of functional similarity between neurons (see Materials and methods). Clustering was performed in a cross-validated manner, taking only a fraction of available trials to build the clusters and using the remaining fraction of trials to verify that the clustered response profiles were not emerging from the aggregation of similar noise patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) as occurred occasionally (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The clustering of calcium imaging data revealed diverse response types, with a small fraction of clusters showing suppression in response to A or B sounds and a larger fraction of clusters activated by A or B with more or less specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). No specific response to pure global violations (rare XXXXX) was observed. By contrast, most neuron clusters activated by A or B displayed an increased response to the preferred sound when this sound generated a local + global violation (rare XXXXY) as compared to when the violation was only local (common XXXXY) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the population-level results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). One exception to this rule was observed in cluster #30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) which responds to the B tone only at the end of AAAAB sequences and not for BBBBX sequences. Clusters of isolated single units with boosted responses upon local + global violations were also observed in Neuropixels data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition, Neuropixels data uncovered a large fraction of clusters suppressed during the sequence. This was in line with the dominance of suppressive response at the population level in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and contrasted with calcium imaging data, indicating possible sampling biases across the two datasets. Notably, in two Neuropixel clusters, the suppressed response was followed by weak activating responses to pure global violations with a time course similar to the long-lasting response profiles of global violations responses observed in human MEG or EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, if some of these responses were statistically significant when individually tested, the significance level was above threshold when accounting for multiple testing across all extracted clusters. This further corroborates the observation that responses to global violations are weak in the mouse auditory cortex if not combined with a local violation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Local violations selectively modulate the responses of neurons tuned to the violating sound.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sample cross-validated cluster with its d∆F/F response profile for the training (left) and test (right) sets (shading=SEM).

To test this hypothesis, we reasoned that recovery from adaptation in the cortex is typically complete after 2–3 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulanovsky et al., 2004</xref>). We, therefore, increased the inter-sequence interval to 28–30 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and repeated two-photon calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in awake mice. Specifically, we sampled 9441 neurons in 27 recordings in eight mice with two-photon imaging, and 559 single units in 8 recordings in four mice with Neuropixel (same dataset as for the 1.5 s interval). We observed that the larger responses at the end of XXXXY sequences are maintained despite the wide intersequence interval in calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and Neuropixels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) data.

In both datasets, no specific response was observed for pure global violations (rare XXXXX, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). The local + global effect for the ~30 s inter-sequence interval, was slightly weaker than for the 1.5 s inter-sequence interval in calcium imaging population responses (30 s: rare XXXXY=151.50 ± 7.95% common XXXXY; 1.5 s: rare XXXXY=182.15 ± 11.89% common XXXXY; p=0.0124, Wilcoxon rank sum test, n=12 sessions for 1.5 s and n=27 sessions for 30 s interval) compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>. Accordingly, a smaller number of neurons were modulated by the global violation for the long inter-sequence interval even when correcting for the smaller number of rare sequences for the 30 s interval protocol (30 s: 8.66 ± 1.48%; 1.5 s: 16.55 ± 2.36%; p=3 × 10–3, Wilcoxon rank sum test, n=12 sessions for 1.5 s and n=27 sessions for 30 s interval, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Varying systematically the inter-tone interval, we observed larger oddball responses compared to when the same tone is a standard up to a 2 s interval, but not for 4 s or larger intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). This indicates that recovery from adaptation is complete after 4 s. To corroborate this, we performed two-photon calcium imaging while presenting in the same imaging sessions two blocks with BBBBA or BBBBB sequences repeated at a 30 s interval, occasionally violated by BBBBB and BBBBA sequences, respectively, and two blocks within which the A tone was presented with the same time intervals as in the BBBBA and BBBBB blocks but in the absence of B tones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We observed in 6906 neurons collected in eight recordings in three mice that the modulation of responses to rare A’s occurred only in the presence of the B tones associated with A in the repeated sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Together, these results show that responses to local + global violations correspond to a surprise mechanism that cannot be entirely explained by adaptation. This, therefore, suggests that the local + global violation response reflects a prediction about the short time scale structure of the 1 s XXXXX sequence chunks rather than about the occurrence frequency of the oddball sound Y.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Unexpected local violations produce a surprise response based on a recently experienced sequence structure</title><p>To further disentangle the contribution of adaptation and of the sequence-based predictions in violation responses, we reasoned that adaptation corresponds to a dampening of the response to a specific stimulus over frequent repeats, whereas the violation of a prediction should rather correspond to an increase of the response for stimuli that are unlikely to occur based on the predictable context. We, therefore, plotted neural responses for each sequence repetition across the full protocols with 1.5 s and ~30 s time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). For the 1.5 s interval, we observed a reproducible diminution of the response across the first three XXXXY sequences when common (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>) which reflects adaptation. For the 30 s interval, we observed no decrease in the responses to the Y tone across successive repeats of the XXXXY sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). Instead, responses to Y when not predictable based on sequence context were always larger than when Y is regularly repeated at the end of the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), corroborating the idea that they reflect a surprise response to an unexpected transition rather than adaptation. For the 1.5 s interval, we also observed a significant diminution of the end response to the rare XXXXY sequences across a single block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). These observations indicate the coexistence of three types of phenomena: (i) stimulus-specific adaptation, that we quantified as the difference between the first and last response to a stimulus in a block, (ii) surprise, which we quantified as the difference between the responses to the first rare and first common XXXXY, and therefore reflects the elevation of XXXXY response when XXXXX is predicted, (iii) surprise adaptation, which is the diminution of the surprise response upon frequent surprises (first - last rare XXXXY). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, these three phenomena coexist when the sequences are repeated at a short interval, but only the surprise component is maintained for the long inter-sequence interval.

VIP neurons were shown to signal stimulus local omissions of image repeats in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>), and are, therefore, important candidates for violation signals in the auditory cortex. We specifically expressed GCAMP6s by local injections of a floxed AAV-GCAMP6s virus in the auditory cortex of Vip-IRES-cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We imaged 3547 VIP neurons across 15 sessions, using a local-global protocol that included oddball sequences with replacement or omission of the last sound. The inter-sequence interval was 1.5 s. Strikingly, the population of VIP neurons was globally suppressed by all sequences with a late rebound activity after the sequence whose amplitude was significantly larger for two particular violations: for an unexpected local transition in rare AAAAB sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and for the omission of B in blocks where AAAAB is the standard sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In blocks where B was the standard tone, local violation responses were weak and we could not detect responses to omission, probably due to the fact that we sampled more extensively VIP neurons preferring tone A. Violation signals provided enough information to decode above chance level if a sequence was rare or common in blocks where A was the standard tone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the strong response suppression disappeared under isoflurane anesthesia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), as well as violation responses for omissions (AAAA in AAAAB block: –0.0010 ± 0.002% dΔF/F, AAAA in AAAA control block: 0.0006% dΔF/<italic>F</italic>±0.001%; p=0.707; Mann-Whitney U test; n=20 for rare and n=100 for common repetitions), suggesting a strong re-organisation of VIP neuron activity during anesthesia. The population response profile, however, concealed a diversity of neuronal responses across VIP neurons which we could uncover by clustering neurons according to their response time courses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). While many VIP neurons were suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, cluster 4), others were driven by sounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, clusters 1, 2, 3), and some were silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, cluster 7). Most remarkably, a small but salient population of VIP interneurons signaled the termination of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, cluster 5). Termination responses were characterized by a slight suppression during all sequences followed by a large activity increase of about 200 ms after the last sound. When the sequence was shortened by one sound the termination response occurred earlier, showing that it follows the actual sequence structure and not a global expectation based on repeated sequence length. Moreover, the termination signal was similar across all sequences although slightly larger for unexpected omissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, cluster 5), consistent with population observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). During anesthesia many sound-driven, suppressed, and sequence termination neurons became unresponsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). By contrast, some VIP neurons that were silent in the awake state became responsive under anesthesia, confirming the massive re-organisation of VIP neuron activity in this state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Vasoactive intestinal peptide positive (VIP) interneurons signal sequence termination and omission of expected local violations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sketch of the experimental setup.

Our results indicate first that the most salient effect of sequence structure is to modulate sound-specific responses depending on the predictability of perceived sounds. The same sound triggers larger responses when it is weakly predictable than when it is highly predictable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In line with observations made over several decades with the classical oddball paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelken, 2014</xref>), part of this modulation is due to stimulus-specific adaptation, which corresponds to a progressive decrease in responsiveness upon repetition of a stimulus. This decrease was clearly exhibited by deviant sounds in the local-global protocol when the intersequence interval was 1.5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Adaptation level is incremented by stimulus repeats occurring within its typical recovery time. Therefore, it is a suitable process to estimate the occurrence probability of a sound through a running average over a short time scale, independent of the presence of other sounds (at least) in the absence of cross-stimulus adaptation which occurs when sounds are similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yarden et al., 2022</xref>). The occurrence probability of a sound can also be deduced from the local transition probability between sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meyniel et al., 2016</xref>). The existence of processes performing such predictions in the mouse brain is demonstrated by our observation that a repeated local transition between an X and a Y sound leads to a lower response to Y than when the transition is unexpected, even over a timescale that does not allow for an occurrence probability estimate via adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This adaptation-independent and anesthesia-resistant violation response aligns with previous observations of stronger responses to deviant stimuli in mice trained with repeated visual stimulus sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavornik and Bear, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tang et al., 2023</xref>) although in these cases the protocol does not allow disentangling the violation of transition probabilities from stimulus-specific and cross-stimulus adaptation. Our results, therefore, clearly indicate that at least two parallel processes estimate stimulus occurrence probability in the sensory cortex: one estimating the probability of a sound independently of other sounds and one making an estimation of conditional probability relative to the previous sound (at least). The modulations of sound response resulting from the violation of these predictions are cumulative and involve the same sound-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these two processes which modulate sensory responses to signal local changes in the sequence, we have also observed several types of anesthesia-sensitive responses that specifically signal more global aspects of the expected sequence structure or of its violations. The first and most robust response type was observed in a subgroup of VIP-positive interneurons which elevate their firing rate about 200 ms after the end of a sequence, irrespective of the sequence type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These responses differ from offset responses in the auditory cortex by their long delay and their lack of specificity. These neurons were a small fraction of all VIP neurons, about 2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and therefore are a rare cell type. They signal the interruption of systematic sound repeats and could serve to mark the border of sequence chunks. These responses could be considered to signal the omission of the next sound in a regular sequence of sounds irrespective of the specific sequence content. Their response pattern is similar to the chunking signals that are observed in the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex and mark the beginning and end of action sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnes et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii and Graybiel, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In parallel with these termination responses, we observed responses of the population of VIP interneurons to omissions of the B sound in repeated AAAAB sequences, but not to omissions of A in repeated AAAAA sequences and not to omissions in BBBBA blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). At the single neuron level, these omission responses reflected a small rebound of neurons that were suppressed during the sequence, or more rarely, a boosting of a ramping response during the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The absence of omissions responses when XXXXX is the expected sequence suggests that the omission detection mechanism requires a salient expectation. As we did not observe a salient response to A in BBBBA sequences in the sampled population of VIP neurons, we speculate that the absence of omission responses for the absence of A in BBBBA sequence was due to weak signaling of A in the considered VIP population. Omission responses have been recently observed through multielectrode recordings in the auditory cortex of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lao-Rodríguez et al., 2023</xref>). Our results suggest that the omission-responsive neurons in this study may be VIP neurons. The sensitivity of omission responses to anesthesia reported in this study is also in line with our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, populations of VIP interneurons have been implicated in the signaling of omitted images in sequences of regularly repeated identical images by ramping activity until the next image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrett et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that VIP interneurons share the function of signaling omissions of salient predictions across sensory cortex.</p><p>The last type of sequence violation feature observed in our experiment is the anesthesia-sensitive slight boosting of PV-positive interneurons at the end of AAAAA sequences when AAAAB sequences are expected, i.e., a ‘pure global’ effect which was also seen in Neuropixel recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Although this effect provides enough information to discriminate between rare and common AAAAA sequences above chance level, it is much weaker than the modulation of sound response for unexpected XXXXY sequences. Moreover, we did not observe it for rare BBBBB sequences in our dataset. The weakness of the response suggests that the mismatch between the local continuation of a sound repeat and the global expectation of a sound transition makes this type of violation difficult to detect for the mouse brain, at least within the auditory cortex. The primary reason may be that global regularities are encoded at a higher level of the cortical hierarchy, with only weak top-down signals returning back to sensory cortices. In prior human and non-human primate experiments, robust responses to pure global violations were observed in, the prefrontal cortex, but also in the auditory cortex in mesoscopic-scale recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekinschtein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wacongne et al., 2011</xref>) with late timing and functional connectivity suggesting that the latter arose from top-down signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chao et al., 2018</xref>). Our imaging approach covers a broad area of the auditory cortex (repeatedly sampled with a 1 × 1 mm field of view), and yet this was insufficient to observe a salient response to pure global violations. This may be because the networks necessary to capture the global regularity level are underdeveloped in mice compared to humans. Alternatively, it is possible that these violation signals originate from a diffuse source in the auditory cortex (rare neurons or incoming axons) which was not sampled in our approach. Larger-scale experiments in mice, encompassing the prefrontal/cingulate cortex, will be necessary to discriminate between these hypotheses.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrate a remarkable diversity of neural processes tracking the regularity of sound sequences in the mouse auditory cortex, some of them pre-attentive and robust to anesthesia, and others which are anesthesia-sensitive. Our results are in line with the general view that predictive processes are constantly ongoing in brain circuits, as suggested by the predictive coding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dayan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friston, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keller and Mrsic-Flogel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao and Ballard, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srinivasan et al., 1982</xref>). However, they also suggest that there is more than a single canonical circuit which performs predictions and detects violations. For example, our results highlight that the boosting of responses to unexpected sounds is both due to an item-specific adaptation and to a surprise response that takes into account transition probabilities and, for some neurons, the more global sequence structure. As they affect the same neurons, the coexistence of these two effects could only be detected by using an appropriate sequence structure and multiple time scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Moreover, the classical predictive coding theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friston, 2005</xref>) postulates that omission and stimulus mismatch responses result from a single process in which top-down predictions are compared to bottom-up sensory signals. Our observation that omission, sequence termination responses, and pure global violation responses are produced by partially distinct interneurons and are anesthesia-sensitive while local transition mismatch responses are broadcasted across all cell types and resist anesthesia, indicates that mismatch and omissions are computed by different sub-circuits. Our results largely extend recent observations that different cell types have different dynamics of violation responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O’Toole et al., 2023</xref>). Therefore, theories of how sound sequences generate predictions in the brain would need to incorporate an array of mechanisms addressing different aspects of the sequence structure rather than a single generic mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cranial window implantation and viral injections</title><p>All procedures were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the French Ethical Committees #59 and #89 (authorizations APAFIS#9714–2018011108392486 v2 and APAFIS#27040–2020090316536717 v1).

In the beginning, the isoflurane level was gradually increased to 2.5% for 2 min to induce narcosis. The anesthesia was then gradually reduced to around 1.3% (range 1.1–1.4%) during recordings, adjusting based on observed whisker movements and pupil size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Calcium imaging data analysis</title><p>Motion artifacts, regions of interest selection, and the signal extraction were carried out using the Python-based version of Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). Then, data analysis was performed using custom Matlab scripts. Neuropil contamination was subtracted by applying the following equation: F<sub>cor</sub>(t)=F(t) – 0.7 F<sub>n</sub>(t). Then the change in fluorescence ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was computed as (F<sub>cor</sub>(t) - F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> is estimated as the minimum of Gaussian filtered calcium trace, for each block. ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> was then temporally deconvolved to yield a more accurate estimate of neuronal firing rate changes, using a linear algorithm using the following formula: r(t) = ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>’(t) + ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>(t) / τ in which ΔF/F<sub>0</sub>’ is the first temporal derivative of ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> and τ the calcium decay time constant which we set to 2 s for GCaMP6s. After deconvolution, a Gaussian smoothing filter (σ=1.5 or 2 frames) was applied to the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Acute extracellular recordings in wake and anesthetized mouse auditory cortex</title><p>Electrophysiology was performed using Neuropixels 1.0 probes (384 channels) on four mice that had previously been used for calcium imaging through a glass coverslip placed above the auditory cortex. For track reconstruction, the electrodes were dipped in diI, diO or diD (Vybrant Multicolor Cell-Labeling Kit, Thermo Fisher) prior to recording and allowed to dry at least 15 min before insertion. Prior to recording, a small hole was drilled in the coverglass to allow probe access, and the electrode was slowly inserted into the brain and left in position for 20 min before beginning recording to stabilize and minimize movements of neurons. Recordings were performed using a warmed cortex buffer filling a small kwik cast well formed around the edge of the coverslip to retain the liquid and in contact with the reference electrode. After each recording, the surface of the brain was amply flushed and then protected with Kwik-Cast. Two recordings were performed per animal. Data was sampled at 30 kHz using a NI-PXI chassis (National Instruments) and the SpikeGLX acquisition software.</p><p>After five of the awake sessions, anesthesia sessions were conducted without moving the Neuropixel probes, using the same protocol as for anesthesia sessions for two-photon calcium imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Spike sorting and analysis of extracellular recordings</title><p>Electrophysiological signals were high-pass filtered and spike sorting was performed using the CortexLab suite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/cortex-lab">https://github.com/cortex-lab</ext-link>, UCL, London, England).

We averaged a subset of trials (training set), pooling trials from the two repetitions of each block type. For each sequence, we considered whether it occurred commonly or rarely in different conditions. Clustering was performed by using the average response signatures of each cell to selected sets of conditions as described in the figure legends. We used agglomerative hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deneux et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deneux et al., 2016</xref>) based on the Ward method to group together neurons with similar response signatures. The similarity metric used was the Pearson correlation between response profiles. A threshold was applied to the resulting dendrogram to obtain N clusters based on the number of neurons and conditions in each dataset. The threshold is chosen so that increasing the number of clusters does not lead to an increase in the number of different response types in the clustering. These clusters were then manually sorted to remove all obvious groups of non-responsive cells as indicated by an absence of activity above or below the typical baseline noise level for the cluster. Finally, the responsive clusters were tested on the remaining trials, which were not used for the clustering (test set). If we observe the same response profile as in the train test, we have validated the cluster (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This cross-validation ensures that clusters do not simply aggregate noise patterns (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Cross-validated classifiers</title><p>In order to evaluate if violation responses provide sufficient information to differentiate between a rare and a common sequence, we used a decoder applied to all neurons of a given dataset pooled across mice and recording sessions, and cross-validated using a leave-one-out procedure. To reduce dimensionality and improve classifier training, we use clusters of neurons instead of individual neurons. Next, we train a linear SVM classifier to discriminate between the common and rare conditions. Finally, we test the classifier using the left-out trial for all averaged 90 ms time bins describing the response to the sequence, including the training time bin. Then another trial is left out and the procedure is performed again. This is repeated until all rare and common trials are tested. The performance of the classifier in each time bin is given as the average of the classifier output (0=wrong, 1=correct classification) for all test trials balanced by the number of trials per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Fraction of neurons selective to a condition</title><p>We evaluated the fraction of neurons in each session selective to the rare or common presentation of a sequence in the time span between 0–300 ms after the last tone onset. For each cell, we computed the p-value of a Wilcoxon rank sum test evaluating the probability that means responses in the considered time bin are greater for the rare than common condition (for the short-interval protocol, we remove the first 10 repetitions of the common stimuli from the habituation phase of each block). Using an alpha-value of 0.01, we then computed the fraction of cells with a p-value below the alpha value. This fraction represents the proportion of neurons showing a significant difference in response between rare and common conditions during the 300 ms time window after the last tone onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and K</xref>).</p><p>To compare the short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) datasets, we first chose an SNR threshold common to both datasets above which cells are retained, in order to extract cells with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR=mean activity divided by its standard deviation). This threshold (=0.2) was determined on the basis of the SNR calculated from the first four tones of the sequences, defining responsiveness to a specific frequency. This threshold allows us to contain between 5% and 12% of neurons in each data set. We then correct our statistical test so that the number of repetitions N of the rare and common stimuli in the short-interval protocol is identical to that in the long-interval protocol. To do this, we calculate the percentage of modulated neurons in the short-interval protocol by randomly selecting only 40 repetitions from 180 repetitions of the common condition and five repetitions from 30 repetitions of the rare condition, repeat this process 100 times and calculate the mean percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All quantifications and statistical analyses were performed using Matlab scripts.

This is, however, largely outside of the scope of this study. We have reported the depth and location of Neuropixel recordings in Figure S2. The depth is similar for both techniques covering mostly layers 2, 3 and 4. The location spans mostly the primary auditory cortex for two photon imaging and Neuropixel recordings. One Neuropixel recording is located in the ventral secondary auditory cortex. We could not find any evidence that the response to global violations in Neuropixel data stems specifically from this particular recording.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The current study did not monitor the attentional state of the mouse in relation to the stimulus by either including a behavioral component or pupil monitoring, which could influence the neural responses to deviant stimuli and omissions.</p></disp-quote><p>As reported by Bekinschtein et al. 2009, the attentional state influences responses to global violation in human subjects. It is extremely difficult to precisely compare attentional states in mice and human subjects. We have performed recordings in mice that had to attend to sound to detect a white noise sound in between the sequence to obtain a reward. This did not lead to increased global violation response. However, as the sequence themselves did not predict reward in this context they may divert attention. Therefore, this result is inconclusive and not worth including in our manuscript. If the sequence predicts rewards, there is a potential confound between violation responses and reward expectations or motor preparation signals. Pupil monitoring could be an alternative which we did not investigate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Given the complexity and variety of the paradigms, conditions, and analyzed cell-types, the manuscript could profit from a more visual summary figure that provides an easy-to-access overview of what was found.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, although given the complexity and diversity of our observations it may be hard to fit everything in one understandable figure.</p></body></sub-article></article>
