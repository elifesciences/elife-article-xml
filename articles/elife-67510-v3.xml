are well characterized, yet it remains unclear how or if these mechanisms regulate neural circuit assembly. To address this, we mapped the developmental origin of 160 interneurons from seven bilateral neural progenitors (neuroblasts) and identify them in a synapse-scale TEM reconstruction of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval central nervous system. We find that lineages concurrently build the sensory and motor neuropils by generating sensory and motor hemilineages in a Notch-dependent manner. Neurons in a hemilineage share common synaptic targeting within the neuropil, which is further refined based on neuronal temporal identity. Connectome analysis shows that hemilineage-temporal cohorts share common connectivity. Finally, we show that proximity alone cannot explain the observed connectivity structure, suggesting hemilineage/temporal identity confers an added layer of specificity. Thus, we demonstrate that the mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity also govern circuit formation and function, and that these principles are broadly applicable throughout the nervous system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>hemilineage</kwd><kwd>temporal identity</kwd><kwd>cell lineage</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>Notch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD27056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Sen-Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarin</surname><given-names>Aref Arzan</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Laurina</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollington</surname><given-names>Heather Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>HHMI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name><name><surname>Lai</surname><given-names>Sen-Lin</given-names></name><name><surname>Zarin</surname><given-names>Aref Arzan</given-names></name><name><surname>Manning</surname><given-names>Laurina</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollington</surname><given-names>Heather Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>HHMI</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cardona</surname><given-names>Albert</given-names></name><name><surname>Truman</surname><given-names>James W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HD007348-24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>Brandon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM007413-43</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pollington</surname><given-names>Heather Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons are mapped for developmental features (lineage, hemilineage, temporal identity) and connectomic features (morphology, synapse localization and connectivity) to reveal correlations that can be tested experimentally.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tremendous progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms generating neuronal diversity in both vertebrate and invertebrate model systems. In mammals, spatial cues generate distinct pools of progenitors, which generate neuronal diversity in each spatial domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>). The same process occurs in invertebrates like <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but with a smaller number of cells, and this process is particularly well understood. The first step occurs when spatial patterning genes act combinatorially to establish single, unique progenitor (neuroblast) identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Skeath and Thor, 2003</xref>). These patterning genes endow each neuroblast with a unique spatial identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping neurons with shared developmental origin in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reconstruction: clonally related neurons project widely and localize synapses to both sensory and motor neuropil.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity. Neuroblasts characterized here are shown in dark gray and arise from all anteroposterior and mediolateral positions of the neuroectoderm (dorsal view: anterior up, ventral midline at left of panel).

Here, we focus on <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroblasts, which undergo a cascade of temporal transcription factors: Hunchback (Hb), Krüppel (Kr), Pdm, and Castor (Cas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>). Each temporal transcription factor is inherited by ganglion mother cells (GMCs) born during each expression window. The combination of spatial and temporal factors endows each GMC with a unique identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle).</p><p>The third step is hemilineage specification, which was initially characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval and adult neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Truman et al., 2010</xref>), and may also be used in vertebrate neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2007</xref>). Hemilineages are formed by GMC asymmetric division into a pair of post-mitotic neurons; during this division, the Notch inhibitor Numb (Nb) is partitioned into one neuron (Notch<sup>OFF</sup> neuron), whereas the other sibling neuron receives active Notch signaling (Notch<sup>ON</sup> neuron), thereby establishing Notch<sup>ON</sup> and Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). In summary, three mechanisms generate neuronal diversity within the embryonic central nervous system (CNS): neuroblast spatial identity, GMC temporal identity, and neuronal hemilineage identity.</p><p>A great deal of progress has also been made in understanding neural circuit formation in both vertebrates and invertebrate model systems, revealing a multi-step mechanism. Neurons initially target their axons to broad regions (e.g., thalamus/cortex), followed by targeting to a neuropil domain (glomeruli/layer), and finally forming highly specific synapses within the targeted domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moyle et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the progress in understanding the generation of neuronal diversity and the mechanisms governing axon guidance and neuropil targeting, how these two developmental processes are coordinated remains largely unknown. While it is accepted that the identity of a neuron is linked to its connectivity, the developmental mechanisms involved are unclear. For example, do clonally related neurons target similar regions of the neuropil due to the expression of similar guidance cues? Do temporal cohorts born at similar times show preferential connectivity? Here, we address the question of whether any of the three developmental mechanisms (spatial, temporal, hemilineage identity) are correlated with any of the three circuit-wiring mechanisms (neurite targeting, synapse localization, connectivity). We map the developmental origin for 80 bilateral pairs of interneurons in abdominal segment 1 (A1) by identifying and reconstructing these neurons within a full CNS TEM volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>); this is over a quarter of the ~300 neurons per hemisegment. We make the unexpected observation that hemilineage identity determines neuronal projection to sensory or motor neuropils; thus, neuroblast lineages coordinately produce sensory and motor circuitry. In addition, we show that neurons with shared hemilineage-temporal identity target pre- and postsynapse localization to similar positions in the neuropil, and that hemilineage-temporal cohorts share more common synaptic partners than that produced by neuropil proximity alone. Thus, temporal and hemilineage identity plays essential roles in establishing neuronal connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping neuronal developmental origin in a TEM reconstruction</title><p>To relate developmental mechanisms to circuit establishment mechanisms, we first needed to identify the developmental origin of neurons within a TEM reconstruction of the larval CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>), allowing us to quantify neuronal projections, synapse localization, and connectivity. We took three approaches. First, we generated GFP-marked clones for seven different neuroblasts, representing different spatial positions in the neuroblast array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). We imaged each clone by light microscopy in newly hatched larvae – the same stage used for the TEM reconstruction – so that we could match clonal morphology at the light and TEM levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). All assayed neuroblast clones had a reproducible clonal morphology including the number of fascicles entering the neuropil, cell body position, and axon/dendrite morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; data not shown). We identified the parental neuroblast generating each clone by comparing clonal morphology to embryonic DiI single neuroblast clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bossing et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>), larval neuroblast clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birkholz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>), and cell body position.</p><p>To identify each of the seven genetically labeled neuroblast clones in the TEM volume, we matched lineage-specific features present in both light and TEM analyses. We identified neurons that had clustered cell bodies, clone morphology matching that seen by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and one or two fascicles entering the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). The similarity in overall clone morphology between genetically marked clones and TEM reconstructed clones was obvious (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). We validated these assignments using two methods. First, we used neuroblast-specific Gal4 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seroka and Doe, 2019</xref>) and multicolor flip out (MCFO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) to label individual neurons within each lineage. We found that in each case we could match the morphology of an MCFO-labeled single neuron from a known neuroblast to an identical single neuron in the same neuroblast clone within the TEM reconstruction (data not shown). Second, we reconstructed the same seven lineages in a second hemisegment, A1R. We observed similar neuron numbers, similar fascicles per clone, and similar clonal morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; data not shown). Thus, neuroblast lineages are highly stereotyped in left and right hemisegments.</p><p>We found that, while lineages have stereotyped and distinct morphology, they all had broad projections within the neuropil. We mapped the distribution of pre- and postsynapses for each neuroblast clone and found that, consistent with neuronal morphology, synapses were distributed widely across the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We conclude that clonally related neurons project widely and localize synapses widely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).</p><p>In total, we have mapped 14 neuroblast clones in the TEM volume (seven in A1L, seven in A1R). These lineages contain 160 interneurons (80 each in A1l and A1r), containing 7794 presynapses and 19,468 postsynapses. We also include the previously traced sensory afferents and dendrites from all 32 motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jovanic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>).

We note that some of the earliest born neurons are not included either because their cell bodies are in contact with the neuropil and they do not fasciculate with clonal fascicles, precluding assignment to a specific neuroblast lineage, or they do not maintain marker expression at larval hatching. This can sometimes, but not always, lead to a gap between the deepest mapped neuron and the neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The morphology and function of the earliest born neurons will be described elsewhere. Nevertheless, the current data is sufficiently comprehensive for mapping developmental mechanisms to circuit assembly mechanisms.</p><p>In the following sections, we first analyze the relationship of developmental mechanisms to neuronal projections and synapse localization within the neuropil; we conclude by exploring the relationship between developmental mechanisms and neuronal connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Individual lineages generate two distinct morphological classes of neurons</title><p>Perhaps the most important neuropil subdivision in both mammalian spinal cord and <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord is the segregation of motor and sensory processing domains.

Wild-type lineages had both dorsal and ventral projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) or glial and ventral projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, Notch expression throughout the NB1-2, NB5-2, or NB7-1 lineages led to a re-routing of projections from the ventral neuropil to the dorsal neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>). Notch expression throughout the NB7-4 lineage led to a loss of ventral projecting neurons and an increase in glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In addition, we note that ascending and descending projection neurons are normally generated by ventral Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, these ascending and descending projection neurons were completely lost following Notch<sup>intra</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–I</xref>, insets). These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>. Our observation that Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages make more complex and lengthy neurons than the Notch<sup>ON</sup> hemilineages is similar to that observed for larval brain lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that this is a conserved mechanism. The Notch<sup>intra</sup> phenotypes we observed are likely due to a Notch<sup>OFF</sup> to Notch<sup>ON</sup> hemilineage transformation, rather than death of ventral projecting neurons, as we observed the same number of neurons in control versus Notch<sup>intra</sup> embryos at stage 16/17 (NB1-2 control: 12.2, n = 10 hemisegments; NB1-2 Notch<sup>intra</sup>: 14.1, n = 12 [p=0.0785]; NB5-2 control: 20.3, n = 16 hemisegments; NB5-2 Notch<sup>intra</sup>: 19.3, n = 26 [p=0.2311]; NB7-1 control: 18.9, n = 7 hemisegments; NB7-1 Notch<sup>intra</sup>: 19.8, n = 11 [p=0.6166]; NB7-4 control: 8.6, n = 9 hemisegments; NB7-4 Notch<sup>intra</sup>: 9.5, n = 11 [p=0.1710]). In conclusion, we show that NBLAST can be used to accurately identify neuroblast hemilineages; that Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages project to motor/sensory neuropil domains, respectively; and most importantly, that hemilineage identity determines neuronal targeting to the motor or sensory neuropil.

When we expand this analysis to all hemilineages, we found that (a) hemilineage-temporal cohorts had more similar synaptic positions than hemilineage alone, and (b) dorsal hemilineage-temporal cohorts preferentially clustered presynapses, whereas ventral hemilineage-temporal cohorts preferentially clustered postsynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). This latter observation may reflect the need to precisely target premotor output to specific regions of motor neuron dendrites and the need to precisely receive sensory input from distinct sensory modalities (see Discussion). Our results also suggest that dorsal and ventral hemilineages utilize temporal identity in different ways to specify the targeting of either presynapses or postsynapses. We conclude that temporal identity subdivides hemilineages into smaller populations of neurons that target both projections and synapses to distinct subdomains within the larger hemilineage targeting domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, hemilineage identity provides coarse targeting within the neuropil, and temporal identity refines targeting to smaller subdomains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Hemilineage-temporal (HL-T) cohorts show synaptic tiling within motor or sensory neuropil.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Hemilineages target their synapses within the neuropil. (<bold>A</bold>) NB5-2 dorsal hemilineage neurons segregate their presynapses to distinct regions of the neuropil.

This has led them to hypothesize that other hemilineage-temporal cohorts may have shared connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>).

Here, we compare connectivity of hemilineage-temporal cohorts to unrelated neurons, neurons sharing a temporal identity, and neurons sharing a hemilineage identity. This allows us to test the hypothesis that hemilineage-temporal cohorts have more shared connectivity compared to other developmental groupings. First, we analyzed the connectome of 12 hemilineages plus the motor and sensory neurons in segment A1. In total, we analyzed 160 interneurons, 56 motor neurons, and 86 sensory neurons, which corresponded to approximately 25% of all inputs and 14% of all outputs for the 12 hemilineages.

Here, we focus specifically on the 160 interneurons we have traced in the TEM volume, excluding motor and sensory neurons. We quantified the average connectivity distance between neurons related by hemilineage or hemilineage-temporal cohort. Neuron pairs that are directly connected have a network distance of one synapse; neurons that share a common input or output have a network distance of two synapses, up to an observed maximum of seven synapses. Importantly, neurons within a hemilineage had a lower network distance (i.e., greater connectivity) than unrelated neurons, while neurons within a hemilineage-temporal cohort had a lower network distance than those related by hemilineage alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–J</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the largest difference between hemilineage and hemilineage-temporal cohort connectivity was at the two synapse distance. While less than 20% of hemilineage-related or hemilineage-temporal cohort-related neurons were directly connected, 75% of hemilineage-temporal cohort neurons were separated by two synapses or less (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I, J</xref>).

Peter’s rule proposes that connectivity is determined primarily by the overlap of axons and dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rees et al., 2017</xref>), raising the possibility that developmental mechanisms confer connectivity specificity simply by targeting sets of neurons to appropriate regions of the neuropil. To determine the role of neuropil proximity in connectivity, we calculated the spatial overlap of presynapses and postsynapses for all pairwise neuronal combinations, which ranged from no overlap to high overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, schematic). This measurement is analogous to previous synapse similarity measures, but instead we compared the presynapse positions of one neuron to the postsynapse positions of another. The majority of neurons have very little spatial overlap between presynapses and postsynapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A'</xref>). Interestingly, even neurons with the highest observed levels of overlap were not always connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A''</xref>).

These results suggest that within each hemilineage temporal identity confers an added level of connectivity compared to proximity or hemilineage alone.

There are three Even-skipped (Eve)+ interneurons at the core of the circuit, receiving strong input from the proprioceptive sensory neurons and three local interneurons (Jaam1-3), and strong output to three premotor neurons (Saaghi1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>). Recent work has shown that the three Eve+ interneurons at the core of the circuit are from a single hemilineage-temporal cohort: late-born neurons from the NB3-3 hemilineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wreden et al., 2017</xref>). This has led to speculation that the input Jaam neurons and the output Saaghi neurons may also be hemilineage-temporal cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meng and Heckscher, 2021</xref>). Fortunately, the Eve+, Jaam, and Saaghi neurons are all contained within our data set, allowing us to test this hypothesis. We confirm the results of Wreden et al., showing that the three Eve+ neurons (A08e1-3) are in a single late-born hemilineage-temporal cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

To do this, we map both developmental and circuit features for 160 neuronal progeny of 14 neuroblast lineages in a serial section TEM reconstruction – this allows us to characterize neurons that share a developmental feature at single synapse resolution. It is important to note that we chose the seven neuroblasts in this study based on successful clone generation and availability of single neuroblast Gal4 lines, and thus there should be no bias towards a particular pattern of neurite projections, synapse localization, or connectivity. Our results show that individual neuroblast lineages have unique but broad axon and dendrite projections to both motor and sensory neuropil; hemilineages restrict projections and synapse localization to either motor or sensory neuropil; and distinct temporal identities within hemilineages provide additional specificity in synapse localization and connectivity. Thus, all three developmental mechanisms act combinatorially to progressively refine neurite projections, synapse localization, and connectivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, clonally related neurons often have a similar location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fekete et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mihalas and Hevner, 2018</xref>), morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mihalas and Hevner, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wong and Rapaport, 2009</xref>), and connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, we found that clonally related neurons project widely in the neuropil, to both sensory and motor domains, and thus lack shared morphology. Perhaps as brain size expands to contain an increasing number of progenitors, each clone takes on a more uniform structure and function. Yet the observation that each neuroblast clone had highly stereotyped projections suggests that neuroblast identity (determined by the spatial position of the neuroblast) determines neuroblast-specific projection patterns. Testing this functionally would require manipulating spatial patterning cues to duplicate a neuroblast and assay both duplicate lineages for similar projections and connectivity.</p><p>We found that hemilineages produce sensory and motor processing units via a Notch-dependent mechanism. Pioneering work on <italic>Drosophila</italic> third instar larval neuroblast lineages showed that each neuroblast lineage is composed of two hemilineages with different projection patterns and neurotransmitter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lacin and Truman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Truman et al., 2010</xref>). We extend these studies to embryonic neuroblasts and show that Notch signaling determines motor versus sensory neuropil projections in all lineages examined. Surprisingly, the Notch<sup>ON</sup> hemilineage always projected to the dorsal/motor neuropil, whereas the Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineage always projected to the ventral/sensory neuropil. The relationship between the Notch<sup>ON</sup> hemilineage projecting to the motor neuropil may be a common feature of all 30 segmental neuroblasts or it could be that the Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> provides a switch to allow each hemilineage to respond differently to dorsoventral guidance cues, with some projecting dorsally and some projecting ventrally. Analysis of additional neuroblast lineages will resolve this question. Another point to consider is the potential role of Notch in post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crowner et al., 2003</xref>) as our experiments generated Notch<sup>intra</sup> misexpression in both newborn sibling neurons as well as mature post-mitotic neurons. Future work manipulating Notch levels specifically in mature post-mitotic neurons undergoing process outgrowth will be needed to identify the role of Notch in mature neurons, if any.</p><p>Elegant work has identified neuropil gradients of Slit and Netrin along the mediolateral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zlatic et al., 2009</xref>), Semaphorins along the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zlatic et al., 2009</xref>), and Wnt5 along the anteroposterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshikawa et al., 2003</xref>). Our finding that neurons in a hemilineage project to a common region of the neuropil strongly suggests that all neurons within a hemilineage respond in the same way to these global pathfinding cues. Conversely, our finding that neurons in different hemilineages target distinct regions of the neuropil suggests that each hemilineage expresses a different palette of guidance receptors, which enable them to respond differentially to the same global cues. For example, neurons in ventral hemilineages may express Plexin receptors to repel them from high Semaphorins in the dorsal neuropil.</p><p>Hemilineages have not been well described in vertebrate neurogenesis. Notch signaling within the Vsx1 + V2 progenitor lineage generates Notch<sup>OFF</sup> V2a excitatory interneurons and Notch<sup>ON</sup> V2b inhibitory interneurons, which may be distinct hemilineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del Barrio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Francius et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Skaggs et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, both V2a and V2b putative hemilineages contain molecularly distinct subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Harris et al., 2019</xref>); our work raises the possibility that these subtypes arise from temporal patterning within the V2 lineage. In addition, Notch<sup>ON</sup>/Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages may exist in the pineal photoreceptor lineage, where Notch<sup>ON</sup> and Notch<sup>OFF</sup> populations specify cell-type identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cau et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Only recently have the role of hemilineages been tested for their functional properties. In adults, activation of each larval hemilineage from NB5-2 showed similar behavioral output, whereas each hemilineage from NB6-1 elicited different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous work showed that the Eve+, Saaghi, and Jaam neurons are part of a proprioceptive circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>); here, we show that each class of neurons represents a hemilineage-temporal cohort. Note that the Jaam neurons process sensory input and are in a Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineage, supporting our conclusion that Notch<sup>OFF</sup> hemilineages are devoted to sensory processing; the Saaghi premotor neurons are in a Notch<sup>ON</sup> hemilineage consistent with their role in motor processing. Interestingly, both input and output neurons in this circuit arise from a common progenitor (NB5-2), which may generate late-born Jaam/Saaghi sibling neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In the future, it would be interesting to determine if other sibling hemilineages are in a common circuit to generate a specific behavior.</p><p>Our hemilineage results have several implications. First, our results reveal that sensory and motor processing components of the neuropil are being built in parallel, with one half of every GMC division contributing to either sensory or motor networks. This would be an efficient mechanism to maintain sensory/motor balance as lineage lengths are modified over evolutionary time. Second, our results suggest that looking for molecular or morphological similarities in full neuroblast clones may be misleading due to the full neuroblast clone comprising two different hemilineages. For example, performing bulk RNAseq on all neurons in a neuroblast lineage is unlikely to reveal key regulators of pathfinding or synaptic connectivity due to the mixture of disparate neurons from the two hemilineages.</p><p>We used the cortex neurite length of neurons as a proxy for birth-order and shared temporal identity. We feel this is a good approximation, but it clearly does not precisely identify neurons born during each of the Hb, Kr, Pdm, Cas temporal transcription factor windows. Nevertheless, we had sufficient resolution to observe that neurons with the same temporal identity clustered their pre- or postsynapses, rather than localizing them uniformly through the hemilineage neuropil domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Interestingly, the three-dimensional location of each hemilineage temporal cohort synaptic cluster is identical on the left and right side of A1 (data not shown), ruling out the mechanism of stochastic self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</xref>). Other possible mechanisms include hemilineage-temporal cohorts expressing different levels of the presynapse spacing cue Sequoia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kulkarni et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petrovic and Hummel, 2008</xref>) or hemilineage-temporal cohorts exhibiting different responses to global patterning cues. Testing the function of temporal identity factors in synaptic tiling will require hemilineage-specific alteration of temporal identity, followed by assaying synapse localization within the neuropil.</p><p>Our results strongly suggest that hemilineage identity and temporal identity act combinatorially to allow small pools of neurons to target pre- and postsynapses to highly precise regions of the neuropil, thereby restricting synaptic partner choice. Yet precise neuropil targeting is not sufficient to explain connectivity as many similarly positioned axons and dendrites fail to form connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We favor the model that hemilineages direct gross neurite targeting to motor or sensory neuropil, whereas temporal identity acts combinatorially with each hemilineage to direct more precise neurite targeting and synaptic connectivity. Thus, the same temporal cue (e.g., Hb) could promote targeting of one pool of neurons in one hemilineage and another pool of neurons in an adjacent hemilineage. This limits the number of regulatory mechanisms needed to generate precise neuropil targeting and connectivity for all ~600 neurons in a segment of the larval CNS.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate how developmental information can be integrated with connectomic data. We show that lineage information, hemilineage identity, and temporal identity can all be accurately predicted using morphological features (e.g., number of fascicles entering the neuropil for neuroblast clones and radial position for temporal cohorts). This both greatly accelerates the ability to identify neurons in a large EM volume as well as sets up a framework in which to study development using data typically intended for studying connectivity and function. We have used this framework to relate developmental mechanism to neuronal projections, synapse localization, and connectivity. We find that lineage, hemilineage, and temporal identity act sequentially to progressively refine neuronal projections, synapse localization, and connectivity, and our data supports a model where hemilineage-temporal cohorts are units of connectivity for assembling motor circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The aged embryos were then submerged in 32°C water bath for 5 min heat shock and then incubated in 25°C until larvae hatched. The CNS of newly hatched larvae was dissected and mounted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heckscher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Syed et al., 2017</xref>).

We then examined every neuron that entered the neuropil in the same fascicle. In most cases, every neuron in the fascicle had a morphology that matched the clonal morphology. In a small number of cases, the fascicles diverged slightly before the neuropil entry point. We verified the number of neurons by looking at fasciculating cell populations from at least two hemisegments (A1L and A1R). In some cases, we were able to identify a stereotyped number of cells across as many as four hemisegments, suggesting that fasciculation is stereotyped and reliable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Hb+ single-cell clone generation</title><p>Hb+ single-cell clones were generated with the following flies: <italic>hs-Flp.G5.PEST.Opt</italic>, <italic>13XLexAop2-IVS-myr::GFP</italic>, and <italic>LexAp65-T2A-hb</italic> (see below).

Secondary antibodies were from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA) and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Confocal image stacks were acquired on Zeiss 700, 710, or 800 microscopes. Images were processed in Fiji (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/Fiji">https://imagej.net/Fiji</ext-link>), Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, San Jose, CA), and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe). When adjustments to brightness and contrast were needed, they were applied to the entire image uniformly. Mosaic images to show different focal planes were assembled in Fiji or Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Morphological analysis of lineages</title><p>Morphological analysis was done using NBLAST and the NAT package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2016</xref>), and analysis and figure generation were done using R. Neurons were preprocessed by pruning the most distal twigs (Strahler order 4), converting neurons to dot-props, and running an all-by-all NBLAST. For individual lineages, clusters were set using a cutoff of 3.0. In the case of NB2-1, where nearly every neuron shares a very similar morphology, we first confirmed the presence of a hemilineage using anti-Hey staining. After confirmation of a hemilineage, we next removed A02o and A02l since we could not find any clones that contained either an anterior projection (A02o) or a second contralateral projection (A02l). We reasoned that the hemilineages would represent the next largest morphological division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Synaptic distributions and density analysis</title><p>Synapse distribution plots and density contours were generated using MATLAB. Neuron synaptic and skeleton information was imported to MATLAB using pymaid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlegel et al., 2016</xref>). Cross-sectional synapse distribution plots were made by taking all synapse positions between the T3 and A2 segments as positional information becomes lost due to changes in brain shape beyond these bounds. Synapse distribution plots are 1D kernel density estimates. Sensory and motor density maps were made by taking the synapse positions of all sensory neurons entering the A1 nerve, and all motor neurons exiting the A1 nerve as well as all neurons with at least three synapses connected to one of these neurons. For sensory and motor maps as well as individual hemilineages, density plots are 2D kernel density estimates of all synapse positions across the neuropil. A cutoff of 60% was used to set the outermost contour. For lineage maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we used 80% as a cutoff. Polyadic synapses were counted as many times as they have targets. For synapse distribution plots, polyadic synapses are scaled by their number of targets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Temporal cohort assignment</title><p>Cortex neurite length was calculated by converting the skeletonized neuronal arbor into a directed graph away from the soma and performing a depth-first-search of all vertices. The neuropil borders were defined by a previously created neuropil volume object (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). The neuropil entry point was defined as the first vertex within the neuropil volume object. Cortex neurite length was then the path length between the soma and the neuropil entry point. Neurons were binned into four groups defined by the positions of identified Hb+ and Cas+ cells. Early-born cells were defined as neurons with a cortex length &lt;1 standard deviation above the mean Hb+ neurite length. The next group had cortex neurite lengths ≤1 standard deviation below the mean Cas+ neurite length. The final two groups were split at the mean Cas+ neurite length.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Synapse similarity measurements</title><p>Synapse similarity was calculated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schlegel et al., 2016</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow/></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>f(is,jk)</italic> is the mean synapse similarity between all synapses of neuron <italic>i</italic> and neuron <italic>j. d<sub>sk</sub></italic> is the Euclidean distance between synapses <italic>s</italic> and <italic>k</italic> such that synapse <italic>k</italic> is the closest synapse of neuron <italic>j</italic> to synapse <italic>s</italic> of neuron <italic>i</italic>. σ is a bandwidth term that determines what is considered close. <italic>n<sub>is</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>jk</sub></italic> are the fraction of synapses for neuron <italic>i</italic> and neuron <italic>j</italic> that are within ω of synapse <italic>s</italic> and synapse <italic>k,</italic> respectively.

For models of unrelated neuron connectivity, we used two methods to determine the individual connection probabilities. First, we used a standard degree-based method in which the number of inputs for a given neuron was divided by the total number of inputs received by that neuron. Second, we used the pre-postsynapse overlap scores. For a given neuron, its probability of connecting to another neuron was equal to the overlap score divided by the sum of all overlap scores for that neuron. Pairs with a score of 0 had a 0 probability of connecting. Thresholds were done by setting all values below the threshold to zero when determining connection probability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Electron microscopy and CATMAID</title><p>We reconstructed neurons in CATMAID as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carreira-Rosario et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heckscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Figures</title><p>Figures were generated using MATLAB, R, CATMAID, and Fiji, and edited in either Illustrator or Photoshop (Adobe).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance is denoted by asterisks: ****p&lt;0.0001; ***p&lt;0.001; **p&lt;0.01; *p&lt;0.05; n.s., not significant.

By using TEM and light microscopy of the larval <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS, as well as leveraging the deep understanding of lineage of embryonic neuroblasts, the work establishes the cellular rules contributing to wiring specificity, unveiling a role for Notch in the concurrent building of sensory and motor circuits in each lineage.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A developmental framework linking neurogenesis and circuit formation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Isabel Holguera (Reviewer #2); Bassem A Hassan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the quality of the work and the potential implications. However, they feel that you need to tone down very significantly your conclusions: You should provide in the text less categorical interpretations of your results and discuss more broadly the different possible alternatives that explain the results you present.</p><p>– Although it would have ben nice to test the role of Notch in hemilineages using LoF and in more than one lineage (perhaps you already have these data?), it would be sufficient to clearly state that while your data support a role for Notch in organizing targeting, it remains to be determined whether this is through hemilineage fate specification and/or additional regulation of neuronal targeting at later developmental stages. Discuss the possibility that hemilineage temporal cohorts correlate with developmental proximity without drawing conclusions.</p><p>– Tone down your statements on the exclusivity of target space occupation by different cohorts because it is obvious from your data that there is quite a bit of mixing. You should also explain the meaning of the 2 synapses or less rule.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a remarkable study.

We agree that it is a complex dataset. To put our work in context and provide links between the neurons in our work and neurons described by others we will deposit our data into the <bold>Virtual Fly Brain</bold> (https://v2.virtualflybrain.org/), which is designed to integrate data on all larval neurons within the brain and VNC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions to improve the paper:</p><p>Line 116. &quot;We note that some of the earliest born neurons are not included either because their cell bodies are in contact with the neuropil and they do not fasciculate with clonal fascicles, precluding assignment to a specific neuroblast lineage, or they do not maintain marker expression at larval hatching.

Could you indicate this in Figure 1C to make this claim easier to understand? Moreover, you could refer to Figure 5I, where the authors do not show early born neurons for these lineages.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for these comments. While most lineages in Figure 1C have a gap between the most proximal cell body and the neuropil, where a missing early-born neuron may reside (3-3, 4-1, 5-2, 7-1, 7-4), it is also possible that there is a missing early-born neuron in lineages where the most proximal neuron is close to the neuropil (1-2, 2-1). We add new text on this point “This can sometimes, but not always, lead to a gap between the deepest mapped neuron and the neuropil (Figure 1C).” Regarding Figure 5I, agree it would be best to add text stating that the earliest-born neurons are not represented. We add new text on this point: “We assigned 70 interneurons in our dataset to one of four temporal cohorts (early, mid-early, mid-late and late born) based on radial position (Figure 5I). We note that some of the earliest born neurons are not included (see Methods)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 139: &quot;In the case of NB3-3, where only a single class of neurons was observed, all neurons were ventral-projecting (Figure 2I).&quot;</p><p>The authors claim only a single morphological class is made by this lineage, but the NBLAST clustering in the Figure has two different branches, in the same manner as the NBLAST clustering in the rest of the panels, where two different morphological types of neurons are said to be made. Please, clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this was confusing. The NBLAST dendrograms were thresholded the same across all lineages to show that the first cut almost always separates the lineage into two hemilineages. For NB3-3 this same threshold showed one hemilineage (which has been shown experimentally by the Thor lab). You are right that there is an intriguing pair of subclusters within the single 3-3 hemilineage, and interestingly they map to neurons with early vs late temporal identity. We have clarified the text to say:</p><p>&quot;We used NBLAST (Costa et al., 2016) to quantify the morphological similarity of neurons within each neuroblast lineage, and found that most lineages made two distinct classes of neurons, and the largest distinction corresponded to classes of neurons that projected to either the dorsal/motor neuropil or the ventral/sensory neuropil (or made one group of neurons and one group of glia) (Figure 2D-H). Note that NB3-3 had only one cluster at the NBLAST threshold used, and all neurons were ventral-projecting (Figure 2I). These classes were more distinct from one another than from neurons in other lineages (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). We conclude that most lineages generate two distinct classes of neurons that target either the sensory or motor neuropils.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 141. &quot;We conclude that most lineages do not generate neurons that share common projections, but rather generate two distinct classes of neurons that target either the motor or sensory neuropil.&quot;</p><p>This statement is confusing: half of the neurons from a lineage share a common projection, either dorsal or ventral, hence lineages generate two group of neurons, which share projections within each group (hemilineage) but not between groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this was confusing, and have clarified it: “We conclude that most lineages generate two distinct classes of neurons that target either the sensory or motor neuropils.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 329. &quot;In conclusion, we propose that neuroblast lineage, hemilineage, and temporal identity function to progressively refine neurite projections, synapse localization and connectivity (Figure 8F).&quot;</p><p>I don't agree with the use of the word &quot;progressively&quot; here: a given neuron is going to acquire its temporal identity and either Notch ON or Notch OFF (hemilineage) identity at the same time (right at birth), so these factors would be acting concurrently.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, good point.

We have fixed the text: “Neurons were binned into four groups defined by the positions of identified Hb+ and Cas+ cells. Early born cells were defined as neurons with a cortex length less than one standard deviation above the mean Hb+ neurite length. The next group had cortex neurite lengths less than or equal to one standard deviation below the mean Cas+ neurite length.

We have also added cell counts for wild type and Notch<sup>intra</sup> for each lineage, showing that cell numbers are not significantly different in the two genotypes (thus Notchintra does not cause loss of ventral projections due to cell death). Thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D: NB-1-2 (red) does not look to have presynapses in the ventral part of the neuropil. Why?</p></disp-quote><p>Great catch. This is because the NB1-2 ventral hemilineage presynapses are located in the posterior segments and thus are not shown in the A1 cross-sectional view. We have added a plot of the distribution of synapses along the AP axis, which makes this clear, and we add the following to the legend: “Note that NB1-2 ventral hemilineage presynapses (red dots) are located ventrally, but are not shown in the cross-section view due to their position in posterior segments of the VNC.” Thanks for this important comment which has clarified a potentially confusing issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 CDEF: From these Figures it looks like there are more postsynapses than presynapses. Could it be that postsynapses target more overlapping domains because there is a higher number of postsynapses than presynapses?</p></disp-quote><p>It looks that way because fly synapses are polyadic and therefore a single presynaptic site connects with many postsynaptic sites. For clarity on this, each dot on the presynapse distribution plots are scaled in size by the number of postsynaptic sites they are associated with.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Recommendations to improve the presentation and clarity of the Figures:</p><p>Figure 1A: indicate the anterior/posterior, medio/lateral and dorso/ventral axes for these neuroblasts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks; we add this to the figure legends: “(A) Three mechanisms specifying neuronal diversity.

Thus, it would be only a minor advance for us to quantify clonal similarity in embryonic neuroblasts. Plus, since the number of neurons in a clone varies slightly, we would have to count neuron numbers per clone and only compare those with identical neuron numbers, which is possible but time-consuming. Then there are the covid restrictions which make it difficult to rapidly generate new clones to increase the number with identical neurons. All in all, we decided that the benefit of answering this question was not worth the cost of performing it, and that other experiments were a higher priority in our limited research time. We have toned down the language to remove the word “striking” in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Honestly, we don’t know of a genotype where we could selectively live image only the ectopic dorsal projecting neurons. And live imaging of the deep projections for several hours is probably at the very edge of feasibility, perhaps only possible with SCAPE microscopy (that we don’t possess).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Or:</p><p>2. Tone down their conclusions about:</p><p>– How Notch activity regulates targeting;</p><p>– The extent to which hemilineage temporal cohorts correlate with developmental proximity.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we agree with your comment about Notch function. We add text in the discussion to indicate that we can’t distinguish the role of Notch overexpression in sibling cell fate from a role in post-mitotic neurons. Yet our findings are strongly supported by similar Notch overexpression experiments in larval neuroblasts which show that Notch misexpression transforms NotchOFF neurons to NotchON neurons in all tested lineages. Nevertheless, we are glad the reviewer raised the point, and we add a Discussion section addressing the unresolved issue of post-mitotic neuron Notch function: “Another point to consider is the potential role of Notch in post-mitotic neurons (Crowner et al., 2003), as our experiments generated Notch<sup>intra</sup> misexpression in both new-born sibling neurons as well as mature post-mitotic neurons. Future work manipulating Notch levels specifically in mature post-mitotic neurons undergoing process outgrowth will be needed to answer this question.”</p><p>We are not sure what “developmental proximity” means – but if it refers to spatial proximity of hemilineage temporal cohort synapses, we agree. This is particularly true for postsynapse position (e.g. Figure 6, supplement 2). We note in the text “When we expand this analysis to all hemilineages, we found that (a) hemilineage-temporal cohorts had more similar synaptic positions than hemilineage alone, and (b) dorsal hemilineage-temporal cohorts preferentially clustered presynapses, whereas ventral hemilineage-temporal cohorts preferentially clustered postsynapses (Figure 6C-F).” We have also gone through the manuscript to ensure that we limit our conclusions on this point to the observed correlations. We leave to the discussion how the observed correlations lead to hypotheses about functional consequences, which need to be determined in a future study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
