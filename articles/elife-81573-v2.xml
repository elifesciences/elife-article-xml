proteins. Mutations in INM proteins interfering with these interactions result in disease. However, mechanisms controlling the levels and turnover of INM proteins remain unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism of regulated degradation of the INM SUN domain-containing protein 2 (SUN2). We show that Casein Kinase 2 and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) have opposing effects on SUN2 levels by regulating SUN2 binding to the ubiquitin ligase Skp/Cullin1/F-Box<sup>βTrCP</sup> (SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>). Upon binding to phosphorylated SUN2, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> promotes its ubiquitination. Ubiquitinated SUN2 is membrane extracted by the AAA ATPase p97 and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Importantly, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 results in aberrant nuclear architecture, vulnerability to DNA damage and increased lagging chromosomes in mitosis. These findings uncover a central role of proteolysis in INM protein homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>nuclear envelope</kwd><kwd>ERAD</kwd><kwd>SUN2</kwd><kwd>protein quality control</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>817708</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>223153/Z/21/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carvalho</surname><given-names>Pedro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Programme DRCNPG-Nov21\100004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruneberg</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K006703/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruneberg</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward Penley Abraham Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF 280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gruneberg</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

These interactions influence a myriad of cellular processes, from gene regulation and repair to cell motility and fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mekhail and Moazed, 2010</xref>). Chromosome interactions involve primarily proteins at the inner nuclear membrane (INM), which together with the outer nuclear membrane (ONM), forms the NE. While continuous with the remaining Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) membrane, the INM has a distinct set of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pawar and Kutay, 2021</xref>). Mutations in INM proteins are associated with a wide range of diseases, such as muscular dystrophies and premature ageing syndromes, underscoring their importance for nuclear architecture and function.</p><p>Among the diverse INM proteome, Sad1p/UNC84 (SUN) domain-containing proteins SUN1 and SUN2 are unique as they couple nuclear and cytoplasmic events via LINC (Linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodzic et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>). These molecular bridges across the NE are mediated by interactions of the luminal domains of SUN1 or SUN2 homotrimers in the INM and Nesprin proteins at the ONM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Crisp et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padmakumar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>). Other domains of SUN and Nesprin proteins engage with various components in the nucleus and the cytoskeleton, respectively, conferring the LINC complex with diverse functions. Indeed, by transducing forces from the cytoskeleton into nucleus, SUN1 and SUN2 have been implicated in controlling nuclear positioning within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lei et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), NE anchoring of specific chromatin loci, facilitating NE disassembly during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Turgay et al., 2014</xref>) and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). SUN proteins have also been implicated in HIV replication and trafficking within host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donahue et al., 2016</xref>). In these various functions, SUN1 and SUN2 appear to play both redundant and unique roles. However, our understanding of SUN proteins and the mechanisms by which they contribute to nuclear organization are far from complete.</p><p>Recent work in budding yeast showed that protein homeostasis at the INM relies on ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khmelinskii et al., 2014</xref>). This process is mainly mediated by an INM localized ubiquitin ligase complex, the Asi complex, which promotes ubiquitination of damaged and mislocalized membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khmelinskii et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Natarajan et al., 2020</xref>). Proteins ubiquitinated by the Asi complex are subsequently extracted from the INM into the nucleoplasm by a conserved ATPase complex called Cdc48 in yeast and p97 in mammals and delivered to the proteasome for degradation. Mechanistically, Asi-mediated protein degradation is similar to the ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), a vital quality control process in ER membranes exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu and Rapoport, 2018</xref>). In fact, the yeast ERAD ubiquitin ligase Doa10 also localizes to the INM and degrades both nucleoplasmic and INM proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boban et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Swanson et al., 2001</xref>). Despite the conservation of the ERAD process across all eukaryotes, sequence-based homologues of the Asi complex appear to be circumscribed to certain fungi.</p><p>While a functional counterpart of the yeast Asi complex has not been identified in higher eukaryotes, there are hints that the ubiquitin system influences protein homeostasis at the INM in mammals. Disease-associated mutations in the Lamin-B receptor (LBR) appear to be removed from the INM through a process involving ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>). Perturbations of NE homeostasis, such as mutations in Torsin ATPase, result in INM herniations enriched in polyubiquitin conjugates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laudermilch et al., 2016</xref>). Proteomics studies suggest links between the Skp/Cullin1/F-Box<sup>β-TrCP1/2</sup> (SCF<sup>β-TrCP1/2</sup>) ubiquitin ligase complex and the INM protein SUN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coyaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huttlin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loveless et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Low et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sowa et al., 2009</xref>). The INM protein Emerin has also been shown to interact with ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khanna et al., 2018</xref>). However, the significance of these observations and the overall role of protein degradation to INM protein homeostasis remain largely unexplored.</p><p>Here, we show that SUN2 levels at the INM are controlled by an ERAD-like mechanism. This process involves SUN2 ubiquitination by the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase, membrane extraction by the p97 ATPase complex, and degradation by the proteasome. We further show that the opposing activities of Casein Kinase 2 (CK2) and the C-terminal domain Nuclear Envelope Phosphatase 1 (CTDNEP1) regulate SUN2 degradation. This kinase/phosphatase balance regulates SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> binding to a non-canonical recognition motif in the SUN2 nucleoplasmic domain that is required for subsequent SUN2 ubiquitination. Finally, we show that accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 results in defects in NE architecture that impact nuclear functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SUN2 stability depends on a non-canonical recognition motif for the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase</title><p>The SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase promotes ubiquitination and degradation of substrates containing defined recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>). To study the relation between SUN2 and SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>, we searched the SUN2 nucleoplasmic region for potential SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>-binding motifs. While the canonical DSGXXS recognition motif is absent, SUN2 contains two regions with related amino acid sequences, hereafter called Sites 1 and 2, respectively. Importantly, Sites 1 and 2 are conserved across vertebrates and are absent in SUN1, a SUN2 homologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).</p><p>Binding of SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> to canonical and non-canonical sites on substrates requires their prior phosphorylation at two consensus serine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>). To test the potential involvement of Sites 1 and 2 in SUN2 degradation, the critical consensus serine residues were mutated to alanine to abolish phosphorylation, and to aspartate to mimic constitutive phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type SUN2 (hereafter called SUN2 WT) as well as Site 1 and 2 mutants were stably integrated at the single flippase recognition target (FRT) site of HEK293 TRex Flp-In (HEK TF) cell lines under a doxycycline/tetracycline-inducible promoter. The various SUN2 constructs were expressed as C-terminal fusions to superfolder green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) and hemagglutinin (HA) tags for easy detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Upon doxycycline (Dox) induction, there was robust detection of SUN2 WT by flow cytometry. Alanine mutations in Site 1 or 2 (Site 1<sup>A</sup> or 2<sup>A</sup>, respectively) resulted in even higher steady-state SUN2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This increase was particularly noticeable for Site 2<sup>A</sup> mutant and was further increased by combining alanine mutations in both sites. Conversely, phosphomimetic aspartate mutations at Sites 1 and 2 (Sites 1<sup>D</sup> and 2<sup>D</sup>, respectively) resulted in much lower SUN2 steady-state levels, with the Site 2<sup>D</sup> mutant displaying again a stronger effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Combination of aspartate mutations in both sites (Sites 1<sup>D</sup> and 2<sup>D</sup>) resulted in further decrease in SUN2 steady-state levels, suggesting that phosphorylation at Sites 1 and 2 have an additive effect. Since all SUN2 derivatives are expressed from the same promoter, these data suggest that SUN2 stability is controlled by non-canonical SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> recognition motifs, with Site 2 having a more prominent contribution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SUN2 stability depends on a non-canonical recognition motif for the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SUN2 nucleoplasmic regions containing non-canonical recognition motifs for the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> hereafter called Sites 1 and 2.

We observed that SUN2 WT was degraded with a half-life of ~240 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with the analysis at steady state, SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> mutant was stable while the phosphomimetic aspartate mutation dramatically accelerated SUN2 degradation. SUN2 degradation was further accelerated by combining aspartate mutations at Sites 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, turnover of endogenous SUN2 was influenced and mirrored the turnover of the various transgenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Given that SUN2 functions as a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sosa et al., 2012</xref>), this observation likely reflects assembly of endogenous and transgenic molecules into trimeric SUN2 complexes. In contrast, the SUN2 homologue SUN1 was stable under all the conditions tested. A small but reproducible increase in SUN1 steady-state levels was observed in cells expressing unstable SUN2 variants. These data confirmed our initial observations and showed that SUN2 degradation is controlled by non-canonical SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> recognition motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>INM degradation of SUN2 by an ERAD-like process</title><p>To test the role of the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> in SUN2 degradation, its activity was acutely blocked with MLN4924. This well-characterized small molecule inhibits Cullin RING ligases like SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> by preventing their activation by neddylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>).

Given that MLN4924 is a general inhibitor of Cullin RING ligases, the contribution of SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> in SUN2 degradation was directly tested upon depletion of the F-Box proteins βTrCP1 and βTrCP2. Depletion of βTrCP1 did not affect the levels of SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup>, while βTrCP2 depletion resulted in increased steady-state levels of this short-lived SUN2 mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Further increase in SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup> levels was observed when βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 were depleted simultaneously showing that they are redundant in promoting SUN2 degradation.

Importantly, these data raise the possibility that CK2 promotes SUN2 phosphorylation thereby facilitating its recognition and ubiquitination by SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase. Consistent with this model, both CK2 and SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase were show to have nuclear localization thereby being able to access SUN2 at the INM.</p><p>The role of CSNK2B in SUN2 degradation was validated using additional sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Given that the depletion of essential genes, like CSNK2B, is complicated and can give confounding effects, we used a well-characterized CK2 inhibitor, tetrabromocinnamic acid (TBCA), to study the role of CK2 in SUN2 degradation. Consistent with the gene depletion experiments, acute CK2 inhibition with TBCA resulted in an increase of the steady levels of both SUN2 WT and Site 2<sup>D</sup> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). SUN2 WT steady levels were comparable between cells subjected to CK2 or p97 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Importantly, phosphomimetic mutation in SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup> showed an intermediate response, while the double mutant SUN2 Sites 1<sup>D</sup>,2<sup>D</sup> was largely refractory to CK2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). Thus, CK2 inhibition slows down SUN2 degradation.</p><p>Next, we used immunoprecipitation to test whether CK2 regulates SUN2 degradation by controlling its interaction with the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>. Indeed, acute CK2 inhibition with TBCA decreased the interaction between SUN2 and βTrCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

Therefore, we hypothesized that CK2-dependent SUN2 degradation is counteracted by the activity of a protein phosphatase. Given its localization to the INM and phosphatase activity towards Serine/Threonine residues, the CTDNEP1 was an attractive candidate to regulate SUN2 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahmanyar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). To test this possibility, we analyzed the levels of endogenous SUN2 upon CTDNEP1 depletion. Consistent with our hypothesis, the steady-state levels of endogenous SUN2 and of SUN2 WT transgene were strongly reduced in CTDNEP1 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This effect was specific to SUN2 as the levels of other INM proteins such as SUN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref>) and LBR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) remained unchanged.

In support of this model, the reduction of SUN2 levels in CTDNEP1 KO cells is counteracted by acute CK2 inhibition with TBCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). A second prediction of the model is that the SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup>, which cannot be phosphorylated in the main site controlling SUN2 degradation, is insensitive to the loss of CTDNEP1. Indeed, depletion of CTDNEP1 while resulting in low levels of SUN2 WT transgene, did not affect SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> mutant level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

To this end, we analyzed nuclear morphology in HeLa cells expressing either SUN2 WT or the non-degradable SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> mutant. In parental HeLa cells, most nuclei display a smooth or slightly wrinkled surface. Expression of SUN2 WT from a Dox-inducible promoter for 24 hr increased the fraction of wrinkled nuclei as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donahue et al., 2016</xref>). A small fraction of SUN2 WT-expressing cells showed aberrant nuclei, which were highly convoluted and multi-lobed. Nearly half of the cells expressing non-degradable SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> displayed these highly aberrant nuclei, which were never observed in parental HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, nuclear morphology greatly improved upon shutting off expression of SUN2 WT for 24 hr. In contrast, aberrant nuclear morphologies persisted even 24 hr after shutting-off SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> expression, consistent with the long half-life of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the aberrant nuclei, SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> was distributed heterogeneously, accumulating in patches or lines. Besides SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup>, these structures were enriched in certain INM proteins, such as LBR and EMD. However, other INM proteins like LAP 2β and SUN1 were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

We wondered if the changes in nuclear architecture due to accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> would impact mitotic progression. Timelapse fluorescence microscopy showed that cells expressing SUN2 WT and Site 2<sup>A</sup> progress through the various stages of mitosis with normal kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In particular, NE breakdown, chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate and anaphase onset occurred with similar timings. In addition, the frequency of multipolar spindles was low in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, cells expressing SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> showed higher frequency of lagging chromosomes during anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Curiously, these cells also showed an increased association of chromosomes with the nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 may impact chromosome dynamics, potentially by interfering with interactions between chromosomes and the INM.</p><p>SUN2 has also been implicated in DNA damage repair, particularly in the repair of double strand breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lei et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). While the precise role of SUN2 in DNA repair is ill defined, it may control the mobility of damaged loci thereby affecting the efficiency of the repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> impacts the cell’s ability to repair DNA double strand breaks. To assess the efficiency of DNA repair we monitored the DNA damage marker γH2AX (Ser139-phosphorylated histone H2AX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rogakou et al., 1998</xref>) in U2OS cells subjected to ionizing radiation (IR) to trigger double strand breaks. Parental and SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup>-expressing cells have comparable levels of γH2AX both prior and soon after IR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D, E</xref>). This indicates that expression of non-degradable SUN2 is (1) insufficient to trigger DNA damage; and (2) does not prevent cells from mounting a DNA damage response upon induction of double strand breaks with IR. At 24 hr post IR, parental cells show nearly basal levels of γH2AX indicating that DNA damage has been repaired. In contrast, the levels of γH2AX in SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> are higher 24 hr post IR, likely due to unresolved DNA damage. Thus, accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> appears to compromise efficient DNA repair.</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that accumulation of non-degradable SUN2 affects nuclear architecture and impacts nuclear functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We uncovered that the INM protein SUN2, a subunit of the LINC complex, undergoes regulated turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The kinase CK2 and the phosphatase CTDNEP1 act, respectively, as positive and negative regulators of SUN2 degradation by influencing the phosphorylation state of non-canonical binding sites for the SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase, primarily Site 2. Binding of SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> to phosphorylated Site 2 results in SUN2 ubiquitination and the recruitment of the p97 ATPase complex, which facilitates SUN2 membrane extraction and delivery to the proteasome for degradation. Cells expressing non-degradable SUN2 display defects in nuclear architecture highlighting the importance of this ERAD-like process in maintaining INM protein homeostasis in mammalian cells.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A kinase-phosphatase balance regulates ER-associated degradation of SUN2 from the inner nuclear membrane (INM).</title><p>The scheme illustrates the opposing effects of the kinase CK2 and the phosphatase CTDNEP1 on SUN2 degradation.

SUN2 is depicted as a monomer for simplicity however it functions as a homotrimer.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81573-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>While SUN2 and the LINC complex play important functions in cell homeostasis, conditions exist in which the forces they transduce into the nucleus are deleterious. It has been shown that aberrant DNA repair resulting from increased chromatin mobility at sites of double strand breaks depends on the LINC complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lottersberger et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with these data, we observe that expression of non-degradable SUN2 results in impaired repair of double strand breaks. Downregulation of the LINC complex resulting in the decoupling of the nucleus from the cytoskeleton has been observed in cells under extreme cycles of mechanical load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gilbert et al., 2019</xref>). This nuclear decoupling protects DNA from mechanical-induced damage and appears to involve a decrease in SUN2 levels by some unknown mechanism. Thus, it is appealing to consider that downregulation of LINC complexes by localized SUN2 degradation at sites of DNA damage or extreme mechanical load may facilitate DNA repair or prevent mechanical-induced damage. Future studies should test these possibilities directly.</p><p>Mechanistically, the involvement of a soluble ubiquitin ligase, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>, in SUN2 degradation presents an important difference to conventional ERAD, which is normally mediated by transmembrane ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>). However, the participation of SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> in an ERAD-like process is not unprecedented. In HIV infected cells, SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> promotes the degradation of the integral membrane protein CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Florence et al., 1998</xref>). In this case, virally encoded Vpu protein functions as an adaptor, binding to the substrate CD4 in the ER membrane and recruiting the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> via the cytosolic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Magadán et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Margottin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Based on these observations, it will be interesting to test whether SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> has a more widespread role in the degradation of membrane proteins. Interestingly, a soluble ubiquitin ligase is also implicated in downregulating the yeast SUN domain-containing protein Mps3 by an ERAD-like process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2019</xref>). In this case, the degradation of Mps3, which is important for the distribution of nuclear pore complexes and spindle pole bodies (the yeast equivalent to centrosomes) within the INM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaspersen et al., 2006</xref>), facilitates cell cycle progression. Like in the case of SUN2, accumulation of non-degradable Mps3 affects nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Extraction of ERAD substrates from the membrane into the cytosol, a step known as retrotranslocation, is driven by the pulling force of p97 ATPase and facilitated by transmembrane segments of ERAD ubiquitin ligases or accessory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu and Rapoport, 2018</xref>). In the case of a soluble ubiquitin ligase like SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup>, how membrane substrates are retrotranslocated is unclear. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen did not identify any membrane proteins that could potentially mediate SUN2 retrotranslocation, suggesting redundancy between multiple components. Alternatively, the pulling force imposed by p97 may be sufficient to extract SUN2 from the INM membrane.</p><p>Regulated protein degradation by ERAD is well documented, particularly in the control of sterol biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christianson and Carvalho, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson and DeBose-Boyd, 2018</xref>). In these cases, the degradation of rate limiting enzymes depends on the concentration of specific sterol metabolites in the ER membrane and functions as a feedback mechanism controlling sterol biosynthesis. To our knowledge, SUN2 is the first substrate shown to be controlled by a kinase/phosphatase balance. Given the requirement of phosphorylation for SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> binding to substrates, the involvement of a kinase was expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frescas and Pagano, 2008</xref>). In fact, CK2 has been implicated in the degradation of other SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> substrates such as Vpu-mediated degradation of CD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Florence et al., 1998</xref>) and Cyclin F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mavrommati et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the involvement of CTDNEP1 is unexpected as this phosphatase has been mainly implicated in dephosphorylation of Lipin, a key regulator of lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang and Reue, 2017</xref>). In particular, CTDNEP1 was recently implicated in coordinating membrane biogenesis with cell division and loss of CTDNEP1 results in excess membrane production which affect chromosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Merta et al., 2021</xref>). A role for SUN2 in lipid metabolism was also recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the convoluted nuclei observed in cells expressing non-degradable SUN2 may result from excessive production of NE membranes. Thus, future studies should explore further how the function of CTDNEP1 in controlling SUN2 levels relates to its role in lipid regulation. Another important open question is whether CTDNEP1 and CK2 act directly on SUN2.</p><p>While studies in rats and cultured cells suggest that INM proteins are generally long lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Toyama et al., 2013</xref>), our results show that the INM proteome can be remodelled in a highly regulated fashion. Other recent examples show that certain conditions, like mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>) or ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buchwalter et al., 2019</xref>), can trigger the turnover of specific INM proteins. Thus, it appears that the turnover of INM proteins is likely to be temporal and spatially restricted, allowing fine-tuning of INM properties without jeopardizing its overall structure and critical functions in nuclear organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For stable integration of SUN2 constructs into the FRT sites of Flp-In T-Rex HEK cells, SUN2 cDNAs were cloned into the pcDNA5-FRT-TO plasmid (Invitrogen).

Cells with delayed chromosome release from nuclear membrane were characterized as having one or more chromosomes at the nuclear periphery in the two timepoints following NE breakdown.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>DNA damage assay and quantification of γH2AX foci</title><p>U2OS parental and SUN2 Site 2 <sup>A</sup> cells were seeded (7.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with Pen/Strep onto round cover slips (16 mm, #1) in 35 mm tissue culture-treated dishes. SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> expression was induced 24 hr before IR with the addition of Doxycycline to a final concentration of 1 µg/ml. A total dose of 5 Gy IR was performed to induce DNA double strand breaks. Cells were further incubated in doxycycline-containing media for 1, 4, 8, and 24 hr. Control cells not exposed to IR were harvested after 24 hr of doxycycline induction. Cells were fixed with 4% PFA (methanol-free) for 10 min at RT, followed by three PBS washes. Fixed cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, followed by three PBS washes. Fixed cells were blocked with PBS/10% FBS for 2 hr at 4°C. Primary antibody (Anti-γH2AX) were incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS/10% FBS (1:1000) in home-made humidified chambers, followed by three times wash with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Secondary antibody was prepared in PBS/0.15% FBS, and cells were incubated with secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 hr in the humidified chambers, followed by three times wash with PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and one 5 min wash with PBS. Cover slips were then incubated in DAPI-containing PBS for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, mounted onto glass slide in non-hardening mounting media and sealed with nail polish.</p><p>Quantification of H2AX signal was performed using ImageJ (bundled with Java 1.8.0_172) software. Each nucleus was masked and the number of spots within the mask with size between 0.4 and 3 µm was counted as foci. More than 90 parental and SUN2 Site 2 <sup>A</sup> cells in each timepoint from three independent experiments were analyzed, and statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance method on GraphPad Prism v9.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Generation CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout cells</title><p>Cells were transfected with single biscistronic gRNA-Cas9 plasmid at 80% confluency with Mirus LT1 transfection reagent in 24-well tissue culture plate format. Forty-eight hours later, cells were trypsinized and expanded into a 10-cm tissue culture dish in the presence of 2 µg/ml puromycin for 72 hr. Cells were maintained in fresh media (without puromycin) for additional 72 hr before validation by western blotting. Knockout clonal cell lines were generated by single cell sorting using fluorescent-assisted cell sorting (FACS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen</title><p>The TKOv3 CRISPR/Cas9 library was a gift from Jason Moffat (Addgene #90294). The sgRNA library and second generation lentiviral packaging plasmids were transfected into HEK293T cells. Virus titre was determined for optimizing transduction at MOI of 0.3 in HEK TF SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup> cells in T175 tissue culture flask format. For the screen, at least 125 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK TF SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup> cells were infected in T175 flasks to achieve a 250-fold coverage of the library after selection at day 1. On day 2, fresh media was replaced. On day 3, cells were selected with 2 µg/ml puromycin (Gibco) for 72 hr. Cells were seeded into two technical replicates with at least 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> total cells per replicate in T175 flasks. Twenty-four hours prior to day 7 sorting, 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cell medium to induce the expression of the transgene SUN2 Site 2<sup>D</sup> transgene. On the day of sorting, cells were trypsinized and collected into a single flask. From this, 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> reference cells were collected, pelleted and frozen. In addition, two replicates of 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were further seeded for day 13 sorting. The rest of the cells were subjected to FACS and 1% of the brightest GFP cells was collected using a BD FACSAria3 sorter. Transgene induction, reference population collection, sorting, and seeding for day 17 were repeated as described above. Genomic DNA was extracted from each cell population using a QIAGEN BloodMaxi kit (for reference samples) or BloodMini kit (for sorted samples) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. sgRNAs were PCR amplified from the entire isolated genomic DNA using NEBNext Ultra II Q5 Master Mix (NEB) and the primers v2.1-F1 and v2.1-R1, according to the TKOv3 protocol. PCR reactions were pooled again, after which a second PCR was performed to attach indices and sequencing adapters using the primers i5 and i7. The PCR reaction was loaded onto a 2% agarose gel, the 200 bp band excised and purified using a GeneJet PCR Purification kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Concentration and quality of the purified bands were assessed by using TapeStation and pooled library at 10 nM in 30 µl were prepared. The library was analyzed by deep sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq500 at the Oxford Genomics Centre. Gene rankings were generated using the MAGeCK algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were trypsinized and resuspended in FACS buffer (2% FCS, 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in PBS).

Non-degradable forms of SUN2 promote altered nuclear architecture and a delay in double strand break repair.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Yihong Ye (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers feel that the paper is strong and relatively complete. However, there are two aspects that we feel would improve the paper.</p><p>1) Although we realize FBXW11 (b-TRCP2) was identified in the CRISPR screen, we feel a formal genetic demonstration of the involvement of FBXW11 and/or b-TRCP1 as a redundant backup enzyme is important, given the conclusions. The extensive use of the degron mutants and binding, while providing important insight, isn't really sufficient genetic evidence. We also realize that making KOs of these E3s is challenging and they are likely lethal as a DKO, but given the wide use in the field of shRNAs for reducing their levels, the use of shRNAs for this experiment would be ok. Essentially, we are asking for further validation of the genetic screening data.</p><p>2) A more complicated question concerns the extent to which this pathway works on endogenous SUN2. In available protein turnover data (PMID: 34626566), SUN2 is really not an unstable protein (half-life of 8h or more). This could reflect that most of the protein is assembled into a stable complex, but of course, there could be small amounts of protein that didn't assemble properly which could be degraded by this pathway. In the experiments reported, it is likely that significant levels of SUN2 are not associated with partner proteins and is therefore mimicking a potential QC pathway. So we are wondering if you can measure turnover of the endogenous protein in the context of b-TRCP shRNA and see if you detect any turnover of the protein normally. If not, the reviewers feel that the paper/data itself is still valuable but that it might require re-working the paper a bit to more of a quality control angle. One experiment that could shed light on this question is to reduce the levels of SUN2-associated proteins and see if that increases the pool of SUN2 that is degraded in a b-TRCP-dependent manner. One could use MLN4924 to do prescreens to determine which subunits of the SUN2 complex might be most critical for the maintenance of its stability. It is also possible you have considered this model and have data for or against this model, and if so, this could change how to address this point.</p><p>3. There are several other suggestions for experiments or changes in the text that will improve the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Although it is understandable that for mutagenesis and CRISPR screen studies, over-expressed SUN2 bearing a tractable tag is necessary, it is important for the authors to validate key findings using endogenous SUN2. In this regard, the role of CK2 (Figure 5F) and SCF β TrCP (Figure 5D) in SUN2 turnover in phosphatase CTDNEP1 knockout cells should be further confirmed with endogenous SUN2.</p><p>2. To address the physiologic relevance of the reported SUN2 degradation, the authors may consider genetically editing the site 2 sequence of SUN2 to abolish this regulation. They can then examine whether this can cause any cellular defects as shown in Figure 6. If this is technically challenging, they need to carefully discuss the limitations of their experimental design and include alternative interpretations in the Discussion section.</p><p>3. They should consider changing the title and discuss the potential physiological conditions that may trigger SUN2 degradation.</p><p>4. The authors should also comment on the subcellular localization of CK2 and CTDNEP1 and whether that can support the degradation of inner nuclear envelope proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81573.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers feel that the paper is strong and relatively complete.

We now show that maximum stabilization of endogenous (Figure Supplement S4D) and transgenic (Figure S2) SUN2 is observed upon simultaneous depletion of βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 indicating that these F-Box proteins are redundant. Depletion of βTrCP1 alone did not impact SUN2 levels while depletion of βTrCP2 increased SUN2 steady state levels, with the effect being more pronounced for overexpressed SUN2. Depletion of other F-Box proteins did not affect SUN2 levels indicating that the effect observed for βTrCP1 is specific (Figure S2B). These results are in line with the results of our genome wide screen (Figure 4 and S3) and the literature. The differences in the effects of βTrCP1 and βTrCP2 depletion likely result from the relative abundance of the two F-Box proteins in the HEK cells used in this study</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A more complicated question concerns the extent to which this pathway works on endogenous SUN2. In available protein turnover data (PMID: 34626566), SUN2 is really not an unstable protein (half-life of 8h or more). This could reflect that most of the protein is assembled into a stable complex, but of course, there could be small amounts of protein that didn't assemble properly which could be degraded by this pathway. In the experiments reported, it is likely that significant levels of SUN2 are not associated with partner proteins and is therefore mimicking a potential QC pathway. So we are wondering if you can measure turnover of the endogenous protein in the context of b-TRCP shRNA and see if you detect any turnover of the protein normally. If not, the reviewers feel that the paper/data itself is still valuable but that it might require re-working the paper a bit to more of a quality control angle. One experiment that could shed light on this question is to reduce the levels of SUN2-associated proteins and see if that increases the pool of SUN2 that is degraded in a b-TRCP-dependent manner. One could use MLN4924 to do prescreens to determine which subunits of the SUN2 complex might be most critical for the maintenance of its stability. It is also possible you have considered this model and have data for or against this model, and if so, this could change how to address this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with the published literature, we observe that endogenous SUN2 is normally a long-lived protein. We now show that depletion of the phosphatase CTDNEP1 dramatically reduces the half-life of endogenous SUN2 (Figure 5C). Importantly, the degradation of endogenous SUN2 is inhibited in cells lacking βTrCP (Figure S4D) or treated with MLN4924, CB5083 or Bortezomib (Figure S4C). Therefore, both endogenous and transgenic SUN2 follow the same degradation pathway.</p><p>The physiological condition(s) leading to SUN2 degradation remain under investigation as a parallel project in our lab and in our opinion fall outside of the scope of the current work. However, data in the literature and our preliminary results argue against SUN2 degradation being related with its assembly state. SUN2 variants lacking the luminal SUN domain (for example SUN2(1-260)) and therefore unable to assemble with Nesprins (via the SUN domain) into a LINC complex display steady state levels comparable to WT SUN2 (see for example PMID: 20551905). These data were reproduced independently in our lab. In agreement with these observations, our preliminary data indicate that SUN2 levels are unaltered by depletion of Nesprin 1 or 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Thus, assembly with Nesprins does not appear to determine SUN2 stability.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>CRISPR/Cas9-mediated depletion of Nesprin1 (SYNE1) and Nesprin2 (SYNE2) in SUN2 WT or SUN2 2<sup>D</sup>-expressing HEK TF cells.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81573-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>On the other hand, we observe that the turnover of endogenous SUN2 is influenced by the turnover rates of overexpressed SUN2. This is mostly obvious for cells overexpressing the SUN2 Site 2<sup>A</sup> and Site 2<sup>D</sup> mutants, which increase and decrease the stability of endogenous SUN2, respectively (see Figure 1E). Since SUN2 functions as an homotrimer, this effect likely reflects the assembly of Site 2<sup>A</sup> and Site 2<sup>D</sup> mutants with endogenous SUN2. We comment on this observation in the Results section.</p><p>In summary, our current data strongly support a model in which SUN2 stability is mainly dependent on the phosphorylation state of nucleoplasmic site 2 and appears independent of its assembly state. Since this is at the moment not fully resolved point, it will not be discussed in further detail in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are several other suggestions for experiments or changes in the text that will improve the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>These suggestions are addressed point-by-point below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Although it is understandable that for mutagenesis and CRISPR screen studies, over-expressed SUN2 bearing a tractable tag is necessary, it is important for the authors to validate key findings using endogenous SUN2. In this regard, the role of CK2 (Figure 5F) and SCF β TrCP (Figure 5D) in SUN2 turnover in phosphatase CTDNEP1 knockout cells should be further confirmed with endogenous SUN2.</p></disp-quote><p>The original submission showed that depletion of CTDNEP1 lead to strong reduction of endogenous SUN2 levels (Figure 5A-B). Importantly this could be rescued by re-expression of WT CTDNEP1 but not by phosphatase dead CTDNEP1 (Figure 5E). In the revised manuscript, we include new data showing that the turnover of endogenous SUN2 is dramatically accelerated in cells lacking CTDNEP1 (Figure 5C) and that this acceleration is curbed by MLN4924, CB5083 and Bortezomib (Figure supplement 4C). Together with the additional data, these experiments demonstrate that CTDNEP1 regulates the turnover of both overexpressed and endogenous SUN2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To address the physiologic relevance of the reported SUN2 degradation, the authors may consider genetically editing the site 2 sequence of SUN2 to abolish this regulation. They can then examine whether this can cause any cellular defects as shown in Figure 6. If this is technically challenging, they need to carefully discuss the limitations of their experimental design and include alternative interpretations in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. It would be great to gene edit the SUN2 locus to introduce the desired mutations. But as pointed out this is not trivial, in particular considering that the desired mutations would need to be introduced in both chromosomal copies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. They should consider changing the title and discuss the potential physiological conditions that may trigger SUN2 degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our comments to point 2 above. We believe that the title is appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should also comment on the subcellular localization of CK2 and CTDNEP1 and whether that can support the degradation of inner nuclear envelope proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We now mention that SCF<sup>βTrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase, CK2 and CTDNEP1 all localize to the nucleus there by being able to access SUN2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
