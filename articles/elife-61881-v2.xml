different behaviors. Without rewiring its anatomical connectivity, how can a motor neuron dynamically switch roles to play appropriate roles in various behaviors? We previously used voltage-sensitive dye imaging to record from DE-3 and most other neurons in the leech segmental ganglion during (fictive) swimming, crawling, and local-bend escape (Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017). Here, we repeated that experiment, then re-imaged the same ganglion using serial blockface electron microscopy and traced DE-3’s processes. Further, we traced back the processes of DE-3’s presynaptic partners to their respective somata. This allowed us to analyze the relationship between circuit anatomy and the activity patterns it sustains. We found that input synapses important for all the behaviors were widely distributed over DE-3’s branches, yet that functional clusters were different during (fictive) swimming vs. crawling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hirudo verbana</kwd><kwd>voltage-sensitive dye imaging</kwd><kwd>serial blockface electron microscopy</kwd><kwd>motor behaviors</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS094403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kristan</surname><given-names>William B</given-names><suffix>Jnr</suffix></name><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name><name><surname>Wagenaar</surname><given-names>Daniel A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P41-GM103412</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201800526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomina</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K16191</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomina</surname><given-names>Yusuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2EZP3-181896</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kassraian</surname><given-names>Pegah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U24NS120055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ellisman</surname><given-names>Mark H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Voltage-dye imaging followed by serial blockface electron microscopy of the same ganglion reveals structure–function relationships of leech motor behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some neural circuits are responsible for only one specialized function. Examples include the exquisitely tuned delay lines that barn owls use to locate sounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Carr and Konishi, 1988</xref>) and the motor neurons that control the honeybee’s stinger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ogawa et al., 1995</xref>). In the early days of neuroscience, those circuits received most attention, likely because they are in important ways more tractable. In most animals’ central nervous systems, however, many circuits respond to stimuli of multiple sensory modalities or control more than one behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>). Increasingly, even sensory brain areas once considered unimodal are found to be modulated by or to directly respond to other sensory modalities, or to be modulated by behavioral state. For instance, auditory stimuli can modulate activity in the human visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plass et al., 2019</xref>) (in sighted as well as in blind subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedny et al., 2015</xref>]). Likewise, motor cortex activity can be modulated not just by visual presentation of images of relevant body parts, but even in a working memory task in the absence of immediate stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Galvez-Pol et al., 2018</xref>). All these forms of multifunctionality likely contribute to the versatility of large brains like ours and may help smaller animals use their more constrained neural hardware more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>).</p><p>A particularly interesting situation occurs when multifunctional circuits converge onto a single motor neuron which plays distinct roles in different behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miroschnikow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zarin et al., 2019</xref>). What functional and anatomical aspects of the converging pathways permit the output neuron to play its various roles? Control of locomotion in the medicinal leech (<italic>Hirudo verbana</italic>) is a prime example of a system organized in this manner. In each of the animal’s segmental ganglia, partially overlapping circuits generate the rhythms for swimming and crawling as well as the dynamics of an escape behavior known as the local bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017</xref>). These circuits have a common output in a motor neuron called DE-3 that excites the animal’s dorsal longitudinal muscles. DE-3 plays markedly different dynamical roles in each of the behaviors: In swimming, it oscillates at a relatively rapid 2 Hz in antiphase to its Ventral Excitor counterpart (VE-4) and controls the local dorsal flexion phase of the swim rhythm. In crawling, it is active in phase with VE-4 and controls the contraction phase of the crawl rhythm. In ‘local bending’ it operates in tight concert with its contralateral homolog as well as VE-4 to precisely deform the local body wall away from a mechanical stimulus.</p><p>To study the mechanisms underlying the versatility of multifunctional circuits, one would ideally like to record from every single neuron in a nervous system during all of the behaviors the animal can execute, and then reconstruct the anatomical connections between those neurons. Once a mere dream, this is rapidly becoming practicable: Activity imaging using calcium dyes has advanced to the point where simultaneous recordings from the vast majority of individual neurons in smaller species can be accomplished, for instance in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2013</xref>). This technique has even been applied to behaving animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiao et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, anatomical imaging using electron microscopy (EM) has advanced to the point that brains as large as that of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> can be imaged—and substantial fractions of their circuitry reconstructed—at a synaptic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maniates-Selvin et al., 2020</xref>). Even small vertebrate brains like that of larval zebrafish are yielding to this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hildebrand et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To bring form and function together, an anatomical atlas based on electron microscopy can be combined with functional studies that use the split-GAL4 system to target individual neurons and identify them with neurons in the anatomical map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eschbach et al., 2020</xref>). This is an immensely powerful approach because a single (costly and time consuming) EM run can be used with an unlimited number of functional studies. However, cross-identification of neurons between EM and functional imaging in this approach is ultimately limited by the fact that all nervous systems, even the simplest ones, exhibit considerable variability in their connectomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharya et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, robustly linking function to connectivity requires a combined anatomical and functional assessment within the same animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>). Nearly a decade ago, back-to-back papers in <italic>Nature</italic> described two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse visual cortex followed by serial transmission electron microscopy of a small volume of that same cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bock et al., 2011</xref>) and two-photon calcium imaging in the mouse retina followed by serial block face electron microscopy of that same retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>). This approach, ‘Correlated Light and Electron Microscopy’ or CLEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Boer et al., 2015</xref>), has since allowed the quantification of synaptic connections between functionally identified neurons that control eye movement in the larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vishwanathan et al., 2017</xref>), a reconstruction of the connections in the olfactory bulb of another larval zebrafish in which neural responses to eight different odors had been recorded prior to sectioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wanner and Friedrich, 2020</xref>), and a critical re-assessment of the mechanisms of selectivity to particular sensory features in neurons of the mammalian visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scholl et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>For the present study of multifunctional behavioral circuits, we chose to use a voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinvald and Hildesheim, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kulkarni and Miller, 2017</xref>) rather than a calcium dye because it can capture faster temporal dynamics, potentially even recording individual action potentials, as well as both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials. We used a fast, high-sensitivity VSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>) to record the neuronal activity in a segmental ganglion of the medicinal leech <italic>Hirudo verbana</italic> while its nervous system expressed several (fictive) behaviors. Then, to map the circuits underlying those behaviors with synapse-level resolution, we re-imaged the same individual ganglion using serial blockface electron microscopy (SBEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lippens et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, we traced the full arborization of the DE-3 motor neuron and the relevant parts of all its presynaptic partners, to enable comparison between functional and anatomical features of the circuit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the overall approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time VSDs and SBEM have been combined at this scale.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Approach.</title><p>Several fictive behaviors were induced in the isolated nervous system of a medicinal leech while one segmental ganglion was imaged using a voltage-sensitive dye.

Each ganglion consists of about 400 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Macagno, 1980</xref>) with cell bodies arranged in a spherical monolayer around a central neuropil. In the neuropil, neurons communicate through chemical and electrical synapses located along extensively branched neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muller and McMahan, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pipkin et al., 2016</xref>). The leech is an ideal model organism for this type of work, because it robustly expresses several behaviors even in reduced preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>), its neurons are uncommonly accessible to physiological recording, and its cell bodies are relatively large and thus yield strong VSD signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggman et al., 2005</xref>). Crucially, an individual segmental ganglion is a good stand-in for a whole nervous system, because its neurons capture the entire pathway from sensory input through self-generated interneuronal rhythms to motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kristan et al., 2005</xref>), which is why we focused our imaging efforts there.</p><p>We expressed (fictive) swimming, crawling, and local bending behavior in the isolated nervous system of a single adult leech following the same protocol used for a previous extensive study of these behaviors using VSD imaging in a larger group of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017</xref>). As in the previous study, one segmental ganglion in the chain was prepared for VSD imaging and we recorded from both the ventral and dorsal aspects simultaneously with a double-sided fluorescence microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). We were able to record from 250 neurons simultaneously, similar to our previous results. Fictive swimming was induced by electrical stimulation of a posterior segment, which resulted in characteristic rhythmic activity in dorsal motor neurons and many other neurons on both sides of the ganglion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Coherence analysis confirmed that the rhythms of the various neurons were indeed related to the fictive behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). In a similar manner, we induced fictive crawling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and local bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fictive swimming imaged using VSD.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Images of the dorsal (<italic>left</italic>) and ventral (<italic>right</italic>) aspects of a leech ganglion simultaneously obtained using a double-sided microscope. ‘R’ indicates the right side of the ganglion (i.e., the animal’s right when dorsal side up).

First we asked whether there was a relationship between the overal functional strength of involvement of presynaptic partners and the number of synapses they make onto DE-3<sup>R</sup>. We thus calculated the correlation coefficients between synapse count and the previously obtained coherence magnitudes of the synaptic partners in each of the behavioral trials (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

To test whether these results were robust, we replaced the synapse count by a ‘proximity weight’ (see Materials and methods) and repeated the analysis. This yielded similar results: The average across trials of the correlation coefficients was again significantly positive (two-sided t-test, <italic>t</italic> = 2.77, <italic>p</italic> = 0.028, <italic>n</italic> = 8).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Correlation between anatomical and functional measures of synaptic strength.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Scatter plot of synapse count vs coherence magnitude during swimming for presynaptic partners with at least two synapses, with linear regression line (data from swim trial #1, <italic>R</italic> = 0.26, p = 0.20, n.s.).

Excitation and inhibition rely on different physiological processes and have asymmetric effects on cell membrane potential. Accordingly, one might expect that excitatory and inhibitory cells synapse onto their target cells in distinct spatial patterns. For instance, to achieve shunting inhibition, inhibitory synapses would have to be located close to the target cell’s spike initiation zone. We therefore considered all the input synapses onto DE-3<sup>R</sup> from neurons with previous descriptions in the literature, and annotated them as either excitatory or inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). Presynaptic neurons for which no previous description as excitatory or inhibitory was found were annotated as 'unknown'. The spatial distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses were not found to be different from the other (‘unknown’) synapses, either when distance was measured to the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>), or when it was measured to the primary neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1a</xref>) of the postsynaptic tree.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Spatial distribution of synapses onto DE-3.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Distribution of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.

This versatility requires a dynamic functional reorganization of the underlying structural circuit. The question hence arises what the principles governing this dynamic reorganization are. We considered whether the anatomy of DE-3<sup>R</sup> facilitates reading out the different patterns of synchronicity in its presynaptic partners during different behaviors.</p><p>We first looked at all neurons that we could cross-reference between EM and VSD recordings (regardless of whether the function of those neurons had previously been described) and, for each of the three behaviors, selected the cells that exhibited the highest coherence with DE-3<sup>R</sup> in that behavior (see Materials and methods).

Work on molecular markers of electrical synapses that do not require expression of a particular connexin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shu et al., 2011</xref>) may overcome this hurdle in the foreseeable future.</p><p>In previous reports, 21 neurons (including bilateral homologues) were found to be monosynaptically connected to the DE-3<sup>R</sup> motor neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Of those, four (bilateral DI-1, 107, and L) were matched to the presynaptic partners seen in the VSD imaging and identified with sufficient confidence. The other neurons previously reported were not confidently matched to presynaptic partners found here. Six other new partners were confidently identified (VI-2, 8, 101, 102, 109, and 117), and a further 41 synaptic partners of DE-3<sup>R</sup> could not be confidently identified with any previously described neuron, mainly because our limited tracing did not allow a morphological identity match. With additional tracing, many of those remaining neurons could possibly be assigned to other previously reported presynaptic neurons shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>.</p><fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Wiring diagram of DE3.</title><p>The diagram shows synaptic connections onto DE3, including newly found presynaptic neurons in this study (yellow) and previously known ones (green if also found in this study; white otherwise).

There is considerable variation in the coherence values of specific cells between animals, but the data here fall within the range of values seen before. We conclude that the leech used in this study was representative of its species.</p><p>Overlaying the anatomical and activity images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and comparing with the established canonical maps of the ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagenaar, 2017</xref>) allowed us to address form–function relationships. For instance, our own data allowed us to ask whether neurons that are more strongly associated with a particular behavior than with others formed synapses onto the output motor neuron that were spatially localized. Such an arrangement would indicate a modular organization of the motor neuron’s processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). However, we found no evidence of such organization in DE-3<sup>R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c,d</xref>) other than a slight trend that swim-associated synapses tended to be located closer to the primary neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Since most presynaptic partners are multifunctional, the pre-motor network undoubtedly plays an important role in generating distinct motor patterns.</p><p>We also asked whether synapses with a particular valence (excitatory or inhibitory) were differently distributed along the tree, which would likewise have implications for possible models of computation in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Saha and Truccolo, 2019</xref>). Thanks to an extensive body of previously published electrophysiological recordings from the leech ganglion, the valence of many of DE-3<sup>R</sup>’s presynaptic partners is known, allowing us to visualize the spatial distributions of excitatory and inhibitory synapses separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). However, we found no obvious differences between the two classes of synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>The lack of macroscopic organization of functionally related synapses does not imply that the spatial arrangement of synapses on the tree has no functional relevance. Indeed, the limited experimental evidence currently available suggests that even clusters of two synapses are functionally relevant in the mammalian cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2012</xref>). Findings from computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Poirazi and Mel, 2001</xref>) and in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Losonczy and Magee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nevian et al., 2007</xref>) suggest that individual dendritic branches act as integrative compartments and that spatial synaptic clusters facilitate nonlinear dendritic integration. These results imply that connectivity has to be specific with respect to individual dendritic branches. Such a precision could arise through spontaneous neural activity where synaptic clusters are established by a branch-specific 'fire-together-wire-together' rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We therefore applied a spatial clustering algorithm to the input synapses on DE-3<sup>R</sup> and asked whether the clusters identified by that algorithm also stand out as functionally significant groupings. Indeed, we found a set of parameter values for which synapses within spatial clusters also clustered in the phase space of the swim rhythm and a different set of parameters for which synapses within spatial clusters also clustered in the phase space of the crawl rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11b,c</xref>). Results were highly consistent between trials of the same behavior. (The results of clustering were not consistent among local bending trials. This may stem from a nature of this reflex behavior: the responsiveness of the population of neurons involving pressure sensation is variable, reflecting the plasticity of the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Crisp and Burrell, 2009</xref>).)</p><p>Earlier work relied on light microscopy and could therefore not identify presynaptic partners. In contrast, our use of SBEM allowed us to assess such connection specificity based on individually identified synapses. Our findings confirm previous observations on the synchrony of proximal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>). An attractive interpretation of our results is that the clusters are the loci where inputs from synchronized presynaptic cell assemblies are integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briggman and Kristan, 2008</xref>). In agreement with earlier reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kleindienst et al., 2011</xref>), the strongest correspondence between spatial clusters and activity patterns was observed when synaptic clusters were defined by a maximum distance between nearest neighbors (<italic>d</italic><sub>NN</sub>) of up to 10 µm.</p><p>Computational and in vitro studies indicate that 10–20 synchronized inputs are required to trigger dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020</xref>). Existing in vivo studies, however, have found synchrony in only up to five neighboring dendritic spines, making it unclear what the impact of the synaptic clusters on the membrane potential of the posysynaptic neuron might be. The smaller number derived from in vivo conditions might stem from the limitations of experimental methods. Indeed, our results indicate that clusters of up to 23 synaptic members can display synchronous activity. Further work is required, however, to elucidate the role of synaptic clusters in vivo or ex vivo on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron under different experimental conditions.</p><p>Additional studies complementing our data are also required to more fully understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic integration in motor neurons like DE-3<sup>R</sup>. For instance, single-cell voltage imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhn and Roome, 2019</xref>) and voltage clamp using sharp electrodes on neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Laurent, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Takashima et al., 2006</xref>) would help determine where in the neurites active propagation of membrane potentials is supported and thus lead to a better understanding of how postsynaptic potentials as well as action potentials propagate through the tree. As it stands, we only have voltage data from the soma. Leech neurons—along with most neurons in the central nervous systems of other annelids, arthopods, and molluscs—have a unipolar morphology with the somata strictly segregated from neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bullock and Horridge, 1965</xref>). With notable exceptions (including sensory neurons in the leech and select insect motorneurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hancox and Pitman, 1992</xref>]), these somata are thought to play a relatively minor role in the integration of synaptic inputs to action potential outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andjelic and Torre, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Even so, the completeness of our functional dataset in combination with our anatomical data makes for an attractive basis for simulation studies to arrive at a computational understanding of multifunctional neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Real et al., 2017</xref>). Our data may also serve as a large-scale ground truth for EM segmentation algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plaza and Funke, 2018</xref>). This study not only represents an important step in a combined approach to studying multifunctional circuits at the synaptic level, but also lays the groundwork for a comprehensive neuronal mapping of a whole ganglion that semi-autonomously processes local sensory information and controls segmental movement.</p><p>The combination of anatomical methods with synaptic resolution and imaging techniques that can record from the entirety of the neurons of a circuit promises an extraordinary opportunity to assess neural computations at the level of circuit dynamics. Functional maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alivisatos et al., 2012</xref>) from recorded activity combined with anatomical connectomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denk et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bargmann and Marder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morgan and Lichtman, 2013</xref>) are therefore poised to become a powerful tool not only to have a better understanding of complex behaviors, but also to predict the outcomes of new manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Devor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kandel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2013</xref>.

Briefly, leeches (<italic>Hirudo verbana</italic>, obtained from Niagara Leeches, Niagara Falls, NY) were maintained on a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark cycle in temperature-controlled aquariums filled with artificial pond water. The entire nervous system of an adult leech was removed and pinned down on silicone (PDMS, Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI). The sheath surrounding one segmental ganglion (M10) was removed from both ventral and dorsal aspects to allow access with voltage-sensitive dyes. Most of the nerves that innervate the periphery were cut short, but several were kept long to allow extracellular stimulation as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017</xref>). A voltage-sensitive dye (VF2.1(OMe).H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodford et al., 2015</xref>] provided by Evan Miller) was bath-loaded at a concentration of 800 nM in leech saline using a pair of peristaltic pumps to evenly load cell membranes on both sides of the ganglion. The preparation was placed on a custom-built dual-headed microscope which was used to image neuronal activity during fictive behaviors triggered by electrical stimulation, as in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tomina and Wagenaar, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We manually drew regions of interest (ROIs) around neuronal cell bodies and used custom software to associate those ROIs with named cells on the canonical maps of the leech ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wagenaar, 2017</xref>).

The ganglion was mounted on a slab of silicone (DPMS) with a hole cut out in the center so that the somata would not be in direct contact with the silicone. This preparation was transferred into a glass container and incubated for 72 hr at 4 °C in 2% paraformaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.15 M cacodylate buffer containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Subsequently, the ganglion was washed in cacodylate buffer for 10 min and then incubated in an aqueous solution of 2% OsO<sub>4</sub> and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide. During this incubation, the sample was microwaved in a scientific microwave (Pelco 3440 MAX) three times at 800 W with a duty cycle of 40 s on and 40 s off at a controlled temperature of 35 °C and subsequently left at room temperature (RT) for 30 min.

The sample was then washed and dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions (50%, 70%, 90%, 100%, 100%, 10 min each) at RT and incubated in acetone. After this, the sample was infiltrated with epoxy resin by first incubating it for one day at RT in a solution of 25% Durcupan (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in acetone. On subsequent days, the concentration of Durcupan was increased to 50%, 75%, and finally 100%.

First, we reduced the linear resolution of the original images by a factor five. Then we split each image into 5 × 5 sub-tiles and calculated the optimal alignment between each sub-tile and the corresponding sub-tile from the image above using a modified version of SWIFT-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wetzel et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, we split the regions of overlap that existing between images of the same slice into five sub-tiles and calculated the optimal alignment between the edges of adjacent images. We used these latter numbers to coarsely align images within each slice and render the first and last slices of each subrun at 1:25 scale, which allowed us to establish regions of correspondence between subruns. Using these procedures, we ended up with 3,430,650 matching pairs of image locations. Because SWIFT-IR matches up entire areas rather than single point pairs, those locations are defined at a much higher resolution than that of the images. Accordingly, alignment information obtained at a scale of 1:5 could be used to align the source images at scale 1:1 without material loss of precision.</p><p>Next, we split the full EM volume up into subvolumes of 200 slices with 50% overlap between subsequent subvolumes (Stefan Saalfeld, personal communication) and optimized alignment in each subvolume independently. This was done in three steps: (1) Coarse alignment of all the z-stacks from all of the subruns involved in the subvolume relative to each other; (2) Refinement of this alignment by determining optimal rigid translation of each tile relative to its substack; (3) Further refinement through elastic deformation. This procedure resulted in absolute coordinates for a grid of points in each source image.</p><p>We then rendered each slice by linearly combining the placement according to the two subvolumes that incorporated the slice. We divided each slice up into nonoverlapping rectangles and rendered pixels from one source image into each rectangle using a perspective transformation derived from the grid coordinates calculated in the previous step.</p><p>The full-resolution stitched volume was then split into tiles of 512 × 512 × 1 voxels and reduced-resolution tiles at 1:2, 1:4, up to 1:256 resolution were produced for faster online visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Visualization</title><p>We developed a custom tool for visualizing the aligned images and for neurite tracing.

The proximity weight of a synapse was defined as the inverse of its distance to the soma of DE-3<sup>R</sup> (measured along the neurite), and the proximity weight of a neuron was defined as the sum of the proximity weights of its synapses onto DE-3<sup>R</sup>. Neurons were included in the calculation if (1) their somata could be matched between VSD and SBEM images and (2) they had at least two synapses onto DE-3<sup>R</sup> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We first looked at the coherence values in all cells and all behaviors, and assigned the neuron that had the greatest coherence to the behavior in which it had that coherence value. In the second step, we looked at the coherence values in all the other cells and both other behaviors, and assigned the top-cohering cell to a behavior. In the third step, we looked at the coherence values in all remaining cells in the last remaining behavior, and assigned the top-cohering cell to that behavior. In the fourth step, we once again considered all behaviors. In this manner, we continued until all cells had been assigned to a behavior. It should be noted that most cells were active in all behaviors to some degree, and that not all differences in absolute coherence values between behaviors were large. Accordingly, some variability in assigned should be expected across animals.</p><p>The primary neurite was defined as the path between the soma and the point where the axon leaves the ganglion through the contralateral dorsal posterior nerve.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Synaptic clustering analysis</title><p>The analysis was based on data from the 45 synaptic partners of DE-3<sup>R</sup> for which both anatomical as well as VSD recordings were available.

Then, it iteratively joined the two clusters with minimum distance between their most proximal elements (‘single-linkage’ clustering). However, if a joint cluster would exceed the limit on overall spatial extent (<italic>d</italic><sub>ext</sub>), its putative constituents were not joined. Aggregation stopped when no pairs of clusters were left with acceptable nearest-neighbor distance (i.e. less than <italic>d</italic><sub>NN</sub>) and acceptable joint spatial extent (i.e. less than <italic>d</italic><sub>ext</sub>). All distances were measured along the neurites of DE-3<sup>R</sup> rather than by Euclidean metric in the volume. Clusters comprising only a single synapse were not considered for further analysis.</p><p>The analysis of functional significance of spatial clusters used an ANOVA-like procedure on the complex spectral coherence values of neurons within clusters relative to DE-3<sup>R</sup>. As in ANOVA, we calculated sums of squares within and between clusters. Since coherence values are complex numbers, we used the <italic>absolute</italic> square value.

an anatomical wiring diagram onto functional maps for the generation of distinct behaviors. They do this by combining voltage -sensitive dye imaging and EM reconstruction of the circuit to reveal functional synaptic locations onto a single motor neuron in 3 different behaviors. This study will be of great significance for bridging our understanding of neural basis of behaviors at the synaptic, cellular and circuit levels.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anatomy and activity patterns in a multifunctional motor neuron and its surrounding circuits&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christel Genoud (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>In this manuscript, Ashabar et al. use a combination of voltage imaging and electron microscopy to explore the important question of how a specific motor neuron participates in distinct behaviors. The authors first perform voltage imaging of a leech ganglion to capture activity patterns of a large number of neurons during three fictive motor patterns: swimming, crawling, and local bending. Next, they perform x-ray tomography and serial block-face EM in order to reconstruct the inputs onto DE-3, a motor neuron that has different activity patterns during all three behaviors. The authors suggest that inputs correlated with distinct behaviors are widely distributed across the dendritic arbor of DE-3, but that synapses from presynaptic neurons with coherent activity cluster together more frequently than would be expected by chance. The addition of an EM dataset to the previous study on voltage imaging of the leech ganglion certainly constitutes a valuable advance.</p><p>Major Concerns:</p><p>1) The premise of this study is that mapping subcellular localization of synaptic inputs onto DE-3 may explain the multifunctionality of the DE-3 motor neuron. However, it is clear from the voltage imaging experiments that many of the premotor neurons are also active during multiple behaviors.</p><p>a) How do the authors assign neurons to distinct behaviors in Figure 8 when Figures 2-4 show that the same neurons are active across multiple behaviors?</p><p>b) If the premotor neurons are also multifunctional (i.e., active during multiple behaviors), then why would one expect there to be differences in subcellular localization on the motor neuron? Given the results from the voltage imaging data, it seems that the pre-motor network should be more important for generating distinct motor patterns, rather than integration of synaptic inputs in the DE-3 motor neuron.</p><p>2) The analysis of synapse distributions is confusing. The primary finding of the paper is that the structure of the functional clusters is different for different behaviors, as different clustering parameters gave optimal correspondence between clusters and the neural activity.</p><p>a) While useful as a statistical measure, it is not clear how the F-ratio score relates to strength of clustering or coherence of neural activity. The authors should provide additional measures that provide some indication of how much functional clustering would contribute to the activity of the motor neuron.</p><p>b) Additionally, it would be useful to see the distribution of how many neurons contribute synapses to each functional cluster. If the clusters arise from individual neurons, or a very small number of neurons, then it seems obvious that they would have a high coherence (with themselves).</p><p>c) Was an analysis of # of synapses versus known connectivity strength performed (to the extent this is known)? Or, for example, the strength of coherence with DE-3 versus number of synapses?</p><p>3) Another key analysis in the paper centers around measuring the distribution of synapses along the arbor of DE-3 (Figure 8). The authors find no differences between inhibitory/excitatory synaptic distributions nor neurons participating in different behaviors. It is unclear whether using the cell body as the reference point is a good choice for these analyses, given the unipolar nature of the motor neuron. It would be worthwhile to</p><p>a) Measure the distribution of synapses along the motor neuron arbor as a function of the distance from the primary neurite, as shunting inhibition could also occur in an arbor-specific manner, or</p><p>b) Use a point on the axon as a reference point rather than the soma, as the spike initiation zone is likely nowhere near the soma.</p><p>4) Generally an analysis of the known presynaptic connectivity onto DE-3 versus what was found in this study seems to be missing. Including a wiring diagram of the known monosynaptic presynaptic connections onto DE-3 would be extremely helpful along with an indication of which of these known connections were found in the volume and which were not (cells 27, 208, 204/205, etc…)</p><p>5) A reconstruction of a juvenile DE-3 was previously reported in Pipkin et al. How do the locations and distributions of synapses in the current volume compare to that reconstruction? At what developmental stage was the leech in this study?</p><p>6) The data quality in Pipkin et al. (e.g. the ability to resolve vesicles) seems to be higher than in this volume? Is this correct? Could data quality also be a reason for different synapse counts between the two datasets?</p><p>7) Why were 51-35 = 16 neurons not able to be matched to the VSD recording? Did they shift location during EM processing? Regarding the 35-10 = 25 neurons that were not included in the analysis because they could not be matched to known neurons: If the morphology of these 25 neurons had been completely traced, it seems at least possible they could have been matched based on morphology and previous light microscopy fills. It seems like this could have been done without too much effort given the size of leech neurons and the availability of programs to skeletonize neurons relatively rapidly. The number of synapses actually analyzed in Table 1 (~100 or so) is a small fraction of those actually identified onto DE-3 and it seems like such incompleteness could significantly impact the results in Figures 8 and 9.</p><p>8) It would be useful to see that the observed clustering on DE-3R is reproducible on DE-3<sup>L.</sup> Given that the final number of neurons used in this analysis is small, is this feasible?</p><p>9) Is it possible to reconstruct the contralateral DE-3 homolog to examine contact locations with the analyzed DE-3 and whether there is an anatomical signature of an electrical synapse?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anatomy and activity patterns in a multifunctional motor neuron and its surrounding circuits&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christel Genoud (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript is greatly improved after the first round of revisions. However, reviewers point out several places where clarifications and/or revising claims is essential. Please address these points.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>All the requests raised by the first review have been carefully considered. The new figures have positively improved the clarity of the results. The added analysis have strengthened the results and conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The revisions made some of the analyses and conclusions more clear. We have four remaining concerns, intended to help explain and clarify the approach for a general scientific audience.</p><p>1) The revised Materials and methods section clarifies the process used to classify neurons as belonging to distinct behaviors. This does not, however, justify that it is appropriate to classify neurons in this manner. It appears as if most neurons that have been classified as participating in one behavior exhibit similar levels of activity during other behaviors. This is also clear from Figure 4J in the previous (original) paper. The authors should provide some justification for assigning neurons to specific behaviors. Wouldn't the tree analysis still assign neurons to single behaviors even if all neurons participated in all behaviors? Would the assignment be repeatable across individual animals?</p><p>2) In response to our previous comment about premotor neurons being multifunctional (ie, participating in multiple behaviors), the authors added a statement that &quot;DE-3 may be a relatively passive integrator of its inputs.&quot; I find this confusing. The synapse clustering analysis seems to suggest that DE-3 is not a passive integrator of inputs. If it were, would one not expect there to be no clustering at all?</p><p>3) In response to our concern about the interpretability of the F-Ratio, the authors provide some additional description in the Results and Materials and methods. This is helpful, but it would still be useful to provide some context for readers unfamiliar with this ratio. This context could be provided with some examples of F-ratio values for highly clustered or randomly distributed synapses.</p><p>4) It would be helpful to compare the coherence analyses in this manuscript with that from the previous (original) paper. They do not always appear similar across the two manuscripts. This should be discussed, especially given the data quality concerns between this paper and the previous one.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed most of the issues pointed out in the initial review adequately. There are a few additional points I had:</p><p>1) I still cannot see the dataset at: https://leechem.caltech.edu/. It leads to a 502 Gateway Error.</p><p>2) I think the correlation analysis of synapse number vs coherence should be added as a supplement to the paper, despite it yielding a statistically insignificant correlation.</p><p>3) This sentence in the Discussion should be corrected: “We reconstructed its entire arborization and traced all of its presynaptic partners back to their somata.” This is not true based on the number of untraceable synapses, right? The Abstract contains a similar claim.</p><p>4) Including details of what limited the data quality would help future experimenters decide on imaging parameters. Perhaps adding a “Comment on data quality” to the Materials and methods section?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61881.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns</p><p>1) The premise of this study is that mapping subcellular localization of synaptic inputs onto DE-3 may explain the multifunctionality of the DE-3 motor neuron.

We have added text in Results and Materials and methods to clarify this, including a new Box that outlines the procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should provide additional measures that provide some indication of how much functional clustering would contribute to the activity of the motor neuron.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of synaptic clusters in vivo or ex vivo is a topic of ongoing research. In particular, how the background activity of in vivo conditions affects integrative dendritic properties is not yet fully understood. To answer the reviewer’s request would require a detailed biophysical model, which we deem out of the scope of the current work. Such a model <italic>was</italic> constructed in a recent study of mouse CA1 pyramidal cells, in which the authors benchmarked characteristics of Na<sup>+</sup> spikes, the amplitude distribution of synaptic potentials, the integration of NMDA receptors, voltage thresholds, and the functional role of K<sup>+</sup> channels as predicted by their model against the relevant values derived from in vitro conditions (Ujfalussy and Makara, 2020).</p><p>Our aim was rather to address another fundamental aspect underlying the functional role of synaptic clusters: If individual dendritic branches are to serve as single computational compartments, connectivity has to be not only specific between neurons, but precise with respect to individual dendritic branches. This precision could arise for instance through spontaneous neural activity or NMDA receptor signaling, such that synaptic clusters displaying synchronous activity are established through a branch-specific “fire-together-wire-together” rule (Kleindienst et al., 2011).</p><p>To assess this level of connection precision, it is fundamental to differentiate between clusters of synapses from the same presynaptic neuron vs. those from different presynaptic neurons, a feat which requires the precision of Electron Microscopy, and which could not been achieved in previous studies of synaptic clustering based on light microscopy (Druckmann et al., 2014).</p><p>Our finding that spatially clustered synapses display synchronized activity confirms observations on synchronous proximal synapses from previous studies (Kleindienst et al., 2011, Takahashi et al., 2012). Our analysis also serves as a “proof of concept”, illustrating what can be achieved by combining functional recording and EM reconstruction, which we hope will become standard in future connectomics studies.</p><p>We have added additional text in the Discussion section that seeks to convey the above ideas in a slightly more concise form.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Additionally, it would be useful to see the distribution of how many neurons contribute synapses to each functional cluster.

At a gross level, the input synapses onto DE-3 were distributed similarly in our sample as in the juvenile.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The data quality in Pipkin et al. (e.g. the ability to resolve vesicles) seems to be higher than in this volume? Is this correct? Could data quality also be a reason for different synapse counts between the two datasets?</p></disp-quote><p>Our image quality is indeed not as high as in Pipkin et al., 2016. There were three reasons for that: (1) To be able to image a much larger volume in a reasonable timespan, we had to accept a shorter per-pixel dwell time. (2) To reduce charging artifacts in the larger volume, we used gas injection (Deerinck et al., 2018) which had a small negative impact on signal to noise. (3) During our acquisition run, the microscope suffered from a hardware defect involving a bad cable. This last issue probably accounted for the majority of the difference. It is certainly possible that image quality had an effect on synapse counts, although it should be noted that our synapse count is right in between the counts Pipkin et al. report for the two DE-3 cells in their dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Why were 51-35 = 16 neurons not able to be matched to the VSD recording? Did they shift location during EM processing? Regarding the 35-10 = 25 neurons that were not included in the analysis because they could not be matched to known neurons: If the morphology of these 25 neurons had been completely traced, it seems at least possible they could have been matched based on morphology and previous light microscopy fills. It seems like this could have been done without too much effort given the size of leech neurons and the availability of programs to skeletonize neurons relatively rapidly. The number of synapses actually analyzed in Table 1 (~100 or so) is a small fraction of those actually identified onto DE-3 and it seems like such incompleteness could significantly impact the results in Figures 8 and 9.</p></disp-quote><p>The neurons that could not be matched between EM and VSD did indeed shift during sample preparation. It is true that partial matching could have been done based on morphology. Unfortunately, given our image quality, complete tracing of all the neurons would have taken several years of effort. It is absolutely true that the incompleteness could have an impact on results. We are presently preparing for a second EM run, which should yield much higher image quality for future analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It would be useful to see that the observed clustering on DE-3R is reproducible on DE-3<sup>L.</sup> Given that the final number of neurons used in this analysis is small, is this feasible?</p></disp-quote><p>It would be very interesting to trace DE-3<sup>L</sup>. Unfortunately, we lack the resources to do so, as tracing DE-3<sup>R</sup> with its presynaptic partners took almost two years. Tracing DE-3<sup>L</sup> would likely take another year of work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is it possible to reconstruct the contralateral DE-3 homolog to examine contact locations with the analyzed DE-3 and whether there is an anatomical signature of an electrical synapse?</p></disp-quote><p>We partially traced DE-3<sup>L</sup>, but only insofar as needed to connect synapses to the soma. Our tracing includes three areas where the two neurons meet each other. Simply by inspecting relevant sections of the EM data, we could not confidently confirm any signature of electrical synapses (Fan et al., 2005). It is possible that future more sophisticated image analysis will change this picture.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The revisions made some of the analyses and conclusions more clear. We have four remaining concerns, intended to help explain and clarify the approach for a general scientific audience.</p><p>1) The revised Materials and methods section clarifies the process used to classify neurons as belonging to distinct behaviors. This does not, however, justify that it is appropriate to classify neurons in this manner. It appears as if most neurons that have been classified as participating in one behavior exhibit similar levels of activity during other behaviors. This is also clear from Figure 4J in the previous (original) paper. The authors should provide some justification for assigning neurons to specific behaviors. Wouldn't the tree analysis still assign neurons to single behaviors even if all neurons participated in all behaviors? Would the assignment be repeatable across individual animals?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence to the end of the “Tree analysis” Materials and methods subsection to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In response to our previous comment about premotor neurons being multifunctional (ie, participating in multiple behaviors), the authors added a statement that &quot;DE-3 may be a relatively passive integrator of its inputs.&quot; I find this confusing. The synapse clustering analysis seems to suggest that DE-3 is not a passive integrator of inputs. If it were, would one not expect there to be no clustering at all?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the sentence was confusing and removed it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In response to our concern about the interpretability of the F-Ratio, the authors provide some additional description in the Results and Materials and methods. This is helpful, but it would still be useful to provide some context for readers unfamiliar with this ratio. This context could be provided with some examples of F-ratio values for highly clustered or randomly distributed synapses.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion. We added a new figure supplement (Figure 11—figure supplement 3) to implement it, along with additional explanation in the Materials and methods section that now includes an explicit equation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be helpful to compare the coherence analyses in this manuscript with that from the previous (original) paper. They do not always appear similar across the two manuscripts. This should be discussed, especially given the data quality concerns between this paper and the previous one.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence to emphasize the considerable variation that always exists between animals in the coherence values of individual cells. It may also be worth noting that the coherence plots in the original paper were referenced to cells DI-1 (for swimming), AE (for crawling), or the stimulus (for local bending), rather than to DE-3 as in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors addressed most of the issues pointed out in the initial review adequately. There are a few additional points I had:</p><p>1) I still cannot see the dataset at: https://leechem.caltech.edu/. It leads to a 502 Gateway Error.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies. When the server rebooted, the software did not automatically restart. We have now fixed this shortcoming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I think the correlation analysis of synapse number vs coherence should be added as a supplement to the paper, despite it yielding a statistically insignificant correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>We particularly appreciate this recommendation. Looking at the data again, we realized we had never tested whether on average across trials the correlation coefficients were statistically significant. We have now performed that test and found that, in fact, they were. These results are presented in the new Figure 9 and corresponding text in Results and in Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) This sentence in the Discussion should be corrected: “We reconstructed its entire arborization and traced all of its presynaptic partners back to their somata.” This is not true based on the number of untraceable synapses, right? The Abstract contains a similar claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the words “entire” and “all,” both here and in the Abstract and added a qualifying phrase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Including details of what limited the data quality would help future experimenters decide on imaging parameters. Perhaps adding a “Comment on data quality” to the Materials and methods section?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a figure (Figure 6—figure supplement 2) that estimates true image resolution based on power spectra of image pixel intensities and added text to the Materials and methods section to describe our findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
