In addition to embryo quality and endometrial function, proper oviduct function is also essential for successful pregnancy establishment. Therefore, structural abnormalities or inflammation resulting from infection in the oviduct may impede the transport of embryos to the endometrium, thereby increasing the risk of miscarriage. However, our understanding of the biological processes that preserve the oviductal cellular structure and functional integrity is limited. Here, we report that autophagy-related protein ATG14 plays a crucial role in maintaining the cellular integrity of the oviduct by controlling inflammatory responses, thereby supporting efficient embryo transport. Specifically, the conditional depletion of the autophagy-related gene <italic>Atg14</italic> in the oviduct causes severe structural abnormalities compromising its cellular integrity, leading to the abnormal retention of embryos. Interestingly, the selective loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> in oviduct ciliary epithelial cells did not impact female fertility, highlighting the specificity of ATG14 function in distinct cell types within the oviduct. Mechanistically, loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> triggered unscheduled pyroptosis via altering the mitochondrial integrity, leading to inappropriate embryo retention and impeded embryo transport in the oviduct. Finally, pharmacological activation of pyroptosis in pregnant mice phenocopied the genetically induced defect and caused impairment in embryo transport. Together, we found that ATG14 safeguards against unscheduled pyroptosis activation to enable embryo transport from the oviduct to uterus for the successful implantation. Of clinical significance, these findings provide possible insights into the underlying mechanism(s) of early pregnancy loss and might aid in developing novel prevention strategies using autophagy modulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>oviduct</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Atg14</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD102680</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kommagani</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD104813</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kommagani</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD065435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kommagani</surname><given-names>Ramakrishna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD-042311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>P Lydon</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35HL145242</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holtzman</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Autophagy sustains oviduct homeostasis, modulates inflammation, and prevents excessive pyroptosis, ensuring efficient embryo transport and a well-balanced reproductive tract environment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A successful pregnancy is orchestrated by the sequential and coordinated events happening in the female reproductive tract (FRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang and Dey, 2006</xref>). Each of these events is crucial to advance to the next step in pregnancy. For example, as a first step, the ovary undergoes ovulation to release a mature ovum that is collected by oviduct fimbriae and funneled through the infundibulum into the ampulla where they get fertilized by sperm. The embryos then pass through the ampulla-isthmus junction to enter the isthmus of the oviduct before exiting via the distal utero-tubal junction (UTJ) to implant on the wall of the uterus. Recently, the intricate structural and cellular diversity of the oviduct has drawn significant attention, emphasizing its vital role in facilitating embryo development and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ford et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McKey et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harwalkar et al., 2021</xref>). Morphologically, the oviduct is divided into four evolutionarily conserved regions: the infundibulum (nearest the ovary), ampulla (the site of fertilization), isthmus (serving as a sperm reservoir and site for early embryonic development), and UTJ (connected to the uterus). Each of these segments comprises epithelial, stromal, and smooth muscle cells with lumen lined up with an epithelium containing secretory (PAX8<sup>+</sup>) and multi-ciliated (FOXJ1<sup>+</sup>) cells. While the infundibulum and ampulla are composed of more ciliated than secretory cells, the isthmus has more secretory than ciliated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dirksen and Satir, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2017</xref>). Successful pregnancy requires that the embryo transit the entire oviduct orchestrated by the following: (1) secretory cells producing oviduct fluid, (2) beating cilia to ensure unidirectional flow of the fluid, and (3) periodic contractions of surrounding muscle to propel fluid flow. Therefore, a combination of ciliary and muscular activity contributes to the overall success of oviduct embryo transport. This combination of ciliary and muscular activity plays a crucial role in the effective transport of the embryo through the oviduct. Any perturbations in these early pregnancy events can lead to adverse ripple effects that can compromise pregnancy outcomes. Previous studies have reported that impaired oviductal transport of embryos can lead to pregnancy failure and cause infertility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jiang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism is not yet completely understood.</p><p>Autophagy is a cellular process, evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals, that recycles long-lived proteins and organelles to maintain cell energy homeostasis. Autophagy is classically activated through the nutrient sensor or mammalian target of the rapamycin complex. Genetic screens for autophagy-defective mutants in yeast and other fungi have currently identified 41 autophagy-related (ATG) genes that play a primary role in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klionsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wen and Klionsky, 2016</xref>). Approximately half of these genes have homologs in higher organisms, and <italic>Atg14</italic> (also known as Barkor for Beclin 1 [<italic>Becn1</italic>]-associated autophagy-related key regulator) is one of them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Itakura et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2008</xref>). ATG14 is part of a protein complex that is composed of Beclin 1, vacuolar sorting protein 15 (VPS15), and VPS34 (also named as Pik3c3, the catalytic subunit of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), and this ATG14-containing complex plays an important role in the initiation process of autophagy.</p><p>Pyroptosis is a type of inflammatory cell death mediated by gasdermin (GSDM) and is a product of continuous cell expansion until the cytomembrane ruptures, resulting in the release of cellular contents that can activate strong inflammatory and immune responses. GSDM family proteins are the primary executioners of pyroptosis. Cytotoxic N-terminal of GSDMs generated from caspase-mediated cleavage of GSDM proteins oligomerizes and forms pores across the cell membrane, leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²) and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Aberrant activation of pyroptosis has been implicated in the progression of many diseases, including cancer and autoimmune, cardiovascular, and infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Man et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2022</xref>). Recent studies have shown that the interactions between pyroptosis and autophagy play an important role in various physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Man et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2022</xref>). For example, autophagy inhibition upregulates galangin-induced pyroptosis in human glioblastoma multiforme cells and promotes pneumococcus-induced pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). However, the studies defining the molecular interactions between the pyroptosis, and autophagy pathways are very limited.</p><p>With a better understanding of the fundamental process of autophagy, its pathophysiological functions have begun to be appreciated in the FRT. For example, mice deficient in key autophagy genes such as genetic knockout of <italic>Atg7</italic> or <italic>Becn1</italic> result in primary ovarian insufficiency and reduced progesterone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gawriluk et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, recent studies from our group established the roles of three different autophagy-specific genes: <italic>Atg16l</italic>, <italic>Fip200</italic>/<italic>Rb1cc1</italic>, or <italic>Becn1</italic> in endometrial physiological processes, including receptivity and decidualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oestreich et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Popli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oestreich et al., 2020b</xref>). However, none of these genes exhibited any discernible impact on oviduct function. Surprisingly, in this study, we revealed a critical role for ATG14 in maintaining proper oviduct function, specifically enabling the transport of embryos to the uterusâa function distinct from that of other autophagy-related proteins. Loss of ATG14 in the oviduct resulted in severe structural abnormalities, compromising its cellular integrity, and ultimately leading to embryo retention and infertility.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conditional deletion of <italic>Atg14</italic> in the FRT results in infertility despite the normal ovarian function</title><p>To explore the role of <italic>Atg14</italic> in uterine function, we first determined its expression levels in the uterus during early pregnancy (days 1â7) in mice. We found distinct expression of ATG14 in all the uterine compartments (luminal epithelium, glands, and stroma) by day 1 of pregnancy, which disappeared by day 2 of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, the ATG14 expression in the uterus reappeared by day 3 and persisted through day 7 of pregnancy. The period from day 3 to day 7 is critical as it is during this time when the uterus begins to prepare for embryo implantation and undergoes the decidualization process. Consistent with protein expression, similar <italic>Atg14</italic> expression at mRNA levels was noted in uteri from early pregnant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This analysis suggests a potential role for ATG14 protein in the uterine physiologic adaptations during early pregnancy. Thus, to study the role of ATG14 in uterine function, we generated a conditional knockout (<italic>Pr</italic><sup>cre/+</sup>; <italic>Atg14</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) mouse model by crossing <italic>Atg14</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice with mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of progesterone receptor promoter (<italic>Pr</italic><sup>cre/+</sup>). Histological examination of the uterus from adult females showed no gross morphological differences between <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, we did not find any overt defects in the ovary as cKO mice had normal follicles and corpus luteum like their corresponding controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Analysis of transcript levels from the uterus, ovary, and liver showed that while <italic>Atg14</italic> levels were efficiently depleted in uteri from cKO mice the levels were unaltered in the ovary and liver samples in control and cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis further confirmed the efficient deletion of ATG14 in all uterine compartments (epithelium and stroma) of cKO mice uteri compared to corresponding control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Atg14</italic> loss in the female reproductive tract (FRT) results in infertility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunofluorescent images of uteri from pregnant mice (n = 3) at the indicated days of pregnancy stained with an ATG14-specific antibody (green).

Thus, the effects of <italic>Atg14</italic> loss on uterine responsiveness to steroid hormones E2 and P4 were characterized. We performed an established hormone-induced uterine receptivity experiment, which involved ordered and co-stimulatory actions of E2 and P4, leading to the initiation of a receptive phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tong and Pollard, 1999</xref>). In response to E2 treatment, uteri from both <italic>Atg14</italic> control and cKO mice showed similar proliferation as evidenced by Ki-67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel).

Unexpectedly, oviduct flushing from cKO mice resulted in the retrieval of approximately 90% of embryos, suggesting their potential entrapment within the oviducts, impeding their transit to the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

The cKO mice oviduct lining shows marked eosinophilic cytoplasmic change akin to decidualization in human oviducts. Some of the cells showed degenerative changes with cytoplasmic vacuolization and nuclear pyknosis, loss of nuclear polarity, and loss of distinct cell borders giving an appearance of fusion of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The marked cytologic enlargement appears to cause luminal obliteration or narrowing resulting in a completely unorganized, obstructed, and narrow lumen, thereby hampering the path of embryos to reach the uterus as evident from an entrapped embryo shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Further, epithelial (cytokeratin KRT8-positive) and myosalpinx (Î±-smooth muscle active [SMA]-positive) marker analysis revealed completely distorted epithelial structures (in terms of loss of epithelial cell integrity) with no overt defects in the muscle organization in oviducts of cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, lower panel).

Based on these findings, we posit that Atg14 plays a crucial role in regulating the pyroptotic pathway by preserving the mitochondrial structural and functional integrity in the oviduct.</p><p>To substantiate the notion, we also evaluated the impact of unscheduled activation of pyroptosis on embryo transport. To test this, we employed a pyroptosis inducer, polyphyllin VI, and chose the optimal dose based on the established studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Teng et al., 2020</xref>). Wild-type females were mated with virile males and following the plug detection treated with polyphyllin VI for three consecutive days from 1 to 4 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We chose to treat mice from 1 to 4 dpc to activate unwarranted pyroptosis in oviduct during the embryo transport. Following the treatments, the oviducts, and uteri from both vehicle-treated and polyphyllin VI-treated were flushed. We found that pregnant females treated with polyphyllin VI showed ~50% embryo retention in the oviduct, whereas in the vehicle-treated group, no embryos were retained in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). Further analysis of embryos retrieved from polyphyllin-treated oviducts showed more percentage of developmentally delayed and non-viable embryos compared to embryos recovered from control uteri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The average number of embryos recovered from polyphyllin- and vehicle-treated mice was not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Histological analysis showed a marked induction in GSDMD expression compared to vehicle-treated mice oviducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, precisely activating the unscheduled pyroptosis during the critical period of embryo transport is technically challenging. Nonetheless, our findings provide evidence that unscheduled pyroptosis adversely affects embryo transport through the oviduct. Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>Atg14</italic> safeguards pyroptosis activation in the oviduct and allows the smooth transport of embryos to the uterus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Pharmacological activation of pyroptosis in the oviduct inhibits embryo transport.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental strategy for pyroptosis activation in pregnant female mice.

Specifically, we dissected the tissue-specific functions of ATG14 in the FRT using Cre driver mice targeting the FRT. Given that PR-Cre expresses postnatally in different tissues of FRT such as corpus luteum, oviducts, and different cellular compartments (epithelial, stromal, and myometrium) of uteri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soyal et al., 2005</xref>), we found that conditional ablation of ATG14-mediated functions in FRT resulted in infertility owing to hampered transport of embryos from the oviduct. Additionally, <italic>Atg14</italic> loss in uteri causes impaired embryo implantation and receptivity. Its ablation in the oviduct might lead to the activation of pyroptosis, an inflammatory-associated apoptosis pathway that causes the retention of embryos in the oviduct and prevents their timely transport to the uterus. However, the ovarian-specific functions were found to be unaffected despite the loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> in the corpus luteum.</p><p>The human endometrium is a complex dynamic tissue that undergoes sequential phases of proliferation and differentiation to support embryo implantation during the conceptive. However, in the absence of an implanting embryo, the endometrium sheds (menstruation) and initiates the regeneration process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Popli et al., 2022</xref>). Previous reports indicated that autophagy is modulated in the human endometrium during the menstrual cycle. For example, autophagy is altered during the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle with its highest activity occurring during the secretory phase when the stroma is decidualized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Choi et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the level of autophagy was higher in postmenopausal human uterine epithelial cells compared to premenopausal uterine epithelial cells, indicating the onset of autophagy upon estrogen deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Although all these studies reported that autophagy is hormonally regulated, however, the role of autophagy-specific proteins in the endometrium was not established till our groupâs recent reports. Specifically, studies from our group reported the role of three different autophagy-associated proteins: FIP200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oestreich et al., 2020a</xref>), ATG16L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oestreich et al., 2020b</xref>), and BECLIN-1 in uterine functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Popli et al., 2023</xref>). Conditional ablation of <italic>Fip200</italic> and <italic>Atg16l</italic> in the uterus displayed fertility defects owing to impaired implantation, uterine receptivity, and decidualization defects. On the contrary, loss of <italic>Beclin1</italic> in the uterus caused progressive loss of endometrial progenitor stem cells, resulting in severe uterine developmental defects and rendering the mice infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Popli et al., 2023</xref>). Although the autophagy-related proteins we studied so far influenced uterine functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oestreich et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Popli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oestreich et al., 2020b</xref>), we found a distinct role for ATG14 in both the uterine and oviduct-specific functions. It is intriguing to note that the absence of ATG14 did not affect the tissue integrity of the uterus. However, the severe structural abnormalities in the oviduct due to <italic>Atg14</italic> ablation unearthed a unique function of Atg14 in maintaining oviduct homeostasis. This distinctive role of ATG14, unlike other autophagy proteins, might be due to its pivotal role in the assembly of PtdIns3K complexes, which is not the case for either FIP200 or ATG16L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Popli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diao et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, understanding the specific contributions of each core autophagy protein in reproductive tract functions is necessary that requires substantial efforts.</p><p>The retention of preimplantation embryos in the oviduct has been established as a significant contributor to implantation failures, presenting challenges to the overall reproductive health of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). Embryo transport in the oviduct is known to be controlled primarily by two major physiological responses: ciliary activity and muscle contractility. In our study, a dramatic decrease in the number of Foxj1+ve ciliary epithelial cells and Pax-8+ve secretory cells in <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice implied cell-type-specific actions for ATG14 in the oviduct. Interestingly, the specific ablation of <italic>Atg14</italic> in Foxj1+ve ciliary epithelial cells of the oviduct does not appear to impact fertility. This suggests that the absence of ATG14 within ciliary cells does not impact the process of embryo transport. Although unexpected, this is consistent with other reports that have demonstrated the dispensability of cilia for embryo transport in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death, characterized by cell swelling, flattening of the cytoplasm, and large bubbles-like protrusions on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cookson and Brennan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jorgensen and Miao, 2015</xref>). Several recent studies found a link between autophagy and pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). In vivo studies also found that mice lacking the autophagy genes <italic>Atg14</italic>, <italic>Fip200</italic>, <italic>Atg5</italic>, or <italic>Atg7</italic> in myeloid cells had more pronounced lung inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, cellular swelling and fused membranous structures (a unique feature of activation of pyroptosis) were observed in the oviductal epithelial folds from <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice. This aberrant activation of the pyroptosis pathway due to loss of <italic>Atg14</italic> appears to adversely affect the oviduct cellular structural integrity. These findings have implications beyond the oviduct as autophagy can modulate the inflammatory signaling pathway through different avenues. For example, first, autophagy prevents mitochondrial reactive oxygen species release that can activate the inflammasome by inhibiting IL1-Î² and IL-18 production through the digestion of dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Netea-Maier et al., 2016</xref>). Second, autophagy is capable of targeting inflammasome complexes for degradation, which prevents the cleavage of pro-IL-1Î² and pro-IL-18 into biologically active forms. Finally, autophagy machinery further regulates IL-1Î² levels by engulfing and degrading pro-IL-1Î² proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Netea-Maier et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, accumulation of abnormally enlarged and dysfunctional mitochondria in the absence of ATG14 in the oviduct clearly suggests the induction of severe inflammatory conditions hampering the embryo transit through the oviduct. These findings are further substantiated by the upregulation of pivotal mediators of the pyroptosis program, including GSDMD and caspase-1, in <italic>Atg14</italic> cKO mice. Notably, the induction of pyroptosis in the absence of ATG14 is specifically localized to the oviducts, with no parallel activation detected in either the ovary or uterus. One potential reason for this observed phenomenon could be the oviductâs unique molecular signatures that get activated in response to the presence of gametes. A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finnerty et al., 2024</xref> reported that sperm induce pro-inflammatory conditions in the oviduct, which are preceded by an anti-inflammatory response triggered by the presence of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Finnerty et al., 2024</xref>). The persistent activation of inflammatory or pyroptotic conditions following the loss of Atg14 suggests that Atg14 may be a critical autophagy protein responsible for suppressing pyroptosis in the oviduct. Moreover, understanding the complex rheostat between the ATG14 and inflammation regulatory axis is highly intriguing and will necessitate future studies employing sophisticated models, such as combined knockout mice where ATG14 is deleted alongside key inflammatory regulators (e.g., NLRP3, GSDMD, or CASPASE-1).</p><p>In this report, we revealed tissue-specific roles of ATG14 in governing oviductal transport, and uterine receptivity that are necessary for embryo implantation and pregnancy establishment. Of mechanistic insights, we delineated a novel function of ATG14 as a negative regulator of pyroptosis, which is vital for proper embryo transport in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Thus, this study not only sheds light on the involvement of autophagy in oviductal embryo transport but also underscores the importance of autophagy in preserving the oviduct tissue integrity. Such insights hold promise for advancing our understanding of gynecological pathologies associated with the oviduct including tubal pregnancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal care and use</title><p>All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, MO (protocol number: 20160227) and the Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX (protocol number: AN-8890). <italic>Atg14</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice were provided by a gift from Dr. Shizuo Akira at the Department of Host Defense, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (RIMD), Osaka University, and previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsunaga et al., 2009</xref>).
