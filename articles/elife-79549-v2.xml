In turn, phages can acquire counter-defense systems, but it remains unclear how such mechanisms arise and what factors constrain viral evolution. Here, we experimentally evolved T4 phage to overcome a phage-defensive toxin-antitoxin system, <italic>toxIN</italic>, in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Through recombination, T4 rapidly acquires segmental amplifications of a previously uncharacterized gene, now named <italic>tifA</italic>, encoding an inhibitor of the toxin, ToxN. These amplifications subsequently drive large deletions elsewhere in T4’s genome to maintain a genome size compatible with capsid packaging. The deleted regions include accessory genes that help T4 overcome defense systems in alternative hosts. Thus, our results reveal a trade-off in viral evolution; the emergence of one counter-defense mechanism can lead to loss of other such mechanisms, thereby constraining host range. We propose that the accessory genomes of viruses reflect the integrated evolutionary history of the hosts they infected.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T4 phage</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>anti-phage defense</kwd><kwd>phage counter-defense</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laub</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guegler</surname><given-names>Chantal K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacteriophage can rapidly evolve resistance to anti-phage defense elements in bacteria by amplifying latent counter-defense genes, though this amplification comes at a cost of compensatory deletions that eliminate other counter-defense genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria face the frequent threat of phage predation and have consequently evolved a diverse arsenal of anti-phage defense systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bernheim and Sorek, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tal and Sorek, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wein and Sorek, 2022</xref>). These defense systems have, in turn, driven the selection of counter-defense mechanisms in phage, underscoring the intense arms race between phages and their bacterial hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>). There are several well-characterized examples of anti-restriction modification (RM) and anti-CRISPR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stanley and Maxwell, 2018</xref>). However, there is an ever-growing inventory of phage defense mechanisms in bacteria and how phages counteract these diverse systems is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Samson et al., 2013</xref>). More generally, it remains unclear how phages can rapidly acquire resistance when confronted with a new defense system and what types of mutations and mechanisms are responsible. Probing how phage overcome bacterial defense systems will help reveal the molecular basis of bacteria–phage coevolution and may inform efforts to develop phage therapies for treating antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections.</p><p>An emerging class of potent phage defense genes are toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems, which typically comprise a protein toxin that is directly neutralized by its cognate antitoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harms et al., 2018</xref>). For defensive TA systems, phage infection activates or triggers the release of the toxin, which can then block phage development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guegler and Laub, 2021</xref>). Although the initially infected cell typically does not survive, particularly if the toxin also inhibits host cell processes during infection, these defensive TA systems prevent the release of new, mature virions, thereby preventing spread of an infection through a population.</p><p>How can a phage evolve to overcome a defensive TA system? There are three general possibilities: (1) a phage prevents activation of the TA system, (2) a phage becomes resistant to the action of the toxin, or (3) a phage acquires or modifies a factor that can inhibit or degrade the toxin. As TA systems may be activated by and target core phage processes, the latter is a potentially powerful mechanism because it does not require mutations in essential phage genes. Notably, like eukaryotic viruses, phages often harbor many ‘accessory genes’ that are not formally required for phage propagation in a naïve host in permissive conditions. For instance, T4 encodes nearly 300 proteins, only 62 of which are required to produce a new virion in common laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2003</xref>). The remaining genes are mostly of unknown function, but their presence in many related T4-like phages suggests they may play key roles in host specificity by overcoming host defense systems or enabling replication in specific growth conditions.</p><p>There are several examples of phage-encoded anti-TA factors. The T4 gene <italic>dmd</italic> encodes a direct inhibitor of the RnlA toxin from the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 type II TA system RnlAB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Otsuka and Yonesaki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wan et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, RnlAB only protects <italic>E. coli</italic> against T4 phage lacking <italic>dmd</italic> (gene <italic>61.5</italic>). More recently, T-even phages including T4 were shown to encode an inhibitor (AdfA, encoded by gene <italic>61.2</italic> in T4) of DarT toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeRoux et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Pectobacterium atrosepticum</italic>, the type III TA system <italic>toxIN,</italic> involving an endoribonuclease toxin and RNA antitoxin, protects against infection by several phages, including ΦTE and ΦA2. Selection for ΦTE mutants that overcome the <italic>P. atrosepticum toxIN</italic> system identified phages that either expressed additional copies of a locus resembling the <italic>toxI</italic> antitoxin or that had acquired <italic>toxI</italic> from the <italic>toxIN</italic> system directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blower et al., 2012</xref>). This study indicates that phages may be poised to readily evolve mechanisms to overcome defensive TA systems.</p><p>Here, we evolved T4 phage to overcome a <italic>toxIN</italic> homolog from a natural plasmid in an environmental <italic>E. coli</italic> isolate that can provide <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 with potent defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fineran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guegler and Laub, 2021</xref>). Using an experimental evolution approach adapted from that used in early phage therapy initiatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appelmans, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrowes et al., 2019</xref>), we find that T4 can rapidly overcome <italic>toxIN</italic> through the segmental amplification and increased expression of <italic>tifA</italic> (previously <italic>61.4</italic>), which encodes a protein inhibitor of ToxN. Strikingly, these segmental amplifications led to T4 genome instability, likely because an increased genome size is incompatible with the fixed capsid size of T4. The evolved phages subsequently acquired compensatory deletions that restored genome size, with the set of deleted genes varying among replicate evolved populations. These deletions compromise the ability of T4 to infect other strains of <italic>E. coli,</italic> often because the lost genes encode factors that overcome other, strain-specific defense systems. In sum, our work reveals the genome dynamics underlying the emergence of an anti-defense mechanism in T4 and demonstrates an evolutionary trade-off in which selection to infect one host can compromise infection of others.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T4 can evolve to overcome <italic>toxIN-</italic>mediated defense in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>We previously identified and characterized <italic>toxIN<sub>Ec</sub></italic> (hereafter <italic>toxIN</italic> for simplicity), a type III TA system from an environmental isolate of <italic>E. coli</italic> that strongly protects <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 against T4 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guegler and Laub, 2021</xref>). To evolve T4 to overcome <italic>toxIN</italic>, we adapted the Appelmans protocol originally developed in phage therapy to evolve phage to replicate on resistant pathogenic hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appelmans, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrowes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mapes et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, our approach involved replicating T4 on both a sensitive host (-<italic>toxIN</italic>), which maintains the phage population size and generates diversity, and on a resistant host (+<italic>toxIN</italic>) to select for phages that can overcome the defense system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During each round of evolution, serial dilutions of the phage population (six serial tenfold dilutions producing a range of 10<sup>7</sup>–10<sup>1</sup> phage) were each inoculated with 10<sup>5</sup> host cells to produce a range of multiplicities of infection (MOIs, defined as the ratio of phages to bacteria) from 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>–4</sup> in 96-well plates and then grown for 16–20 hr. This protocol allows phage to evolve by a combination of point mutations and recombination events within a phage genome, as well as recombination between co-infecting phage. The clearing of cultures across MOIs provided a visual readout of the phage population evolving to infect the resistant host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Throughout the evolution protocol, the T4 population titer remained at 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>6</sup> pfu/µL, with an estimated 1–3 phage infection generations occurring in wells from high to low MOI within a single round of evolution (see ‘Materials and methods’).

To identify the mutations responsible for overcoming <italic>toxIN</italic>, we fully sequenced the genomes of these four evolved clones. No individual gene was mutated in all of the evolved clones. However, our sequencing revealed increased read coverage of a two-gene locus in the genome of each evolved clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This locus consists of two genes<italic>, dmd (61.5</italic>) and <italic>61.4</italic>, driven by an early T4 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liebig and Rüger, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2003</xref>).

PCR using divergent primers in the middle of the amplified region generated a band for the evolved clones but not the T4 ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

We performed a PCR with divergent primers that would only amplify a product following a segmental amplification to confirm the size of the amplified region in each population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). The different sizes of the band in clones from different populations confirmed that the repeat region was unique in clones of each population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

We confirmed the absence of each deletion by PCR using primers that flank the deleted region inferred by genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These deletions likely enable T4 to maintain a constant genome size by acquiring deletions that compensate for the amplifications selected during evolution.

T-even phages encode a set of proteins – including IPIII – called internal proteins: they contain a sequence motif that drives packaging into mature virions such that the proteins are injected into a host with the phage genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kutter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leiman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullaney and Black, 1996</xref>).

We hypothesized that IPIII may also be an anti-defense protein that targets a host defense system. Indeed, providing <italic>ipIII<sub>T4</sub></italic> on a plasmid in ECOR17 restored the ability of clones from evo 2 and 5 to infect this host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We also found that having the host cells express a variant of IPIII lacking the capsid-targeting sequence (<italic>ipIII<sub>T4</sub>ΔCTS</italic>) restored infectivity of clones from evo 2 and 5, indicating that IPIII functions in the cytoplasm of ECOR17 to enable T4 replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). For the clone from evo 1, <italic>ipIII</italic> on a plasmid did not restore infectivity, suggesting that phages in this population lack an additional gene required to infect ECOR17.</p><p>To identify the relevant host defense systems in ECOR17, we used available annotation pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Payne et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tesson et al., 2022</xref>) to predict phage-defensive operons in the ECOR17 genome, finding six potential systems, which we deleted, individually, from ECOR17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). None of these deletions restored the infectivity of phage that lack IPIII, suggesting that an unknown defense system exists in ECOR17 and that IPIII enables T4 to overcome this system. Though the evo 3 clone also lost the ability to infect ECOR17, its deletions do not include IPIII. For this clone, a disruption of <italic>dsr1</italic> in ECOR17 restored infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Dsr1 contains a Sirtuin domain and likely blocks phage replication by disrupting cytoplasmic NAD+ levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Garb et al., 2021</xref>). Expression of the ECOR17 <italic>dsr1</italic> gene from its native promoter on a medium-copy plasmid conferred protection to MG1655 against the evo 3 clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Thus, a T4 gene deleted in the evo 3 clone must overcome Dsr1 in the context of T4 ancestor infection.

Thus, the T4 genome contains multiple genes (including <italic>ipIII</italic> and <italic>nrdC.5</italic>) that enable the infection of multiple hosts by overcoming the suite of defense systems in these hosts. Our results support the notion that phage genomes are flexible and can rapidly amplify genetic material allowing them to overcome a specific defense system, but at the cost of losing genes that enable infection of other hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>TifA and an anti-TA island in T4-like phage</title><p>Bacteria and phages are locked in an ongoing coevolutionary battle, with extant genomes of each reflecting the outcomes of the underlying molecular arms race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hampton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>). Given the fast generation times of bacteria and phages, experimental evolution offers an opportunity to study this arms race as it unfolds. Here, using an adapted version of Appelmans protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Appelmans, 1921</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrowes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mapes et al., 2016</xref>), we evolved T4 to overcome the type III TA system <italic>toxIN</italic>.

Homologs of TifA are found in many T4-like phage, suggesting that these phages may frequently encounter hosts harboring <italic>toxIN-</italic>like systems. However, these homologs vary in both their sequence and their ability to inhibit ToxN, suggesting that each TifA may be ‘tuned’ to inhibit a particular, cognate ToxN of an ecologically relevant host.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of T4 evolving to overcome <italic>toxIN</italic> by genomic variation affecting host range.</title><p>The genome of T4 contains a number of accessory genes (<italic>tifA</italic>, <italic>nrdC.5</italic>, etc.) that enable infection of hosts by overcoming hosts defenses (<italic>toxIN</italic>, <italic>dsr1</italic>, etc.).

These recombination events may arise during replication of the T4 genome or during the repair of DNA breaks.

Similar recombination events between short (2–10 bp) regions of homology in T4 have been seen previously in studies of the <italic>rII</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumagai et al., 1993</xref>), genes <italic>16–18</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 1991</xref>), and escape from CRISPR-Cas defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our work also indicates that T4 can undergo large genomic changes through recombination between short regions of homology, leading to loss of the intervening region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Genome packaging in T4 proceeds via a headful mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rao and Black, 2005</xref>), so any substantial gain in DNA must be offset by comparably sized losses. Thus, the gains in genetic material resulting from amplification of <italic>dmd-tifA</italic> likely necessitated the loss of other, nonessential DNA to maintain a genome that could be fully packaged into the head. A similar pattern of gene amplification in the <italic>16–18</italic> region of T4 followed by deletion of the gene <italic>alt</italic> was previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wu et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Gene amplification is a major source of evolutionary innovation. For instance, antibiotic resistance in bacteria frequently arises through gene amplification. Seminal studies of <italic>Salmonella</italic> demonstrated that spontaneous tandem duplications arise frequently in bacterial genomes and can be present in as much as 3% of a population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Roth, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Roth, 1977</xref>). Gene duplications can provide intrinsic advantages, as with antibiotic resistance genes or in our case of <italic>tifA</italic>. Additionally, duplications create additional copies of a gene and hence provide a larger target for point mutations; if a beneficial mutation arises in any copy of the gene, it can provide a selective advantage and be maintained while other copies are lost by subsequent recombination. Such a scenario explains the apparently high rates of <italic>lac</italic>- reversions measured by Cairns and Foster when selecting for restoration of LacZ activity in strains harboring a point mutation in <italic>lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cairns and Foster, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendrickson et al., 2002</xref>). Similarly, a selection for poxviruses that can overcome the host restriction factor protein kinase R revealed an initial segmental amplification of the anti-host factor K3L, followed by subsequent acquisition of a beneficial point mutation in one copy K3L and subsequent loss of additional copies of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elde et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In the case of <italic>tifA</italic>, the entire T4 ancestor population likely contains a single copy of the <italic>dmd-tifA</italic> locus, which is insufficient to overcome plasmid-borne <italic>toxIN</italic>. Thus, the segmental amplifications that increase <italic>tifA</italic> copy number could not have been identified through a direct, one-step selection for escape mutants. However, the recombination events leading to these amplifications arose within several rounds in each of our replicate populations, indicating that this is a readily available pathway to overcoming <italic>toxIN</italic>. We did not observe point mutations in <italic>tifA</italic> early on that improve its inhibition of ToxN, likely because segmental amplifications via recombination arise more frequently. We also did not observe beneficial point mutations arising after the segmental amplifications, leading to subsequent collapse of the amplification, as with protein kinase R. We speculate that the fitness gains and number of beneficial point mutations in <italic>tifA</italic> are likely too small to arise and fix.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The evolution of phage host range</title><p>The genes deleted in our evolved T4 phage are all nonessential for infection of <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 grown in laboratory conditions but may be crucial for T4 to infect other hosts.

The loss of <italic>rII</italic> led to an inability to infect λ lysogens, consistent with prior work showing that <italic>rII</italic> is required to neutralize the λ-encoded anti-T4 system RexAB. Similarly, we found that IPIII, which was lost in three populations, is required for T4 to infect <italic>E. coli</italic> strain ECOR17. Internal proteins, including IPIII, are packaged with and then subsequently injected with the T4 genome. These proteins likely act against ‘first-response’ defense systems like RM systems in each host.

The set of anti-defense genes in a phage genome at a given time will reflect, in part, those that have recently been selected for based on the hosts that phage has infected.

Such genome dynamics, which stem from the relentless coevolution of phage with their hosts, may help to explain the staggering diversity of accessory genes within phage genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pope et al., 2015</xref>) and their sometimes narrow host ranges across hosts with varied and dynamic immune profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hussain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kauffman et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Our experimental evolution approach enabled the identification of new anti-phage defense and phage counter-defense mechanisms.

Briefly, sequences for RNA guides to target Cas9-mediated cleavage in the <italic>tifA</italic> open-reading frame (but nowhere else in the T4 genome) were designed using the toolbox in Geneious Prime 2021.2.2. Guides were chosen based on a high activity score that may have a loose correlation with their efficiency of cutting of the T4 genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duong et al., 2020</xref>). The guides were inserted into the pCas9 plasmid (Addgene #42876) and tested for their ability to target the T4 genome by measuring the restriction of T4 spotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Specifically, though wild-type T4 is not strongly restricted by any of the guides, a clone of T4 with a mutation in the β-glucosyltransferase gene, <italic>bgt(II/5-6Δ</italic>), showed strong sensitivity to one of the guides. We expect the deletion to cause a deficiency in β-glucosyltransferase activity, leading to the loss of β-glucose modification of about 30% of the hydroxymethylcytosines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lehman and Pratt, 1960</xref>). pCas9-containing guide <italic>tifA<sub>T4</sub></italic>-cr4 (<named-content content-type="sequence">AATTCCACTCGACCAAATGGAGG</named-content>, constructed with primers SS-47/48) was selected because it had the strongest effect on plaquing efficiency of T4(<italic>bgt(II/5-6Δ</italic>)) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Escape plaques were isolated by plating T4(<italic>bgt(II/5-6Δ</italic>)) at high titer onto a lawn of MG1655 harboring the plasmid pCas9-<italic>tifA<sub>T4</sub></italic>-cr4.

Briefly, phage stocks isolated from single plaques were propagated in <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 at 37°C in LB. To titer phage, stocks were mixed with <italic>E. coli</italic> MG1655 and melted LB + 0.5% agar and spread on LB + 1.2% agar plates at 37°C. For phage spotting assays, the bacterial strain of interest was mixed with LB + 0.5% agar and spread on an LB + 1.2% agar + antibiotic plate. For experiments in which expression of <italic>tifA</italic> was induced with aTc (P<italic><sub>tet</sub>-tifA</italic>), 100 ng/μL aTc was added to LB + 0.5% agar at a final concentration of 100 ng/mL prior to mixing with bacterial cells. For the experiment inducing <italic>rIIA</italic> and <italic>rIIB</italic>, aTc was added to 10 ng/mL to minimize the toxicity of the <italic>rII</italic> system. For experiments in which expression of genes was induced with IPTG (P<italic><sub>lac</sub>-genes</italic>), 100 mM IPTG was added to LB + 0.5% agar to a final concentration of 100 μM prior to mixing with bacterial cells. Phage stocks were then serially diluted in 1× FM buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>), and 2–3 μL of each dilution was spotted on the bacterial lawn. Plates were then grown at room temperature or 37°C overnight and plaques quantified the following day. EOP was calculated by comparing the ability of the phage to form plaques on an experimental strain relative to the control strain.</p><p>Phage experiments in liquid culture were conducted at 37°C. Single colonies were grown overnight in LB. Overnight cultures were back-diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.01 and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3 in fresh LB such that cells re-entered exponential growth. Cultures were then back-diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.01 in fresh LB, and phage was added to each culture. Growth following phage infection was measured in 24-well plates at 15 min intervals with orbital shaking at 37°C on a plate reader (BioTek). Data points reported are the mean of three independent biological replicate growth curve experiments.

This protocol was more recently used to modify the host range of phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burrowes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mapes et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, a population of phage is propagated on a sensitive host to maintain phage population size and generate genetic diversity, and also a resistant host to select for phage that can infect the novel host. In our experiment, the resistant host was MG1655 with a <italic>toxIN</italic>-containing plasmid (ML3328), and the sensitive host was MG1655 with an empty plasmid (ML3330). Thus, T4 needs to overcome the defense conferred by <italic>toxIN</italic> to successfully invade the resistant host. To visually track the progress of evolution, the evolution experiment was setup in 96-well plates with phage populations inoculated with host cells at a range of MOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A phage blank well was also maintained to confirm there is no cross-contamination during the setup of each round of evolution.</p><p>T4 (10<sup>6</sup> pfu/µL) lysate prepared in MG1655 was then serial-diluted tenfold in FM buffer to generate inoculum samples from 10<sup>6</sup> to 1 pfu/µL. 10 µL of each the phage inoculums were added to the corresponding wells in a row. Each well contains 100 µL of supplemented LB (LB + 15 µg/mL <sc>l</sc>-tryptophan + 5 µg/mL thiamine) with 10<sup>5</sup> bacterial cells. Bacterial culture was back-diluted from overnight growth of single colonies in LB (or M9) at 37°C using OD<sub>600</sub> of 1 as an estimated cell density of 7 × 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL. The bacterial cells are ML3328 (<italic>+toxIN</italic>) and ML3330 (<italic>-toxIN</italic>) in two separate rows. The first wells of each row are inoculated with only 10 µL of FM buffer as a no-phage control check against phage cross-contamination during the setup of evolution plate. The second to eighth wells of each row receive inoculum from the phage serial dilutions to setup wells with phage-to-bacteria rations (MOI) of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>–4</sup>. Each pair of rows correspond to an independent evolving population, with the top two rows in the plate being a control evolution with T4 infecting two rows of ML3330 to identify mutations that arise when T4 is passaged on just MG1655 with no <italic>toxIN</italic>. The remaining rows on the plate accommodate five independent evolving populations of T4. For the first round, the same clonal population of T4 is used to start all the evolving populations. After inoculating the cell culture with phage, the evolution plate is sealed with breathable film and incubated at 37°C on a plate shaker at 1000 RPM overnight (16– 20 hr). The plate is harvested by pooling all cleared wells and the first uncleared well (up to a total of five wells per row from the highest MOI) in every pair of rows to generate the population of phage at the end of the round. In a round of evolution, phage in the highest MOI well lyse all cells in a single infection generation, while at the lowest MOI (one phage particle inoculated into 10<sup>5</sup> bacteria) about three rounds of phage infection (with an estimated T4 burst of 100) are needed to lyse all the bacteria. Thus, a phage population after a round of evolution contains particles that have gone through 1–3 infection generations from a phage at the start of the round. The cell debris and unlysed cells in pooled samples were pelleted (4000 RPM at 4°C for 25 min) and the supernatant phage lysate was transferred to 96-deep-well blocks for long-term storage (with 40 µL chloroform to prevent bacterial growth). Pooled samples generated six populations – five replicate populations evolving on ML3328 and ML3330, and one control population evolving on ML3330 alone. Twenty-five rounds of evolution were performed saving a total of 150 populations (six populations at each of 25 rounds of evolution). The evolution was performed in supplemented LB for the first 18 rounds and was then switched to supplemented M9 for 7 rounds to increase the selective pressure of <italic>toxIN</italic> on T4 replication. Evolving populations were stored as lysates at 4°C, and also as glycerol stocks of infected hosts snap-frozen and left at –80°C.</p><p>Evolved clones were isolated by plating to single plaques from the evolved populations on lawns of ML3328 for T4 that can overcome <italic>toxIN</italic>.

host interaction field. Notably, the interplay between bacteria and their viral predators has regained broad interest in recent years given the discovery of numerous innate immunity-like phage defense systems. The identification of phage-mediated counter-defense strategies is therefore not only of prime importance for our basic understanding of predator-prey arms races but also for medical applications such as phage therapy.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79549.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Blokesch</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02s376052</institution-id><institution>Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Blokesch</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02s376052</institution-id><institution>Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne</institution></institution-wrap><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.14.488369">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.14.488369v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Melanie Blokesch as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please note that no additional experiments will be required (the reviewer group agreed that the short reads combined with the distinctive PCR amplification pattern and Sanger sequencing are sufficient to support the claim of this study and that the suggested experiment to further increase ToxN abundance would be a nice add-on but isn't strictly required).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures need revisions for clarity (missing labels, low resolution, etc).</p><p>2) The authors should carefully update their Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) A few points need better discussion.</p><p>4) The accessibility of raw data on github, as stated in the manuscript, should be double-checked.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is well written and the storyline is easy to follow. We also appreciate the schemes to explain more difficult points (e.g. Figure S1D and Figure S4D).</p><p>We find it remarkable that the acquisition of resistance in the toxin-expressing host was acquired in 5 evolved clones through segmental amplification of the dmd-tifA locus (versus mutations in the promoter sequence to increase transcription levels for example). This illustrates the extent of recombination within phage genomes thanks to regions of microhomology, in comparison to the pervasiveness of point mutations in bacterial genomes.</p><p>Interestingly, tifA is surrounded by further genes encoding anti-TA systems suggesting the clustering in anti-TA islands – an observation that could guide further investigations.</p><p>Overall, this is without question an interesting example, but it describes a very specific phenomenon, namely the adaptation of phage T4 to an <italic>E. coli</italic> strain expressing a plasmid-based toxN. Their results also show that native tifA expression is sufficient to overcome ToxN production from the chromosome.</p><p>1. It is puzzling that the control evolved clone (without toxin) showed no resistance clones appearing, even after 25 rounds of infection (figure S4A). Is the emergence of resistance so rare in T4?</p><p>2. It would be maybe advisable to be precise that RnlAB is a type II TA system. This was not clear in the manuscript.</p><p>3.

Upon crafting our reviewer responses, we verified that this document is accessible and that the data are clearly labeled. We apologize if the reviewer was unable to find them.
