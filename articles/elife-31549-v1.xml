require a thorough understanding of parasite transmission from human to mosquito. A clinical model to induce gametocytes to understand their dynamics and evaluate transmission-blocking interventions (TBI) is currently unavailable. Here, we explore the use of the well-established Controlled Human Malaria Infection model (CHMI) to induce gametocyte carriage with different antimalarial drug regimens. <bold>Methods</bold> In a single centre, open-label randomised trial, healthy malaria-naive participants (aged 18–35 years) were infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> by bites of infected <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02836002). Participants were randomly allocated to four different treatment arms (n = 4 per arm) comprising low-dose (LD) piperaquine (PIP) or sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), followed by a curative regimen upon recrudescence. Male and female gametocyte densities were determined by molecular assays. <bold>Findings</bold> Mature gametocytes were observed in all participants (16/16, 100%). Gametocytes appeared 8.5–12 days after the first detection of asexual parasites. Peak gametocyte densities and gametocyte burden was highest in the LD-PIP/SP arm, and associated with the preceding asexual parasite biomass (p=0.026). Male gametocytes had a mean estimated circulation time of 2.7 days (95% CI 1.5–3.9) compared to 5.1 days (95% CI 4.1–6.1) for female gametocytes. Exploratory mosquito feeding assays showed successful sporadic mosquito infections. There were no serious adverse events or significant differences in the occurrence and severity of adverse events between study arms (p=0.49 and p=0.28). <bold>Conclusions</bold> The early appearance of gametocytes indicates gametocyte commitment during the first wave of asexual parasites emerging from the liver. Treatment by LD-PIP followed by a curative SP regimen, results in the highest gametocyte densities and the largest number of gametocyte-positive days. This model can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs and vaccines on gametocyte dynamics, and lays the foundation for fulfilling the critical unmet need to evaluate transmission-blocking interventions against <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria for downstream selection and clinical development. <bold>Funding</bold> PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI)</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31549.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The parasite that causes malaria, named <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, has a life cycle that involves both humans and mosquitoes. Starting in the saliva of female Anopheles mosquitoes, it enters a person’s bloodstream when the insects feed. It then moves to the person’s liver, where it infects liver cells and matures into a stage known as schizonts. The schizonts then divide to form thousands of so-called merozoites, which burst out of the liver cells and into the bloodstream. The merozoites infect red blood cells, producing more schizonts and yet more merozoites, which continue the infection.</p><p>To complete its life cycle, the parasite must return to a mosquito. Some of the parasites in the person’s blood transform into male and female cells called gametocytes that are taken up by a mosquito when it feeds on that person. Inside the mosquito, male and female parasites reproduce to create the next generation of parasites. The new parasites then move to the mosquito’s salivary glands, ready to begin another infection. Stopping the parasite being transmitted from humans to mosquitoes will stop the spread of malaria in the population. Yet it has proven difficult to study this part of the life cycle from natural infections.</p><p>Here, Reuling et al. report a new method for generating gametocytes in human volunteers that will enable closer study of the biology of malaria transmission. The method is developed using the Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) model. Healthy volunteers without a history of malaria are bitten by mosquitoes infected with malaria parasites. Shortly afterwards, the volunteers are given a drug treatment to control and reduce their symptoms. The gametocytes form during this phase of the infection. At the end of the experiment, all the volunteers receive a final treatment that completely cures the infection.</p><p>Reuling et al. recruited 16 volunteers and assigned them to four groups at random. Each group received a different drug regime. Roughly a week after the mosquito bites, all participants showed malaria parasites in their blood, and between 8.5 and 12 days later, mature gametocytes started to appear. This early appearance suggests that the parasites start to transform into gametocytes when they first emerge from the liver. The experiment also revealed that female gametocytes stay in the blood for a longer period than their male counterparts.</p><p>These results are proof of principle for a new way to investigate malaria infection. The new model provides a controlled method for studying <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes in people. In the future, it could help to test the impact of drugs and vaccines on gametocytes. Understanding more about these parasites’ biology could lead to treatments that block malaria transmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Malaria</kwd><kwd>gametocytes</kwd><kwd>Plasmodium falciparum</kwd><kwd>transmission</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>&lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt;</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005624</institution-id><institution>PATH</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Malaria Vaccine Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reuling</surname><given-names>Isaie J</given-names></name><name><surname>van de Schans</surname><given-names>Lisanne A</given-names></name><name><surname>Lanke</surname><given-names>Kjerstin</given-names></name><name><surname>Graumans</surname><given-names>Wouter</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gemert</surname><given-names>Geert-Jan</given-names></name><name><surname>Teelen</surname><given-names>Karina</given-names></name><name><surname>Siebelink-Stoter</surname><given-names>Rianne</given-names></name><name><surname>van de Vegte-Bolmer</surname><given-names>Marga</given-names></name><name><surname>de Mast</surname><given-names>Quirijn</given-names></name><name><surname>van der Ven</surname><given-names>André J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivinson</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name><name><surname>Hermsen</surname><given-names>Cornelus C</given-names></name><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>Katharine A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ockenhouse</surname><given-names>Christian F</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Sauerwein</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2014-StG 639776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bousema</surname><given-names>Teun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder, PATH's Malaria Vaccine Initiative, was involved in the study design, analysis and interpretation of the data, the preparation of the report, but not data collection.

Despite a reduction in the malaria case incidence of ~40%, and mortality by 62% over the last decade, malaria caused ~429,000 deaths in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). Apart from the direct health implications, malaria is a substantial contributor to ongoing poverty in affected countries. Recently, the spread of artemisinin-resistant parasites has emerged as a global health concern. Both the recent gains in malaria control and concerns about artemisinin resistance have stimulated programs to eliminate malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">World Health Organization, 2016</xref>). Novel interventions may support malaria elimination efforts in endemic settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griffin et al., 2010</xref>) that are further dependent on political and financial commitments to maximize coverage with currently available interventions and improve surveillance systems to optimize disease notification and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moonen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge to eliminating malaria is its highly efficient transmission by <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Transmission to mosquitoes starts when a small proportion of asexual parasites commit to form male and female gametocytes. It is currently unclear what stimulates gametocyte commitment and when gametocyte commitment first occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>). Upon commitment, maturation of gametocytes takes place predominantly in the bone marrow, and requires 7 days (range 4–12) of development. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichner et al., 2001</xref>) Subsequently, mature gametocytes (parasites that are not associated with clinical disease) appear in the peripheral blood, where they may circulate for an average of 6 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eichner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bousema et al., 2010</xref>). During this period, blood-feeding <italic>Anophelines</italic> may ingest gametocytes where, after a sporogonic development phase, sporozoites reach the mosquito salivary gland rendering the mosquito infectious to humans upon its next bite. Early work based on the microscopic evaluation of experimental <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection (malariatherapy) studies reported that gametocytes may make their appearance in small numbers around 10 days following the first day of fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shute and Maryon, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciuca et al., 1937</xref>).</p><p>The renewed focus on malaria elimination requires a thorough understanding of malaria transmission dynamics - when mature male and female gametocytes are first produced upon infection and how long they circulate in peripheral blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sinden, 2017</xref>). These parameters are difficult to measure in naturally acquired infections where frequent super-infections, immunity and other factors dictate parasite and gametocyte dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>). Interventions that specifically aim to reduce gametocyte development, circulation time or infectivity are highly desirable in the context of malaria elimination and require effective models for the early clinical evaluation.</p><p>The controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model allows the induction of parasitemia under highly standardized conditions and plays an important role in the assessment of safety and efficacy of novel antimalarial drugs and vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sauerwein et al., 2011</xref>). Preliminary evidence for the induction of female gametocytes in CHMI studies with blood stage inoculum was recently demonstrated using piperaquine monotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pasay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farid et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to develop a CHMI transmission model to induce gametocyte carriage after mosquito bite infection. The primary objective of the current trial was to safely induce gametocytemia in study participants by the use of different (sub)curative drug regimens based on sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butcher, 1997</xref>) and piperaquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adjalley et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From a total of 49 screened candidate participants, 16 volunteers were included in a first cohort and randomly assigned to four study arms prior to challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After observed transient liver enzyme elevations in the first cohort, the study was temporarily put on hold and the already initiated infections in the second cohort of 13 participants were abrogated by curative treatment on day 3 post challenge. The hold was lifted after reviewing safety data. Participants from the first cohort completed all study visits, and form the basis of the current manuscript; their baseline characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. After exposure to bites of a standard protocol of five <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infected mosquitoes, all participants developed parasitemia on days 6.5–12 post-challenge; peak parasite densities ranged from 1050 to 63113 <italic>Pf</italic>/mL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Due to asexual recrudescence in seven of the eight participants after a subcurative treatment (T1) with LD-PIP, a curative treatment (T2) had to be administered before day 21 post challenge. The median period between T1 and T2 was 9.1 (range of 7.7–11.7), 10.0 (range of 9.2–10.2), 4.7 (range of 2–10.7), and 2.5 (range of 1.5–5.0) days for study arms LD-SP/SP, LD-SP/PIP, LD-PIP/PIP, and LD-PIP/SP, respectively. In participants receiving a subcurative LD-SP as T1, no recrudescent infection occurred and T2 was initiated on day 21 per protocol.

The timing of the first appearance of gametocytes suggests that a fraction of the first wave of asexual parasites commit to the production of male and female gametocytes. With the use of antimalarial drugs that attenuates asexual stage infections but leave (developing) gametocytes unaffected, we determined biologically plausible half-lives of male and female gametocytes, and show preliminary evidence of the potential of this model to complete the lifecycle of malaria in mosquito feeding assays.</p><p>Malaria elimination efforts require a thorough understanding of the transmissibility of infections. Gametocyte commitment occurs for a fraction of asexual parasites under regulation of the transcription factor AP2-G with the entire progeny of a sexually committed schizont forming either male or female gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kafsack et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings, based on novel sex-specific gametocyte qRT-PCR, confirm earlier work from malariatherapy studies where gametocytes were first detected by microscopy at 9–11 days after asexual parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciuca et al., 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shute and Maryon, 1951</xref>). These data indicate very early gametocyte commitment and are in line with our earlier observations that Pfs16 mRNA, the earliest gametocyte transcript, is detectable at the moment of peak parasitemia in CHMI models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schneider et al., 2004</xref>). This timing is highly relevant for understanding gametocyte transmission biology. The circulation of mature gametocytes has not been reported in previous CHMI trials using curative regimens of chloroquine, artemether-lumefantrine, or atovaqoune-proguanil, and our data illustrate the differential impact of antimalarial drugs on developing gametocytes. Once treatment is initiated, gametocyte production ceases abruptly (in the case of artemisinins), remains unaffected, or may even be stimulated under drug pressure as suggested for sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and piperaquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butcher, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adjalley et al., 2011</xref>). In our study, we aimed for a protracted low density of asexual parasitemia demonstrating that early abrogation of asexual infections by both sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and piperaquine permits successful mature gametocyte development. SP has long been associated with a rapid appearance of gametocytes that is too early to be explained by de novo gametocyte production upon drug pressure and has thus been hypothesized to reflect an efflux of sequestered gametocytes upon treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butcher, 1997</xref>). Evidence for the permissiveness of piperaquine to (developing) gametocytes is more recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pasay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farid et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adjalley et al., 2011</xref>). In the current study, group sizes are limited and comparisons between treatment arms have to be interpreted with caution. CHMI studies are logistically challenging and the number of volunteers that can be monitored to ensure participant safety is an important consideration when defining the study size. Our sample size calculation was based on the optimistic assumption that the vast majority of volunteers would develop mature gametocytes; an assumption that was supported by the current data. With our limited study size, our findings indicate that none of the study drugs prevented the appearance of gametocytes after treatment, thereby suggesting limited or no effect of PIP and SP on developing or mature gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bolscher et al., 2015</xref>). We hypothesized that slow acting drugs may promote the development of gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Méndez et al., 2002</xref>), potentially via microvesicles that are derived from infected erythrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nilsson et al., 2015</xref>) and differences between drug regimens in the rate at which asexual parasites are cleared upon T1 and T2 would result in different gametocyte dynamics. Although our findings indicate highest gametocyte concentrations in the LD-PIP/SP arm, more observations and thus additional studies are needed to allow the construction of a model that allows a quantification of gametocyte commitment at different time-points during the study (e.g. prior to T1, during the phase of parasite recrudescence and following T2). One hypothesis would be similar gametocyte commitment in all arms after T1 but a more rapid release of gametocytes that accumulated in the bone marrow between T1 and T2.</p><p>We present the novel evidence that both male and female gametocytes appear early, upon infection. Our findings suggest an earlier appearance of female gametocytes (18.8 days (SD 1.8) compared to male gametocytes 20.3 days (SD 1. 2)) and a longer circulation time of female gametocytes that is in line with previous estimates from naturally infected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bousema et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciuca et al., 1937</xref>). Whilst both male and female gametocytes are consistently detected at densities of 0.1 gametocyte/µL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stone et al., 2017</xref>), the highly abundant Pfs25 mRNA makes the female gametocyte qRT-PCR more sensitive than the male PfMGET qRT-PCR. Differences in gametocyte dynamics between male and female gametocytes should therefore be interpreted with caution. Gametocyte densities remained below the threshold of detection by microscopy throughout the study period and were strongly associated with the preceding densities of the asexual progenitors. Participants in the LD-PIP/SP study arm showed the highest gametocytes densities, and a mean female/male sex ratio of 4.1 (SD = 5.1), in line with gametocyte sex-ratios in natural infections (~3 to 5 females to one male) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciuca et al., 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delves et al., 2013</xref>). We confirmed the infectivity of gametocytes in three mosquitoes from three study arms. The very low rate of infected mosquito corroborates observations from naturally acquired infections where mosquito infection becomes highly unlikely below 1000–10,000 gametocytes/mL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gonçalves et al., 2016</xref>). The sporadic mosquito infections thus demonstrate that mature gametocytes in sex-ratios supportive of mosquito infections can be achieved in CHMI transmission models. Studies on the evaluation of TBIs will need a further optimized protocol aimed to achieve higher gametocyte densities by increasing duration and load of the asexual parasite burden. For the evaluation of gametocytocidal interventions in the CHMI transmission model, gametocyte densities should be sufficiently high to quantify an intervention-associated reduction in gametocyte appearance or gametocyte half-life. For the evaluation of interventions that reduce the transmissibility of gametocytes, higher mosquito infections should be achieved at proportions that allow the detection of meaningful reductions in mosquito infection rates in experimental arms. Low infectivity in membrane feeding assays may be overcome by achievement of higher gametocyte densities in the model, and the use of gametocyte concentration methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reuling et al., 2017</xref>), or by direct skin feeding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bousema et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In line with recent findings, we observed recrudescent infections in 7/8 participants treated with LD-PIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pasay et al., 2016</xref>). Recrudescent infections were not observed in arms that first received LD-SP, suggesting that this dose, although 1/3 of the standard curative dose of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, is curative at asexual parasite densities observed in our participants. It has been hypothesized that the prolonged parasitemia under drug pressure increases gametocyte commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">WWARN Gametocyte Study Group, 2016</xref>). The duration of parasite multiplication between T1 and T2 was relatively short in this study (2–5 days) for subjects with recrudescent infections, and the contribution of drug pressure may thus have been limited. The current findings suggest that further lowering the SP dose may be considered to prolong asexual parasite exposure.</p><p>The liver enzyme elevations found in our study led to a structured risk analysis, and review by independent experts. Transient, asymptomatic liver function test (LFT) derangements have been reported in volunteers in previous CHMI studies, and are likely to be related to the asexual stage parasitemia, and subsequent treatment.</p><p>Detailed studies on gametocyte biology and dynamics, and the early development of novel drugs and vaccines that target malaria transmission (TBIs) are currently restricted to in vitro assays, such as drug sensitivity assays, and standard membrane feeding assays (SMFA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bousema and Drakeley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wells et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, a humanized mice model has been developed to investigate <italic>P. falciparum</italic> sexual commitment that could, therefore, bridge in vitro assays to in vivo animal studies that take into account drug metabolism and gametocyte sequestration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffier et al., 2016</xref>). Also, an experimental <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> transmission model in human has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Griffin et al., 2016</xref>). However, mechanisms underlying P. <italic>falciparum</italic> gametocytogenesis and dynamics have never been addressed in a controlled clean system in humans.</p><p>Here, we present a novel CHMI transmission model for <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that can be used to study gametocyte biology and dynamics providing novel insights and tools in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. The dynamics of gametocyte commitment, maturation, sex ratio, and sequestration found in our model reflect parasite dynamics found in naturally acquired infections, although parasite densities are much lower than in many endemic settings. This model can be used to evaluate the effect of drugs and vaccines on gametocyte dynamics and sex ratios. With its current performance, the CHMI transmission model may allow testing of vaccination strategies that reduce the production of gametocytes from their asexual progenitors or accelerate their clearance from the blood stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stone et al., 2016</xref>), and the testing of gametocytocidal drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">White, 2013</xref>). To allow testing of sterilizing effect of drugs on circulating gametocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">White et al., 2014</xref>) or the effect of antibodies that interfere with gametocyte fertilisation inside the mosquito gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stone et al., 2016</xref>), the model needs to be optimized to achieve considerably higher mosquito infection rates. The current work lays the foundation for fulfilling the critical unmet need to evaluate transmission-blocking interventions against <italic>falciparum</italic> malaria for downstream selection and clinical development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This single centre, open-label randomised trial was conducted at the Radboud university medical center (Radboudumc), Nijmegen, the Netherlands.

To examine molecular markers of drug resistance, we used available Illumina whole genome sequencing data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB12838">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB12838</ext-link>); aligning reads to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reference genome v3 (plasmoDB) with bowtie2 (sourceforge) and obtaining consensus sequences for dhps and dhfr genes with samtools. No mutations were identified in the dhfr gene; the only detected mutation was dhps A437G which, by itself, is not associated with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Staedke et al., 2004</xref>). Plasmepsin II/III duplication events are associated with piperaquine resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Witkowski et al., 2017</xref>) but were not observed although the sequence similarities with neighboring genes Plasmepsin I and IV suggest that unambiguous quantification may require more specific gene targeting. Importantly, piperaquine sensitivity of our 3D7 lineage was previously confirmed by in vivo experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pasay et al., 2016</xref>). We conclude that the lineage used was sensitive to both sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and piperaquine.</p><p>Participants were monitored twice daily on an outpatient basis from day 6 after exposure to infected mosquitoes until malaria parasites were detected at a density of ≥5000 parasites per milliliter (<italic>Pf</italic>/mL) by qPCR or a positive thick blood smear, upon which they were treated with a subcurative dose of 500 mg/25 mg sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (Roche, Boulogne-billancourt, FR) or 480 mg of piperaquine phosphate (PCI Pharma Services, Tredegar, UK). After the first treatment (T1), participants continued to visit the study center twice daily for another 4 days to monitor the initial clearance of parasitemia by qPCR, after which they were monitored once a day for recrudescence. On day 21 or upon parasite density reaching ≥1500 <italic>Pf</italic>/mL, participants received a second treatment (T2), consisting of 1000 mg/50 mg sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine or 960 mg of piperaquine phosphate. After the second treatment, participants were monitored daily for 3 days, then three times a week until final treatment with atovaquone/proguanil (Malarone) on day 42. Adverse events were recorded, and blood sampling was performed to monitor parasitemia and blood safety parameters. Symptoms of malaria were treated with acetaminophen up to 4000 mg daily, and nausea with metoclopramide up to 30 mg daily, if necessary.</p><p>Parasite density was determined by quantitative PCR (qPCR) targeting the multicopy 18S rRNA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermsen et al., 2001</xref>); samples collected in the morning were processed immediately, evening samples 12 hr later. Thick blood smears were taken during evening visits, double-read and considered positive if two or more parasites were detected in 0.5<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>µ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> µL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laurens et al., 2012</xref>). The presence of gametocytes was monitored in samples from day 7.5 after challenge until end of study by quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) targeting female-specific Pfs25 mRNA and male specific PfMGET (Pf3D7_1469900) and using sex-specific trendlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pett et al., 2016</xref>). All samples with an estimated gametocyte density ≥5 gametocytes per mL (gametocytes/mL) were considered gametocyte positive. The duration of gametocyte carriage as an indicator of stable gametocyemia was defined as the maximum number of consecutive days with detectable gametocytemia above the threshold for detection. Direct Membrane Feedings Assays (DMFA) were performed as exploratory measures on days 21, 25 and 31 post-infection with ~300 mosquitoes per feed per participant (total of ~14,400 mosquitoes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bousema et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lensen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ouédraogo AL et al., 2013</xref>). Mosquito infection status was determined on day 12 by circumsporozoite (CSP) ELISA(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stone et al., 2015</xref>) followed by qPCR confirmation of mosquitoes where the OD exceeded the mean +3 standard deviations of control mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Graumans et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Adverse events were recorded and graded by the research physician as mild (easily tolerated, grade 1), moderate (interfering with daily activity, grade 2) or severe (preventing daily activity, grade 3), and in the case of fever as mild (38.0–38.4°C), moderate (38.5–38.9,°C) or severe (≥39°C). Safety blood tests were performed daily, including full blood counts, LDH and highly sensitive troponin-T. Biochemistry tests including liver function test were assessed at screening, inclusion, 2 days after every treatment and at the end of study, and on additional days if considered relevant for clinical decision-making.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Pfs25 and PfMGET RNA quantification</title><p>For the quantification of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> Pfs25 transcript levels total NA was RQ1 DNaseI treated according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 2 µL of DNaseI-treated material was run in a total volume of 25 µL of TaqMan RNA-to-Ct qRT-PCR reaction mixture (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). For the quantification of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> male gametocyte enriched transcript (PfMGET), cDNA was synthesized from Total NA with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Samples were added in a 1: one ratio to the mastermix. 2 µL of cDNA was run in a total volume of 20 µL making use of the GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin). Male <italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes were quantified using a standard curve of serially diluted StageV male gametocytes from the transgenic PfDynGFP/P47mCherry line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lasonder et al., 2016</xref>).

The prevalence of gametocytes is the presence of female gametocytes as measured by qRT-PCR targeting female-specific Pfs25 mRNA at any of the twice daily measurements from day 6. Secondary outcomes were the peak density and time-point of peak density of male and female gametocytes, the AUC of gametocyte density, and assessment of the dynamics of gametocyte commitment, maturation and sex-ratio. The AUC of gametocyte density represents the total gametocyte exposure over time (gametocyte load). Assessment of gametocyte infectivity to <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes by DMFA was an exploratory study endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The sample size was calculated based on preliminary data that &gt; 95% of the participants would develop gametocytemia. Conservatively, we considered the approach unsuitable for gametocyte induction if &lt;50% of individuals developed mature gametocytes. We, therefore, powered the trial to estimate a 90% confidence interval around the proportion of gametocytaemic individuals that excludes 50%. If eight individuals (allowing for one dropout per arm), and 6/7 or 7/7 of these individuals become gametocytaemic, we would be able to estimate this proportion with a lower limit of the 90% Wilson confidence interval ≥54.8% (the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval being 48.7%). Differences between study arms were assessed by comparing mean values using a one-way ANOVA or non-parametric equivalents.</p><p>To further identify which study arm(s) potentially deviated from others, we jointly estimated the differences between all four arms in a Bayesian framework (standard linear regression model, no mixed effects), using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as implemented in the R package <italic>rstanarm</italic>, and using an uninformative (uniform) prior for the explained variation (R^2) (see R codes used in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Team SD, 2016</xref>). For discrete variables (e.g. the number of positive assays), the chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test was used (two-tailed). The total number of adverse events and total number of grade three adverse events were calculated per individual and compared by non-parametric Kruskal Wallis test.</p><p>A previously developed model was used to estimate gametocyte half-life for female and male gametocytes separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bousema et al., 2010</xref>). For this analysis, gametocyte observations were included from 12 days after the last detection of asexual parasites until the end of study. This was based on the gametocyte sequestration time of 10–12 days in this study, and the assumption that the number of newly released gametocytes would thus be minimal in this observation period. All model fittings were carried out using the PROC NLMIXED procedure in SAS (Version 9, SAS Institute Inc) and included no covariates other than time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref> for SAS code). The AUC was computed by GraphPad Prism 5 (USA) with the (X2-X1)*(Y1 +Y2)/2 formula (X = days post challenge; Y = gametocytes per mL (≥5 gametocytes/mL)) as used repeatedly for each adjacent pair of points defining the curve; the total AUC was used.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the staff from the Clinical Research Centre Nijmegen.

Estimated mean gametocyte circulation times were about 3 and 5 days for male and female gametocytes respectively and the timing of gametocyte appearance indicated probable commitment to gametocyte production in the first wave of asexual parasites.

In general this is a very good piece of work but more details on the validation of qPCR gametocyte quantitation are essential if it is to be published. If there is one disappointment it is the complete absence of reference to the early observations of gametocytaemia in human challenge studies – notably the work of Shute and Cuica whose conclusions were in broad agreement with the current paper. The earliest reference is from 1986.</p><p>A list of questions or comments in the order they appear in the manuscript:</p><p>1) &quot;It is widely accepted that malaria elimination is unlikely to be attainable in the majority of endemic settings with currently available resources and tools&quot;. Perhaps this could be attenuated? Many think the obstacles are primarily political, organisational and financial.</p><p>2) &quot;maturation of gametocytes takes place predominantly in the bone marrow&quot;.</p><p>3) The 3D7 &quot;lineage&quot; is well known, but it is also well known to be different in different laboratories! Perhaps a few additional sentences on this particular lineage would be valuable. In particular whether there is any evidence that serial passage through volunteers and these laboratory reared mosquitoes has altered its biological properties – notably infectivity over the years? Please also confirm wild type PfDHFR and DHPS and single copy plasmepsin 2/3.</p><p>4) &quot;until malaria parasites were detected at a density of {greater than or equal to}5000 parasites per milliliter (Pf/mL) by qPCR or a positive thick blood smear&quot; – – were any volunteers symptomatic at this density?</p><p>5) Piperaquine base or piperaquine phosphate?</p><p>6) Safety seems rightly to have been a major concern. Did anyone look at the ECG if metoclopramide was given to piperaquine recipients? Was there any additional QTc prolongation?</p><p>7) The section on parasite DNA and RNA quantitation needs considerable strengthening as it is the central component of the paper. This is important.a) The performance characteristics of the 18S DNA and mRNA assays needs presenting in detail or references provided to detailed validation – accuracy at different densities, reproducibility, linearity, criteria for limits of detection etc.</p><p>b) The volume of blood taken and assayed needs stating.</p><p>c) Validation of gametocyte quantitation needs support – particularly with reference to stability of transcript numbers per cell and any assumptions made in the derivation of a gametocyte density.</p><p>8) Bousema et al., 2010 is referred to – which if I understand correctly assumes a single first order decline in gametocyte densities. Is this justified? It would be valuable to describe, if possible, the residuals around the model fits and comment on any heteroscedasticity. This is particularly important considering that a major finding of this report is that male gametocytes appear to be cleared more rapidly than female gametocytes. If in fact the gametocyte clearance profile is more complex (e.g. multiexponential) then the lower density male gametocytes may appear to be more rapidly eliminated whereas, in fact, the slower terminal phase of elimination is below the limit of accurate detection. A similar problem has bedevilled assessment of the pharmacokinetic properties of slowly eliminated antimalarials.</p><p>9) It is not very clear what modelling approach was used to fit the model – was this a mixed effect model? Were any covariates incorporated – if so which? What programme was used?</p><p>10) Is there any explanation for the liver function test abnormalities?</p><p>11) &quot;SP has long been associated with a rapid appearance of gametocytes that is too early to be explained by de novo gametocyte production upon drug pressure and has thus been hypothesized to reflect an efflux of sequestered gametocytes upon treatment&quot;. True – but it is not very clear from the text whether this study's results supports this hypothesis. Could the authors be explicit here? The implication is that such early released gametocytes should be more immature- and thus the period during which <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> gametocytes are not infectious (after release into the circulation) should be longer in these circumstances. Is there any evidence for this?</p><p>12) &quot;The highly abundant Pfs25 mRNA makes the female gametocyte qRT-PCR more sensitive than the male PfMGET qRT-PCR.&quot; Could this be elaborated upon- or at least referenced?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper describes a novel controlled human malaria infection model that consistently achieves gametocyte carriage. This work is important with implications for understanding of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission dynamics and broad significance for the future study of transmission blocking interventions.</p><p>The paper is, in most respects, clearly written. There are, however, some aspects of reporting where it is not entirely clear exactly what was done and why (particularly in relation to statistical methods).</p><p>Results, fifth paragraph. Details of these membrane feeding experiments are lacking from the Materials and methods. In particular, how many mosquitos on each feeding day? Even if full details are presented in the references describing the protocols for these experiments, it would be useful to summarise some of the key numbers in the manuscript to give the reader an idea of what these numbers mean. See also Discussion, third paragraph – &quot;the very low rate&quot;. Since only the numerators are reported, there is no information on what this rate actually is.</p><p>Subsection “Statistical analysis”, second paragraph. More details need to be given here. What non-parametric tests were used and what exactly was the statistical model implemented in the Bayesian framework (code for this does not appear to have been provided). Also, the R package <italic>rstanarm</italic> is mentioned, but appears not to be acknowledged in the references. It probably should be along with the appropriate references for Stan and R.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> is confusing.

Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) studies are logistically challenging and this CHMI study was particularly challenging in terms of the number of study participants that were examined in exploratory mosquito feeding assays. As a consequence, the number of volunteers was informed by both feasibility and study power and a 90% confidence interval was chosen to find a balance between feasibility and the precision in study endpoints.</p><p>We used a Wilson confidence interval in the planning phase of this study. The Wilson confidence interval is particularly informative in case of a small number of observations. The Wilson confidence interval is considered an improvement over the normal approximation interval in that the actual coverage probability is closer to the nominal value. We used the command ‘cii 7 6, wilson level(90)’ in STATA, giving the confidence limit of 54.8 if we assumed 6/7 volunteers per arm would develop gametocytes.

There was no statistically significant difference in time to appearance of gametocytes between the study arms. (p = 0.26). A simple ANOVA for gametocyte density (AUC) did however suggest a statistical significant difference between arms (p = 0.04). Following this conventional frequentist analysis, we used a Bayesian model to determine whether there was evidence for a difference between study arms. With this Bayesian model, this difference was identified as being caused by the LD-PIP/SP arm, which had significantly higher mean gametocyte density (in terms of AUC) than the other three arms. Because the model is Bayesian, we are actually able to calculate the probability that this conclusion is true (i.e. the posterior probability) given the model, which we calculated to be 94.4% (94.0% after correction for asexual density AUC). Regarding the “unintuitive” prior for R^2, we did not add any prior information to the Bayesian model, which in the case of standard linear regression in the package <italic>rstanarm</italic> takes its prior information in the form of a prior for R^2. Essentially, this means that we allowed model parameters to take on any value and that these values were solely informed by the data.</p><p>We now also provide further details in the Results section.</p><p>“The LD-PIP/SP arm had significantly higher gametocyte concentrations (area under the curve, AUC) than each of the other three arms with a posterior probability of 99.1% (compared to the LD-SP/SP arm), 98.9% (LD-SP/PIP), and 95.4% (LD-PIP/PIP), respectively. […] After correction for the asexual AUC, the probabilities of the gametocyte AUC in the LD-PIP/SP arm being higher than the other three decreased to 97.2%, 96.3%, and 96.2%, and the probability of LD-PIP/SP being higher than all other groups decreased to 94.0%.”</p><p>In addition, we expanded our Bayesian analysis to also look at the number of gametocyte positive days per individual by means of a multi-level logistic regression model (including a random effect for individual deviations from the four group means). The model was fitted to data on the number of days that each individual was tested using for Pfs25mRNA (denominator) and the number of days that individuals tested positive for gametocytes by Pfs25 qRT-PCR (≥ 5 gametocytes/mL) at least once (numerator). Consistent with the results from the AUC analysis, the average proportion of days that individuals in each group tested positive for Pfs25 mRNA was estimated at 27.4% (LD-SP/SP), 35.9% (LD-SP/PIP), 51.4% (LD-PIP/PIP), and 48.3% (LD-PIP/SP). The LD-PIP/PIP and LD-PIP/SP arms (i.e. those receiving “low dose PIP”) each had significantly higher average proportions of gametocyte-positive days than both arms LD-SP/SP and LD-SP/PIP (posterior probability 90.8% and 86.1%, respectively; 81.1% joint probability of arms LD-PIP/PIP and LD-PIP/SP both being higher than both LD-SP/SP and LD-SP/PIP). This information has been added to the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to briefly state the assumptions in the previously developed model to estimate the gametocyte half-life.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided the requested details in the revised supplemental information and expanded the Materials and methods section.

The annotated model code, including all assumptions are now provided in detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not obvious that the AUC is the most useful measure – a short spike in gametocytes could be equal to longer low-level gametocytaemia. Clarification of what the optimal characteristics for drug development are would help. The AUC as a measure may also suffer from the non-independence of each time-point from the previous time-points – from a high peak (which may have occurred by chance or not due to the drugs), then further high values might tend to follow. A suggestion only: it might be possible to take into account the non-independence between time-points and use all the data, by using a statistical time-series model with a lag from the asexual densities or a simple mechanistic model fitted to the data. You might need more than four participants per arm for that but you might also be able to borrow strength for some parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments that make a case for a more comprehensive model of gametocyte commitment, maturation and longevity as a function of asexual parasitaemia. This is a longer term objective of our group once we have optimized our model that will require a larger number of participants to accurately parameterize gametocyte commitment and release rates. For the current purposes (i.e. to establish the CHMI transmission model, to select an optimal treatment regimen and to determine the time of first appearance of gametocytes), we consider the presented analyses appropriate.</p><p>For the comparison of drug regimens, we consider the AUC a useful summary measure as gametocyte density patterns looked very similar between individuals (i.e. similar levels of variation over time and not different types of patterns of variation, e.g. “short spikes” vs. “continuous stable levels”).We have, however, also incorporated analyses on the number of gametocyte positive days (showing the same patterns between groups as the AUC) and provide a more detailed presentation of individual parasite and gametocyte curves.</p><p>Importantly, and this was not clearly described in the original submission, a future study will examine infectivity to mosquitoes in more detail. For that, the current data are crucial since they inform us on the time till gametocyte appearance and the plateau phase in gametocyte density. A short spike in gametocytes (without a plateau phase of gametocyte densities that are sufficiently high to measure gametocyte clearance or infectivity) would be operationally very challenging since it would be nearly impossible to define the optimal moment for mosquito feeding assays and/or initiation of gametocytocidal drugs. This is clarified in the revised Discussion section.</p><p>The reviewer’s concern of correlation over time within individuals would indeed be an issue when one would consider the observed densities at individual time points as independent identically distributed variables. For this specific reason, we reduced the time series data to one data point per individual (i.e. the AUC), which essentially relaxes the assumption of inter individual differences observations. So in our analysis, despite the fact that the AUC may be higher in some individuals by shear chance (which the model captures in the error term of the linear predictor), the posterior probability that the AUC is highest in the LD-PIP/SP arm on average is still a very convincing 94.4% (if groups where identical, one would expect a posterior probability of about 1 / 4 = 25%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Results section focuses on differences between the arms but it is unfortunate that the AUC is the only reported measure of gametocytaemia which is (borderline) significant between the arms for gametocytaemia (or the other p-values are just not mentioned). Looking at the graphs, I think the effect is plausible, but there is very limited evidence due to the small sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated above, we have clarified the limitations of our study size in the Discussion section. We have further extended our analysis to the proportion of days that individuals test positive for gametocytes, showing that individuals in study arms LD-PIP/PIP and LD-PIP/SP on average experience more gametocyte-positive days, with little difference between LD-PIP/PIP and LD-PIP/SP. The previous AUC analysis then further shows that individuals in LD-PIP/SP have higher gametocyte concentrations than in all other groups.</p><p>We would also like to clarify that the finding of 94.4%% probability is not borderline as it represents a posterior probability, i.e. the probability that there really is a difference between groups. In a Bayesian context, if in reality there is no real difference between four groups (and this is reflected by the data), the posterior probability of one group being the highest would be estimated around 25%. Therefore, our estimate of 94.4% probability of group 4 being the highest is very convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That three mosquitoes were infected cannot be interpreted without the numbers of mosquitoes fed (Results, fifth paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided full details of this exploratory endpoint.

In general this is a very good piece of work but more details on the validation of qPCR gametocyte quantitation are essential if it is to be published. If there is one disappointment it is the complete absence of reference to the early observations of gametocytaemia in human challenge studies – notably the work of Shute and Cuica whose conclusions were in broad agreement with the current paper. The earliest reference is from 1986.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment.

Perhaps a few additional sentences on this particular lineage would be valuable.

Please also confirm wild type PfDHFR and DHPS and single copy plasmepsin 2/3.</p></disp-quote><p>The 3D7 lineage that was used in the current study is based on a 3D7 bank described in detail in Cheng et al., AJTMH 1997. The material has thus not been in constant passage. Whilst differences in infectivity exist between parasite lines (McCall, Sci Transl Med 2017 as recent example), the material we used was generating gametocyte densities not dissimilar from our routine NF54 line and we achieved high mosquito infection rates and oocyst and sporozoite densities for inoculation in the current study.</p><p>We have clarified the origin of the 3D7 material, including the original reference, in the revised manuscript. In addition, we used available Illumina Whole genome sequencing data for this lineage (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB12838). Reads were aligned to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> reference genome v3 (plasmoDB) with bowtie2 (sourceforge) and consensus sequences for dhps and dhfr genes were obtained with samtools. Read depth (coverage) was assessed using bedtools. With this approach, we determined dhfr/dhps mutations in our 3D7 parasites; only one mutated locus in the dhps gene was found (PfDHPS A437G), which is not associated with treatment failure as single mutation (Staedke et al. 2004). WGS analysis thus rules out sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine drug resistance of the 3D7 lineage we used. Plasmepsin II/III duplication events are associated with piperaquine resistance (Witkowski et al., 2017) but were not found in the 3D7 WGS data. However, as the neighboring genes Plasmepsin I and IV have sequence similarities, unambiguous quantification is challenging and a final assessment would involve more specific targeting, e.g. by qPCR.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><bold>gene</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>locus</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>3D7 codon</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>amino acid</bold></td><td valign="top"><bold>mutated</bold></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DHPS</bold></td><td valign="top">A437G</td><td valign="top">GGT</td><td valign="top">G</td><td valign="top">yes</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DHPS</bold></td><td valign="top">K540E</td><td valign="top">AAA</td><td valign="top">K</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DHFR</bold></td><td valign="top">N51I</td><td valign="top">AAT</td><td valign="top">N</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DHFR</bold></td><td valign="top">C59R</td><td valign="top">TGT</td><td valign="top">C</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><bold>DHFR</bold></td><td valign="top">S108N</td><td valign="top">AGC</td><td valign="top">S</td><td valign="top">no</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Importantly, piperaquine sensitivity of the 3D7 lineage was previously confirmed by in vivo experiments (Pasay et al., 2016).</p><p>We included the following information in the revised manuscript in the section describing the parasite lineage:</p><p>“The 3D7 lineage that was used in the current study is based on a 3D7 bank described in detail in Cheng et al., (Cheng et al., 1997).

The maximum dose of piperaquine used in our study is approximately only 1/3 of the curative dose used in the dihydroartemisinin piperaquine combination therapy (label use), therefore, the risk of QT-prolongations in this study, next to administration on an empty stomach (to reduce the peak concentrations) is assessed to be very low. The combination of the very rarely described QT-prolongations with metoclopramide and the sporadic, and mostly single-dose (10mg) metoclopramide use in our study participants made an additional risk of QT-prolongations highly unlikely. Therefore, additional ECG assessments after metoclopramide were not deemed necessary at discretion of the investigators. No QT-prolongations were found after or between piperaquine treatments in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The section on parasite DNA and RNA quantitation needs considerable strengthening as it is the central component of the paper.

Is this justified? It would be valuable to describe, if possible, the residuals around the model fits and comment on any heteroscedasticity. This is particularly important considering that a major finding of this report is that male gametocytes appear to be cleared more rapidly than female gametocytes. If in fact the gametocyte clearance profile is more complex (e.g. multiexponential) then the lower density male gametocytes may appear to be more rapidly eliminated whereas, in fact, the slower terminal phase of elimination is below the limit of accurate detection. A similar problem has bedevilled assessment of the pharmacokinetic properties of slowly eliminated antimalarials.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the model assumes a single first order decline in male gametocyte densities. The decline is on the linear scale; but the error structure is a Tobit distribution on the log scale (the SAS code is now provided in the supplemental information).

There is no clear relationship between parasitemia densities and liver abnormalities, and it also seems unlikely to be directly related to anti-malarials due to variety of drugs used in CHMI. Similarly, the use of paracetamol does not support a clear relationship. Rather a combination of the above mentioned factors, and individual susceptibility may have triggered the observed abnormalities. The transient asymptomatic liver function test abnormalities are most likely directly related to the asexual parasitemia, and subsequent treatment. The exact mechanism of the transient organ injury during the malaria and its treatment is yet to be understood and ongoing work. We are currently reviewing all our CHMI data, including the many trials where treatment was initiated at lower parasite densities, and intend to write this up as a separate manuscript to describe the prevalence, severity and transient nature of liver function abnormalities upon controlled malaria infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) &quot;SP has long been associated with a rapid appearance of gametocytes that is too early to be explained by de novo gametocyte production upon drug pressure and has thus been hypothesized to reflect an efflux of sequestered gametocytes upon treatment&quot;. True – but it is not very clear from the text whether this study's results supports this hypothesis. Could the authors be explicit here?
