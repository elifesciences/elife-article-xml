single positive (SP4) and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (SP8) thymocyte populations from the foetus and young adult mouse. We found that life-stage had a greater impact on TCRβ and TCRα gene segment usage than cell-type. Foetal repertoires showed bias towards 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ rearrangements in all populations, whereas adult repertoires used more 5’TRAV gene segments, suggesting that progressive TCRα rearrangements occur less frequently in foetal DP cells. When we synchronised young adult DP thymocyte differentiation by hydrocortisone treatment the new recovering DP thymocyte population showed more foetal-like 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ gene segment usage. In foetus we identified less influence of MHC-restriction on α-chain and β-chain combinatorial VxJ usage and CDR1xCDR2 (V region) usage in SP compared to adult, indicating weaker impact of MHC-restriction on the foetal TCR repertoire. The foetal TCRβ repertoire was less diverse, less evenly distributed, with fewer non-template insertions, and all foetal populations contained more clonotypic expansions than adult. The differences between the foetal and adult thymus TCR repertoires are consistent with the foetal thymus producing αβT-cells with properties and functions that are distinct from adult T-cells: their repertoire is less governed by MHC-restriction, with preference for particular gene segment usage, less diverse with more clonotypic expansions, and more closely encoded by genomic sequence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>thymus</kwd><kwd>TCR sequencing</kwd><kwd>TCR repertoire</kwd><kwd>repertoire selection</kwd><kwd>MHC-restriction</kwd><kwd>T-cell development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P000843/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>Tessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S037764/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>Tessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/T020970/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crompton</surname><given-names>Tessa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1903458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowell</surname><given-names>Jasmine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The foetal thymic T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire is distinct from adult, and it is less governed by MHC-restriction, more closely encoded by genomic sequence with distinct gene-segment usage including 3’TRAV to 5’TRAJ.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>T-cells are essential for adaptive immunity to mount an immune response against a wide and unpredictable array of foreign pathogens. T-cells recognise pathogens through their T-cell receptor, and adaptive immunity relies upon a broad repertoire of T-cells with TCRs with different specificities to potentially unknown pathogens, so that should a new threat arise, the immune system can respond. The diverse repertoire of possible TCRs is generated from gene rearrangement of two independently generated chains, the β chain and α chain, which come together to form the TCR. This diverse pool of αβTCR is generated during T-cell development in the thymus by the RAG-dependent joining of variable (V), joining (J), and diversity (D) gene segments at the β locus, and V and J gene segments at the α locus, with additional diversity coming from non-template nucleotides (junctional diversity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schatz and Swanson, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The thymus is essential for both T-cell development and TCR repertoire selection, but undergoes changes in output and function across the life of a mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kondo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montecino-Rodriguez and Dorshkind, 2023</xref>). In this study, we compared the αβTCR repertoire generated in the foetal thymus to that of the young adult, to investigate how these life-stages influence V(D)J gene usage and TCR repertoire diversity and distribution.</p><p>The thymus and the parathyroid organs, emerge from the third pharyngeal pouch and cleft during mid gestation of the foetal mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon and Manley, 2011</xref>). Haematopoietic progenitors migrate from the foetal liver through the blood stream to colonise the thymus from embryonic day (E) 10–12. The first CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double negative (DN) thymocytes are already present at E11 and proliferate over the following days, producing a larger population by E14. CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>double positive (DP) and CD8+ immature single positive (ISP) thymocytes are first detectable at ~E16, while mature CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> single positive (SP4) and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> single positive (SP8) thymocytes can be detected at day E18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Solanki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Solanki et al., 2020</xref>). After birth, the thymus continues to grow rapidly and reaches its peak size at 4–6 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>During this developmental progression, the <italic>Tcrb</italic> and <italic>Tcra</italic> loci are sequentially rearranged to produce T-cells with a diverse TCR repertoire. Successful rearrangement of <italic>Tcrb</italic> and pre-TCR expression are required for commitment to the αβT-cell lineage and differentiation from the CD25<sup>+</sup>DN (DN3) stage to DP cell, whereas cells that successfully rearrange the γδTCR commit to the γδT-cell lineage at the CD25<sup>+</sup> DN stage. <italic>Tcra</italic> rearrangement and signalling through the αβTCR are essential for MHC-restriction and differentiation from DP to SP cell (positive selection) and then also for deletion of T-cells bearing self-reactive TCR (negative selection). Pre-TCR signalling is required for survival, expansion, and differentiation of cells that have completed TCRβ rearrangement, to produce a pool of cells which express a single functional TCR β-chain, in which <italic>Tcra</italic> rearrangement and αβTCR repertoire selection will occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dutta et al., 2021</xref>) and β-selection is believed to involve immune synapse formation and MHC-interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allam et al., 2021</xref>). In general, allelic exclusion of the TCR β-chain locus is believed to prevent developing thymocytes from simultaneously rearranging and expressing two TCR β-chains, whereas in DP cells the TCR α-chain locus undergoes biallelic Vα-Jα rearrangement, with many possible rounds of rearrangement on each allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carico and Krangel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carico et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genolet et al., 2012</xref>). Although the sequence of this developmental programme is the same between foetal and adult αβT-cell development, progression beyond the DN3 stage is less tightly linked to TCRβ expression and β-selection in the foetal thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hager-Theodorides et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>There are several other fundamental differences between adult and foetal thymus that may affect the generation and selection of the TCR repertoire. In contrast to adult αβT-cells which are produced in a thymus structure that is mature, during foetal T-cell development, the thymus is still forming: the structure of the medulla and differentiation of the medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC) population, which express tissue restricted antigens for tolerance induction, are dependent on the haematopoietic compartment, with different requirements in foetal and adult thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desanti et al., 2012</xref>). There are also differences in the progenitor cells that seed the thymus at different life-stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ramond et al., 2014</xref>), which arise from either the foetal liver or postnatal bone-marrow, and enter the thymus through different locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montecino-Rodriguez and Dorshkind, 2023</xref>). Some foetal haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) have been shown to have increased capacity to proliferate and to differentiate preferentially into innate-like lymphocytes compared with adult cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaudin et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, CD8 T-cells derived from HSCs from the foetal liver are functionally distinct from adult CD8 T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The foetal TCR repertoire is known to be less diverse than the adult repertoire. TdT is absent from the foetal thymus and is first expressed a few days after birth, so foetal repertoires contain less non-template nucleotide additions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogue et al., 1992</xref>). This has been confirmed by next generation TCR sequencing from mouse and human foetal and adult repertoires, which showed increased diversity after birth that was attributed to the postnatal increase in non-template nucleotide additions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sethna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Britanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pogorelyy et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, a PCR approach has indicated that the foetal TCRα repertoire uses a limited range of VJ rearrangements with enrichment of proximal VJ rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pasqual et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we compared the TCR repertoire that is generated and selected in the foetal thymus with that from the young adult thymus. In addition to the reduction in non-template nucleotide additions seen in the embryonic repertoire, we identified biases in VJ usage and VxJ pairing of both TCRβ and TCRα repertoires. The foetal TCRβ repertoires were less diverse and less equally distributed with more clonal expansions than the young adult repertoires.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Foetal thymocyte populations show clonotypic TCRβ expansion with a less diverse TCRβ repertoire than adult</title><p>To compare the TCRβ chain repertoire generated in the embryonic and young adult thymus, we FACS-sorted DP (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>), SP4 (CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>), and SP8 (CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup>) populations from E18.5 (foetal) and 4-week-old (young adult) thymus and sequenced their rearranged TCR transcripts. After RNA extraction from purified populations, we used a TCR sequencing protocol and analysis pipeline which includes single-strand DNA ligation that tags each molecule of <italic>Tcra</italic> and <italic>Tcrb</italic> mRNA with a unique molecular identifier (UMI), allowing PCR bias to be corrected for in later analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Oakes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uddin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thomas et al., 2013</xref>). Firstly, to visualise the frequency distribution of the TCRβ repertoire in each population, we plotted the TCRβ abundance (number of copies of each sequence) against their proportion of the repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). For each of the developmentally defined thymocyte populations, the foetal thymus showed an increase in the proportion of abundant clones compared to adult mice in DP, SP4, and SP8 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The frequency distributions of TCRβ abundances were fitted to a discrete power law, where the power law exponent corresponds to the gradient on the log-log plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The power law exponent was significantly lower in each foetal population compared to its adult counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating a difference in distribution of abundance of TCRβ clones between foetal and adult, consistent with an increase in clonotypic expansion of abundant clones in the foetal TCRβ repertoire. To confirm this, we calculated the proportion of the TCRβ repertoire represented by the top 1% most abundant TCRβ clones in each population. In foetal DP and SP4 and SP8 populations, the proportion of the TCRβ repertoire represented by the top 1% most abundant TCRβ clones was more than twice that of the adult populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and the mean abundance of TCRβ sequences detected in the top 1% most abundant (expanded) clones was also significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in the foetal SP4 population only, suggesting a difference in equality of distribution in the top 1% most abundant (expanded) clones in the DP and SP8 populations compared to SP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Decreased diversity and increased clonality of foetal compared to young adult TCRβ repertoires.</title><p>TCR β-chain repertoires were sequenced from FACS-sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (DP), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP4), and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP8) thymocyte populations from E18.5 (red circles; n=7) and 4-week-old (blue circles; n=6) C57BL/6 thymus.

Shannon entropy is derived from information theory and represents the complexity of the system, taking into account both the number of unique clonotypes and the frequencies of each clonotype, to generate a measure of richness and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shannon and Weaver, 1949</xref>). For each thymocyte population, the Shannon entropy was higher in the young adult TCRβ repertoire than in the foetal, demonstrating a richer more diverse repertoire in the adult thymocyte populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The Gini index is a measure of the equality (evenness) of the distribution, and is frequently used in economics to demonstrate the distribution of a population’s wealth, where a lower index represents a more equal distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ceriani and Verme, 2012</xref>). The Gini index of the distribution of TCRβ clonotypes was significantly lower in each adult population compared to its foetal counterpart, confirming a more equally distributed TCRβ repertoire in the young adult thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>In parallel, we analysed the repertoire diversity, richness, and distribution of the TCRα repertoires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, we detected no significant differences between foetal and adult populations in the abundance of TCRα sequences detected in the top 1% most frequent (expanded) clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

We found many differences between foetus and adult in proportional V and J segment usage within unique TCRβ and TCRα sequences for DP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), SP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), and SP8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) populations. Preferential gene segment usage according to life-stage appeared to correlate with the chromosomal location of the gene segment, particularly for TRAV and TRBV usage within the DP population, where the adult repertoire favoured the 5’ gene segments, and the foetus the 3’ gene segments. To visualise these differences, we plotted heatmaps of mean proportional gene segment usage for unique TCR sequences, clustering each life-stage and thymocyte population, but showing each gene segment in chromosomal order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). The samples clustered by life-stage first before cell-type (E18.5 populations clustered together) for both TCRα and TCRβ, suggesting that VJ gene usage is altered in the foetus compared to young adult. Both TRAV and TRAJ showed clear preference for chromosomal location, with foetal populations favouring 3’ TRAV segments and 5’ TRAJ segments, whereas adult populations showed enrichment of 5’ TRAV and 3’ TRAJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). To test if this bias in gene usage was present in the unselected TCRα repertoire, we separated the DP population into cells that have not yet entered positive selection (CD3<sup>-/lo</sup>DP/CD69<sup>-</sup>DP) and cells that have entered TCR repertoire selection (CD3<sup>+/hi</sup>DP/CD69<sup>+</sup>DP). Both foetal DP populations clustered together and showed similar bias towards 3’ TRAV and 5’ TRAJ, suggesting that the bias was independent of positive selection. In the case of the adult DP populations, however, the more immature DP population clustered separately from the other young adult populations and showed weaker enrichment 3’TRAJ than the populations that had undergone or were undergoing positive selection (CD3<sup>+/hi</sup>DP, SP4 and SP8). This suggests that in the adult thymus, positive selection changes proportional TRAJ gene usage, whereas in the foetal thymus an inherent bias in VJα gene usage persists after positive selection.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Foetal and young adult TCR repertoires favour different gene segments.</title><p>TCR α-chain (<bold>A, B</bold>) and β-chain (<bold>C–G</bold>) repertoires were sequenced from FACS-sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP4) and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP8) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>-</sup> (CD69-DP, foetal), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD69<sup>+</sup> (CD69<sup>+</sup>DP foetal) CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>-/lo</sup> (CD3<sup>-/lo</sup>DP, adult), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+/hi</sup> (CD3<sup>+/hi</sup>DP adult) thymocyte populations from E18.5 (red; n=7) and 4 week-old (blue; n=6) C57BL/6 thymus.

For both foetal and adult samples, DP populations were positioned between SP8 and SP4, indicating a divergence in CDR1xCDR2 usage as a result of MHC restriction following positive selection. Indeed, CDR1xCDR2 combinations that contributed strongly to the positive side on PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), such as MSHET-SYDVDS (TRBV29) and SGHSN-HYEKVE (TRBV12-1), showed increased expression in SP8 and decreased expression in SP4 (consistent with MHCI-restriction), while combinations that contributed strongly to the negative side of PC2, such as GKSSPN-SITVG (TRBV31), showed increased expression in SP4 and decreased expression in SP8 (consistent with MHCII-restriction).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Proportional combinatorial CDR1xCDR2 bias in foetal and young adult thymocyte populations indicates reduced MHC-restriction in foetal thymus.</title><p>TCR β-chain and α-chain repertoires were sequenced from FACS-sorted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> (DP), CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP4), and CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>CD3<sup>+</sup> (SP8) thymocyte populations from E18.5 (n=7) and 4-week-old (n=6) C57BL/6 thymus and frequency of CDR1 and CDR2 sequences calculated for each population.

During TCRβ gene rearrangement, these segments are closest to one another in the looping structure that enables V to DJ rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Skok et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting this might account for the foetal bias in proportional TRBVxTRBJ segment usage. In contrast to <italic>Tcrb</italic> locus rearrangement, the <italic>Tcra</italic> locus can undergo multiple rounds of rearrangement on each chromosome, sequentially moving 3’ to 5’ along the series of TRAV gene segments, while moving 5’ to 3’ along the series of TRAJ gene segments, with proximal pairs (3’ TRAV segments with 5’ TRAJ segments) initiating this sequence of rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carico et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that the foetal DP repertoire showed TRAVxTRAJ bias by their chromosomal position. One possible explanation for this bias is that in the foetus progressive rounds of <italic>Tcra</italic> rearrangement are less common than in young adult, perhaps as a result of differences in the kinetics of T-cell development. Differentiation of foetal thymocytes occurs in a largely synchronized wave, whereas adult thymocyte production is unsynchronised, continuous and slower. Once the adult thymus has reached steady-state, homeostasis between thymocyte populations regulates the rate of differentiation to DP cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hager-Theodorides et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Outram et al., 2009</xref>). To examine the influence of the rate of differentiation on VJ gene usage, we synchronized the differentiation of adult DP thymocytes by treating young adult mice with hydrocortisone (HC) to deplete the adult thymus of all but the most mature cells. At 2 days after treatment, the thymus was depleted of DP cells. Four days later (6 days after treatment), we FACS-sorted and TCR sequenced the replenished CD3<sup>-/lo</sup>DP (CD3<sup>-/lo</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>), and CD3<sup>+/hi</sup>DP (CD3<sup>+/hi</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup>) populations. We plotted heatmaps of mean proportional V and J gene segment usage for unique TCR sequences in foetal, HC-treated and control young adult repertoires, clustering each life-stage and thymocyte population, but showing each gene segment in chromosomal order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). For TRAJ usage, foetal and adult HC-treated repertoires clustered together, with untreated adult repertoires clustering separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). Interestingly, both foetal and HC-treated young adult populations favoured 5’ TRAJ segments, in contrast to control young adult populations, that displayed bias for 3’ TRAJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>).

Our study revealed many differences between the foetal and young adult thymus in TCR gene segment usage, repertoire diversity, and clonality by bulk sequencing separate TCRβ and TCRα repertoires. These data indicate that MHC restriction and positive selection have a weaker impact on the TCR repertoire in foetal thymus compared to adult. Overall, the differences between the foetal and adult thymus TCR repertoires are consistent with the foetal thymus producing αβT-cells with properties and functions that are distinct from adult T-cells: their repertoire is less diverse, more closely encoded by genomic sequence, less governed by MHC-restriction, and with preference for particular gene segment usage. Several recent studies have demonstrated distinct and more innate-like features of foetal and neonatal T-cell populations in both humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaudin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rackaityte and Halkias, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). The first wave of foetal αβT-cells that leave the thymus must provide early protection against infection in the neonatal animal but also need to be tolerant to both self and maternal MHC/antigens. It is possible that the distinct features and potentially weaker MHC-restriction of the foetal TCR repertoire have evolved to provide these two important features of foetal adaptive immunity. It will be interesting to investigate if the foetal-bias in gene segment usage confers specific properties on foetal TCRs, with respect to their binding specificity, affinity and avidity and immunity to neonatal infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas and Crawford, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In validation of our approach, we were able to quantify known differences in TCRβ repertoire diversity, CDR3 length and non-template insertion length between foetal and adult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sethna et al., 2017</xref>). The foetal TCRβ and TCRα repertoires contained fewer non-template nucleotides than adult, indicating that they were more closely aligned to genomic sequence. Consistent with this, the foetal β-chain and α-chain CDR3 repertoires shared more sequences with one another than their young adult counterparts. Our study also showed that the foetal TCRβ repertoire had a less equal distribution in DP, SP4, and SP8 populations compared to adult, and increased clonal expansion of the most abundant clones in DP and SP4 populations. Thus, the reduction in TCRβ repertoire diversity observed in the foetal thymus could not simply be attributed to the reduction in N-nucleotide insertions. These differences in TCRβ repertoire distribution and clonal expansion may be the result of differences in the kinetics of expansion and differentiation of thymocyte subsets in the foetus, leading to greater clonal expansion of TCRβ clones following β-selection. The transition from DP to SP cell in the foetus takes just 2–3 days at most, as DP cells first appear around E16, and the mature SP populations were FACS-sorted on E18.5, whereas in the adult thymus differentiation from DN3 to SP cell may take place over a longer period of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Solanki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We found many differences in proportional TRBV, TRBJ, TRAV, and TRAJ gene usage between foetal and adult thymocyte populations, with foetal populations showing proportional bias towards 3’ TRBV usage. We observed a particularly striking bias towards use of 3’ TRAV and 5’ TRAJ gene segments in the foetus. As a previous study used a PCR-based approach to identify enrichment of 3’TRAV to 5’TRAJ rearrangements in foetal BALB/c thymocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pasqual et al., 2002</xref>), the bias is not dependent on mouse strain or MHC haplotype.</p><p>Bias in TCRα gene segment usage by chromosomal location has been reported in human DN thymocyte populations by single cell RNAseq but was found to diminish as thymocytes mature and progressive recombination of the TCRα loci occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in the mouse foetal thymus, we found that the bias in proportional TRAV and TRAJ gene segment use by chromosomal position persisted in the positively selecting CD69<sup>+</sup>DP and mature SP4 populations, but was not apparent in the adult CD3<sup>-/lo</sup>DP population. Our data therefore suggest that progressive rounds of TCRα rearrangement are less common in the foetal DP population. Indeed, when we depleted the young adult thymus by HC-treatment, we found an increase in 3’TRAV and 5’TRAJ gene segment usage in the synchronized recently differentiated recovering DP population, making these repertoires more similar to the foetal DP TCRα repertoires. Thus, differences between foetal and control young adult TCRαV-J rearrangements in DP cells may be the result of slower differentiation in the adult thymus, allowing more time for multiple rounds of TCRαV-J rearrangements in the DP population. Consistent with this, the foetal DP population showed a different TCRα frequency distribution than the adult DP population, with a lower power law exponent.</p><p>Comparison of proportional use of TCRβVxJ and TCRαVxJ combinations between adult and foetal populations also highlighted the 3’ V gene segment preference in the foetal DP population, and the 5’ V gene segment preference in the adult DP population for both β-chain and α-chain. Interestingly, life-stage had a greater impact on TCRβ and TCRα gene segment usage than MHC-restriction in all populations.</p><p>When we carried out PCA on adult and foetal samples separately, PCA clustered β-chain VxJ combination counts and β-chain CDR1xCDR2 by SP population in both adult and foetal samples, showing the impact of MHC restriction (positive selection) on the SP repertoires. However, the percentage of variability that was attributable to MHC-restriction was greater in adult repertoires than foetal repertoires. PCA also clustered the adult α-chain V x J and CDR1xCDR2 combinations by SP cell type, confirming impact of MHC restriction on adult Vα gene usage. However, foetal populations failed to segregate by cell type in either α-chain PCA, indicating that MHC restriction/positive selection has less influence on α-chain repertoires in foetal SP populations. Thus, our data suggests that in the foetal thymus the influence of MHC-restriction/positive selection on both the TCRβand TCRα repertoires that is weaker than in the adult thymus.</p><p>Our approach of bulk TCR sequencing from FACS-sorted thymocyte populations had the advantages of scale (allowing the sequencing of thousands of rearrangements from thousands of cells from each embryo or mouse), at relatively low cost. However, it had the disadvantage that we were unable to investigate which TCRβ rearrangements pair with which TCRα rearrangements in single cells. Clearly, in future it will be important and interesting to expand this analysis to include TCRβ/α pairing by single cell RNAseq.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were bred and maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions at University College London (UK) and animal experimentation was carried out under UK Home Office regulations (PPL PP7936049), following ethical review at UCL, following ARRIVE guidelines.

These reactions were purified by Minelute PCR purification (QIAGEN, cat. no: 28004) following the manufacturer’s instructions and eluted in 10.5 μL nuclease-free water.</p><p>The cDNA was then ligated to the M13 ligation primer which is composed of the Illumina SP2 primer, an 8 base spacer and a 12 base Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI). This UMI consists of two random hexamers separated by the 8 base spacer. On the 5’ end the primer is phosphorylated, and on the 3’ end it is blocked with a Spacer C3 moiety to prevent primer concatemerization. The ligation mix consisted of: 10 μL cDNA, 3 μL of bovine serum albumin (BSA)/hexamine cobalt chloride (HCC) mixture (1 mg/mL BSA, 10 mM HCC), 3 μL of T4 RNA ligase buffer (NEB, cat. no: M0204S), 1 μL of 10 mM ATP (NEB, cat. no: M0204S), 1 μL of 10 μM M13 Ligation primer, 2 μL of T4 RNA Ligase (10 000 U/mL, NEB, M0204S), and 10 μL of PEG 8000 50% (NEB, cat. no: M0204S).

The m-alpha-RC1 and m-beta-RC1 primers hybridize to the constant region of the α-chain and β-chain genes in the mouse, respectively. The SP2-M13 primer hybridizes to the sequence introduced by the M13 ligation primer earlier during the ligation step. PCR-1 was run using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 3 min, followed by 4 cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 69 °C for 30 ss and extension at 72 °C for 40 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.</p><p>The 50 μL PCR product was then purified by adding 40 μL of AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, cat. no: A63881) with some modifications to manufacturer’s instructions: 200 μL of 80% ethanol was used for the washing steps.

SYBR Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, 10,000 x concentrate in DMSO (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no: S7567) was diluted firstly 1:100 in DMSO and this stock solution was stored at –20 °C.

The qPCR was run using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98 °C for 3 min, followed by a variable number of cycles of denaturation at 98 °C for 15 s, annealing at 69 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 40 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.</p><p>The reaction was stopped when the samples passed the threshold of 0.1 ∆Rn.

A Vacuum Concentrator Centrifuge was used to pellet the library and remove excess volume, so that 30 μL of the pooled library could then be run on the Pippin Prep System using a Pippin Gel Cassette 1.5% w/v agarose dye free 250 bp-1.5 kb DNA size range (Sage Science, cat. no: CDF1510) to size select for sequences between 350 and 750 bp, following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p><p>40 μL of library eluted from the Pippin Prep was then quantified using a Qubit and TapeStation System HSD1000 as detailed above.

It should be noted that these basic observations were made 20 years ago using PCR approaches (Pasqual et al., J.Exp.Med. 196:1163 (2002)), and even earlier by others.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited this manuscript (Introduction, page 5) which used PCR of genomic DNA to investigate some TCRα VJ rearrangements in foetal and adult thymus. In contrast, our study uses next generation sequencing of transcripts to investigate all possible combinations of TCRα and TCRβ VJ combinations in different sorted thymocyte populations ex vivo. The greater sensitivity of this more modern technology has thus enabled us to detect many more TCRαVJ rearrangements than the 2002 study, and to conclude on basis of stringent statistical testing that the foetal repertoire is enriched for 3’V to 5’J combinations (Fig. 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also note that in fetal thymus this bias persists after positive selection, and it can be reproduced in adults during recovery from hydrocortisone treatment. The authors conclude that there are fewer rounds of sequential TCRA rearrangements in the fetal thymus, perhaps due to less time spent in the DP compartment in fetus versus adult. However, the repertoire difference noted by the authors does not require such an explanation. What the authors are analyzing in the fetus is the leading edge of a synchronous wave of TCRA rearrangements, whereas what they are analyzing in adults is the unsynchronized steady state distribution. It is certainly true, as has been shown previously, that the earliest TCRA rearrangements use 3' TRAV and 5'TRAJ segments. But analysis of adult thymocytes has shown that the progression from use of 3' TRAV and 5' TRAJ to use of 5' TRAV and 3' TRAJ takes several days (Carico et al., Cell Rep. 19:2157 (2017)). The same kinetics, imposed on fetal development, would put development of a more complete TCRA repertoire at or shortly after birth. In fact, Pasqual showed exactly this type of progression from F18 through D1 after birth, and could reproduce the progression by placing F16 thymic lobes in FTOC. It is not appropriate to compare a single snapshot of a synchronized process in early fetal thymocytes to the unsynchronized steady state situation in adults. In fact, the authors' own data support this contention, because when they synchronize adult thymocytes by using hydroxycortisone, they can replicate the fetal distribution. Along these lines, the fact that positive selection of fetal thymocytes using 3' TRAV and 5' TRAJ segments occurs within 2 days of thymocyte entry into the DP compartment does not mean that DP development in the fetus is intrinsically rapid and restricted to 2 days. It simply means that thymocytes bearing an early rearranging TCR can be positively selected shortly after TCR expression. The expectation would be that those DP thymocytes that had not undergone early positive selection using a 3' TRAV and a 5' TRAJ would remain longer in the DP compartment and continue the progression of TCRA rearrangements, with the potential for selection several days later using more 5'TRAV and 3'TRAJ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this summary provided by the reviewer which corresponds closely to the points we made ourselves in the manuscript. Indeed, we discuss the synchronization and kinetics of first wave of T-cell development in Results page 13 and Discussion page 17, which was the rationale for the hydrocortisone experiment. We have also discussed findings from Carico et al 2017 in this context (see pages 13, 16, 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors note 3' V and 5'J biases for TCRB in fetal thymocytes. The previously outlined concerns about interpreting TCRA repertoire development do not directly apply here. But it would be appropriate to note that by deep sequencing, Sethna (PNAS 114:2253 (2017)) identified skewed usage of some of the same TRBV gene segments in fetal versus adult. It should also be noted that Sethna did not detect significantly skewed usage of TRBJ segments. Regardless, one might question whether the skewed usage of TRBJ segments detected here should be characterized as relating to chromosomal location. There are two logical ways one can think about chromosomal location of TRBJ segments - one being TRBJ1 cluster vs TRBJ2 cluster, the other being 5' to 3' within each cluster. The variation reported here does not obviously fit either pattern. Is there a statistically significant difference in aggregate use of the two clusters? There is certainly no clear pattern of use 5' to 3' across each cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a statistical comparison of the aggregate TRBJ use between the J1 cluster and the J2 cluster (see SFig5) and Results page 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors show that biases in TCRA and TCRB V and J gene usage between fetal and adult thymocytes are mostly conserved between pre- and post-selection thymocytes (Fig 2). In striking contrast, TCRA and TCRB combinatorial repertoires show strong biases preselection that are largely erased in post-selection thymocytes (Fig 3). This apparent discrepancy is not addressed, but interpretation is challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>I think the reviewer is referring to heatmaps for individual gene segment usage shown in Figure 2 in comparison to combinatorial usage shown in Figure 4. There is not a discrepancy in the data, but rather the differences between these two figures lie in the way in which the comparisons are made and visualised. The heatmaps in Figure 2A-D show mean proportional usage of each individual gene segment for each cell type in the two life stages, clustered by Euclidian distance. This visualisation clearly shows bias in foetal 3’ TRAV usage and 5’TRAJ usage (looking at areas of red, which have higher usage), with less pronounced enrichment for TRBV and TRBJ. The heatmaps also show differences in intensity between different cell populations in each life-stage.</p><p>In contrast, in Figure 4 the tiles show combinations with statistically significant (P&lt;0.05) differences in mean counts for each VJ combination in each cell type between 7 foetal and 6 adult repertoires by Student’s t-test, after correcting for False discovery rate (FDR) due to multiple combinations. It is the case, that there are fewer significant differences in proportional combinatorial VxJ use between foetal and adult repertoires after selection. We find this an interesting finding and have expanded our discussion of this aspect of the data (page 10). More than half of the significant differences persist after repertoire selection, and the reduction in each individual SP population, of course in part reflects the lineage divergence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The observation that there is a higher proportion of nonproductive TCRB rearrangements in fetal thymus compared to adult is challenging to interpret, given that the results are based upon RNA sequencing so are unlikely to reflect the ratio in genomic DNA due to processes like NMD.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two sentences to explain that transcripts of non-productive rearrangements are eliminated by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), but some non-productive transcripts are detected in many studies of TCR repertoire sequencing, and we have cited three studies from different groups that document this (see Results, page 10-11). We have not commented on how the increase in non-productive TCR rearrangements in the foetal populations (in comparison to adult) relates to rearrangements in genomic DNA or NMD. We have likewise not commented on the possible significance or biological role of nonproductive TCR transcripts, but simply reported our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) An intriguing and paradoxical finding is that fetal DP, CD4 and CD8 thymocytes all display greater sharing of TCRB CDR3 sequences among individuals than do adults (Fig 5DE), whereas DP and CD8 thymocytes are shown to display greater CDR3 amino acid triplet motif sharing in adults (with a similar trend in CD4).</p></disp-quote><p>As foetal DP, CD4SP and CD8SP TCRbeta repertoires have fewer non-template insertions and lower means CDR3 length, they are expected to share more CDR3 repertoires than their adult counterparts. However, in the case of CDR3 amino acid triplet motifs (k-mers) what is being analysed is the sharing of each possible individual k-mer. If k-mers are shared more in the adult for some populations, but CDR3 repertoires are shared more in the foetus, we think it means that some k-mers appear in many different CDR3 sequences in the adult, so that they are over-represented in multiple different CDR3s (presumably due to selection processes, although we agree that this is just an assumption).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors attribute high amino acid triplet sharing to the result of selection of recurrent motifs by contact with pMHC during positive selection. But this interpretation seems highly problematic because the difference between fetal and adult thymocytes is dramatic even in unfractionated DP thymocytes, the vast majority of which have not yet undergone positive selection. How then to explain the differences in CDR3 sharing visualized by the different approaches?</p></disp-quote><p>The TCRβ repertoire has been selected in the adult DP population through the process of β-selection, which is believed to involve immune synapse formation and MHC-interactions (Allam et al 2021,10.1083/jcb.201908108). We have now included this reference in the introduction to make this clear (page 4). However, we agree with the reviewer’s comments that it is challenging to explain the k-mer analysis and that we have not been able to actually show that increased k-mer sharing in the adult is a direct consequence of increased positive selection: it was our interpretation of this seemingly paradoxical finding. For clarity, we have therefore removed the k-mer analyses from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors conclude that there is less MHC restriction in fetal thymocytes, based on measures of repertoire divergence from DP to CD4 and CD8 populations (Fig. 6). But the authors point to no evidence of this in analysis of TRBV usage, either by PC or heatmap analyses (A,B,D). The argument seems to rest on PC analysis of TRAV usage (Fig S6), despite the fact that dramatic differences in the SP4 and SP8 repertoires are readily apparent in the fetal thymocyte heatmaps. The data do not appear to be robust enough to provide strong support for the authors' conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have written the text very carefully so as not to make the claim too strong, stating in the abstract: “In foetus we identified less influence of MHC-restriction on α-chain and β-chain combinatorial VxJ usage and CDR1xCDR2 (V region) usage in SP compared to adult, indicating weaker impact of MHC-restriction on the foetal TCR repertoire.” We are not saying that MHC-restriction does not impact VJ gene usage in foetal repertoires, but rather that it has less influence (particularly when compared to life-stage). Evidence for this comes from: [1] Heatmaps in Fig2A-D which show that all repertoires cluster first by life-stage ahead of cell type; [2] Fig3A and B: PCA of adult and foetal TCRβ VXJ combinations: All repertoires cluster by life-stage on PC1. PC2 separates adult repertoires by cell type (adult SP8 are positive on PC2 while adult SP4 are negative on PC2, and DP cells are between them) but for foetal repertoires the SP8 and SP4 are highly dispersed with some SP4 cells falling on positive side of PC2. Only foetal DP repertoires cluster tightly. [3] Fig6A-C: PCA of β−chain CDR1xCDR2 (corresponding to Vβ gene segment usage) again shows the same pattern. Adult repertoires separate by cell type on PC2, (SP8 positive on PC2, SP4 negative on PC2, with DP in between), but foetal SP8 repertoires are much more dispersed. [5] SFig6J-K: PCA of α−chain CDR1xCDR2 (Vα usage) frequency distributions: adult repertoires cluster together and are separated by cell type on PC2 (SP4 positive, SP8 negative), but foetal populations are highly dispersed and fail to cluster by cell type on either axis. [6] We have additionally added new PCA analyses to explore differences in MHC-restriction between foetal and adult SP populations. This is shown in the new Figure 7. We reasoned that in a PCA that included foetal and adult repertoires together, the foetal repertoires might not segregate by SP cell type (MHC-restriction) because of their overall bias towards particular VJ combinations, which would mean that effectively the PCA would be imposing adult MHC restriction on the foetal repertoires. We therefore carried out PCA in which we analysed the adult repertoires separately from the foetal repertoires. As expected for adult repertoires, PCA separated SP4 repertoires from SP8 repertoires on PC1 in each comparison (β-chain VxJ (Fig. 7B), α-chain VxJ (Fig. 7F), β-chain CDR1xCDR2 (V region) (Fig. 7H) and α-chain CDR1xCDR2 (V region) (Fig. 7L)). In contrast, for foetal TCRα repertoires (α-chain VxJ and α-chain CDR1xCDR2 (V region)), PCA failed to separate SP4 from SP8 repertoires on PC1 or PC2, so we did not detect impact of MHC-restriction on foetal TCRβ repertoires (Fig. 7E and K). For foetal TCRβ repertoires, PCA separated SP4 β-chain VxJ from SP8 on PC2, accounting for only 11.1% of variance (Fig. 7A) (in contrast to the 44.2% of variance accounted for by MHC-restriction in adult β-chain VxJ PCA (Fig. 7B)). Thus, in adult repertoires ~4-fold more of the variance in β-chain VxJ usage can be accounted for by MHC-restriction than in foetal repertoires. PCA of foetal β-chain CDR1xCDR2 (V region) separated SP4 from SP8 on PC1, accounting for 28.8% of variance, whereas in PCA of adult β-chain CDR1xCDR2, MHCrestriction accounted for 56.1% (&gt;2-foldmore than in foetus). Thus, even when we considered only V-region usage alone, we detected a stronger influence of MHC-restriction on the TCRβ repertoire in adult compared to foetal thymus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides a comparison of TCR gene segment usage between foetal and adult thymus.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Interesting computational analyses was performed to find interesting differences in TCR gene usage within unpaired TCRa and TCRb chains between foetal and adult thymus.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>This study was significantly lacking insight and interpretation into what the data analysed actually means for the biology.

This is included in the Methods (page 19).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major points:</p><p>- Group sizes are very small (4 foetal and 4 adult mice). Considering the spread in TCR analysis (eg fig 1 B-H, Sup figures 2-4), the study is likely underpowered as it often looks like one mouse prevents or supports a statistical difference. Authors should therefore consider increasing the group size.</p></disp-quote><p>We have sequenced more libraries and included more data, from 7 foetal and 6 young adult animals (biological replicates).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should include a gating strategy for their sorted cells. This is essential to verify the quality of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this to the Methods and SFig7 and SFig8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Authors should include a summary sentence at the end of each result section which interprets the main finding. Furthermore, the manuscript would greatly benefit from a schematic figure of their main findings, particularly with regards to the rearrangements and selection differences in foetal and adult thymi.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a summary sentence to the end of each results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Authors should be more careful with their claim that MHC has less of an effect foetal TCR selection. Authors demonstrated that there is a difference in VJ recombination between the foetal and adult TCR repertoire, skewing the foetal TCR repertoire to certain variable and junctional segments. Since both CDR1 and CDR2 are encoded by the variable gene, this is likely to affect their ability to interact with the MHC during positive selection. Have Authors considered whether the selection process is actually a bystander effect of the differences in the rearrangement process? One way to support the authors claim is to demonstrate that mice with an alternative MHC background, have similar foetal/adult gene rearrangements but a different TCR repertoire in the SP populations.</p></disp-quote><p>Time and resources have prevented us from repeating our experiments in another strain of inbred mice. However, we note that a previous PCR study that showed 3’TRAV to 5’TRAJ bias in foetal repertoires was carried out in BALB/c mice (Pasqual JEM 2002). We have added this point to the Discussion (page 17).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- (supplementary) tables have not been provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary Tables were uploaded with the submission. STables 1 and 2 show antibodies used for cell sorts and STable 3 primers used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moderate points:</p><p>- The loading plots in Figure 3 onward are visually strong. Authors could consider including an V and J (separate) loading plots for Figure 3 E, F and G to demonstrate preferential V and J usage.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional loading plots in Figure 7 for the new PCA we have added (see Fig. 7C, D,I and J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- &quot;the proportion of non-productive rearrangements was higher in the foetal SP8 population than adults (Fig 5A)&quot; Authors should explain how non-productive TCRs end up in SP populations as they need to pass positive and negative selection which both require interactions between the TCR and the MHC.</p></disp-quote><p>As we used RNA sequencing in our study, we did not comment on how the increase in nonproductive TCRbeta rearrangements in the foetal populations (in comparison to adult) relates to rearrangements in genomic DNA or to nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) that is believed to down-regulate transcripts of non-productively rearranged TCR. We have not commented on the possible significance or biological role of non-productive TCR transcripts, but simply reported our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Authors have studied CDR3 sequential amino acid triplets (k-mers). However, CDR3 regions are longer than 3 amino acids in length, hence authors should provide (1) an overview/comparison of the identified k-mers in foetal or adult thymocytes (2) explain how different k-mers relate to each other, eg whether they are expressed in the same TCR. Have authors considered using alternative programs to identify CDR3 motifs that are based on the full CDR3amino acid sequence, eg TCRdist provides motifs and indicated which amino acids are germline encoded or inserted.</p></disp-quote><p>In light of this comment from this reviewer and also comments from Reviewer 2, we have removed the comparison of k-mers from the manuscript. Please see response to point 5 of Reviewer 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The term &quot;innate-like&quot; is confusing as it implies that foetal cells are not antigen specific.</p><p>However, once in the circulation, foetal cells will respond in an antigen-specific manner.</p><p>Hence authors should use another term.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the term “innate-like” from the abstract and the first time we used it in the first paragraph of the Discussion. However, the second time we used the term, we are actually taking it from the manuscript we cited (Beaudin et al 2016) and in this case we left it in. We agree that foetal cells are likely to respond in an antigen-specific manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- To support their hypothesis in the discussion &quot;However, as TCRd gene segments are nested.... so that 5' TRAV segments are not favoured&quot; can authors confirm that there are indeed less yd T cells in the foetal repertoire?</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this section from the discussion, because although it is interesting, it is highly speculative, and the manuscript is already quite complicated to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>- The authors may find the publication by De Greef 2021 PNAS of interest to identify TRBD segments</p><p>- Authors need to clarify that they mean CDR3-beta in the sentence &quot;The mean predicted CDR3 length.... compared to young adult&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new data in the manuscript to show that mean CDR3 length is lower in all foetal populations of beta (Fig5C) and alpha (SFig5C) and clarified which we are referring to in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Authors should bring the section &quot;During TCRb gene rearrangement, these segments.... Initiating the sequence of rearrangements&quot; forward and include a schematic.&quot; Forward to figure 2 and provide the reader with a visual schematic of the foetal vs adult recombination events.</p><p>- Discussion: &quot;The first wave of foetal abT-cells that leave the thymus... tolerant to both self and maternal MHC/antigens&quot;. Have Authors considered the alternative hypothesis published by Thomas 2019 in Curr Opin System Biol that the observed bias could potentially provide better protection against childhood pathogens?</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed considered this, as stated in the first paragraph of the Discussion “The first wave of foetal αβT-cells that leave the thymus must provide early protection against infection in the neonatal animal”. We have now cited the Thomas 2019 study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discussion: Authors should rephrase the sentence &quot;The transition from DP to SP cell in the foetus.... From DN3 to SP cell may be slower&quot; as it is unclear what the authors mean.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased this (see page 17)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discussion &quot;TRAV and TRAJ Array&quot; do authors mean &quot;TRAV and TRAJ area&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We did indeed mean array (as in series of gene segments) but we have changed the wording for clarity (page 14).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Methods, Fluorescence activated cell sorting: can authors clarify whether they stained, sorted and sequenced the full thymus and /or specify how many cells were included. Can authors also explain why foetal and adult cells were treated differently (eg the volume of master mix)?</p><p>- Methods Fluorescence activated cell sorting authors should specify what they mean with &quot;mastermix of either 1:50 (foetal thymus) or 1:100 (adult thymus)&quot;. Does this mean all antibodies in the foetal mastermix were 1:50 and all antibodies in the adult master mix were 1:100? If so, why were different concentrations used and why were antibodies not individually titrated before use?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the methods and antibodies used are listed with clones in supplementary tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures:</p><p>- Several figures did not fit on the page and therefore missed the top or side</p><p>- Figure 1A: missing a label on the Y axis</p></disp-quote><p>This is visible</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 2A-D: please indicate the 5' and 3' terminus in each graph.

There are several ways they might provide a more meaningful assessment: (1) They could analyze the fetal repertoire at multiple time points. (2) They could compare instead the steady state distributions in early postnatal and adult thymus samples. (3) They could compare the peripheral T cell repertoires in the first week of life versus adult. This last approach would allow them to draw the most impactful conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions. Sadly, it is beyond our budget for the current manuscript and beyond the scope of our current study that we believe provides interesting new information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Fig S2D shows TRBJ1-4 in black lettering meant to indicate no significant difference whereas the figure shows use of this gene segment to be elevated in adult.

Isn't it the case that every TRBV gene presents a distinct CDR1xCDR2 combination, meaning that there is no difference between TRBV usage and TRBV CDR1xCDR2 usage? If so, please make this clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is the case, we have made this clearer in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In general, although there is lots of interesting analyses that can be done with these large datasets, I feel as though the authors did not fully interpret the real meaning and significance of many of these results. Whilst there were some speculation on why a foetal repertoire might be different to those of adults in the discussion sections, the rationale for each individual analyses was not clearly explained. I would suggest that the rationale and a thorough explanation of each analyses be added to the results section, including a finishing sentence on what it means.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added short summaries to each results section to make the points we are making clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did not mention how many cells were sorted for from each thymus for sequencing. Was the cell number normalised between each population? As this might have an influence on various downstream measurements of diversity, evenness and clonality, if there is a sampling issue.</p></disp-quote><p>This is explained in the methods. We used sampling to allow comparisons between repertoires of different sizes, and this is also explained in the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should include the cell sorting profiles and example flow cytometry plots, including gating strategies and the post sort purity of each sorted population.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included sorting strategies in the methods (SFig7 and SFig8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think the manuscript could also be improved if there were some basic characterisation of foetal vs. adult thymus development. How many thymocytes are in a foetal vs adult thymus at the timepoints chosen?</p><p>I think there were some interesting findings in this paper. Given that overall, the foetal thymus appeared to be less diverse than that of the adult, one question I thought would be interesting to discuss was the overlap between the two repertoires. Is the foetal thymus simply a sub-fraction of the adult repertoire or is it totally distinct with no overlapping sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>Our analyses indicate that the repertoires are actually different. This is evident in Fig4 and in PCA loading plots shown in Fig, 3C and new Fig. 7C, D, I and J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think that some of the interpretation in the results section may be a bit vague. &quot;When we compaired by thymocyte population, each adult population clustered together, with adult SP4 separating from adult SP8 on PC2 and DP cells scoring in between, suggesting that PC2 might correspond to MHC restriction of the adult populations.&quot; - whilst I think I know what the authors mean, I do believe that this could be explained in clearer detail and more explicit. SP4 and SP8 are known to be positively selected in the thymus on distinct MHC class I and MHC class II molecules for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to clarify the text describing that PCA and additionally added a new Figure (new Fig. &amp;) to compare the influence of MHC-restriction on the TCR repertoire in foetal and adult thymus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the methods section, the age and sex of mice used were not explained at all. What was used in the experiment? Are there any sex differences?</p></disp-quote><p>Age and sex of mice is given in the methods. We have not detected sex differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a huge omission from the manuscript. In general, I don't believe the methods section has described the analysis in sufficient detail for replication. All analysis code and data should be publicly accessible and be in a format that allows for the reader to replicate the figures in the paper upon running the code. Perhaps even allowing them to run their own TCR datasets. Overall, I think the manuscript needs some rewriting to include additional details and deeper interpretation of each individual analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Sequencing data files will be made publicly available on UCL Research Data Repository.</p></body></sub-article></article>
