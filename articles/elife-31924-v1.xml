In dopamine neurons, both variants can act as autoreceptors to regulate neuronal excitability and dopamine release, but the roles of each variant are incompletely characterized. In a previous study we used viral receptor expression in D2 receptor knockout mice to show distinct effects of calcium signaling on D2S and D2L autoreceptor function (Gantz et al., 2015). However, the cocaine-induced plasticity of D2 receptor desensitization observed in wild type mice was not recapitulated with this method of receptor expression. Here we use mice with genetic knockouts of either the D2S or D2L variant to investigate cocaine-induced plasticity in D2 receptor signaling. Following a single in vivo cocaine exposure, the desensitization of D2 receptors from neurons expressing only the D2S variant was reduced. This did not occur in D2L-expressing neurons, indicating differential drug-induced plasticity between the variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>D2 receptor</kwd><kwd>cocaine</kwd><kwd>desensitization</kwd><kwd>D2 splice variants</kwd><kwd>plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 DA038456</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Brooks G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA033554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borrelli</surname><given-names>Emiliana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borrelli</surname><given-names>Emiliana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA04523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DA007262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>John T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000738</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX003279</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neve</surname><given-names>Kim A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Desensitization of the D2 autoreceptor is reduced following in vivo cocaine exposure due to plasticity in the D2S and not the D2L splice variant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine D2 autoreceptors decrease neuronal excitability when activated by dendrodendritic release of dopamine in the midbrain. The D2 receptor has short (D2S) and long (D2L) splice variants that differ by a 29 amino acid section in the third intracellular loop. While both variants are expressed in dopamine neurons and function effectively as autoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jomphe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Neve et al., 2013</xref>), subtle differences have been reported suggesting the variants are not redundant. Agonist induced desensitization of the variants has been shown to differ in multiple reports. The D2S receptor desensitizes and internalizes to a greater degree than D2L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Itokawa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ito et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Morris et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Thibault et al., 2011</xref>). Desensitization of the D2S receptor-dependent activation of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) conductance was also greater and was dependent on the level of intracellular calcium buffering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). Desensitization of the D2 receptor is decreased following in vivo acute drug exposure to ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Perra et al., 2011</xref>), cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>), or L-DOPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>). A reduction in desensitization following drug exposure would conceivably result in a more effective autoreceptor (and therefore reduced neuronal excitability) during the next high dopamine situation, which would have widespread effects on dopamine signaling throughout the brain. However, studies using viral expression of single D2 receptor variants in D2-KO mice were inconclusive in determining whether the plasticity induced by cocaine resulted from adaptation of a single variant, or perhaps an altered ratio of splice variant expression/function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). To resolve this issue, the present study used mouse models that express only the D2S (D2L-KO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Usiello et al., 2000</xref>) or D2L variant (D2S-KO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Radl et al., 2013</xref>). The results show that a single treatment of animals with cocaine reduced acute desensitization of the D2S variant. Treatment with cocaine did not alter the expression of either D2 receptor variant, and the desensitization of the D2L variant was not changed. Thus, it appears that plasticity in D2 receptor signaling induced by a single cocaine treatment results from adaptation of the D2S variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The calcium sensitivity and desensitization of the short and long variants of the D2 receptor were effectively studied with the use of viral expression of D2S and D2L receptors in dopamine neurons of D2-KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). However, the adaptation in D2 receptor desensitization following in vivo cocaine treatment could not be replicated with mice virally expressing D2 receptors (D2S, D2L, or a combination of both) and therefore there was uncertainty about the source of adaptation. To address the issue, D2L-KO and D2S-KO mouse lines were employed. These mice express a single D2 variant at physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Usiello et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Radl et al., 2013</xref>). Whole-cell recordings from dopamine neurons in brain slices containing the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were used to measure desensitization. The selective D2 receptor agonist quinpirole (10 µM) was applied for 5 min and the decline from the peak outward D2-GIRK current was measured after 90 s. This experiment was done in slices taken from untreated and cocaine treated (20 mg/kg 24 hr prior) male mice between 61 and 106 days old. Each genotype was examined using two internal solutions, a weak calcium buffering EGTA (0.1 mM) and a strong calcium buffering BAPTA (10 mM) solution. The comparison of these two internal conditions allows the parsing of processes dependent on and independent of intracellular calcium signaling. Results from wild type littermates from both genotypes were combined as no differences between the groups were seen. D2-GIRK currents from wild type mice desensitized to a greater extent with the weak calcium buffering EGTA internal solution compared to the strong buffering BAPTA internal. With the use of EGTA (and not BAPTA) internal solution the D2-GIRK current desensitized significantly less in cells from animals that were treated with cocaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This confirms previous results obtained in wild type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). The results from experiments with the D2L-KO mice (expressing D2S only) were similar to experiments in wild type mice. The decline in the quinpirole current with EGTA internal was greater than with BAPTA internal and was significantly reduced following in vivo cocaine treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In D2S-KO mice (expressing only D2L), some calcium sensitivity in current decline was still present (EGTA currents declined significantly more than BAPTA currents), but treatment with cocaine had no effect in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Representative traces of currents from naïve or cocaine-treated mice of each of the three genotypes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> further demonstrate that D2S, and not D2L, adapts following cocaine exposure. Desensitization is measured 90 s post peak. This initial phase of desensitization is calcium sensitive and differs between D2 receptor variants (52.7 ± 5.1% vs. 36.1 ± 2.9% decline with EGTA internal p&lt;0.01 with Student’s t-test, comparison not depicted). In the wild type and D2L-KO genotypes, the initial decline from peak becomes substantially shallower following cocaine exposure indicating an adaptation in a calcium-sensitive aspect of desensitization.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31924.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cocaine-induced adaptation in D2 receptor desensitization.</title><p>Shown on the left are representative traces from naïve and cocaine-treated groups in all genotypes of quinpirole (quin., 10 µM)-induced D2 receptor-GIRK currents (I-quinpirole) reversed by sulpiride (sulp., 600 nM) recorded from dopamine neurons in the SNc using EGTA internal solution.

Post-hoc analyses indicate that in both treatment conditions the decline using BAPTA (<bold>B</bold>) internal was less than that using EGTA (E, p&lt;0.001 for naïve and coc-treated). Additionally, with EGTA internal there was significantly reduced decline following cocaine treatment (p=0.049, n = 7–9 neurons from 5 to 8 mice).

In post hoc analyses, there was significantly more decline when using EGTA internal than BAPTA internal in both treatment conditions (p&lt;0.001 for naïve, p=0.002 for cocaine-treated), and the decline was significantly reduced following drug exposure when EGTA internal was used (p=0.021, n = 8–12 neurons from 4 to 7 mice).

However, there are likely calcium binding proteins that act as intermediaries between the ion and the D2 receptor. Indeed, the intracellular domains of the D2 receptor can bind calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bofill-Cardona et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2007</xref>), NCS-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kabbani et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Pandalaneni et al., 2015</xref>), and S100B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dempsey and Shaw, 2011</xref>) among other potential calcium sensitive proteins. The present results show that while the D2S is more calcium sensitive than D2L, the long variant maintains some calcium sensitivity as evidenced by decreased desensitization when calcium is strongly buffered by the BAPTA internal solution. One explanation is that the calcium sensitivity of the D2 receptor involves multiple sources. Recent imaging of endogenous D2 receptors revealed a clustered and static localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that an array of proteins, potentially including several that are calcium sensitive, forms a complex with D2 receptors modulating their placement and signaling.</p><p>Adaptation in one D2 receptor variant but not the other is relevant to studies in humans that have identified two intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DRD2 gene that cause an increase in D2L expression relative to D2S. These SNPs have been found to be associated with cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moyer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levran et al., 2015</xref>), alcohol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sasabe et al., 2007</xref>), and opioid abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Clarke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Levran et al., 2015</xref>). This has been interpreted mainly as altering the balance between striatal postsynaptic D2 receptor activation (assumed to be D2L) vs. dopamine neuron autoreceptor activation (assumed to be D2S), but our data call into question this hypothesis about the dichotomous function of the D2 receptor splice variants (current results; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Neve et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). However, because dopamine neurons can express either variant, the ratio of D2 autoreceptor variants could very well be important in drug related behaviors. Increased presence of the D2L variant as the autoreceptor would alter the dopamine reward circuitry because this variant desensitizes less (suggesting it is a more efficacious autoreceptor) and does not appear to adapt following a single cocaine exposure. Furthermore, following cocaine exposure desensitization of the D2S variant adapts to resemble the D2L variant. In this assay, preexisting prevalence of the D2L variant would resemble a previous cocaine experience.</p><p>The present results are in some respects at odds with the previous study that used viral D2 receptor variant expression and found no calcium-dependent desensitization of D2L and no cocaine-induced adaptation of either variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>), rather than decreased calcium-dependent desensitization of D2L and selective cocaine-induced adaptation of D2S. A possible explanation is that virally transduced D2 receptors have altered expression levels (often superphysiological) resulting in reduced sensitivity to adaptive mechanisms. It must be noted, however, that we cannot exclude the possibility of developmental abnormalities in mice that are constitutive knockouts of D2S, D2L or both D2 variants. One clear advantage of the D2S- and D2L-KO mice used in this study over viral receptor expression is the maintenance of physiological levels of expression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the current densities in pA/pF (a reliable measure of expression) of D2-GIRK currents from wild type, D2L-KO, and D2S-KO animals. While viral receptor expression is not well controlled and often much higher than physiological levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>), the KO animals were in the same range, or lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>) compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The previously shown trend of GIRK currents having increased amplitude upon strong calcium buffering is clearly present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), however in the D2S-KO genotype, there is no significant difference between current densities in the EGTA and BAPTA groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Additionally, a comparison between D2L-KO and D2S-KO groups reveals an overall significant effect of genotype on current density (F(1, 28)=5.27, p=0.029, two-way ANOVA). This effect is likely not due to differences in GIRK channel expression because GABA<sub>B</sub>-GIRK current density was not different between the groups (in pA/pF D2L-KO EGTA 16.3 ± 2.3, BAPTA 18.2 ± 3.6 vs. D2S-KO EGTA 16.0 ± 0.6, BAPTA 18.8 ± 1.2, p&gt;0.05 two-way ANOVA, data not shown). Because of the similarity of D2S-mediated responses to responses of neurons from wild type mice, despite the presence of mRNA for both subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Khan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>) and the ability of both to activate GIRKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jomphe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Neve et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>), it was speculated that D2L function is in some way occluded under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>). The lower current density for D2L in this study, despite similar levels of expression of the splice variants in these two lines of mice (D. Radl, M. Chiacchiaretta, R. Lewis, K. Brami-Cherrier, L. Arcuri, &amp; E. Borrelli, manuscript in preparation), is consistent with this notion. Alternatively, the lower current density for D2L and lack of calcium-dependent desensitization could both be explained if the D2L receptor were constitutively desensitized.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31924.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Amplitude of D2-GIRK currents.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In wild type mice, there was an overall significant effect of internal solution on D2-GIRK current density (pA/pF, F(1, 30)=76.32, p&lt;0.001).

Mice with either the long or short splice variant of the D2 receptor constitutively knocked out were employed to show that the cocaine-induced decrease in D2 receptor desensitization occurs when D2S is the only variant expressed. This mimics the wild type phenotype and does not occur when only the D2L variant is expressed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals/Key Resources</title><p>All experiments were done in strict accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) at the VA Portland Health Care System (VAPORHCS) and Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sacha Nelson as a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David M Lovinger (Reviewer #1); Louis-Eric Trudeau (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The present manuscript by Robinson and colleagues is a useful and informative extension of the author's previous paper published in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2015. The work takes advantage of mice in which the short or long isoform of the D2 receptor are separately expressed due to selective knockout of one of the two. The authors' main conclusion is that the calcium-dependent desensitization of the D2R and the reduction of such desensitization after cocaine treatment is similar in dopamine neurons expressing only the D2S isoform and in WT mice expressing both isoforms. However, both of these processes are attenuated or absent in dopamine neurons expressing only the D2L. The work is solid and the conclusions sound.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have requested some additional statistical analyses and some textual changes for clarity. The original reviews are included below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The investigators report differences in cocaine-induced alterations in desensitization of the short and long variants of the D2 receptor in neurons of the ventral tegmental area. Mice that lack one or the other receptor variant are used in pharmacological and electrophysiological experiments. This work follows up on a previous study from this group showing differences in calcium-dependent desensitization and in the cocaine effect between the different receptor sub-forms using a viral overexpression technique. The effect of a single in vivo dose of cocaine is clearly lost in mice that express only D2L receptors, and the desensitization is larger under conditions of lower calcium buffering independent of cocaine treatment. Interestingly, cocaine and calcium buffering do not alter desensitization of GABAB receptor effects mediated through the same GIRK channel effector. The data also appear to show that D2-activated GIRK current density is lower in D2L-expressing neurons, and that calcium buffering and cocaine have no influence on this measure in these mice, while stronger buffering increases current density in VTA neurons from mice expressing D2S or a mixed receptor population. The authors also nicely extend their previous findings by using the sub-form knockout mice instead of viral expression which keeps the current densities within a relatively normal range. The scope of the study is very limited, but in general the findings are clear.</p><p>There are only a couple of additional analyses that would further clarify the findings:</p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the authors should determine if the agonist-induced decline in current amplitude differs after cocaine treatment in the BAPTA recording condition. This appears to be the case in the wild type mice (although it did not differ in WT mice in the original paper) but not in the two knockouts, but statistical analysis of these data is needed.</p><p>2) The findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> appear to indicate lower current density when D2L is the only sub-form expressed, especially in the BAPTA condition. A statistical comparison of these current densities across genotypes should be performed. This difference was not observed in the previous study when viral overexpression was used. Is this due to a change in receptor or GIRK density? Does it suggest that D2L receptors are already &quot;pre-desensitized&quot; and thus insensitive to the calcium effect? Also, since the density and calcium-dependent desensitization are both altered with this receptor, it might be good to correlate current density with desensitization across all cells in all genotypes in the EGTA and BAPTA conditions to determine to what extent these variables are related.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The present manuscript by Robinson and colleagues is a useful and informative extension of the author's previous paper published in <italic>eLife</italic> in 2015.

Counter to the previous report (Gantz et al. 2015), they find that D2S, not D2L, undergoes cocaine-dependent alteration. The results are clearer because the D2R's are separated by selective knockout, rather than global D2 knock out and viral restoration, so developmental confounds are reduced, and expression remains physiological, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (showing that there is no impact of cocaine treatment on quinpirole-induced K<sup>+</sup> currents D2-GIRK currents).
