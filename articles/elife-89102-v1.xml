engraved designs on cave walls or other surfaces is recognized as a major cognitive step in human evolution. Such intentional designs, which are widely interpreted as signifying, recording, and transmitting information in a durable manner, were once considered exclusive to Late Pleistocene <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. Here we present observations of what appear to be engraved abstract patterns and shapes within the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system in South Africa, incised into the dolomitic limestone walls of the cave. The markings described here are found on a pillar in the Hill Antechamber that extends into the natural fissure corridor that links the two chambers, and we associate them with <italic>Homo naledi</italic>. They include deeply impressed lines, cross-hatchings, percussion marks, and other geometric shapes on flat wall surfaces and in and around existing cracks and grooves in the dolomitic limestone walls, found in one specific location of the Dinaledi Subsystem. Remains of multiple <italic>H. naledi</italic> are found in this part of the cave system, and evidence of mortuary behavior appears in both the Dinaledi Chamber and adjacent Hill Antechamber dated to between 241 and 335 ka (Dirks et al., 2017; Robbins et al., 2021; Berger et al., 2025).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Homo naledi</italic></kwd><kwd>rock art</kwd><kwd>cognitive evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006363</institution-id><institution>National Geographic Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Rising Star Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Lee R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Rising Star Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Lee R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hawks</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007423</institution-id><institution>Lyda Hill Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Lee R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fulbright Scholar Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawks</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The University of Wisconsin</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hawks</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006734</institution-id><institution>Princeton University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fuentes</surname><given-names>Agustín</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Engraved features found within the Dinaledi Subsystem are interpreted as being made by <italic>Homo naledi</italic> in the absence of evidence of other candidate makers.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rising Star cave system, South Africa, is located within a small promontory situated to the south and east of the course of the Blaaubankspruit stream. The cave system is situated within the dolomitic limestone of the Malmani Subgroup, a Precambrian marine rock bedded with chert bands and containing abundant stromatolite fossils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dirks et al., 2015</xref>). The system includes more than 3 km of mapped passages comprising multiple levels within a west-dipping dolomite horizon. Abundant remains of <italic>Homo naledi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2015</xref>) occur within several localities in the system, including the Dinaledi Subsystem, which lies at a depth of ~30 m below the present surface and ~120 m through the cave system from the nearest present entrance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>). Remains of <italic>H. naledi</italic> have been recovered and excavated from the Dinaledi Chamber, Hill Antechamber, and adjacent spaces and fissures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brophy et al., 2024</xref>). These spaces are challenging to enter and navigate, and exploration of them is ongoing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>On July 28, 2022, during a survey of the Dinaledi Subsystem, we identified what appear to be engraved markings on the southern and northern faces of a natural pillar that forms the entrance and exit of a narrow passage connecting the Hill Antechamber with the Dinaledi Chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The marks include linear features between ~5 and~15 cm in length. Many intersect to form geometric patterns such as squares, triangles, crosses, and X’s, while some are isolated lines. These markings are located on three dolomitic panels on otherwise smooth areas, as well as in and around existing cracks and grooves in the rock. They occur in three areas which we have labeled <italic>A, B,</italic> and C. These markings are in a location where they can be viewed during access into and egress from the Dinaledi Chamber when entering the system from the Hill Antechamber. The Hill Antechamber is the likely point of access by <italic>Homo naledi</italic> to the entire subsystem, and the passage is the natural linkage between the two main chambers of the subsystem (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Elliott et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A photogrammetric map of the Dinaledi Subsystem of the Rising Star cave system, South Africa.</title><p>Orange bars mark the positions of the Engravings panels on the walls of the cave.

The green box outlines the area enlarged and colorized.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89102-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In this article, we describe our observations of Panel A within the passage linking the two main chambers. We provide images of Panels B and C within the Hill Antechamber and offer suggestions of their contextual relationship with Panel A, while recognizing that identifying and examining any and all potential engraved lines within these panels requires further study. We also provide additional contextual data supporting the attribution of these markings to <italic>H. naledi</italic> and discuss the time sequence represented by engraved marks on Panel A. We end by discussing potential implications of our findings for <italic>H. naledi</italic> culture and cognition. The description and initial analyses provided here are intended to document the discovery and provide spatial and contextual information to the scientific and heritage community prior to any further analyses that may require invasive sampling as such may require destructive methods or interacting with the marks directly, and therefore have associated ethical implications that need to be carefully considered before being undertaken (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bednarik, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arthur et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zerboni et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Panel A</title><p>What we term Panel A is found on the southern face of the natural pillar that forms the southern edge of the entry from the Hill Antechamber into the southern of two passages leading to the Dinaledi Chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). The panel is notable as an area of discolored rock that appears to have been smoothed by percussive blows by a hard object, as is evidenced by micro and macro pitting of the surface not found on the adjacent natural rock surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and by the possible application of sand and grit both before and after markings were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>) .</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Engraving Panel A (<bold>A, B</bold>) and Engraving Panel B (<bold>C, D</bold>).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) was taken with a polarizing filter as described in the ‘Methods’.

The lines appear to have been made by repeatedly and carefully passing a pointed or sharp incising tool into existing or new grooves. In addition, there are markings that are best described as scratches that fall outside of identifiable lines and their intersections.

In this number, we include features that appear to be natural lines that have been altered by etching. The most prominent markings on Panel A are a series of intersecting lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">12</xref>). There appears to be a temporal span involved in the creation of the engraved lines as some seem more recently engraved and show clean etching, while others have been obscured either by slight weathering or by the application of sediment. The most easily identifiable engravings, based on their clarity, are lines L2, L6, L9, L11, L16, L17, L27, L30, and L31 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16</xref>). While the existing lines may have been created in older etchings or been created over multiple interactions, the final etchings of the lines based on which lines overlap we interpret as follows: horizontal lines 11 and 25 were created after vertical line 2. Vertical line 6 was created after L11. Vertical line 18 was created after horizontal line 17. Line 30 was created after horizontal line 25, but before horizontal line 31.</p><fig id="fig16" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><title>A conservative map of non-natural engravings observed on Panel A.</title><p>Non-natural engravings are traced in white lines and given yellow number references in the text.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89102-fig16-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Evidence of hominin manufacture of engravings on Panel A</title><p>Dolomite is known for a pattern of natural weathering that results in patterns of recessed linear features on its surface often called ‘elephant skin’ patterning. Natural fissures and erosional features in weathered dolomite surfaces due to chemical weathering processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burger, 1989</xref>) are in our observations characteristically deeper than several millimeters, and they follow natural fracture planes within the rock. Natural erosional features in dolomite may have variable cross-sections, ranging from beveled to U-shaped to rectangular in cross section with rounded or flat bottoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeelani et al., 2018</xref>) and are typically a few millimeters to many centimeters in depth, but do not have multiple parallel striations visible within them which would be characteristic of retouching or engraving. As opposed to natural surface weathering, artificial lines are limited in depth and extent due to the natural hardness of dolomite. This hardness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tabor, 1954</xref>) means that any substantial artificial marking requires multiple parallel incisions with a hard tool. Where artificial engraved markings intersect, they often appear to exhibit an ordering in which one was completed before the other (e.g., see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">15</xref>); this appearance of sequencing is not typical of natural weathering. In previous work, researchers have noted the limited depth of artificial lines, their composition from multiple parallel striations, and their association into a clear arrangement or pattern as evidence of hominin manufacture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodríguez-Vidal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The engraved lines in Panel A diverge in their patterning from the natural ‘elephant skin’ weathering of the surrounding dolomite walls, which can be seen adjacent to the panel within 20 cm of the nearest artificial marks (Figure 18). Our assessment of the features produced by natural weathering in this area is that they are deeper than 10 mm, in particular deep relative to the feature width, maintain a consistency of size and depth across substantially undulating or rugged surfaces, and expand from natural cracks and fissures. In contrast, even the widest of the engraved lines that constitute Panel A have a relatively shallow depth. High-resolution macro-photography shows micro-striations constituting several of these engraved lines, in which roughly parallel incisions sometimes overlap with each other (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">15</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">17</xref>). Many of the lines also fall out of the direction of natural fracture features in the dolomite, although it should be recognized that there are multiple places on this panel where natural lines and features of the rock may have been enhanced or extended by artificial engraving. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figures 13</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">15</xref> show examples of ordering where engraved lines intersect, one having been completed clearly before the other. Some of the elements we describe as engraved lines appear to be artificial extensions or alterations of lines that may originally have resulted from natural weathering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig18">Figure 18</xref>).</p><fig id="fig17" position="float"><label>Figure 17.</label><caption><title>Magnified images of etchings 41 through 46 numbered from left to right.</title><p>Scale in millimeters.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89102-fig17-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig18" position="float"><label>Figure 18.</label><caption><title>Image of dolomite above and right of Panel A.</title><p>The top of the cross-hatched etchings can be seen in the lower left of the image.

The dolomitic bedrock of the Malmani Formation includes fossil stromatolites, which manifest as curving linear banded striations visible in the rock. Panel A includes these layered stromatolitic bands, and all engraved lines that pass below the bottom of line 14 cross over this fossil feature (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15">15</xref>). Where engraved lines cross over this feature, they retain direction, and in some cases, the multiple striations slightly diverge, suggesting that maintaining a linear engraving over this irregular surface may have been challenging. Second, the markings are, in places, covered wholly or partially in sediment or some other substance. This coating does not occur in other areas of the chambers where there are no such engravings. This material (we cannot determine if it is sediment or pigment) may have been used either to create visual contrast on the gray dolomite, to abrade the surface as a form of polish, to enhance or obscure some aspects of the engraved lines, or all of these. This material is present on the surface as a thin layer and is evident within some of the grooves of the lines, indicating its application after some of the marks were made. The appearance of time-ordering between engraved lines and the surface treatment may imply an origin of the engravings in multiple episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, it does not appear this covering, likely sediment, can be explained by geological or other non-organic processes.</p><p>The means of manufacture of engraved lines in this context would have required an implement of equal or greater hardness compared to the native dolomitic limestone. Dolomite rocks of appropriate size and morphology to mark the cave walls have been recovered from surface contexts within the Dinaledi Subsystem, as have many chert fragments. At present, only one possible lithic artifact has been described in direct association with <italic>H. naledi</italic> remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>). This ‘tool-shaped rock’ does resemble tools from other contexts of more recent age in southern Africa, such as a silcrete artifact with linear engraved features on it that was recovered from Blombos Cave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Henshilwood et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19">Figure 19</xref>).</p><fig id="fig19" position="float"><label>Figure 19.</label><caption><title>The tool-shaped artifact described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref> (top) recovered from the Hill Antechamber burial immediately below Panels B and C compared to the artifact from Blombos Cave, South Africa, attributed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Henshilwood, 2009</xref> as having symbolic markings in ochre made by <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> circa 78k years ago.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-89102-fig19-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Panels B and C</title><p>Panels B and C are located on the northern wall within 2 m of the Hill Antechamber burial feature described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>.

Both panels appear to have been prepared in a similar way to Panel A, with possible use of cave sediment applied to the surface, giving the surfaces of these panels an obvious textural difference to adjacent walls of the chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>).

It appears, in softer visible light, that a foreign substance has been applied to part of the panel. As was noted, the purpose of this article is not to describe these complex panels, but to simply note their presence in the Hill Antechamber.

This is the only species that left any evidence of presence in this subsystem until the entry of modern cave explorers. In this discussion, we consider possible objections to this hypothesis and ways in which this hypothesis may be tested in the future. We also suggest some comparisons with the broader record of ancient markings beyond the Rising Star examples.</p><p>One possible objection is that some markings were not produced by hominins. For example, some have suggested that some of the apparent markings are consistent with weathered dolomite, while others may have been produced by non-hominin agents such as carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinón-Torres et al., 2024</xref>). Linear features and other modifications of rock surfaces are sometimes produced by animal claws due to tunneling, climbing, or claw-sharpening, or other behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bednarik, 1991</xref>). Such features have often been observed within caves formed within relatively soft limestone formations, including those in some parts of Europe and southern Australia. Deeply incised claw markings are sometimes seen, which tend to include multiple parallel incisions with a spacing typical of the anatomical spacing between claws. When claw marks are made repeatedly on the same surface, they may cross each other or exhibit complex geometries. However, the susceptibility of a surface to marking by animal claws is determined by the hardness of the material. Animal claws have a hardness of 2–2.5 on Mohs hardness scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rothschild et al., 2013</xref>). Dolomite has a hardness of 3.5–4.5, with Malmani dolomites at the higher end of this scale, much harder than non-dolomitic limestones with hardness of 2–3, which are commonly marked by animal claws. None of the cave systems in the Malmani dolomite have been noted for incised claw markings into dolomite itself of the depth and form seen in the Dinaledi marks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17">Figure 17</xref>), even though clawed species like porcupines, honey badgers, and leopards do use caves and do dig into softer sediments found in the area. The hardness of the rock does not admit scratches by animal claws of this kind; additionally, the specific features of Panel A do not exhibit the kind of spacing or morphology that would be expected for repeated scratching by animal claws, and their position well above the cave floor would not lend itself naturally to scratching in that location. Further, there is no evidence of carnivore presence within the subsystem: no carnivore remains, no evidence of carnivore burrowing activity, no coprolites, and no bones with tooth marks attributable to carnivores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dirks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirks et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Another possible objection is that the engravings may be of comparatively recent origin, potentially made by modern cavers or other <italic>H. sapiens</italic> groups in Holocene or Late Pleistocene times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herries, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petraglia et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martinón-Torres et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pettitt and Wood, 2024</xref>). This idea has two parts: one concerns the idea that other species or populations besides <italic>H. naledi</italic> were active within this subsystem; the other concerns the chronological placement of the markings relative to <italic>H. naledi</italic>. There is no evidence of any hominin activity in the Dinaledi Subsystem other than <italic>H. naledi</italic>. No remains attributable to other prehistoric hominin groups occur in this subsystem or any adjacent areas of the cave system, nor is there any other evidence of activity of such groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dirks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirks et al., 2017</xref>). Human cave explorers entered these areas only within the last 40 years, and the number of modern cavers and archaeologists who have entered the Dinaledi Subsystem is extremely limited (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). There is no evidence of modern cavers altering cave walls in such a manner in the Dinaledi Subsystem, or elsewhere in the Rising Star system, and we have detected no evidence of traces of metallic tools in association with the markings. By contrast, abundant remains of <italic>H. naledi</italic> have been identified within the subsystem, including the Hill Antechamber Feature only 3–4 m away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>). Nevertheless, the nature and composition of the tools that made these engravings are an area that can be tested with future work.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table

rid="bib52">Whitley, 2012</xref>). Successful use of geochronological methods may occur when some or all of the markings were buried within sediment that can be dated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rodríguez-Vidal et al., 2014</xref>), or when markings were later covered in part by mineral formations that can be dated using radiometric methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoffmann et al., 2016</xref>), or when exposure to weathering creates a varnish that can be dated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dorn and Nobbs, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dragovich, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Masson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pillans and Fifield, 2013</xref>). Still, even where geochronological methods are possible, they may provide only a minimum age, which may be thousands of years after the marks were produced. The markings that we have identified within the Dinaledi Subsystem are not overlain by naturally forming sedimentary deposition. Without further excavation of sediments that adjoin cave walls, we cannot say whether additional markings may exist in subsurface contexts. No obvious mineral deposition overlaps the engraved features. Our observations do note that there may be materials added to the surface of the engraved areas, and these may provide an avenue of investigation. The situation as a whole makes it challenging to build alternative lines of evidence about the age of the engravings beyond their spatial proximity to the <italic>H. naledi</italic> evidence from only a few meters away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Thus, at present, the <italic>H. naledi</italic> skeletal material provides the only information about the chronology of hominin activity in this area of the cave system. The maximum age constraint reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirks et al., 2017</xref> on <italic>H. naledi</italic> skeletal material (335 kyr BP) in Dinaledi is the highest 95% confidence limit of a direct ESR-US date on <italic>H. naledi</italic> teeth; while the minimum age constraint (241 kyr BP) is based on U-Th on a flowstone that formed in part around a bone fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dirks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 2021</xref>). These dates provide strong constraints on some <italic>H. naledi</italic> skeletal material from the Dinaledi Subsystem. Geochronological methods do not yet provide similar constraints for <italic>H. naledi</italic> material from other parts of the cave system, including the Lesedi Chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hawks et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we cannot be certain that the constraints of the Dinaledi Subsystem evidence mark the full duration of <italic>H. naledi</italic> cultural activity across the cave system. However, we adopt as a conservative hypothesis that the age of these markings is constrained in the same way as the skeletal remains from the Dinaledi Subsystem, between 335 ka and 241 ka.</p><p>Stylistic criteria are also sometimes used to establish the chronology of cave art, although such comparisons should be accepted cautiously. In this case, the images are not typical of contemporary graffiti made by recent people. They are also not typical of rock art of the last several thousand years in southern Africa. The markings are comparable to other hominin-produced markings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), pigment use, and curation of nonutilitarian objects from the later Middle Pleistocene of southern Africa.

Small pebbles of quartz, chalcedony, and other materials occur within the Wonderwerk sequence and have been interpreted as manuports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaumont and Vogel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beaumont and Bednarik, 2013</xref>), although an alternative hypothesis that they were ostrich gastroliths, potentially introduced by hominins who hunted the birds, may also be possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tryon, 2010</xref>).

None of these examples of hominin-produced markings, pigment use, or other activities have been found near hominin fossil remains.

However, further analytic and comparative work must be conducted to confirm exactly how much similarity and overlap there is between the proposed Dinaledi engravings and the engravings at other Pleistocene sites where such designs have been found.</p><p>The precise location of the engraved markings within the Dinaledi Subsystem may be important to their interpretation. Many artifacts and rock walls from later Pleistocene sites with engraved marks appear to have a nonrandom placement of markings on an object or surface. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Henshilwood and Dubreuil, 2011</xref> have suggested that one should be less focused on the specifics of the designs and rather concentrate on the underlying cause of their creation. Those and other authors have suggested symbolic implications for such engravings, under the assumption that they were made by <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. The broader record of engravings and other forms of meaning-making behavior in a range of hominin species and populations over the latter portions of the Pleistocene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kissel and Fuentes, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dusseldorp and Lombard, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kissel and Fuentes, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuentes et al., 2025</xref>) suggests that such activity, be it ‘symbolic’ or not, was not exclusive to <italic>H. sapiens</italic>. The engravings reported here add to this growing dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>As the main purpose of this work was documentation of the presence of engravings in proximity to the burials, for this study, the etchings and engraving markings were only examined using high-resolution photography and magnification of lines and markings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walderhaug Saetersdal, 2000</xref>). Polarizing filters were also used to enhance relief, and this is indicated when used.</p><p>Cross-polarization was employed for control of specular highlights/reflections in order to limit artifacts when generating the 3D-depth map for photogrammetry purposes. A circular polarizer was used on the camera lens in conjunction with a linear polarizing gel placed over the two speed lights (electronic flash heads) used as the light source. The different minerals/material on the dolomite are reflecting/absorbing the cross-polarized light emphasizing the ‘bright’ striations visible in images.</p><p>Images were shot with a 50 mm (Ppolarizer fitted) at f/11 unless otherwise stated.</p><p>The light source used (twin speed lights with polarized gel attached) was placed as close to the lens axis as possible so that the angles of incidence approximate the reflected angles limiting shadow. This assisted us in building the 3D mesh for photogrammetry purposes. The cross-polarization also removed specular highlights that create artifacts.</p><p>We used Metashape 1.8.1 (Agisoft, Inc) to generate three-dimensional models of Panels A and B based on photographs taken with the parameters reported above. Generation of cross-sections and measurements from these models was performed with MeshLab 2021.20. Resolution of the three-dimensional surface is estimated to be accurate to 0.2 mm.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s6"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are included in the paper.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Permits to conduct research in the Rising Star cave system were provided by the South African National Research Foundation (LRB).

As in a European and much later case they reference ('Neanderthal engraved 'art' from the Pyrenees'), the entangled issues of demonstrable intentionality, persuasive age and likely authorship will generate much debate among the academic community of rock art specialists. The title of the paper and the reference to 'intentional designs', however, leave no room for doubt as to where the authors stand, despite an avoidance of the word art, entering a very disputed terrain. Iain Davidson's (2020) 'Marks, pictures and art: their contributions to revolutions in communication', also referenced here, forms a useful and clearly articulated evolutionary framework for this debate. The key questions are: 'are the markings artefactual or natural?', 'how old are they?' and 'who made them?, questions often intertwined and here, as in the Pyrenees, completely inseparable. I do not think that these questions are definitively answered in this paper and I guess from the language used by the authors (may, might, seem etc) that they do not think so either.</p><p>Before considering the specific arguments of the authors to justify the claims of the title, we should recognise the shift in the academic climate of those concerned with 'ancient markings' that has taken place over the past two or three decades. Before those changes, most specialists would probably have expected all early intentional markings to have been made by <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> after the African diaspora as part of the explosion of innovative behaviours thought to characterise the 'origins of modern humans'. Now, claims for earlier manifestations of such innovations from a wider geographic range are more favourably received, albeit often fiercely challenged as the case for Pyrenean Neanderthal 'art' shows (White et al. 2020). This change in intellectual thinking does not, however, alter the strict requirements for a successful assertion of earlier intentionality by non-sapiens species. We should also note that stone, despite its ubiquity in early human evolutionary contexts, is a recalcitrant material not easily directly dated whether in the form of walling, artefact manufacture or potentially meaningful markings. The stakes are high but the demands no less so.</p><p>Why are the markings not natural? Berger and co-authors seem to find support for the artefactual nature of the markings in their location along a passage connecting chambers in the underground Rising Star Cave system. The presumption is that the hominins passed by the marked panel frequently. I recognise the thinking but the argument is weak. More confidently they note that &quot;In previous work researchers have noted the limited depth of artificial lines, their manufacture from multiple parallel striations, and their association into clear arrangement or pattern as evidence of hominin manufacture (Fernandez-Jalvo et al. 2014)&quot;. The markings in the Rising Star Cave are said to be shallow, made by repeated grooving with a pointed stone tool that has left striations within the grooves, and to form designs that are &quot;geometric expressions&quot; including crosshatching and cruciform shapes. &quot;Composition and ordering&quot; are said to be detectable in the set of grooved markings. Readers of this and their texts will no doubt have various opinions about these matters, mostly related to rather poorly defined or quantified terminology. I reserve judgement, but would draw little comfort from the similarities among equally unconvincing examples of early, especially very early, 'designs'. Two or even three half convincing arguments do not add up to one convincing one.</p><p>The authors draw our attention to one very interesting issue: given the extensive grooving into the dolomite bedrock by sharp stone objects, where are these objects? Only one potential 'lithic artefact' is reported, a &quot;tool-shaped rock [that] does resemble tools from other contexts of more recent age in southern Africa, such as a silcrete tool with abstract ochre designs on it that was recovered from Blombos Cave (Henshilwood et al. 2018)&quot;, also figured by Berger and colleagues. A number of problems derive from this comparison. First, 'tool-shaped rock' is surely a meaningless term: in a modern toolshed 'tool-shaped' would surely need to be refined into 'saw-shaped', 'hammer-shaped' or 'chisel-shaped' to convey meaning? The authors here seem to mean that the Rising Star Cave object is shaped like the Blombos painted stone fragment? But the latter is a painted fragment not a tool and so any formal similarity is surely superficial and offers no support to the 'tool-ness' of the Rising Star Cave object. Does this mean that Homo naledi took (several?) pointed stone tools down the dark passsageways, used them extensively and, whether worn out or still usable, took them all out again when they left? Not impossible, of course. And the lighting?</p><p>The authors rightly note that the circumstance of the markings &quot;makes it challenging to assess whether the engravings are contemporary with the Homo naledi burial evidence from only a few metres away&quot; and more pertinently, whether the hominins did the markings. Despite this honest admission, they are prepared to hypothesise that the hominin marked, without, it seems, any convincing evidence. If archaeologists took juxtaposition to demonstrate authorship, there would be any number of unlikely claims for the authorship of rock paintings or even stone tools. The idea that there were no entries into this Cave system between the Homo naledi individuals and the last two decades is an assertion not an observation and the relationship between hominins and designs no less so. In fact the only 'evidence' for the age of the markings is given by the age of the Homo naledi remains, as no attempt at the, admittedly very difficult, perhaps impossible, task of geochronological assessment, has been made.</p><p>The claims relating to artificiality, age and authorship made here seem entangled, premature and speculative. Whilst there is no evidence to refute them, there isn't convincing evidence to confirm them.</p><p>References:</p><p>Davidson, I. 2020.

My review is brief as the authors state they have made &quot;relatively minimal changes&quot;, so most of the comments I made in 2023 still stand. Some of the language is a little more temperate but the main issues of this potentially landmark study remain and undermine scientific acceptance of the findings claim. The fact that this is an initial report does not excuse it from the normal conventions of building arguments supported by empirical data. Again, the absence of a rock art expert on the authorial team causes recurring weaknesses still to be evident (would one ask a rock art expert to analyse a new fossil hominin skull for example?). Specifically, there are two major issues that need to be resolved before there is necessary and sufficient cause to assign the term 'rock engravings' to the marks in the Dinaledi chamber. These are authorship and dating.</p><p>* Authorship: The assertion that the 'rock engravings' are anthropogenic remains unsupported by empirical evidence, with a number of possible natural factors that could just as likely have caused the marks. Not to use image enhancements - which is standard in most rock art research and has been for some time - is a critical omission. The concerns stated about AI and data standards are not developed and the authors are directed to the literature in this field, for example this 2025 overview - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207424002516">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1296207424002516</ext-link>. Again, having a rock art expert would show the AI concern to be valid but easily addressed using Data Standards. In the almost 2 years since the first pre-print was released, there has been ample time for high resolution photographs and scans of the purported 'rock engravings'; analysis of which by relevant experts could properly physically characterise the marks and thus establish more or less likely agents for their production. European-based researchers in particular has utilised this approach on material such as the Blombos ochre and marked bone from Europe and Africa. None of these methods is invasive or destructive.</p><p>To then go on and link Homo naledi to these markings is premature, especially when this landscape has been home to multiple hominins. Most rock art sites do not contain the physical bodily remains of their makers so we assign authorship based on dating (such as for Neanderthal era art in Europe for example); the second critical issue in this report:</p><p>* Dating: There is no direct or closely associated chronometric dating of the 'rock engravings' or their immediate context, so the age range claimed is unsupported. Rock art dating is notoriously difficult - and why researchers closely scrutinise dates produced. In this case, however, the chronological context is physically so far removed from these rock markings, as to be misleading at best and need to be discounted until a proper programme of dating has commenced. The sources cited for rock art dating tend to be out of date and it would be standard practice to have a geochronologist assess the rock-marked areas and then establish dating protocols.</p><p>Authorship and dating are cornerstone of archaeological/paleoanthropological work and need to established in the first instance. Until that has been done commensurate with current standards in global rock art research this potentially landmark finding cannot be taken as probable, only as possible. This is a pity as the last decade or so has revolutionised our understanding of the socially complex world multiple hominin species lived in, and marked in utilitarian and symbolic ways. The conditions for acceptance of ancient rock art has thus never been better, but the Dinaledi example needs to revisit research first principles around authorship and dating to be included as a credible part of this larger context. It would have been good to see a commitment to a coherent research programme to this end for this case study.</p><p>I hope these observations are useful. As above I keep them short as there has been minimal change to the 2023 ms, and my detailed comments on that remain with the first version of the work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89102.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>Lee R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The National Geographic Society</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Washington DC</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hawks</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin-Madison</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Madison</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fuentes</surname><given-names>Agustín</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Princeton University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Princeton</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Van Rooyen</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Johannesburg</named-content></addr-line><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tsikoane</surname><given-names>Mathabela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Johannesburg</named-content></addr-line><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mpete</surname><given-names>Maropeng</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Johannesburg</named-content></addr-line><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nkwe</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Johannesburg</named-content></addr-line><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Molopyane</surname><given-names>Keneiloe</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of the Witwatersrand</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Johannesburg</named-content></addr-line><country>South Africa</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews:</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their very constructive and helpful comments on the previous version of this manuscript. They have focused on some important issues and have raised many valuable questions that we expect to answer as research begins on these markings. As has been often the case with preprints, a number of experts beyond the four reviewers and editor have provided comments, questions, and suggestions, and we have taken these on board in our revision of the manuscript. In particular, Martinón-Torres et al. (2024) focused several comments upon this manuscript and raise some points that were not considered by the reviewers, and so we discuss those points here in addition to the reviewer comments.</p><p>Some of us have been engaged in other aspects of the possible cultural activities of <italic>Homo naledi</italic>. After the discovery of these markings we considered it indefensible to publish further research on the activity of <italic>H. naledi</italic> within this part of the cave system without making readers aware that the <italic>H. naledi</italic> skeletal remains occur in a spatial context near markings on cave walls. Of course, the presence of markings leaves many questions open. A spatial context does not answer all questions about the temporal context. The situation of the Dinaledi Subsystem does entail some constraints that would not apply to markings within a more open cave or rock wall, and we discuss those in the text.</p><p>We find ourselves in agreement with most of the reviewers on many points. As reflected by several of the reviewers, and most pointedly in the remarks by reviewer 1, the purpose of this preprint is a preliminary report on the observation of the markings in a very distinctive location. This initial report is an essential step to enable further research to move forward. That research requires careful planning due to the difficulty of working within the Dinaledi Subsystem where the markings are located. This pattern of initial publication followed by more detailed study is common with observations of rock art and other markings identified in South Africa and elsewhere. We appreciate that the reviewers have understood the role of this initial study in that process of research.</p><p>Because of this, the revised manuscript represents relatively minimal changes, and all those at the advice of reviewers. Many thanks to all the reviewers for noting various typographic errors, missed references and other issues that we have done our best to fix in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Expertise of authors. Reviewer 4 mentions that the expertise of the authors does not include previous publication history on the identification of rock art, and other reviewers briefly comment that experts in this area would enhance the description. AF does have several publications on ancient engravings and other markings; LRB has geological training and field experience with rock art. Notwithstanding this, we do take on board the advice to include a wider array of subject experts in this research, and this is already underway.</p><p>Image enhancement. We appreciate the suggestions of some reviewers for possible strategies to use software filters to bring out details that may not be obvious even with our cross-polarization lighting and filtering. These are great ideas to try. In this manuscript we thought that going very far into software editing or image enhancement might be perceived by some readers as excessive manipulation, particularly in an age of AI. In future work we will experiment with the suggested approaches.</p><p>Natural weathering. In the process of review and commentary by experts and the public there has been broad acceptance that many of the markings illustrated in this paper are artificial and not a product of natural weathering of the dolomite rock. We deeply appreciate this. At the same time, we accept the comments from reviewers that some markings may be difficult to differentiate from natural weathering, and that some natural features that were elaborated or altered may be among the markings we recognize. On pages 3 and 4 we present a description of the process of natural subaerial weathering of dolomite, which we have rooted in several references as well as our own observations of the natural weathering visible on dolomite cave walls in the Rising Star cave system. This includes other cave walls within the Dinaledi Subsystem. We discuss the “elephant skin” patterning of natural dolomite surface weathering, how that patterning emerges, and how that differs from the markings that are the subject of this manuscript.</p><p>Animal claw marks. Martinón-Torres <italic>et al.</italic> 2024 accept that some of the markings illustrated on Panel A are artificial, but they offer the hypothesis that some of those markings may be consistent with claw marks from carnivores or other mammals. They provide a photo of claw marks within a limestone cave in Europe to illustrate this point. On pages 5 and 6 of the revised manuscript we discuss the hypothesis of claw marks. We discuss the presence of animals in southern Africa that may dig in caves or mark surfaces. However the key aspect of the Malmani dolomite caves is that the hardness of dolomitic limestone rock is much greater than many of the limestone caves in other regions such as Europe and Australia, where claw marks have been noted in rock walls. As we discuss, we have not been able to find evidence of claw marks within the dolomite host bedrock of caves in this region, although carnivores, porcupines, and other animals dig into the soft sediments within and around caves. The form of the markings themselves also counter-indicates the hypothesis that they are claw marks.</p><p>Recent manufacture. One comment that occurs within the reviews and from other readers of the preprint is that recent human visitors to the cave, either in historic or recent prehistoric times, may have made these marks. We discuss this hypothesis on page 6 of the revised manuscript. The simple answer is that no evidence suggests that any human groups were in the Dinaledi Subsystem between the presence of <italic>H. naledi</italic> and the entry of explorers within the last 25 years. The list of all explorers and scientific visitors to have entered this portion of the cave system is presented in a table. We can attest that these people did not make the marks. More generally, such marks have not been known to be made by cavers in other contexts within southern Africa.</p><p>Panels B and C. We have limited the text related to these areas, other than indicating that we have observed them. The analysis of these areas and quantification of artificial lines does not match what we have done for the Panel A area and we leave these for future work.</p><p>Presence of modern humans. We have observed no evidence of modern humans or other hominin populations within the Dinaledi Subsystem, other than <italic>H. naledi</italic>. Several reviewers raise the question of whether the absence of evidence is evidence of absence of modern humans in this area. This is connected by two of the reviewers to the observation that the investigation of other caves in recent years has shown that markings or paintings were sometimes made by different groups over tens of thousands of years, in some cases including both Neanderthals and modern humans. We have decided it is best for us not to attempt to prove a negative. It is simple enough to say that there is no evidence for modern humans in this area, while there is abundant evidence of <italic>H. naledi</italic> there.</p><p>Association with <italic>H. naledi</italic>. Reviewer 2 made an incisive point that the previous version contained some text that appeared contradictory: on the one hand we argued that modern humans were not present in the subsystem due to the absence of evidence of them, yet we accepted that <italic>H. naledi</italic> may have been present for a longer time than currently established by geochronological methods.</p><p>We appreciate this comment because it helped us to think through the way to describe the context and spatial association of these markings and the skeletal remains, and how it may relate to their timeline. Other reviewers also raised similar questions, whether the context by itself demonstrates an association with <italic>H. naledi</italic>. We have revised the text, in particular on pages 5 and 7, to simply state that we accept as the most parsimonious alternative at present the hypothesis that the engravings were made by <italic>H. naledi,</italic> which is the only hominin known to be present in this space.</p><p>Age of <italic>H. naledi</italic> in the system. At one place in the previous manuscript we indicated that we cannot establish that <italic>H. naledi</italic> was only active in the cave system within the constraints of the maximum and minimum ages for the Dinaledi Subsystem skeletal remains (viz., 335 ka – 241 ka), because some localities with skeletal material are undated. We have adjusted this paragraph on page 7 to be clear that we are discussing this only to acknowledge uncertainty about the full range of <italic>H. naledi</italic> use of the cave system.</p><p>Geochronological methods. Several reviewers discuss the issue of geochronology as applied to these markings. This is an area of future investigation for us after the publication of this initial report. As some reviewers note, the prospects for successful placement of these engraved features and other markings with geochronological methods depends on factors that we cannot predict without very high-resolution investigation of the surfaces. We have included greater discussion of the challenges of geochronological placement of engravings on page 6, including more references to previous work on this topic. We also briefly note the ethical problems that may arise as we go further with potentially invasive, destructive or contact studies of these engravings, which must be carefully considered by not just us, but the entire academy.</p><p>Title. Some reviewers suggested that the title should be rephrased because this paper does not use chronological methods to derive date constraints for the markings. We have rephrased the title to reflect less certainty while hopefully retaining the clear hypothesis discussed in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
