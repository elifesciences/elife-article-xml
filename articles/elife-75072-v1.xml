However, knockdown of IL-33 increased LPS-induced calcium concentration, ER stress and phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38 MAPK). In addition, siRNA IL-33 further stimulates LPS enhanced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression via NF-κB and p38 pathways. IL-33 expression was decreased in the nucleus with the onset of labor. LPS-induced ER stress and increased expression of the labor-associated gene, COX-2, as well as IL-6 and IL-8 in cultured myometrial cells. IL-33 also increased COX-2 expression, but after it was knocked down, the stimulating effect of LPS on calcium was enhanced. 4μ8C also inhibited the expression of COX-2 markedly. The expression of calcium channels on the membrane and intracellular free calcium ion were both increased which was accompanied by phosphorylated NF-κB and p38.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>These data suggest that IL-33 may be involved in the initiation of labor by leading to stress of the ER via an influx of calcium ions in human uterine smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81300507).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>preterm labor</kwd><kwd>myometrium</kwd><kwd>interleukin-33</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>calcium channels</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81300507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement> </funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IL-33 plays an important role in the initiation of labor by leading to stress of the ER via an influx of calcium ions in human uterine smooth muscle cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preterm delivery occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and is one of the major causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The main difference between preterm labor (PTL) and term labor (TL) is when the initiation of labor begins. It is widely accepted that infection, uterine over-distension, decline in progesterone action, breakdown of maternal–fetal tolerance, stress, and other unknown reasons are involved in PTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Romero et al., 2014</xref>). However, all of these reasons lead to inflammatory events. These are mainly due to the identification of microorganisms and their products, and increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the decidua and myometrium, which enable leukocytes to infiltrate the uterus leading to its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lamont, 2015</xref>).</p><p>As a member of IL-1 family, IL-1β is one of the well-recognized inflammatory factors that induce the initiation of labor. Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is another member of the IL-1 family and it is expressed in a variety of cells, including innate immune (macrophage and dendritic), Th2, B, epithelial, endothelial, and muscle cells. Also, it has been shown to have a key role in various diseases, including inflammation-associated autoimmune (including asthma), cardiovascular, and allergic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cayrol and Girard, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drake and Kita, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2017</xref> found that after exogenous administration of IL-33, it was able to activate B cell-mediated immune regulation and promote the expression of progesterone-induced blocking factor 1 (PIBF1), which plays an essential role in safeguarding against PTL. Preliminary data showed that IL-33 was mainly located in the nuclei of myometrial cells, and with the onset of labor, IL-33 expression in the nucleus decreased. Studies also showed that mast cells responded to the secretion of IL-33 after exposure to the allergens and this affected airway smooth muscle hyper-responsiveness by promoting the contraction and enhancing calcium influx of airway smooth muscle, leading asthma attacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bønnelykke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, IL-33 was found to be effective in alleviating the myocardial endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response caused by myocardial injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Theoharides et al., 2010</xref>). These studies suggested a potential role of IL-33 in human parturition and prompted us to investigate the changes in IL-33 expression in the nuclei of the myometrium during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Specimen collection</title><p>Patients were separated into four groups: (1) TL: samples were obtained from women who had the presence of contractions of sufficient strength and frequency to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix and were between 37 and 41 + 6 weeks’ gestation; (2) PTL: samples were obtained from women who had the presence of contractions of sufficient strength and frequency to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix and were between 28 and 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation; (3) term nonlabor (TNL): these samples were obtained from women who were between 37 and 41 + 6 weeks’ gestation without any signs of onset of labor; (4) preterm nonlabor (PNL): these samples were obtained from women who were between 28 and 36 + 6 weeks’ gestation without any sign of onset of labor.</p><p>When undergoing cesarean section, a sample of the uterine smooth muscle (1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 cm<sup>3</sup>) was cut from the site of incision at the lower and upper edges of the uterus.

There were similar levels of staining in the two no labor groups as well as the two labor groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Western blotting analysis revealed that there was no difference in the expression of total IL-33 among all groups. To confirm the nuclear localization of the IL-33, we separated the cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction of myometrial cells. There were decreased levels of nuclear IL-33 from the TNL to the TL groups, which was consistent with the change seem from PNL to PTL. The results of qPCR suggested that mRNA expression of total IL-33 was not different between the different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Treatment with LPS resulted in a time-dependent nuclear IL-33 decrease</title><p>To examine the function and the mechanisms of nuclear IL-33 during parturition, myometrial cells were incubated with LPS and the kinetic changes of IL-33 were visualized by confocal microscopy.

The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of primary myometrial cells were also isolated at different time points after LPS treatment. Western blot analysis showed that nuclear IL-33 reduced with the stimulation by LPS. However, the levels peaked again in the nucli at 12 hr, and were higher than seen in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Our current understanding of this process is that as the myometrium switches from a quiescent to a contractile state, it also undergoes a shift in signaling from anti-inflammatory to proinflammatory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hadley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shynlova et al., 2020</xref>). As an inflammatory factor, IL-33 has many similar effects to IL-1β. IL-33 is composed of a N-terminal nuclear domain and a C-terminal IL-1-like cytokine domain which is mainly localized in the nucleus and binds to histones and chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin and Martin, 2016</xref>). We proposed that IL-33 plays a dual role, playing a proinflammatory role as an inflammatory cytokine outside the cell as well as participating in the regulation of transcription as a nuclear factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carriere et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that IL-33 had an essential role in pregnancy-related diseases such as recurrent abortion and preeclampsia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fock et al., 2013</xref>). In early pregnancy, IL-33 can increase the proliferation and invasion of the decidua, and decidual macrophage-derived IL-33 is a key factor for placental growth, and its deletion can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sheng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hu et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, IL-33 expression is reduced in the placenta of preeclamptic patients, which is a condition that affects placental function by reducing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of trophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spaans et al., 2014</xref>). In preliminary experiments, we found that IL-33 was expressed in the nuclei of myometrial cells in the third trimester of pregnancy and the levels decrease following the onset of the labor. This was consistent with previous studies which showed that IL-33, a mucosal alarmin, was being sequestered in the nucleus in order to limit its proinflammatory potential. It was released as a warning signal when tissues were damaged following stress or infection such as its release from the nucleus during asthma attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pelletier and Savignac, 2018</xref>). However, IL-33 is mainly located in the nucleus of human myometrial tissue at the last trimester of pregnancy, but its functions remained unclear. Meanwhile, it was reported that IL-33 is a dual-function protein that might act both as a cytokine and as an intracellular nuclear factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gautier et al., 2016</xref>). In the following experiments, we explored the role(s) of the nuclear localization of IL-33.</p><p>In order to identify factors that are important in driving PTL progression, we utilized LPS to stimulate primary cultures of uterine smooth muscle cells to mimic inflammation during labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sheller-Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kent et al., 2022</xref>). This resulted in a rapid decrease of IL-33 in the nucleus after LPS treatment which was ameliorated after the stimulus duration was lengthened. It is known that labor is a physiological process and will not cause a maternal pathological state, so we hypothesized that the recruitment of IL-33 may be to maintain cell homeostasis and enable its normal function. For exploring the potential effect of nuclear IL-33 during labor, we knocked down IL-33 in primary myometrial cells before LPS stimulation. Initially, we found that after introduction of siRNA IL-33, the intracellular calcium ion levels and the expression of T-type calcium channel proteins (Cav3.1 and Cav3.2) on the membrane, increased sharply. This was consistent with other studies which showed that IL-33 can affect calcium elevation autonomously or it can cooperate with other mediators to achieve this effect, although the specific mechanism is still unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, we tried to explain how IL-33 affected calcium ion levels, directly or via other subcellular organelles that regulated local calcium concentrations.</p><p>Myometrial contractions are mainly regulated by intracellular Ca<sup>2 +</sup> levels and calmodulin and the effect of IL-33 on calcium elevation is likely to be a direct effect upon myometrial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wray and Prendergast, 2019</xref>). However, we found that reduced levels of IL-33 in the nucleus promoted the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 in myometrial cells, while the expression of proinflammatory cytokines was reduced after Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in the cytoplasm. This led us to conclude that IL-33 may play a certain role in the process of parturition. Intracellular calcium was closely linked to the ER stress response. It is well documented that when tissues and cells are irretrievably stimulated or damaged, an ER stress response occurs to maintain cell homeostasis. The ER, which is the main intracellular calcium storage chamber, plays a vital impact on maintaining Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in various organelles, and homeostasis of the ER is closely related to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almanza et al., 2019</xref>). So far, we attempted to show that IL-33 is involved in onset of labor via ER stress which subsequently stimulates the release of calcium in the ER, thus leading the changes of in intracellular calcium concentrations and cell membrane calcium channels.</p><p>Researchers recently found that LPS stimulation of uterine explants could cause an ER stress response in uterine muscle. This led them to hypothesized that dysregulation of ER homeostasis in uterine smooth muscle might be one of the mechanisms of LPS-induced inflammatory preterm delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guzel et al., 2017</xref>). When compared with nonlaboring specimens, the levels of GRP78, IRE1, and XBP1s in fetal membranes and myometrium were elevated in both TL and PTL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liong and Lappas, 2014</xref>). Consistently, the expression of the ER stress response in the uterine smooth muscle was increased during labor when compared to nonlabor tissues. Here, we found that, although there was no obvious change in GRP78, and knockdown of IL-33 further increased LPS-induced expression of IRE1α and XBP1s, significantly. As a chaperone protein in the ER, GRP78 binds to three prominent ER stress proteins under steady-state conditions. These are PERK and ATF6, which are related to redox reaction and the Golgi apparatus, respectively. An additional protein, IRE1α, is also involved and it is related to inflammatory signals and the repair of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ron and Walter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oakes and Papa, 2015</xref>). During the adaptive phase of the ER stress response, the IRE1α–XBP1s pathway is activated. In the near future, we would like to confirm whether Ca Release Activated Ca (CRAC) is involved in ER stress response in order to maintain myometrial cell calcium homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To explore the potential mechanism of how IL-33 is involved in the process of labor, we transfected siRNA IL-33 into primary myometrial cells, and the decrease in nuclear IL-33 prompted the increase of COX-2 expression after LPS stimulation. Meanwhile, the stimulating effect of LPS on COX-2 which could be blocked by calcium chelating agents was more obvious. Furthermore, we explored whether the modest ER stress response seen relates to the process of labor. We found that the expression of COX-2 was sharply decreased by loading the primary cells with an ER stress response blocker which is similar with research results seen with modulation of pain by leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chopra et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on the above findings, we speculated that IL-33 could influence LPS induced COX-2 expression via two pathways: (1) it directly prevents excessive COX-2 expression in myometrial cells after LPS stimulation and (2) it influences COX-2 expression by maintaining the severity of ER stress response. In addition, we also speculate that IL-33 may affect the myometrial cells calcium homeostasis via ER calcium-level regulation. The binding of IL-33 to NF-κB in the nucleus could block NF-κB signaling and inhibit the transduction of downstream associated inflammatory signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griesenauer and Paczesny, 2017</xref>). Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2011</xref>), phosphorylation of NF-κB following LPS treatment was increased after IL-33 knockdown in myometrial cells. Also, we found that a change of the p38/MAPK signaling pathway was consistent with that of the NF-κB signaling pathway. In addition, selective blocking of NF-κB and p38/MAPK signaling pathways significantly inhibited the LPS-induced COX-2 expression. Therefore, we hypothesized that NF-κB and p38/MAPK signaling pathways may be the potential downstream pathways of IL-33 affecting LPS-induced COX-2 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Diagrammatic model for the role of interleukin-33 (IL-33) in the myometrium where it participates in maintaining a uterine quiescent state at the tissue-to-cellular level during late pregnancy.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75072-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To summarize, we found that the nuclear factor, IL-33, can affect contraction of uterine smooth muscle cells so as to participate in parturition by regulating levels of intracellular calcium ions and thus influencing the ER stress. Our study demonstrates that nuclear IL-33 in the myometrium participates in maintaining a uterine quiescent state at the tissue-to-cellular level during late pregnancy. Further studies will be focused on underlying mechanism(s) whereby of nuclear IL-33 maintains myometrial calcium homeostasis via ER stress.</p><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All the patients signed an informed consent form.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The dialog between all the reviewers 1,2 and 3 emerges with a consensus that the paper addresses an interesting an important topic bearing on the initiation of labor at the end of pregnancy, invoking interleukin-33 in an alteration of ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in uterine smooth muscle. However, they point out aspects in which the evidence falls short of the conclusion you wish to draw. Nevertheless consultation between editors lead us to wish to give you an opportunity to make major revisions that involve additional experiments for a revised version, which we list below. In the latter connection, the list of essential revisions below refer both to the additional evidence required, as well as refer to the list of corrections under the headings of 'recommendations for the authors' to assist such a revision. We do this with the expectation that these are feasible within a 6 month period.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) In addition to the changes requested in the notes below, reviewer 2 flags that the conclusions drawn here would require a good amount of additional work to fully support.</p><p>(2) Reviewer 3 makes parallel criticisms, considering that much stronger data is needed to make a strong case worthy of consideration for publication to <italic>eLife</italic>, particularly of IL33 function in the rodent model of LPS-induced preterm labour.LPS as a TLR4 activator will drive expression of multiple cytokines some via NFkB and also other pro-contractile molecules. Thus both reviewers felt the characterisation of the responses and role of IL33 inadequate to make a strong case for this cytokine.</p><p>(3) Reviewer 2 under &quot;recommendations for the authors&quot; make comments that require addressing concerning the data in its present form that require addressing.</p><p>(4) Reviewer 3 also refers to a need of studies on primary tissues (not cells which tend to lose their contractile phenotype once cultured) to back up their claim that this is an important molecule involved in the onset of labour.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Matters of clarity.</p><p>(1) Abbreviations need to be defined with their use in the abstract.</p><p>(2) Make more explicit the experimental groups:</p><p>a) term labor (TL)</p><p>b) preterm labor (PTL)</p><p>c) nonlabor (TNL)</p><p>d) nonlabor (PNL)</p><p>(3) The relationship between the LPS, the silencing and the ER stress experiments needs to be made more explicit, as at present the paper appears disjointed, with the reader tending to lose the plot.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1 legend line 110 to say QRTPCR rather than QTPCR.</p><p>– Nuclear cytosolic protein westerns should show any presence of cross contamination. Thus, any β actin contamination in nuclear fraction should be shown as well as lamin B contamination in cytosolic fraction.</p><p>– In general, Figure legends need details of statistics used.</p><p>– Different LPS serotypes was shown to activate different inflammatory pathways. Please clarify which serotype was used.</p><p>– Calcium response for contractions is often a quick cyclic response. Would be interesting to see the timepoints shorter than 6h? potentially measuring calcium response real time using fluo4AM would be informative in linking to uterine contractions. Can IL-33 induce calcium response alone?</p><p>– Control should be included in all IL-33 siRNA experiments to demonstrate successful knockdown of IL-33.</p><p>– Figure 4B shows LPS increasing p-IRE1alpha and XBP1s at 6h but this is not shown in Figure 5C during a timecourse experiment (only XBP1s increased). Can you explain what causes this difference?</p><p>– NL vs L for ER stress markers. Protein difference is apparent but not mRNA.

However, siRNA IL-33 effect on calcium levels was not shown (what was shown was siRNA IL33 effect on LPS-induced calcium response) only that of calcium channel proteins.</p><p>– Discussion line 321-324, authors state that they found that reduced IL-33 in the nucleus promoted the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-6 in myometrial cells, while the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was reduced after ca<sup>2+</sup> binding in the cytoplasm. The data presented only shows that IL33 knockdown alone induced release of IL-8 not IL-6. It enhanced release of LPS-induced IL-8 and IL-6, and calcium chelation was able to reduce LPS-effect, not that of IL-33.</p><p>– Discussion line 338-340, authors state that knock down of IL-33 increased the expression of IRE1α and XBP1s significantly. It should be clarified that knockdown of IL33 enhanced LPS-induced expression of IRE1alpha and XBP1s, not IL33 alone.</p><p>– Discussion line 352-353, 357-358, authors state that IL-33 influenced COX-2 expression by maintaining the severity of ER stress response.

Further studies on whether IL-33 is involved in the redox reaction of mitochondria as well as regulation of intracellular calcium ions caused by ER stress are necessary. The study indicates low levels of IL-33 can enhance LPS/infection-induced inflammation during late pregnancy. As no experiments were done using over-expression of IL-33, it does not necessarily demonstrate that IL-33 maintains uterine quiescence.</p><p>– Authors should also indicate gestational age window for myometrial samples for all groups.</p><p>– Methods line 457 subscript bracket to be edited.</p><p>– The siRNA concentrations used should be added to methods, and clarify appropriate vehicle controls were used for BAPTA-AM and 4μ8C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As mentioned previously, the manuscript would be of some interest to cell biologists examining pathways of myometrial contractility but has very limited, if any, translational potential.</p><p>The authors need to strengthen the conceptual aspect of myometrial IL33 in relation to other inflammatory mediators and also carry out extensive studies on primary tissues (not cells which tend to lose their contractile phenotype once cultured) to back up their claim that this is an important molecule involved in the onset of labour.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75072.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Matters of clarity.</p><p>(1) Abbreviations need to be defined with their use in the abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We have defined all of the abbreviations in the abstract in revised manuscript as the Reviewer suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Make more explicit the experimental groups:</p><p>a) term labor (TL)</p></disp-quote><p>a) Term labor (TL): samples were obtained from women who had the presence of contractions of sufficient strength and frequency to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix and were between 37 and 41+6 weeks' gestation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) preterm labor (PTL)</p></disp-quote><p>b) Preterm labor (PTL): samples were obtained from women who had the presence of contractions of sufficient strength and frequency to effect progressive effacement and dilation of the cervix and were between 28 and 36+6 weeks' gestation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) nonlabor (TNL)</p></disp-quote><p>c) Term non-labor (TNL): These samples were obtained from women who were between 37 and 41+6 weeks' gestation without any signs of onset of labor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) nonlabor (PNL)</p></disp-quote><p>d) preterm nonlabor (PNL): These samples were obtained from women who were between 28 and 36+6 weeks' gestation without any sign of onset of labor.</p><p>These were defined in the Materials and methods in revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The relationship between the LPS, the silencing and the ER stress experiments needs to be made more explicit, as at present the paper appears disjointed, with the reader tending to lose the plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the relationship between LPS and siRNA IL-33 and ER stress in the discussion of the revised manuscript as the Reviewer suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Figure 1 legend line 110 to say QRTPCR rather than QTPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this as the Reviewer suggests.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Nuclear cytosolic protein westerns should show any presence of cross contamination.
