arrangement. However, most epigenetic studies describe locations of methylation marks, chromatin accessibility regions, and histone modifications in the horizontal dimension. Proper spatial epigenomic information has rarely been obtained. In this study, we designed spatial chromatin accessibility sequencing (SCA-seq) to resolve the genome conformation by capturing the epigenetic information in single-molecular resolution while simultaneously resolving the genome conformation. Using SCA-seq, we are able to examine the spatial interaction of chromatin accessibility (e.g. enhancer–promoter contacts), CpG island methylation, and spatial insulating functions of the CCCTC-binding factor. We demonstrate that SCA-seq paves the way to explore the mechanism of epigenetic interactions and extends our knowledge in 3D packaging of DNA in the nucleus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>3D genome</kwd><kwd>pore-C</kwd><kwd>Hi-C</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>GpC methyltransferase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015805</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant number</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100015805</institution-id><institution>Shenzhen Municipal Science and Technology Innovation Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JSGG20170824152728492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guo</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SCA-seq enables simultaneous detection of spatial interactions, chromatin accessibility, and CpG methylation at single-molecule resolution, advancing multi-omics studies of genome spatial organization.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The linear arrangement of DNA sequences usually gives an illusion of a one-dimensional genome. However, the DNA helix is folded hierarchically into several layers of higher-order structures that undergo complex spatial biological regulation. The link between gene transcription activity and genome structure was established following an observation that active gene expression occurs in the decondensed euchromatin, and silenced genes are localized in the condensed heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). Accessibility of chromatin acts as a potent gene expression regulatory mechanism by controlling the access of regulatory factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>). Although this model is attractive, it is simplifies the concept of genome accessibility by considering it solely in the horizontal dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Misteli, 2007</xref>). In reality, the genome is organized into a three-dimensional structure within cells, resulting in similar spatial complexities in the accessibility of genome regions. For example, the accessibility of promoter region could be regulated by the interactions with enhancers or silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kolovos et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is imperative to employ sophisticated tools that can provide insights into genome accessibility in relation to the organization of the genome, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between chromatin activation and genome interactions.</p><p>Most of the tools designed to study chromatin accessibility in the linear form are based on the vulnerability of open/decondensed chromatin to treatment with enzymes such as DNase, micrococcal nuclease (MNase), and transposase. In a pioneer study, Crawford lab used DNase-seq to establish the relationship between DNase-hypersensitive regions and open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song and Crawford, 2010</xref>). MNase-seq is based on a similar concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henikoff et al., 2011</xref>). Subsequent studies simplified experiments on chromatin accessibility by taking advantage of the ability of mutant transposase to insert sequencing adapters into open chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>). All these methods rely on statistical calculations of chromatin domain accessibility based on the frequency of enzyme-dependent tags on the accessible genome. Chromatin accessibility has been studied at a single-molecule resolution in recent years to provide insights about chromatin heterogeneity in vivo. Approaches such as methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), single-molecule adenine methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdulhay et al., 2020</xref>), nanopore sequencing of nucleosome occupancy and methylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), single-molecule long-read accessible chromatin mapping sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>), and Fiber-seq <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stergachis et al., 2020</xref> have been developed for this purpose. Generally, decondensed genomes were methylated using methyltransferases and directly sequenced using third-generation sequencing platforms (Nanopore, PacBio). These advanced methods offered a single-molecule view of the two-dimensional 2–15 kb long chromatin structures.</p><p>However, it is important to note that chromatin exhibits a higher-order organization, and relying solely on a horizontal dimensional map of chromatin accessibility may not fully capture the complexity of its spatial arrangement. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) techniques, for example, Hi-C, SPRITE, CHIAPET, and pore-C, have been widely used to map genome-wide chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quinodoz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshpande et al., 2022</xref>). Most of these techniques do not allow obtaining epigenome information in the process or examining chromatin conformation with multi-omics. Some advanced approaches, such as Trac-looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2018</xref>), OCEAN-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>), and HiCAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), can capture open chromatin and chromatin conformation information simultaneously by enrichment of accessible chromatin regions through solubility or transposons. These advanced approaches were originally developed to enrich the accessible chromatin and efficiently observe the interactions of cis-regulatory elements. The loss of the condensed chromatin regions and methylation marks restricted the possibility of observing the full-scale genome architecture with multi-omics. Therefore, reconstructing DNA organization with multi-omics information could promote further understanding of the interactive regulation of transcription and enable more detailed studies of DNA interactions.</p><p>Here, we developed a novel tool, spatial chromatin accessibility sequencing (SCA-seq), based on methylation labeling and proximity ligation. The long-range fragments carrying the chromatin accessibility, CpG methylation, and chromatin conformation information were sequenced using nanopore technology. We mapped chromatin accessibility and CpG methylation to genome spatial contacts at single-molecule resolution. Our findings revealed the presence of heterogeneous chromatin accessibility in spatial interactions, suggesting complex genome regulation. We believe that SCA-seq may facilitate multi-omics studies of genome spatial organization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Principle of SCA-seq</title><p>Recently, there has been an increasing interest in applying methylation labeling and nanopore sequencing for the analysis of chromatin accessibility at a single-molecule level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdulhay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2021</xref>). In this study, we have used SCA-seq to study chromatin spatial density to resolve the genome organization and chromatin accessibility simultaneously. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,1</xref>) After cell fixation, we used a methyltransferase enzyme (EcoGII or M.CviPI) to artificially mark accessible chromatin regions. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,2-3</xref> ) After the chromatin accessibility information was preserved as m6A or GpC methylation marks, we conducted digestion and ligation steps using chromatin conformation capturing protocols, relying on proximity ligation to ligate together multiple linearly distant DNA fragments that are close to each other in the three-dimensional space. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,4</xref>) Next, we performed optimized DNA extraction to obtain pure and large DNA fragments. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,5</xref>) The DNA fragments that carried chromatin accessibility information, methylation marks, and three-dimensional conformation information were sequenced using the nanopore method and analyzed in our house pipeline from concatemer alignment to single-molecule methylation calling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). The conventional next-generation sequencing-based chromatin conformation protocols only captured the interaction between two genomic loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Unlike the conventional protocol, the proximity ligation in SCA-seq, not limited to the first-order ligation, can occur multiple times in one concatemer (genome fragments fixed together as a cluster), informing about the high cardinality of the genome conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>). Compared with the output of the comparable techniques Trac-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lai et al., 2018</xref>), Hi-CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wei et al., 2020</xref>), and NicE-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luo et al., 2022</xref>), which also capture the accessible chromatin conformation, the SCA-seq preserved more multi-omics information, for example, CpG methylation epigenetic marks, chromatin inaccessibility, and high-order chromatin conformation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Principle of SCA-seq.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) (1) After fixation, chromatin accessibility can be inferred from the extent of artificial methylation by methyltransferase (m6A or GpC, rare in native genomes). (2–4) Restriction enzymes to digest the labeled genome are selected. The interacted segments (&gt;2) stay as a cluster of fragments (concatemer) due to fixation. Next, the spatially interacted segments in one concatemer are proximally ligated, along with the formation of chimeric long fragments. (5) These long chimeric fragments are sequenced using the Nanopore technology. The data-trained Nanopolish model helps calling the labeled artificial methylation marks (GpC or m6A), which reflect the regional chromatin accessibility and native CpG on the chimeric reads. Our algorithm analyzes the composition of the chimeric reads, indicating genome locations of these composed segments. Moreover, SCA-seq can simultaneously capture chromatin accessibility and native methylation information of these segments.

Methyltransferase EcoGII transferred the methyl group to the 6′-carbon of adenosine (m6A modification). Due to the high density of adenosines in the genome (~25%), the abundant artificial m6A modification may impair restriction enzyme activity. We used EcoGII to treat the HEK293T genomic DNA (m6A<sup>+</sup>), whereas control DNA was left untreated (m6a<sup>−</sup>). We tested HindIII, DpnI (<bold>a</bold>), PstI and NdeI (<bold>b</bold>) on the methylated and unmethylated genomic DNAs, and all these restriction enzymes were inhibited by the abundant m6A modifications. DpnI is an m6A-dependent restriction enzyme that digests only genomic loci with the m6A modification. NA indicates the genomic DNA control. In a similar way, we tested the activities of HindIII (<bold>c</bold>) for lambda DNA; DpnII, and NIaIII (<bold>d</bold>) for HEK293T genomic DNA on the GpC methylated DNA preparations that were treated by methyltransferase M.CviPI.

In the methylation reactions, the most suitable methyltransferases, EcoGII and M.CviPI, generated the artificial modifications m6A and m5C (GpC), which are rarely present in the native mammalian genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McClelland and Ivarie, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">O’Brown et al., 2019</xref>). Our previous research showed that EcoGII effectively labels accessible chromatin owing to the high density of adenine in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>). However, when EcoGII was used, the high-density labeled m6A modification either blocked or impaired the activity of the majority of restriction enzymes and produced long-digested fragments, leading to lower chromatin conformation resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). We also tried digestion with multiple enzymes, as in Hi-C 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>), and slightly decreased the fragment length. To solve this problem, we selected the m6A-dependent restriction enzyme DpnI that preferentially digests highly methylated DNA containing methylated adenine and leaves blunt ends. However, such m6A-dependent digestion of the highly methylated accessible chromatin was biased, and the blunt ends were not ligated efficiently. We then tried another approach and used M.CviPI that methylates GpCs (m5C) on the accessible chromatin, and these marks occur four times less frequently than adenosine. In the following steps, DpnII and other enzymes (without GC pattern in the recognition sites) efficiently cut DNA molecules with both methylated and unmethylated GpCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>), followed by ligation. It should be noted that the m5C base-calling algorithm has been gradually improved and is now widely used in nanopore sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Considering the unbiased digestion, M.CviPI might be a better choice in SCA-seq than EcoGII/DpnI. Next, we analyzed the sequencing data and compared them with those obtained using previous technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SCA-seq has the comparable ability to identify chromatin accessibility and native methylation marks</title><p>Our work was inspired by the concepts of nanoNOME-seq, SMAC-seq, and Fiber-seq methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abdulhay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2021</xref>), which use either M.CviPI or EcoGII methyltransferases to label chromatin-accessible regions with methylation sites. Our previous experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) and validations of the results against published data confirmed the effectiveness of the methyltransferase-mediated labeling, showing technological advantages of the complex genome alignment and single-molecule resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weng et al., 2021</xref>). As the SCA-seq generated discontinuous genomic segments by ligating fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which might affect data processing, we first validated the accuracy of methylation calling and methyltransferase labeling in SCA-seq.</p><p>First, we performed the initial quality control of the sequencing data for HEK293 cells by validating the methylation calling. We generated 129.94 Gb (36.9× coverage) of mapped sequencing data with an N50 read length of 4446 bp. To obtain the methylation information from the nanopore data, we adopted well-established methylation caller Nanopolish with the cpggpc calling module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>) and achieve considerable success (AUC [Area under the ROC Curve] CpG = 0.908, GpC = 0.984). In the further validation of methylation calling, we parallelly performed the gold standard whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). The results of the WGBS analysis were highly correlated with those of Nanopolish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), supporting the accuracy of the methylation caller. In addition to the methylation calling accuracy, there might also be some ambiguity between the native and artificially labeled cytidine methylations. We first checked the native or false positive GpC regions, which were also very rare and accounted for only 1.8% in the unlabeled genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). GpC ratio of the M.CviPI-treated genomes was significantly higher than the background GpC ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>, &gt;10-fold change, &lt;2.6 × 10<sup>−16</sup>, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test). Second, the GCG pattern in the genome might also cause the ambiguity of native methylation CpG or accessibility representing GpC; therefore, we excluded both CpG and GpC methylations from the GCG context (5.6% of GpCs and 24.2% of CpGs) to obtain unbiased methylation information. The excluded GCGs did not significantly affect most of the biological methylation analysis, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). In conclusion, our bioinformatic pipeline was able to detect native CpG methylations and artificially labeled GpC methylations.</p><p>We next assessed the potential of SCA-seq to reveal simultaneously endogenous methylation and chromatin accessibility. As the ATAC-seq and DNase-seq are gold standards for detecting chromatin accessibility, we compared the labeling accuracy of SCA-seq with that of ATAC-seq/DNase-seq globally and locally. Of the 87,991 accessibility peaks called from the SCA-seq data in the whole genome, 80% overlapped with peaks observed in ATAC-seq or DNase-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In the evaluation of SCA-seq 1D peak sensitivity and specificity, we considered the non-peak region genomic bins shared by ATAC-seq and DNase-seq as true negatives, and the overlapping peaks of ATAC-seq and DNase-seq as true positives. The obtained results showed a peak sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.91 for SCA-seq. These results were comparable to those of a previous study, in which methyltransferase labeling was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The ATAC-seq/DNase-seq unique peaks were less frequent, as indicated by the larger p-value calculated by MACS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). On the other hand, the sequencing depth could improve the sensitivity of SCA-seq to identify the less frequent peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d, e</xref>). Previous publications also suggested that the difference between the outputs of the Nanopore-based and next-generation sequencing-based methods might be explained by sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shipony et al., 2020</xref>). In the local comparison, SCA-seq also showed peak patterns around the ATAC-seq-identified peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Moreover, we computationally predicted binding sites of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), which usually associates with open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). As expected, the native CpG methylation level decreased, whereas GpC accessibility increased around the CTCF-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). At active human transcription start sites (TSSs) with high expression, ‘open’ chromatin regions hypersensitive to transposon attack were observed in ATAC-seq/DNase-seq. SCA-seq showed similar nucleosome depletion patterns around TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Inactive TSSs (low quantile of gene expression) were less accessible than active TSSs (upper quantile of gene expression) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In the detailed examination of the genome regions, the SCA-seq showed the expected nucleosome pattern co-localizing with various epigenetic marks, for example, H3K4me3 (active) and H3K27ac (active) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d</xref>). To further estimate the labeling efficiency between different methods, we also compared the fold change values of signal enrichment around TSS with HiCAR, ATAC-seq and DNase-seq, where the accessible chromatin conformation is enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). All three methods SCA-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq showed similar labeling efficiency on the TSS. We then explored the time-dose influence on the labeling results. The relationship between the dose and M.CviPI treatment effect demonstrated superior efficiency of the 3 hr treatment, comparing with those achieved after 15 or 30 min treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b, c</xref>).

The background GpC ratio in each segment was around 0.018 (<bold>a, b</bold>). Efficiency of spiked-in lambda DNA labeling by M.CviPI was around 0.88 in vitro. We then selected CTCF motifs as control to calculate in vivo labeling efficiency (<bold>c</bold>). We plotted the CpG methylation ratio (methylated CpG/total CpG) against the GpC methylation ratio in CTCF motifs. Previous publications showed that pre-existing methylation could antagonize CTCF binding to CTCF motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell and Felsenfeld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hark et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kanduri et al., 2000</xref>).

Both nanoNOME-seq and SCA-seq were single-molecule assays. nanoNOME-seq could report chromatin accessibility in 2–20 kb single DNA molecules.

Therefore, we next validated genome spatial organization. First, we analyzed basic statistical parameters, for example, contact distance and cardinality of SCA-seq. As SCA-seq ligated the multiple fragments together, revealing the multiplex chromatin conformation, we aligned non-singleton chimeric reads into genomic segments and assembled in silico paired-end tags (PETs) in order to compare with Hi-C carrying paired loci. The segment median length was approximately 700 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Among the informative intra-chromosome PETs, 0.1% of the PETs (contact distance) were &lt;150 bp; 0.3% of them ranged from 150 to 1000 bp; 24.5% were 1000–200,000 bp; and 75.1% were &gt;200,000 bp. Unlike Hi-C, SCA-seq, derived from pore-C, revealed the multiplex nature of chromatin interactions. As for the intra-chromosome interactions, 14.7% of the reads contained two segments (cardinality = 2); approximately 14.5% of the reads contained 3–5 segments (cardinality = 3–5); and 5.4% of the reads had more than five segments (cardinality &gt;5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). As in the previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ulahannan et al., 2019</xref>), most of the contacts from the reads with fewer segments appeared to have closer contact distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The contacts from the reads with more segments appeared to have more distal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c, d</xref>). The high cardinality of concatemers with enriched enhancer and/or promoter might indicate the cooperativity in the mammalian transcriptional regulation, as in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ulahannan et al., 2019</xref>). Compared with the output of similar methods, such as Trac-loop and HiCAR, SCA-seq also resolved more high-cardinality chromatin conformation and distal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2e, f, g</xref>). Our results regarding high-order chromatin conformation capturing also agreed with the output of previously published methods, such as SPRITE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quinodoz et al., 2018</xref>), pore-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ulahannan et al., 2019</xref>), and ChIA-Drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>), which also disclosed more distal interactions.</p><p>We then compared SCA-seq to the gold standard Hi-C with respect to the false positive call rate, reproducibility, and ability to resolve genome spatial organization. False positive call rates of SCA-seq and Hi-C, inferred from hybrid PETs that consisted of mitochondrial DNA and genomic DNA, were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>). The compartment score correlation between SCA-seq replicates and pore-C replicates was approximately 0.94, suggesting comparable reproducibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Furthermore, SCA-seq revealed genome organization similar to the one detected using in situ Hi-C. Side-by-side visualization of interaction heatmaps, loops, topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, and A/B compartments obtained using SCA-seq and Hi-C showed equivalent genome organizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c, e, g, h</xref>). The correlation coefficients of the eigenvector and insulation scores were 0.91 and 0.84, that is, slightly lower than we expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d and f</xref>). From the analysis of a 130G base run of HEK293T SCA-seq, we successfully identified 105,598,180 ligation junctions and 492,502,643 virtual pairwise contacts, which resulted in coverage of 5,625,908 dpnII digested restriction fragments (7,127,633 dpnII in silico restriction fragments). The sequencing depth of SCA-seq could improve these correlations with Hi-C results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Because SCA-seq is a non-amplification method, whereas Hi-C is an amplification method, these differences might have resulted from the amplification bias of GC regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e-h</xref>).

Considering the relationship between CTCF binding and chromatin structure formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hyle et al., 2019</xref>), we plotted the concatemer cardinality and interaction distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3k, i</xref>). We found that the CTCF binding resulted in higher cardinality and more distal interactions than the non-CTCF binding, suggesting that CTCF binding facilitates formation of a more complex structure. As has been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battaglia et al., 2022</xref>), the methyltransferase accessibility pattern also could reflect other transcription factors’ footprints, enlightening the further exploring the relationship between chromatin conformation with other transcription factors by SCA-seq. Therefore, SCA-seq could help to subgroup chromatin interaction concatemers and investigate the relationship between chromatin conformation and protein binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SCA-seq resolves spatial interactions of accessible and inaccessible chromatin regions</title><p>Given the genome organization is highly heterogeneous in different cells, our chromatin interaction status analysis mainly relied on the single-molecule pattern, which needs high sensitivity and specificity. Single-molecule base modification calling was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, we determined enzyme labeling efficiency, which was 79–88%, based on the CTCF motifs and the lambda DNA spike-in control measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). Next, we filtered the segments using the binomial test to minimize false positive attribution of the accessible or inaccessible status (see Methods). Unexpectedly, accessible and inaccessible DNAs were ligated together in SCA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), suggesting heterogeneous accessibility of the spatially neighboring DNA regions. Each segment in the concatemer was determined to be either accessible or inaccessible. Then, the fraction of accessible segments in each concatemer was calculated as the <italic>N</italic><sub>accessible</sub>/(<italic>N</italic><sub>accessible+inaccessible</sub>). Compartment A had a significantly higher fraction of accessible segments than compartment B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). Our overall genome concatemer calculations showed that 29% of the genome concatemers were inaccessible on all enclosed segments (the fraction of accessible segments &lt;0.1). Furthermore, 62.2% of genome concatemers had both accessible and inaccessible segments (hybrid concatemers), and only 8.8% maintained all segments as accessible (the fraction of accessible segments &gt;0.9) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> illustrates an example region with 1D genome feature tracks to demonstrate the promoter–enhancer spatial interactions, accessibility, and CpG methylation at a single-molecule resolution. nanoNOME-seq that labels chromatin accessibility in single molecules also confirmed the existence of partial hybrid concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>). To explore if the concatemer accessibility status was related to spatial location, we plotted the inaccessible concatemers and hybrid concatemers on the 2D contact heatmap. We found that hybrid concatemers tended to accumulate around the TAD boundaries and contain more distant connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). By plotting the ratio of accessible segments against concatemer cardinality or interaction distance, we revealed that the more accessible segments tended to cluster as high cardinality, also implying their distal and high-cardinality interaction preference on the hybrid concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Moreover, we found that the hybrid concatemers comprised more enhancer and promoter elements than inaccessible concatemers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>), suggesting the relationship between concatemer type and the extent of transcription regulation. We further investigated the enhancer and promoter contacts on chromosome 7, 30.3% of which had accessible–accessible status, 18.5% had accessible–inaccessible status, and 51.2% had inaccessible–inaccessible status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>).

However, 51.2% of enhancer–promoter interactions were independent of the chromatin-accessible status, suggesting that such spatial interactions were not the only factor regulating the initiation of transcription.

In the SCA-seq data that indicated the high-order interaction and CpG methylation, we found 76,418 reads overlapping with CGIs on chromosome 7, and the majority of oCGIs were usually spatially close to the CTCF-binding motifs and active histone markers, such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3, suggesting their active regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). By examining the methylation status on reads, as expected, these read segments demonstrated lower CpG methylation and higher chromatin accessibility (GpC methylation), which further supports their roles in gene activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). In a previously published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pachano et al., 2021</xref>), oCGIs were considered to act as tethering elements that promote topological interaction between enhancers and distally located genes to regulate gene expression.

Compared with 1D ATAC-seq, SCA-seq might more closely represent the true structure of the native genome. With SCA-seq, we found that genome spatial contacts maintained non-uniform chromatin accessibility, suggesting complex genome regulation in the 3D space. SCA-seq could be a multi-omics tool to simultaneously analyzed the DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, transcription factor binding, and chromatin conformation.</p><p>For the single-molecule resolution, the efficiency of methyltransferase labeling must be ensured. We used lambda DNA in vitro labeling and in vivo CTCF motif signal to estimate labeling efficiency. The binomial test was utilized to correct the labeling accuracy at a single-molecule level. Then, relatively reliably accessible chromatin markers were obtained. However, it is still possible for such a marker to be missed or overridden in the case of insufficient enzyme activity. Because suboptimal labeling efficiency may lead to deviations from our conclusions, our analysis in the following experiments was mainly based on the single-molecule accessible signals from called accessible region to reduce background noise. Given the high heterogeneity of the dynamic genome structure and SCA-seq resolution, a much higher sequencing throughput is required to achieve analysis at a single-molecule level in a specific spatial location. The cost of sequencing a 40× depth human sample using SCA-seq is approximately 1300 USD per sample. The cost may pose a limitation when attempting to perform high-depth SCA-seq profiling of large number of samples. It is important to note that SCA-seq requires the use of a regular Oxford nanopore sequencer with an R9.4.1 chip. While this chip is currently available, there is a possibility that Oxford Nanopore may discontinue it in the future.</p><p>The eigenvalue and insulation score of SCA-seq moderately correlated with those of gold standard Hi-C (0.91 and 0.84), and the moderate correlations were also true in all other multiplex-order chromatin conformation methods, such as pore-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshpande et al., 2022</xref>), SPRITE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Quinodoz et al., 2018</xref>), and ChIA-Drop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>). After we studied this problem deeper, we found that there may be two reasons for this. First, the conversion from multi-contacts to pairwise contacts overrepresented some interactions. In our algorithm, we significantly resolved this issue by weighted transformation, which increased the correlation coefficient to 0.9. Second, we found that the low correlation regions had lower GC density and low read counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4e-h</xref>). It has been pointed out previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Niu et al., 2019</xref>) that PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification could bias eigenvalues and insulation scores. In contrast, pore-C and SCA-seq are non-amplification methods. After the quality filter of low-coverage regions, the correlation between the two methods was significantly improved.</p><p>SCA-seq was created as a multi-omics tool to examine both chromosome conformation and chromatin accessibility. It is important to discuss different levels of resolution of chromosome conformation capture and chromatin accessibility. The resolution of the chromosome conformation capture is approximately 700 bp, whereas that of the conventional chromatin accessibility is approximately 200 bp. Not all precise accessible–accessible chromatin interactions can be determined. Therefore, an alternative hypothesis is that the interaction loci are located outside the accessible chromatin. Therefore, improvement of the resolution of chromosome conformation capture in SCA-seq is needed to determine spatial accessibility interaction accurately.</p><p>Overall, our results demonstrated that SCA-seq could resolve genome accessibility locations in the three-dimensional space, facilitating the observation of subgroups of chromatin conformation regions with a specific binding pattern, conformation-based chromatin accessibility, and conformation-based native CpG methylation.

Briefly, the workflow starts with the alignment of SCA-seq reads to a reference genome by bwa (v0.7.12) using the parameter bwa bwasw -b 5 -q 2 -r 1 -T 15 -z 10. The mapping score ≥30, and reads with length &lt;50 bp were set to filter out the low-quality mapping segment. To remove the non-chimeric pairs due to ligation of cognate free ends or incomplete digestion, each alignment is assigned to an in silico restriction digest based on the midpoint of alignment. The locus of each segment on each concatemer is summarized by converting the filtered alignment to a segment bed file sorted by read ID first and then the genome locus. The alignment bam file is also used to call the GpC and CpG methylation by Nanopolish (v0.11.1) call-methylation with the cpggpc model (--methylation cpggpc). The default cut-off for log-likelihood ratios are used to determine methylated GpC (&gt;1) and methylated CpG sites (&gt;1.5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The methylation call is then counted to each segment in the segment bed file to derive the methylated and unmethylated count of GpC and CpG for each segment of the concatemers.</p><p>To filter out background GpC methylation signal, we performed a segment-level sliding window analysis combined with a binomial test. The GpC methylation signal was divided into 50 bp sliding windows with a 10-bp step size. For a given window, let the background GpC methylation ratio be the probability of success in a given trail, where the number of methylated GpC sites be the number of successes and the total number of GpC sites be the number of trials. A right-tailed binomial test was performed to determine if the GpC methylation ratio in the given window is significantly greater than the background GpC methylation ratio (p &lt; 0.05). The accessible region on the given segment was then defined by merging the overlapping windows that pass the binomial as well as contain at least 2 GpC sites. Once the accessible regions on each segment of each read is determined, the GpC methylation signal out of the accessible regions are removed to reduce the random noise in GpC methylation signal. For the CTCF footprint analysis, we identify CTCF site with footprints on each segment if the accessible regions are called nearby the CTCF sites (at least 20 bp away from the center of CTCF sites) but not on the CTCF sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>SCA-seq and Hi-C comparisons</title><p>SCA-seq concatemers were converted into virtual pairwise contacts in order to correlate with the published Hi-C datasets.

The SCA-seq accessibility peak calling was performed in a similar way to nanoNOMe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, 200 bp window and 20 bp step size continuous regions of GpC methylated counts, unmethylated counts, and GpC methylation ratio were generated from SCA-seq Nanopolish calls. The regions of GpC methylation ratio greater than 99th percentile of the regions were selected as candidate first. The significance of each candidate region was calculated by the one-tailed binomial test of raw frequency of accessibility (methylated GpC site/total GpC site) to reject the null probability, which is defined by the overall regions GpC methylation ratio. The p-values were corrected for multiple testing by Benjamini–Hochberg correction. The adjusted p-values &lt;0.001 and widths greater than 50 bps were determined as the SCA-seq accessibility peaks. The overlapping peaks between SCA-seq, ATAC-seq, and DNase-seq were identified by bedtools (v2.26.0) intersect. The CTCF-binding sites, enhancer regions, and promoter regions are obtained from the Ensembl Regulatory Build (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zerbino et al., 2015</xref>) in the 1D track view and pile-up analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Analysis of cytosine modifications called by WGBS</title><p>The cytosine modification analysis of WGBS data generally follows the rules in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heyn et al., 2012</xref>. In brief, the two sets of hg19 genome reference sequences were prepared; the C to T reference that had the C residues replaced by Ts, and the G to A reference that had the T residues replaced by As. The two sets of reads are prepared the same way; the C to T reads and G to A reads. The two sets of reads were aligned to the two sets of genome separately by GEM alignment software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marco-Sola et al., 2012</xref>) which allows 4 mismatches of bases with quality score over 25. The lack of methylation of C residues would be recognized as C to T or G to A conversions. The methylation ratio of methylated GpC or CpG residues in 200 bp windows was then calculated for the correlation analysis with the SCA-seq methylation calling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Estimate the labeling efficiency in vivo</title><p>As previous research, the CTCF motif maintained the accessible chromatin in neighboring 200 bp region. Consider the resolution in Hi-C and experimental fragmentation, we selected the 1000 bp bins with the documented CTCF motif in center. The CpG methylation levels were negatively correlated with the chromatin accessibility. Then the segment with low CpG methylation were expected to maintain the accessible chromatin status with CTCF binding. We hypothesized that the segments with low CpG methylation (CpG ratio &lt;0.25) and low chromatin accessibility (GpC ratio &lt;0.1) were not efficiently labeled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Identification of accessible segments by binomial test</title><p>The medium segment length is 500 bp, which is close to the general size of accessible chromatin segments. We first calculated the background level of the methyl-GpC (accessible) and non-methyl-GpC (inaccessible) probability on the segments. We used the non-treated genomic DNAs as the background, and 0.03 (GpC background) were the average GpC frequency on segments. Then we performed the binomial test (R basics) for each segment in M.CviPI-treated samples to test the null hypothesis that if labeled GpCs (GpC ≥4) was equal or smaller than the background GpCs. We further to investigate the confidence level of inaccessible chromatin with the non-methyl GpC. The non-methyl-GpC frequency in M.CviPI-treated spike-in is 0.3. Therefore, we roughly estimated that 21% GpCs(p) were not efficiently labeled by M.CviPI. Then we performed the binomial test (R basics) for each segment in M.CviPI-treated samples to test the null hypothesis that if the non-methyl GpCs on heterochromatins were equal or larger than the enzymatic inefficiency. For both p-value, the probabilities were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini–Hochberg correction and accessible/inaccessible segments with adjusted p-value less than 0.05. We determined the accessible segments first, and then we further determined the inaccessible segments in the rest. There are ~2 million segments which is undetermined and discarded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistics</title><p>Most of the parametric data which were distributed as normal distribution (log normal distribution), were performed in two-side <italic>t</italic>-test.

SCA-seq first uses M.CviPI DNA methyltransferase to treat chromatin, then perform proximity ligation followed by long-read sequencing. This method is highly relevant to a few previously reported long read sequencing technologies. Specifically, NanoNome, SMAC-seq, and Fiber-seq have been reported to use m6A or GpC methyltransferase accessibility to map open chromatin, or open chromatin together with CpG methylation; Pore-C and MC-3C have been reported to use long read sequencing to map multiplex chromatin interactions, or together with CpG methylation. Therefore, as a combination of NanoNome/SMAC-seq/Fiber-seq and Pore-C/MC-3C, SCA-seq is one step forward. The authors tested SCA-seq in 293T cells and performed benchmark analyses testing the performance of SCA-seq in generating each data module (open chromatin and 3D genome). The QC metrics appear to be good and I am convinced that this is a valuable addition to the toolsets of multi-OMIC long-read sequencing mapping.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This paper reports the development of SCA-seq, a new method derived from PORE-C for simultaneously measuring chromatin accessibility, genome 3D and CpG DNA methylation. Most of the conclusions are supported by convincing data. SCA-seq has the potential to become a useful tool to the scientific communities to interrogate genome structure-function relationships.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this work, Xie et al. developed SCA-seq, which is a multiOME mapping method that can obtain chromatin accessibility, methylation, and 3D genome information at the same time. SCA-seq first uses M.CviPI DNA methyltransferase to treat chromatin, then perform proximity ligation followed by long-read sequencing. This method is highly relevant to a few previously reported long read sequencing technologies. Specifically, NanoNome, SMAC-seq, and Fiber-seq have been reported to use m6A or GpC methyltransferase accessibility to map open chromatin, or open chromatin together with CpG methylation; Pore-C and MC-3C have been reported to use long read sequencing to map multiplex chromatin interactions, or together with CpG methylation. Therefore, as a combination of NanoNome/SMAC-seq/Fiber-seq and Pore-C/MC-3C, SCA-seq is one step forward. The authors tested SCA-seq in 293T cells and performed benchmark analyses testing the performance of SCA-seq in generating each data module (open chromatin and 3D genome). The QC metrics appear to be good and I am convinced that this is a valuable addition to the toolsets of multi-OMIC long-read sequencing mapping.</p><p>The revised manuscript addressed most of my questions except my concern about Fig. S9. This figure is about a theory that a chromatin region can become open due to interaction with other regions, and the author propose a mathematic model to compute such effects. I was concerned about the errors in the model of Fig. S9a, and I was also concerned about the lack of evidence or validation. In their responses, the authors admitted that they cannot provide biological evidence or validations but still chose to keep the figure and the text.</p><p>The revised Fig. S9a now uses a symmetric genome interaction matrix as I suggested. But Figure S9a still have a lot of problems. Firstly, the diagonal of the matrix in Fig. S9a still has many 0's, which I asked in my previous comments without an answer. The legend mentioned that the contacts were defined as 2, 0 or -2 but the revised Fig. S9a only shows 1,0, or -1 values. Furthermore, Fig. S9b,9c,9d all added a panel of CTCF+/- but there is no explanation in text or figure legend about these newly added panels. Given many unaddressed problems, I would still suggest deleting this figure.</p><p>In my opinion, this paper does not need Fig. S9 to support its major story. The model in this figure is independent of SCA-seq. I think it should be spinoff as an independent paper if the authors can provide more convincing analysis or experiments. I understand eLife lets authors to decide what to include in their paper. If the authors insist to include Fig. S9, I strongly suggest they should at least provide adequate explanation about all the figure panels. At this point, the Fig. S9 is not solid and clearly have many errors. The readers should ignore this part.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for raising these concerns regarding Fig. S9. After careful consideration, we have decided to address your concerns by deleting Fig. S9 and the corresponding text from the manuscript. We understand your point that the model presented in Fig. S9 is independent of SCA-seq and may require additional evidence and validation to be presented in a separate paper.</p><p>We agree that it is important to maintain the integrity and accuracy of the manuscript, and we appreciate your feedback in helping us make this decision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this manuscript, Xie et al presented a new method derived from PORE-C, SCA-seq, for simultaneously measuring chromatin accessibility, genome 3D and CpG DNA methylation. SCA-seq provides a useful tool to the scientific communities to interrogate the genome structure-function relationship.</p><p>The revised manuscript has clarified almost of the concerns raised in the previous round of review, though I still have two minor concerns,</p><p>1. In fig 2a, there is no number presented in the Venn diagram (although the left panel indeed showed the numbers of the different categories, including the numbers in the right panel would be more straightforward).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for pointing out the need for clarification in the Venn diagram in Fig 2a. We have added the numbers to Venn diagram.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors clarified the discrepancy between sfig 7a and sfig 7g. However, the remaining question is, why is there a big difference in the percentage of the cardinality count of concatemers of the different groups between the chr7 and the whole genome?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the difference in the percentage of the cardinality count of concatemers between chr7 and the whole genome in figures S7a and S7g. The difference arises because the chr7 cardinality count only considers the intra-chromosome segments that are adjacent to each other on a SCA-seq concatemer, while the whole genome cardinality count includes both intra-chromosome and inter-chromosome segments.</p><p>In the case of a SCA-seq concatemer that contains both intra-chromosome junctions and inter-chromosome junctions, the whole genome cardinality count will be greater than the intra-chromosome cardinality count. This explains the difference in the percentages between chr7 and the whole genome in figures S7a and S7g.</p><p>To better clarify the definition of intra-chromosome cardinality, we have added an illustrative graph in figure S7a. In the updated figure S7a, the given exemplary SCA-seq concatemer has a whole genome cardinality of 4 and a chr7 intra-chromosome cardinality of 3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
