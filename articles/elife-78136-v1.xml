(MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), yet the specific oncogenic pathways activated by mis-splicing have not been fully elucidated. Inflammatory immune pathways have been shown to play roles in the pathogenesis of MDS, though the exact mechanisms of their activation in splicing mutant cases are not well understood.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>RNA-seq data from <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant samples was analyzed and functional roles of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (<italic>IRAK4)</italic> isoforms were determined. Efficacy of <italic>IRAK4</italic> inhibition was evaluated in preclinical models of MDS/AML.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>RNA-seq splicing analysis of <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant MDS samples revealed retention of full-length exon 6 of <italic>IRAK4</italic>, a critical downstream mediator that links the Myddosome to inflammatory NF-kB activation. Exon 6 retention leads to a longer isoform, encoding a protein (IRAK4-long) that contains the entire death domain and kinase domain, leading to maximal activation of NF-kB. Cells with wild-type <italic>SF3B1</italic> contain smaller IRAK4 isoforms that are targeted for proteasomal degradation. Expression of IRAK4-long in <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutant cells induces TRAF6 activation leading to K63-linked ubiquitination of CDK2, associated with a block in hematopoietic differentiation. Inhibition of IRAK4 with CA-4948, leads to reduction in NF-kB activation, inflammatory cytokine production, enhanced myeloid differentiation in vitro and reduced leukemic growth in xenograft models.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p><italic>SF3B1</italic> mutation leads to expression of a therapeutically targetable, longer, oncogenic <italic>IRAK4</italic> isoform in AML/MDS models.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work was supported by Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Research Foundation, Leukemia Lymphoma Society, and National Institute of Health (R35HL135787, RO1HL111103, RO1DK102759, RO1HL114582), Gabrielle’s Angel Foundation for Cancer Research, and Edward P.

Between these blocks are sections of linking DNA, which cells remove when they are preparing to use their genes. Scientists call this process 'splicing'. Cells can splice some genes in more than one way, allowing them to make different proteins from the same genetic code.</p><p>Mutations that affect the splicing process can change the way cells make their proteins, leading to disease. For example, the myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of blood cancers often caused by mutations in splicing proteins, such as SF3B1. The disorder stops blood cells from maturing and causes abnormal inflammation. So far, the link between splicing, blood cell immaturity, inflammation and cancer is not clear.</p><p>To find out more, Choudhary, Pellagatti et al. looked at the spliced genetic code from people with myelodysplastic syndromes. Mutations in the splicing protein SF3B1 changed the way cells spliced an important signalling molecule known as IRAK4. Affected cells cut out less genetic code and made a longer version of this signalling protein, named IRAK4-Long. This altered protein activated inflammation and stopped blood cells from maturing. Blocking IRAK4-Long reversed the effects.

Mutations in spliceosome genes are commonly seen in MDS and AML and <italic>SF3B1</italic> is the most frequently mutated gene in patients with MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Yoshida et al., 2011</xref>). Even though reports have shown that mutations in <italic>SF3B1</italic> can lead to widespread changes in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Inoue and Abdel-Wahab, 2016</xref>), the exact pathways that are disrupted and lead to the pathogenesis of ineffective hematopoiesis and carcinogenesis in MDS and AML are not yet fully elucidated.</p><p>The innate immune signaling pathways have been shown to be activated in MDS and AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barreyro et al., 2018</xref>). The upstream activation of toll like receptors (TLRs), interleukin receptor 1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAP), and interleukin 8 (IL8) activate the IRAK/TRAF6 pathways and lead to NF-kB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). Even though these pathways have been shown to be overactivated, a link between this activation and commonly seen <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutation has not been established. We had recently shown that another splicing mutation in <italic>U2AF1</italic> splicing factor can lead to retention of exon 4 leading to overexpression of <italic>IRAK4</italic> in MDS and AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). In the present report, we now demonstrate that <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutation leads to exon 6 retention leading to overexpression of active isoform of IRAK4 known as IRAK4-long (IRAK4-L). We demonstrate that this IRAK4-L isoform containing the death domain can associate with MYD88 and lead to activation of downstream NF-kB signaling. These data demonstrate the link between <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutation and oncogenic IRAK4 signaling in MDS/AML and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of inhibiting this pathway via pharmacological inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>(Study schema outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell lines and human samples</title><p>HEK-293T and THP1 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection.

Full length IRAK4 protein (IRAK4-L) is composed of a death domain, hinge region, and a kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Exon 6 encodes a part of the kinase domain of IRAK4 protein. The exclusion of mRNA sequence encoding amino acids 188–217 in exon 6 as seen in HC can lead to two possible smaller IRAK4 isoforms. Isoform S1 (191 amino acids) could be produced due to formation of a premature stop codon (TGA) leading to a smaller IRAK4 isoform containing death, hinge, and part of kinase domain. Isoform S2 (243 amino acids) (S2) could also be generated by utilizing an alternative translational start site (ATG) resulting in an IRAK4 isoform with only the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Structural modeling of TRAF6 and CDK2 peptide show that positions P<sub>-2</sub>, P<sub>0</sub>, and P<sub>3</sub> in CDK2 correspond to three distinct sub-pockets in the binding site of TRAF6 and supports the notion that CDK2 can be ubiquitinated by TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). To directly test the role of TRAF6 dependent ubiquitination of CDK2 in chronic innate immune signaling, we ectopically expressed CDK2, IRAK4, and TRAF6 in presence of either Lys48 linked ubiquitin or Lys63 linked ubiquitin.CDK2 was associated with a much stronger K63 ubiquitin that was dependent on TRAF6 and IRAK4 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To validate this result, we generated alanine and glycine mutants (CDK2 Myc 122 and CDK2 Myc 123) within CDK2 binding site of TRAF6 and examined their ubiquitination in presence of IRAK4-L and TRAF6 by immunoprecipitating CDK2.

Mutations in splicing genes are one of the most common alterations in MDS and AML and predominantly affect <italic>SF3B1, U2AF1, and SRSF2</italic> (1). <italic>SF3B1</italic> is the most commonly mutated splicing gene in MDS and can also be mutated in solid tumors such as breast cancer, melanoma, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Papaemmanuil et al., 2013</xref>). Even though mutations in <italic>SF3B1</italic> can affect splicing of numerous genes, the exact pathways that are disrupted by aberrant splicing and lead to ineffective hematopoiesis are not well elucidated. We recently demonstrated that mutant <italic>U2AF1 (S34F</italic>) directly regulates IRAK4 exon 4 retention in MDS/AML, which results in expression of the longer IRAK4 isoform (IRAK4-L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). In the present report, we demonstrate that <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations also lead to production of active IRAK4-L isoforms but by aberrant retention of exon 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). The functional activation of the IRAK4 pathway by two different exon retention events by <italic>U2AF1</italic> mutations and <italic>SF3B1</italic> mutations suggest that this is an important functional event in MDS pathobiology.</p><p>While IRAK4 and its downstream pathways have been studied in innate immunity and in the context of inflammatory diseases, its molecular and cellular effects in MDS/AML are relatively understudied. Recent work has shown that innate immune signaling mediators such as IL1RAP, IL8/CXCR2, TLRs as well as myeloid derived suppressor cells are activated in MDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barreyro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dimicoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Wei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Rhyasen et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings further support the role of activated innate immune signaling pathways in MDS and suggest that interaction of IRAK4 with upstream TLR/MyD88 pathways is critical in MDS pathogenesis. Demonstration of overexpression of active IRAK4 isoforms in splicing mutant MDS suggests that these cells are primed to respond to upstream TLR and MyD88 activation. In fact, since active IRAK4 isoforms are expressed in different spliceosome mutant subsets, they potentially represent a shared downstream functional pathway that regulates MDS/AML malignant cell survival.</p><p>CA-4948 is a specific inhibitor of IRAK4 that is now being tested in clinical trials in MDS/AML and lymphomas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT04278768; NCT03328078) and in preliminary findings has shown a tolerable safety profile. Early clinical data appears encouraging in spliceosome mutant patients, supporting the validity of IRAK4 as a therapeutic target in SF3B1 mutant MDS/AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Garcia-Manero et al., 2021</xref>). CA4948 also shows inhibitory activity against FLT3 and CLKs, potentially another reason for the antimalignant activity observed in our preclinical studies. Our data suggests that inhibiting IRAK4 pharmacologically leads to shrinkage of the MDS/AML clones in vivo and this correlates with decreased blast counts seen with CA4948 monotherapy in relapsed/refractory MDS/AML in early results. MDS/AML are characterized by block in hematopoietic differentiation that leads to neutropenia and subsequent infections. Our data suggests that IRAK4 inhibition promotes myeloid differentiation in SF3B1 mutant cases. This affect can be therapeutically advantageous in clinical trials and supports further testing.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>MS owns stock options in Poseida Therapeutics.

the splicesome SF3B1. The authors demonstrate that this mutation leads to a shift in the production of a long-form of IRAK4 (called IRAK4-L), which is part of inflammatory signaling in immune cells. They demonstrate that IRAK4-L stabilizes the cell cycle protein CDK2, and targeting IRAK4-L with an inhibitor can induce differentiation and slow clonal uptake in murine transplantation models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78136.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Iqbal</surname><given-names>Jameel</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>DaVita Labs</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Parekh</surname><given-names>Samir</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.09.483595">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.09.483595v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We investigated CDK2 after an unbiased discovery of motif targeted by TRAF6. It has been shown in previous papers that decrease in CDK2 protein levels are critical for myeloid differentiation to occur (Ying et al., Ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CDK2 drives the therapeutic differentiation of AML by targeting PRDX2, Blood (2018) 131 (24): 2698–2711). Since block in differentiation is the hallmark of MDS/AML, we investigated Lys63 Ub of CDK2 in MDS/AML and also showed the ability of CDK2 inhibitors in promoting myeloid differentiation. We hope that future studies will evaluate CDK2 Ub patterns in primary samples, especially in splicing mutant cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1D: There is a smaller band below the putative IRAK4 in the SF3B1 lane. Please explain what that is and if it is reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>The smaller band was not reproducible nor found in the endogenous exon/intron cassette so likely a technical artifact of the splicing reporter system. A deep analysis of MDS patient samples by RNA-seq also did not reveal any newer shorter splice sites. It is possible in the reporter system, a minor/cryptic splice site, could results in a slightly shorter band when over expressing SF3B1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4B and C: There appears to be a slight discrepancy in the concentrations with B using much higher concentrations than C. As a result, there is little recovery in B to the DMSO level. The (p) recovery is there but is very hard to see; might be worth attempting to quantitate.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting point. We had used lesser number of doses in the western blot (Figure 4B) to highlight the downstream inhibition of NF-κB. In Figure 4C, we used a larger dose range to illustrate the biological effects better. We have quantified the blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and show a clear dose response inhibition with CA4948 (In response to stimulation with TLR5 agonist).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78136-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sup Figure 3: Generally, this figure is poorly put together with some axis language cut off and mcd45 and mCD45 annotated differently for some reason.

Xenografts with MDS samples, especially with lower risk SF3B1 mutant samples are technically challenging and yield variable rates of engraftment. The decision to treat/control was not based on engraftment numbers. Larger set of pdx will be performed in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
