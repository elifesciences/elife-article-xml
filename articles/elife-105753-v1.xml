profound influence of cognitive-affective processes on symptom perception and treatment outcomes, with the potential to significantly alter responses to medical interventions. Despite their clinical relevance, the question of how placebo and nocebo effects differ in strength and duration remains largely unexplored. Using a within-subject design in 104 healthy individuals, we investigated and directly compared the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects on experimental pain. Effects were assessed immediately after their induction through verbal instructions and conditioning and at a 1-week follow-up. The study was preregistered in the German Clinical Trials Register (registration number: DRKS00029228). Significant placebo and nocebo effects were detected on days 1 and 8, but nocebo effects were stronger on both test days. Sustained effects after 1 week were primarily predicted by individuals’ experienced effects on day 1. Our findings underscore the enduring nature of placebo and nocebo effects in pain, with nocebo responses demonstrating consistently greater strength, which is consistent with an evolutionarily advantageous ‘better-safe-than-sorry’ strategy. These insights emphasise the significant impact of nocebo effects and stress the need to prioritise efforts to mitigate them in clinical practice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>placebo hypoalgesia</kwd><kwd>nocebo hyperalgesia</kwd><kwd>pain modulation</kwd><kwd>conditioning</kwd><kwd>treatment expectation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>422744262</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bingel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In healthy volunteers, negative expectations exert stronger and longer-lasting effects on pain than positive expectations, consistent with a better-safe-than-sorry account of placebo and nocebo effects.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Placebo and nocebo effects are intriguing phenomena that have generated considerable research interest in medicine, psychology, and neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wager and Atlas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petrie and Rief, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colloca and Barsky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>). Belief in the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of a treatment can reduce or increase symptoms, highlighting the powerful interaction between perception, physiology and cognitive-affective processes. Harnessing the power of positive expectations could complement standard medical treatments, and thereby enhance overall treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingel, 2020</xref>). Conversely, awareness of nocebo effects is important to minimise negative expectations and side effects in clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colloca and Barsky, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bingel and Placebo Competence Team, 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is relevant in placebo-controlled clinical trials where nocebo effects, manifesting as adverse events in the placebo group, can decrease treatment adherence and even lead to treatment discontinuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colloca, 2024</xref>). Recent insights into both phenomena have therefore led to a growing call to systematically utilise placebo effects and to learn to avoid nocebo effects in clinical care.</p><p>While extensive investigations have focused on the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying positive expectations and their effect on symptom perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Petrie and Rief, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bingel, 2020</xref>), our understanding of negative expectations and nocebo effects is comparably sparse despite evidence that nocebo effects can be moderate to large in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Petersen et al., 2014</xref>). Even less is known about the longevity of the effect, a crucial factor for assessing its impact on treatment outcome in real-life scenarios.</p><p>Importantly, there is evidence suggesting that an individual’s susceptibility to nocebo information may not simply mirror their capacity for placebo analgesia. Early research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref> demonstrated that a single session using non-painful stimuli induced a nocebo effect but failed to elicit a placebo effect, indicating that negative expectations may be more readily triggered than positive ones. Moreover, nocebo effects seem to generalise more easily to other symptoms or treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zunhammer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faasse et al., 2019</xref>). Given the evolutionary relevance of anticipating negative, threatening, and potentially harmful events, it seems reasonable to assume that negative expectation and its effect on health outcome is an integral aspect of promoting safety behaviours and is thus more persistent than positive expectation. To accurately gauge an individual’s capacity to produce placebo and nocebo effects and compare their magnitude and duration, it is essential to investigate both effects within the same individual.</p><p>Here we investigated immediate and sustained effects of positive and negative treatment expectations on experimentally induced heat pain in N = 104 healthy volunteers. Our experimental approach allowed for the trial-by-trial modulation of expectations for pain relief and pain aggravation in a within-subject design. Verbal instructions were combined with conditioning along with a sham electrical stimulation, which was introduced to participants as a method to ‘induce frequency-dependent changes in pain sensitivity’. Treatment expectations and pain perception of physically identical medium-level heat stimuli were assessed immediately after expectancy induction (day 1), but also 1 week later (day 8) to investigate the longevity of both placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia. We also assessed psychological variables to explore whether they modulate or predict an individual’s susceptibility, effects, and persistence of expectancy effects on pain. We hypothesised that negative expectations and nocebo effects would be stronger than positive expectations and placebo effects induced on day 1, and that negative expectations and their effects are more resistant to extinction and would therefore still be stronger on day 8.</p><p>Our data confirm that, although significant placebo and nocebo effects were found on days 1 and 8, the nocebo effect was consistently stronger. Both effects were primarily influenced by the most recent experience of pain reduction and pain increase but were also susceptible to psychological factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The calibration procedure determined one temperature level for the placebo condition and one for the nocebo condition that were equidistant from the temperature of the control condition. These three temperatures were used in the conditioning procedure to induce the perception of pain reduction (placebo hyperalgesia) and pain aggravation (nocebo hyperalgesia), respectively (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and Appendix 1). In the test sessions on days 1 and 8, however, the same medium-level temperature of the control condition was applied in all three conditions. The analyses include comparisons between all three conditions (i.e. placebo, nocebo and control) and comparisons between placebo effects (i.e. control vs. placebo) and nocebo effects (i.e. nocebo vs. control). To identify variables associated with placebo or nocebo effects on day 1 or day 8, we conducted multiple regression analyses including expected and experienced effects as well as psychological variables as potential predictors.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Study and trial design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Study design: on day 1, participants underwent a conditioning procedure in which a noxious heat was applied directly after a (sham) TENS: (transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation) stimulation in three conditions.

Three key findings emerged from our investigation. First, medium-to-large scale placebo and nocebo effects were found not only on day 1 but also 1 week later. Second, nocebo effects were consistently stronger than placebo effects, including during the conditioning phase, despite analogous conditioning protocols in both conditions. Third, placebo and nocebo effects are primarily driven by the most recent experience of these effects but were also susceptible to some psychological factors.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Sustained placebo and nocebo effects</title><p>While placebo effects have been shown to persist for an extended period of time after they have been induced, there are only a few studies that have investigated the longevity of nocebo effects so far and these studies focused on sustained effects within the same test session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colagiuri et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, nocebo effects were not only sustained over the period of a week, but they were also significantly stronger than the placebo effect on both test days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding aligns with broader evidence from learning studies, which demonstrate a greater influence of negative information on sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Schaaf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forkmann et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zika et al., 2023</xref>), as well as similar effects observed in placebo and nocebo trials. For example, nocebo hyperalgesia was more easily induced via instructions than placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colloca et al., 2008</xref>) and tended to extinguish more slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colagiuri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colloca et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, in an experimental study involving healthy individuals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref> found that one session of conditioning was sufficient to induce a nocebo effect but not a placebo effect.</p><p>Stronger and more sustained nocebo effects are likely to be the result of a combination of different factors. Evolutionary psychology suggests that humans may have evolved to be more attuned to potential threats for survival. Negative information or expectations about harm may have carried more evolutionary significance, making individuals more sensitive to nocebo suggestions, a tendency often referred to as ‘better safe than sorry’. Confirmation for this assumption comes from brain imaging studies demonstrating a cognitive bias in which the brain tends to process negative information more readily than positive information. Moreover, negative expectations and fear tend to amplify sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">van der Schaaf et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Forkmann et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zika et al., 2023</xref>). When individuals anticipate a negative outcome, their attention is often heightened which makes them susceptible to perceiving symptoms, even in the absence of an actual stimulus. In line with this assumption, nocebo effects have been shown to lead to anticipatory anxiety and autonomic arousal which mediated the effect on extinction in an experimental learning model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colagiuri et al., 2015</xref>). It may be argued that the dominant nocebo effect observed in our study is the result of the stronger conditioning in the nocebo condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This asymmetry is noteworthy in and of itself because it occurred despite the equidistant stimulus calibration relative to the control condition prior to conditioning. It may be the result of different physiological effects of the stimuli over time or amplified learning in the nocebo condition, consistent with its heightened biological relevance, but it could also be a stronger effect of the verbal instructions in this condition. Importantly, the stronger nocebo effect observed on both test days remained significant even after accounting for the asymmetric conditioning effect, ruling out that conditioning differences alone explain the stronger nocebo effects. Instead, it suggests that the two effects may be induced and maintained by at least in part distinct mechanisms and temporal dynamics. Recent work using a predictive coding framework further suggests that nocebo effects may be less susceptible to prediction error than placebo effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hird et al., 2019</xref>), which could contribute to their greater persistence and strength in our study. This is supported by the observation that, similarly to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref>), a significant correlation between placebo and nocebo effects was found on day 1 but was no longer detectable at the follow-up 1 week later. Interestingly, our expectancy manipulation increased placebo expectations, but had no significant effect on nocebo expectations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, expectations were not correlated with actual placebo or nocebo effects on either test day. While this may seem surprising, it has recently been suggested that these correlations depend on whether expectations are measured in the same format as the pain experience or as a difference measure, as in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lunde et al., 2024</xref>). Further research is therefore needed to investigate the effects of assessment methods on such associations.</p><p>It is important to note that our study was designed in alignment with previous studies addressing similar questions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref>). Our primary aim was to directly compare placebo and nocebo effects in a within-subject design and assess their persistence of these effects 1 week following the first test session. One limitation of our approach is the relatively short duration of each session, which may have limited our ability to examine the trajectory of responses within a single session. Future studies could address this limitation by increasing the number of trials for a more comprehensive analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Past effects predict future effects</title><p>To explore the relative influence of expectations and prior experience in more detail, we conducted separate regression analyses for placebo and nocebo effects on both test days, using expectations and perceived effects as predictors. The analyses revealed that experienced pain reduction and increase were significant predictors of subsequent effects, especially for the placebo effect on days 1 and 8, and for the nocebo effect on day 8 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>). This highlights the strong impact of sensory experience on subsequent effects, in line with studies on learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atlas et al., 2016</xref>), meta-analyses of behavioural placebo analgesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vase et al., 2002</xref>), and previous studies on carry-over effects between analgesic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zunhammer et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the most recent experience was the most predictive in all three analyses; for instance, the placebo effect on day 8 was predicted by the placebo effect on day 1, not by the initial conditioning. This finding supports the Bayesian inference framework, where recent experiences are weighted more heavily in the process of model updating because they are more likely to reflect the current state of the environment, providing the most relevant and immediate information needed to guide future actions and predictions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Büchel et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, while a change in pain predicted subsequent nocebo effects, it seemed less influential than for placebo effects. This aligns with findings that longer conditioning enhanced placebo effects, while it did not affect nocebo responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref>) and the conclusion that nocebo instruction may be sufficient to trigger nocebo responses. Using Bayesian modelling, future studies could identify individual differences in the development of placebo and nocebo effects by integrating prior experiences and sensory inputs, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of psychological variables in immediate and sustained placebo and nocebo effects</title><p>Our extended regression models, incorporating psychological variables, highlight two interesting predictors: somatosensory amplification and perceived practitioner competence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1—table 2</xref>). Somatosensory amplification, described as a tendency to experience bodily symptoms as intense, noxious and disturbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doering et al., 2015</xref>), was associated with a weaker placebo effect on day 1. This may be due to higher-level evaluative processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakao et al., 2007</xref>), leading individuals to perceive symptoms as more threatening, which in turn diminishes the influence of cognitive processes that typically drive placebo effects. Additionally, our study suggests that nocebo effects can be linked to the perceived competence of the experimenter. While practitioner competence – alongside perceived warmth – usually enhances positive treatment expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seewald and Rief, 2024</xref>) and treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton-James et al., 2019</xref>), it might also make negative suggestions more convincing and thereby amplify nocebo responses through increased anxiety or hypervigilance. This finding underscores the dual-edged nature of competence in patient–practitioner interactions, where heightened credibility could inadvertently strengthen nocebo effects.</p><p>Our findings have important implications for clinical research and practice. First, they underscore the necessity of prolonged observation periods in clinical trials to accurately capture the durability of these effects. Second, they emphasise the importance of not dismissing early signs of nocebo effects as they may persist and undermine otherwise treatments if left unaddressed. Third, our findings advocate for a stronger focus on the prevention of nocebo effects. While considerable effort has been made to leverage placebo effects, it is equally – if not more – crucial to focus on minimising nocebo effects, which seem to be triggered more easily. Fortunately, nocebo effects can often be avoided by adopting simple, effective strategies to improve patient–practitioner communication. For example, positive framing, avoiding unnecessary focus on potential side effects or building a trusting relationship can reduce the likelihood of triggering nocebo effects. In a time where cost-effectiveness is paramount, and healthcare resources must be carefully allocated, prioritising the prevention of nocebo effects should be a key strategy to enhance treatment outcome and reduce overall healthcare costs.</p><p>In summary, our findings indicate that nocebo effects are indeed more than the flipside of a placebo effect and that the two phenomena may be sustained by distinct mechanisms. These insights shed light on the factors that exacerbate nocebo effects and underscore the importance of carefully managing communication in clinical and experimental settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>As there are no studies investigating within-subject effects that could provide indications for the relevant effect sizes, the study was powered to detect small effect sizes for the hypothesised differences between the placebo and nocebo condition (<italic>d</italic> = 0.2–0.25, <italic>α</italic> = 0.05, power = 0.95, <italic>N</italic> = 84–120).

The experiment was carried out on 2 days with an approximate duration of 3 hours on day 1 and 1 hour on day 8. On the first day (day 1), treatment expectations were induced using verbal instructions in combination with a conditioning procedure. During conditioning, participants learned to associate the presentation of one of three visual, differently coloured cues with a reduction of heat-induced pain through a (sham) ‘transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) device’ that was introduced as an analgesic treatment in the placebo condition. A second cue signalled an increase in pain in the nocebo condition, and the third cue signalled no change in pain in the control condition. As in previous studies using conditioning to induce placebo and nocebo effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colloca et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colloca and Benedetti, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Montgomery and Kirsch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Voudouris et al., 1990</xref>), unbeknownst to the participant, the heat stimulation was reduced from VAS 60 to VAS 40 in the placebo condition, increased to VAS 80 in the nocebo condition and left unchanged at VAS 60 in the control condition. In the subsequent first test session, the same moderate stimulation intensity of VAS 60 was used in all three conditions. To explore the longevity of the induced conditioned effects, participants underwent the same testing procedure but no conditioning a week later (day 8) with all three visual stimuli again followed by the same moderate temperature stimulation (VAS 60). Participants’ condition-specific treatment expectations and trial-by-trial pain intensity ratings were recorded as outcome measures. The study also comprised structural and functional MRI that took place on a separate day before day 1 (methods and data on this part will be reported elsewhere).</p><p>During the experiment, the participants were seated in a chair in front of a computer in a behavioural laboratory setting with a keyboard as response device.

During calibration, the initial stimulation intensity for 500 ms stimuli started at 0.9 mA and increased in increments of 0.1 mA until participants noticed a clear but non-painful sensation. This intensity was then tested by applying four 4-second stimuli. If participants rated at least two out of four of the stimuli between 25 and 35 on a VAS from 0 to 100 (anchors: 0 = not perceivable, 100 = unbearably painful; 25-35 equals perceivable but not painful), this final stimulation intensity was carried forward to be used throughout the test sessions.

First, we used the Method of Limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fruhstorfer et al., 1976</xref>) to determine the individual heat pain threshold (HPT) in three consecutive trials. In the subsequent calibration procedure, participants rated 21 noxious heat stimuli with varying temperature levels around the HPT (–1°C to 3.5°C) on a VAS with endpoints 0 (=‘not painful at all’) and 100 (=‘unbearably painful’). These ratings were entered into a linear regression (lm(VAS rating ~temperature)) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">R Development Core Team, 2021</xref> (except for the first rating due to familiarisation effects) to determine the temperature levels rated as VAS 40, 60, and 80. These temperatures were applied twice in a short subsequent test to ensure that the calculated heat levels induced the intended pain intensity. The 20-second contact heat pain stimuli were delivered using a Pathway advanced thermal stimulator with a 30 × 30 mm activation area (Pathway System, Medoc, Israel). The thermode was attached to one of three possible locations on the medial inner aspect of the left forearm using a tourniquet, maintaining a standardised distance of 3.5 cm from the electrode maintained via a template. To prevent sensitisation or habituation, three different stimulation sites were used. The thermode was moved to another of the three locations after calibration and conditioning, following a pseudorandomised order.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conditioning procedure</title><p>During the conditioning session, participants' expectations of pain relief and pain increase were modulated using verbal instructions and electrical stimulation coupled with coloured visual cues. Specifically, participants were told that the electrical stimulation would either increase pain (nocebo instruction), decrease pain (placebo instruction), or have no influence on their pain perception (control instruction) depending on the frequency of the stimulation. The direction of change would be indicated by the colour of a cross that was shown in the centre of the computer screen. A green cross indicated a decrease in pain (placebo condition), a red cross indicated an increase of pain (nocebo condition) and a yellow indicated no change (control condition). In fact, unbeknownst to the participants, in placebo trials the green cross was followed by low-intensity heat stimulation calibrated at VAS 40 to induce a sense of pain reduction through the electrical stimulation, whereas the red cross was followed by a high-intensity heat pain calibrated at VAS 80 for a sense of pain increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In control trials, the yellow cross was followed by a VAS 60 heat pain stimulus. This temperature manipulation was applied to all trials of the conditioning procedure, respectively. The order of conditions was pseudorandomised, and each trial type was repeated twelve times during the conditioning procedure. Due to a randomisation error, 25 participants received an unbalanced number of trials per condition (i.e. 10x VAS 40, 14x VAS 60, 12x VAS 80).

The blue cross appeared for 300 ms with a jittered onset at the beginning of each trial, that is, 0–5 s after trial onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Psychological questionnaires</title><p>Before calibration on day 1, participants completed the German version of the following questionnaires using an online survey system (LimeSurvey, LimeSurvey GmbH, Hamburg, Germany): the Generic Rating for Treatment Pre-Experiences, Treatment Expectations, and Treatment Effects (GEEE; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rief et al., 2021</xref>), the Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Doering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barsky et al., 1988</xref>), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2016</xref>), State-Trait-Anxiety-Depression-Inventory (STADI Trait; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laux et al., 2013</xref>), and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sullivan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>). Warmth and competence of the experimenter were assessed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seewald and Rief, 2024</xref> at the end of day 1. In short, participants were asked the question how the experimenter seemed to them and provided ratings on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (=not at all) to 5 (=extremely) for the following descriptors in German: ‘friendly’, ‘well-intentioned’, ‘trustworthy’, ‘warm’, ‘good-natured’, and ‘sincere’ to capture experimenter warmth and ‘competent’, ‘confident’, ‘capable’, ‘efficient’, ‘intelligent’, and ‘skilful’ for experimenter competence. The mean across items of each scale was used in further analyses.</p><p>Treatment expectation ratings using the GEEE and the emotional state using STADI State were also collected before conditioning, after conditioning, and before test session 2 on day 8. Treatment effects were rated after conditioning and after test sessions 1 and 2. Note that participants also completed the following questionnaires as part of a larger project: Fear of Pain Questionnaire III, Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation scales, 10-item Big Five Inventory, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. Responses to these questionnaires will be analysed elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analysed using SPSS (version 29.0.2.0). For each of the three conditions, mean pain intensity ratings for the calibration phase, conditioning phase and tests on days 1 and 8 were calculated across the trials of the respective phase. Nocebo effects were defined as the difference in pain intensity ratings between the nocebo and the control condition (nocebo – control), placebo effects as the difference between the control and the placebo condition (control – placebo). Comparisons of stimulation intensities and pain intensity ratings between conditions were carried out using repeated-measures ANOVAs with the within-subject factor <italic>Condition</italic> (placebo, nocebo, control) followed by post hoc Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons. To compare the magnitude and persistence of placebo and nocebo effects over time, an ANOVA with the within-subject factors <italic>Effect</italic> (placebo effect, nocebo effect) and <italic>Session</italic> (day 1, day 8) was used. The analysis of trial-by-trial ratings used an ANOVA with the within-subject factors <italic>Condition</italic> (placebo, nocebo, control) and <italic>Trial</italic> (trials 1–12). To account for interindividual differences in conditioning, the difference between the pain worsening and pain relief during the conditioning phase was entered as a covariate in the comparison of pain intensity ratings at days 1 and 8 (ANCOVA). Degrees of freedom were corrected using the Greenhouse–Geisser estimate of sphericity. To explore the relationship between placebo and nocebo effects on both test days, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient. Because expectancy ratings were not normally distributed, non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests were used to compare these ratings between conditions and timepoints and Spearman’s rho was calculated for correlations between pain intensity and expectancy ratings. All questionnaires were analysed according to their respective manuals.</p><p>Separate multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the influence of expectations (GEEE ratings) and experienced effects (VAS ratings) on subsequent placebo and nocebo effects. For day 1, the placebo effect was entered as the dependent variable and the following variables as potential predictors: (i) expected pain improvement with placebo before conditioning (i.e., placebo expectation), (ii) pain relief during conditioning, and (iii) the expected pain improvement with placebo before the test session at day 1. The equivalent analysis was conducted for the nocebo effect but with (i) expected pain worsening with nocebo before conditioning (i.e., nocebo expectation), (ii) pain worsening during conditioning, and (iii) the expected pain worsening with nocebo before the test session at day 1 as predictors.</p><p>To predict placebo responses a week later (VAS<sub>control</sub> – VAS<sub>placebo</sub> at day 8), the same independent variables were entered as for day 1 but with the following additional variables: (i) pain ratings during test trials at day 1 and (ii) the expected pain improvement with placebo before the test session at day 8. In the equivalent analysis for the nocebo effect on day 8 as dependent variable, we added (i) the nocebo effect at day 1 and (ii) the expected pain worsening with nocebo before the test session at day 8.</p><p>To explore whether psychological variables could explain additional variance in the regression analyses, we repeated all four analyses described above but included scores from these questionnaires as additional independent variables: SSAS, PSS-10, STADI trait, PCS, and experimenter warmth and competence scores.</p><p>In all analyses, a significance level of <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05 was used, and pairwise comparisons were conducted using two-tailed <italic>P</italic>-values. For all multiple regression analyses, the regression coefficient is reported.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Ethics approval was granted by the University Hospital Essen (22-10597-BO).

A third level was found for the control condition (M = 45.38°C, SD = 1.20). The three temperature levels were perceived as significantly different (VAS ratings; placebo condition: M = 32.90, SD = 16.17; nocebo condition: M = 80.84, SD = 12.18; control condition: M = 56.62, SD = 17.09; F(1.95, 200.86) = 466.70, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; control vs. placebo condition: <italic>t</italic>(103) = 15.85, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI, 20.74–26.68; nocebo vs. placebo condition: <italic>t</italic>(103) = 28.37, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI, 44.58–51.28; nocebo vs. control condition: <italic>t</italic>(103) = 16.0, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001, 95% CI, 21.22–27.22).

The study follows standard placebo experiment conventions with use of TENS stimulation as the placebo manipulation. The authors were able to achieve their aims. A key finding is that placebo and nocebo effects were predicted by recent experience, which is a novel contribution to the literature.

To address this question, they used a powerful within-participants design, with a very large sample size (n=104), in which they compared placebo and nocebo effects - within the same individuals - across verbal expectations, conditioning, testing phase, and a 1-week follow-up. With elegant analyses, they establish that different mechanisms underlie the learning of placebo vs nocebo effects, with the latter being acquired faster and extinguished slower. This is an important finding for both the basic understanding of learning mechanisms in humans and for potential clinical applications to improve human health.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Beyond the above - the paper is well-written and very clear. It lays out nicely the need for the current investigation and what implications it holds. The design is elegant, and the analyses are rich, thoughtful, and interesting.

The study follows standard placebo experiment conventions with the use of TENS stimulation as the placebo manipulation. The authors were able to achieve their aims. A key finding is that placebo and nocebo effects were predicted by recent experience, which is a novel contribution to the literature. The findings provide insights into the differences between placebo and nocebo effects and the potential moderators of these effects.</p><p>Specifically, the study aimed to:</p><p>(1) assess the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects immediately after induction through verbal instructions and conditioning</p><p>(2) examine the persistence of these effects one week later, and</p><p>(3) identify predictors of sustained placebo and nocebo responses over time.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>An innovation was to use sham TENS stimulation as the expectation manipulation. This expectation manipulation was reinforced not only by the change in pain stimulus intensity, but also by delivery of non-painful electrical stimulation, labelled as TENS stimulation.</p><p>Questionnaire-based treatment expectation ratings were collected before conditioning and after conditioning, and after the test session, which provided an explicit measure of participants' expectations about the manipulation.</p><p>The finding that placebo and nocebo effects are influenced by recent experience provides a novel insight into a potential moderator of individual placebo effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thorough evaluation of our manuscript and for highlighting the novelty and originality of our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are a limited number of trials per test condition (10), which means that the trajectory of responses to the manipulation may not be adequately explored.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment regarding the number of trials in the test phase. The trial number was chosen to ensure comparability with previous studies addressing similar research questions with similar designs (e.g. Colloca et al., 2010). Our primary objective was to directly compare placebo and nocebo effects within a within-subject design and to examine their persistence one week after the first test session. While we did not specifically aim to investigate the trajectory of responses within a single testing session, we fully agree that a comprehensive analysis of the trajectories of expectation effects on pain would be a valuable extension of our work. We have now acknowledged this limitation and future direction in the revised manuscript.</p><p>The paragraph reads as follows:“It is important to note that our study was designed in alignment with previous studies addressing similar questions (e.g., Colloca et al., 2010). Our primary aim was to directly compare placebo and nocebo effects in a within-subject design and assess their persistence of these effects one week following the first test session. One limitation of our approach is the relatively short duration of each session, which may have limited our ability to examine the trajectory of responses within a single session. Future studies could address this limitation by increasing the number of trials for a more comprehensive analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On day 8, one stimulus per stimulation intensity (i.e., VAS 40, 60, and 80) was applied before the start of the test session to re-familiarise participants with the thermal stimulation. There is a potential risk of revealing the manipulation to participants during the re-familiarization process, as they were not previously briefed to expect the painful stimulus intensity to vary without the application of sham TENS stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this point. Participants were informed at the beginning of the experiment that we would use different stimulation intensities to re-familiarize them with the stimuli before the second test session. We are therefore confident that participants perceived this step as part of a recalibration rather than associating it with the experimental manipulation. We have added this information to the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>The paragraph now reads as follows:“On day 8, one stimulus per stimulation intensity (i.e., VAS 40, 60 and 80) was applied before the start of the test session to re-familiarise participants with the thermal stimulation. Note that participants were informed that these pre-test stimuli were part of the recalibration and refamiliarization procedure conducted prior to the second test session.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The differences between the nocebo and control conditions in pain ratings during conditioning could be explained by the differing physiological effects of the different stimulus intensities, so it is difficult to make any claims about expectation effects here.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and agree that, despite the careful calibration of the three pain stimuli, we cannot entirely rule out the possibility that temporal dynamics during the conditioning session were influenced by differential physiological effects of the varying stimulus intensities (e.g., intensity-dependent habituation or sensitization). We have addressed this in the revision of the manuscript, but we would like to emphasize that the stronger nocebo effects during the test phase are statistically controlled for any differences in the conditioning session.</p><p>The paragraph now reads:“This asymmetry is noteworthy in and of itself because it occurred despite the equidistant stimulus calibration relative to the control condition prior to conditioning. It may be the result of different physiological effects of the stimuli over time or amplified learning in the nocebo condition, consistent with its heightened biological relevance, but it could also be a stronger effect of the verbal instructions in this condition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A randomisation error meant that 25 participants received an unbalanced number of 448 trials per condition (i.e., 10 x VAS 40, 14 x VAS 60, 12 x VAS 80).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is indeed unfortunate. However, we would like to point out that all analyses reported in the manuscript have been controlled for the VAS ratings in the conditioning session, i.e., potential effects of the conditioned placebo and nocebo stimuli. Moreover, we have now conducted additional analyses, presented here in our response to the reviewers, to demonstrate that this imbalance did not systematically bias the results. Importantly, the key findings observed during the test phase remain robust despite this issue.</p><p>Specifically, when excluding these 25 participants from the analyses, the reported stronger nocebo compared to placebo effects in the test session on day 1 remain unchanged. Likewise, the comparison of placebo and nocebo effects between days 1 and 8 shows the same pattern when excluding the participants in question. The only exception is the interaction between effect (placebo vs nocebo) x session (day 1 vs day 8), which changed from a borderline significant result (p = .049) to insignificant (p = .24). However, post hoc tests continued to show the same pattern as originally reported: a significant reduction in the nocebo effect from day 1 to day 8 and no significant change in the placebo effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kunkel et al aim to answer a fundamental question: Do placebo and nocebo effects differ in magnitude or longevity? To address this question, they used a powerful within-participants design, with a very large sample size (n=104), in which they compared placebo and nocebo effects - within the same individuals - across verbal expectations, conditioning, testing phase, and a 1-week follow-up. With elegant analyses, they establish that different mechanisms underlie the learning of placebo vs nocebo effects, with the latter being acquired faster and extinguished slower. This is an important finding for both the basic understanding of learning mechanisms in humans and for potential clinical applications to improve human health.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Beyond the above - the paper is well-written and very clear. It lays out nicely the need for the current investigation and what implications it holds. The design is elegant, and the analyses are rich, thoughtful, and interesting. The sample size is large which is highly appreciated, considering the longitudinal, in-lab study design. The question is super important and well-investigated, and the entire manuscript is very thoughtful with analyses closely examining the underlying mechanisms of placebo versus nocebo effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive evaluation of our manuscript and for acknowledging the methodological rigor and the significant implications for clinical applications and the broader research field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There were two highly addressable weaknesses in my opinion:</p><p>(1) I could not find the preregistration - this is crucial to verify what analyses the authors have committed to prior to writing the manuscript. Please provide a link leading directly to the preregistration - searching for the specified number in the suggested website yielded no results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We included a link to the preregistration in the revised manuscript. This study was pre-registered with the German Clinical Trial Register (registration number: DRKS00029228; https://drks.de/search/de/trial/DRKS00029228).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a recurring issue which is easy to address: because the Methods are located after the Results, many of the constructs used, analyses conducted, and even the main placebo and nocebo inductions are unclear, making it hard to appreciate the results in full. I recommend finding a way to detail at the beginning of the results section how placebo and nocebo effects have been induced. While my background means I am familiar with these methods, other readers will lack that knowledge. Even a short paragraph or a figure (like Figure 4) could help clarify the results substantially. For example, a significant portion of the results is devoted to the conditioning part of the experiment, while it is unknown which part was involved (e.g., were temperatures lowered/increased in all trials or only in the beginning).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comment and agree that the Results section requires additional information that would typically be provided by the Methods section if it directly followed the Introduction. In response, we have moved the former Figure 4 from the Methods section to the beginning of the Results section as a new Figure 1, to improve clarity. Further, we have revised the Methods section to explicitly state that all trials during the conditioning phase were manipulated in the same way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Given that the authors are claiming (correctly) that there is only limited work comparing placebo/nocebo effects, there are some papers missing from their citations:</p><p>Nocebo responses are stronger than placebo responses after subliminal pain conditioning - - Jensen, K., Kirsch, I., Odmalm, S., Kaptchuk, T.

We have now included it into the discussion of the revised manuscript by adding the following paragraph:</p><p>“Recent work using a predictive coding framework further suggests that nocebo effects may be less susceptible to prediction error than placebo effects (Hird et al., 2019), which could contribute to their greater persistence and strength in our study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The trial-by-trial pain ratings could have been usefully modelled with a computational model, such as a Bayesian model (this is especially pertinent given the reference to Bayesian processing in the discussion). A multilevel model could also be used to increase the power of the analysis. This is a tentative suggestion, as I appreciate it would require a significant investment of time and work - alternatively, the authors could acknowledge it in the Discussion as a useful future avenue for investigation, if this is preferred.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. While we agree that computational modelling approaches could provide valuable insights into individual learning, our study was not designed with this in mind and the relatively small number of trials per condition and the absence of trial-by-trial expectancy ratings limit the applicability of such models. We have therefore chosen not to pursue such analysis but highlight it in the discussion as a promising direction for future research.</p><p>“Notably, the most recent experience was the most predictive in all three analyses; for instance, the placebo effect on day 8 was predicted by the placebo effect on day 1, not by the initial conditioning. This finding supports the Bayesian inference framework, where recent experiences are weighted more heavily in the process of model updating because they are more likely to reflect the current state of the environment, providing the most relevant and immediate information needed to guide future actions and predictions24. Interestingly, while a change in pain predicted subsequent nocebo effects, it seemed less influential than for placebo effects. This aligns with findings that longer conditioning enhanced placebo effects, while it did not affect nocebo responses10 and the conclusion that nocebo instruction may be sufficient to trigger nocebo responses. Using Bayesian modeling, future studies could identify individual differences in the development of placebo and nocebo effects by integrating prior experiences and sensory inputs, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding the underlying mechanisms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The paper is missing any justification of sample size, i.e. power analysis - please include this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the missing information on our a priori power analysis. As there is a lack of prior studies investigating within-subjects comparisons of placebo and nocebo effects that could inform precise effect size estimates for our research question, we based our calculation on the ability detect small effects. Specifically, the study was powered to detect effect sizes in the range of d = 0.2 - 0.25 with α = .05 and power = .9, yielding a required sample size of N = 83-129. We have now added this information to the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) &quot;On day 8, one stimulus per stimulation intensity (i.e., VAS 40, 60 and 80) was applied before the start of the test session to re-familiarise participants with the thermal stimulation.&quot;</p><p>What were the instructions about this? Was it before the electrode was applied? This runs the risk of unblinding participants, as they only expect to feel changes in stimulus intensity due to the TENS stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the potential risk of unblinding participants due to the re-familiarization process prior to the second test session. We would like to clarify that we followed specific procedures to prevent participants from associating this process with the experimental manipulation. The re-familiarisation with the thermal stimuli was conducted after the electrode had been applied and re-tested to ensure that both stimulus modalities were re-introduced in a consistent and neutral context. Participants were explicitly informed that both procedures were standard checks prior to the actual test session (“We will check both once again before we begin the actual measurement.”). For the thermal stimuli, we informed participants that they would experience three different intensities to allow the skin to acclimate (e.g., “...we will test the heat stimuli in 3 trials with different temperatures, allowing your skin to acclimate to the stimuli. …”), without implying any connection to the experimental conditions.</p><p>Importantly, this re-familiarization procedure mirrored what participants had already experienced during the initial calibration session on day 1. We therefore assume that participants interpreted as a routine technical step rather than part of the experimental manipulation. We have now clarified this procedure in the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) &quot;For a comparison of pain intensity ratings between time-points, an ANOVA with the within-subject factors Condition (placebo, nocebo, control) and Session (day 1, day 8) was carried out.

To avoid confusion, the Condition x Session ANOVA has been removed from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please can the authors provide a figure illustrating trial-by-trial ratings during test trials as well as during conditioning trials?</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s point, we now provide the trial-by-trial ratings of the test phases on days 1 and 8 as an additional figure in the Supplement (Figure S1) and would like to clarify that trial-by-trial pain intensity ratings of the conditioning phase are displayed in Figure 2C of the manuscript,</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) &quot;Separate multiple linear regression analyses were performed to examine the influence of expectations (GEEE ratings) and experienced effects (VAS ratings) on subsequent placebo and nocebo effects.

All other participants reported minimum values of VAS 11 or higher (all on a scale from 0-100). Thus, no participant provided a pain rating of VAS 0, and all ratings indicated some level of pain perception in response to the stimulus. We did not define an exclusion criterion based on day 8 pain ratings in our preregistration, and we did not observe any technical issues with the stimulation procedure.

We used the Generic rating scale for previous treatment experiences, treatment expectations, and treatment effects (GEEE questionnaire, Rief et al. 2021) that discriminates between expected symptom improvement, expected symptom worsening, and expected side effects due to a treatment.

We therefore now introduce the relevant publication (Doering et al., 2015) before reporting our findings on this concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In line 169, if the authors want to specify what portion of the variance was explained by expectancy, they could conduct a hierarchical regression, where they first look at R2 without the expectancy entered, and only then enter it to obtain the R2 change.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that hierarchical regression can be a useful approach for isolating the contribution of variables. However, in our case, expectancy was assessed at different time points (e.g., before conditioning and before the test session on day 1), and there was no principled rationale for determining the order in which these different expectancy-related variables should be entered into a hierarchical model.</p><p>That said, in response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have now conducted hierarchical regression analyses in which all expectancy-related variables were entered together as a single block (see below). These analyses largely confirmed the findings reported so far and are provided here in the response to the reviewers below. Given the exploratory nature of this grouping and the lack of an a priori hierarchy, we feel that the standard multiple regression models remain the most appropriate for addressing our research question because it allows us to evaluate the total contribution of expectancy-related predictors while also examining the individual contribution of each variable within the block. We would therefore prefer to retain these as the primary analyses in the manuscript.</p><p>Results of the hierarchical regression analyses:</p><p>Day 1 - Placebo response: In step 1, we entered the difference in pain intensity ratings between the control and the placebo condition during conditioning as a predictor. In step 2, we added the two variables reflecting expectations (i.e., expected improvement with placebo (i) before conditioning and (ii) before the test session on day 1). This allowed us to assess whether expectation-related variables explained additional variance beyond the effect of conditioning.</p><p>The overall regression model at step 1 was significant, F(1, 102) = 13.42, p &lt; .001, explaining 11.6% of the variance in the dependent variable (R<sup>2</sup> = .116). Adding the expectancy-related predictors in step 2 did not lead to a significant increase in explained variance, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = .007, F(2, 100) = 0.384, p = .682. Thus, the conditioning response significantly predicted placebo-related pain reduction on day 1, but additional information on expectations did not account for further variance.</p><p>Day 1 - Nocebo response: The equivalent analysis was run for the nocebo response on day 1. In step 1, the pain intensity difference between the nocebo and the control condition was entered as a predictor before adding the two expectancy ratings (i.e., expected worsening with nocebo (i) before conditioning and (ii) before the test session on day 1).</p><p>In step 1, the regression model was not statistically significant, F(1, 102) = 2.63, p = .108, and explained only 2.5% of the variance in nocebo response (R<sup>2</sup> = .025). Adding the expectation-related predictors in Step 2 slightly increased the explained variance by ΔR<sup>2</sup> = .027, but this change was also non-significant, F(2, 100) = 1.41, p = .250. The overall variance explained by the full model remained low (R<sup>2</sup> = .052). These results suggest that neither conditioning nor expectation-related variables reliably predicted nocebo-related pain increases on day 1.</p><p>Day 8 - Placebo response: For the prediction of the placebo effect on day 8, the following variables reflecting perceived effects were entered as predictors in step 1: the difference in pain intensity ratings between the control and the placebo condition (i) during conditioning and (ii) on day 1. In step 2, the variables reflecting expectations were added: the expected improvement with placebo (i) before conditioning, (ii) before the test session on day 1 and (iii) before the test session on day 8.</p><p>In step 1, the model was statistically significant, F(3, 95) = 14.86, p &lt; .001, explaining 23.8% of the variance in the placebo response (R<sup>2</sup> = .238, Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = .222). In step 2, the addition of the expectation-related predictors resulted in a non-significant improvement in model fit, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = .051, F(3, 92) = 2.21, p = .092. The overall variance explained by the full model increased modestly to 29.0%.</p><p>Day 8 - Nocebo response: For the equivalent analyses of nocebo responses on day 8, the following variables were included in step 1: the difference in pain intensity ratings between the nocebo and the control condition (i) during conditioning and (ii) on day 1. In step 2, we entered the variables reflecting nocebo expectations including expected worsening with nocebo (i) before conditioning, (ii) before the test session on day 1 and (iii) before the test session on day 8.In step 1, the model significantly predicted the day 8 nocebo response, F(3, 95) = 6.04, p = .003, accounting for 11.3% of the variance (R<sup>2</sup> = .113, Adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = .094). However, the addition of expectation-related predictors in Step 2 resulted in only a negligible and non-significant improvement, ΔR<sup>2</sup> = .006, F(3, 92) = 0.215, p = .886. The full model explained just 11.9% of the variance (R<sup>2</sup> = .119).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typos:</p><p>(6) Abstract - 104 heathy xxx (word missing).</p><p>(7) Line 61 - reduce or decrease - I think you meant increase.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have now corrected both sentences.</p><p>References</p><p>Colloca L, Petrovic P, Wager TD, Ingvar M, Benedetti F.
