lymphocytes. The canonical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) HLA class I assembly pathway enables presentation of cytosolic peptides, but effective intracellular surveillance requires multi-compartmental antigen sampling. Endo-lysosomes are generally sites of HLA class II assembly, but human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) also contain significant reserves of endo-lysosomal HLA class I molecules. We hypothesized variable influences of HLA class I polymorphisms upon outcomes of endo-lysosomal trafficking, as the stabilities and peptide occupancies of cell surface HLA class I molecules are variable. Consistent with this model, when the endo-lysosomal pH of moDCs is disrupted, HLA-B allotypes display varying propensities for reductions in surface expression, with HLA-B*08:01 or HLA-B*35:01 being among the most resistant or sensitive, respectively, among eight tested HLA-B allotypes. Perturbations of moDC endo-lysosomal pH result in accumulation of HLA-B*35:01 in LAMP1<sup>+</sup> compartments and increase HLA-B*35:01 peptide receptivity. These findings reveal the intersection of the vacuolar cross-presentation pathway with a constitutive assembly pathway for some HLA-B allotypes. Notably, cross-presentation of epitopes derived from two soluble antigens was also more efficient for B*35:01 compared to B*08:01, even when matched for T cell response sensitivity, and more affected by cathepsin inhibition. Thus, HLA class I polymorphisms dictate the degree of endo-lysosomal assembly, which can supplement ER assembly for constitutive HLA class I expression and increase the efficiency of cross-presentation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>antigen presentation</kwd><kwd>cross-presentation</kwd><kwd>HLA class I</kwd><kwd>endo-lysosomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1AI044115</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Malini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AI64025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raghavan</surname><given-names>Malini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Herman and Dorothy Miller Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Olson</surname><given-names>Eli</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA class I) polymorphisms dictate the degree of endo-lysosomal assembly, which can supplement endoplasmic reticulum assembly for constitutive HLA class I expression and increase the efficiency of cross-presentation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I) molecule is responsible for providing nearly all cells in the body with the capability for intracellular immune surveillance. This is accomplished by presenting intracellular peptides on the cell surface, where they are recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bjorkman and Parham, 1990</xref>). CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that have been properly selected in the thymus do not react to self-derived peptides but may recognize and activate in response to foreign antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2014</xref>). Assembly of MHC class I complexes with peptides typically occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where nascent MHC class I heavy chains are synthesized and associated with the invariant β<sub>2</sub>m light chain. This is followed by their binding to a complex of chaperones known as the peptide loading complex (PLC), in close association with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), a dimeric peptide transporter that brings cytosolically processed peptides into the ER for peptide loading. Upon successful assembly, MHC class I complexes are sufficiently stabilized so that they can release from the PLC and traffic to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Raghavan and Geng, 2015</xref>). Assembly is a highly coordinated and regulated process that is often targeted by viruses and cancers to escape immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen and Bouvier, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Verweij et al., 2015</xref>); thus highlighting the importance of efficient assembly and surface MHC class I expression.</p><p>Human MHC class I (human leukocyte antigen class I [HLA class I]) heavy chains are encoded by three highly polymorphic genes: <italic>HLA-A</italic>, <italic>HLA-B</italic>, and <italic>HLA-C</italic>, with <italic>HLA-B</italic> being the most polymorphic of the three. The high polymorphisms enable the presentation of diverse antigens to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). The polymorphisms also result in divergent assembly, stability, and expression variations among allotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>) as well as peptide repertoire differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Falk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sarkizova et al., 2020</xref>). Several HLA class I allotypes can assemble independently of tapasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>), a key PLC component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2013</xref>). Tapasin is known to edit the HLA class I peptide repertoire toward high-affinity sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rizvi and Raghavan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wearsch and Cresswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Bouvier, 2007</xref>), and tapasin-deficient cells have lower cell surface HLA class I stability than their wild type counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garbi et al., 2003</xref>). Allotypes that can assemble independently of tapasin may generally contain suboptimal peptide repertoires, resulting in complexes that are less stable (more rapidly endocytosed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zagorac et al., 2012</xref>) and more peptide receptive on the cell surface (a phenotype induced by suboptimal peptide loading; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumacher et al., 1990</xref>). Additionally, some HLA-B allotypes are mismatched with TAP in their peptide-binding specificities, which can contribute to suboptimal peptide loading in the ER and resulting reduction in cell-surface stability and expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Following the expression on the cell surface via the secretory pathway, MHC class I molecules are endocytosed, sorted, and recycled to the cell surface or trafficked to lysosomes for degradation. These are well-studied processes that are likely to be important in antigen presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells that have specialized endosomal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montealegre and van Endert, 2018</xref>). While some studies have provided evidence for endosomal recycling and assembly in constitutive HLA class I induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacAry et al., 2001</xref>), the major immunologically relevant role for HLA class I recycling is thought to be in antigen cross-presentation, which involves the presentation of exogenous antigens via MHC class I molecules. Endosomal/phagosomal digestion of exogenous antigens and assembly with recycling class I molecules (the vacuolar pathway) is one pathway for HLA class I assembly during cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbert et al., 2020</xref>). While MHC class I endosomal recycling has been well studied in APC in the context of cross-presentation, there is little data on the contributions of endosomal assembly to constitutive HLA class I surface expression, and on whether HLA class I polymorphisms result in different efficiencies of or dependencies on endosomal assembly. The conditions for peptide binding within endosomal and phagosomal compartments are quite different compared to canonical assembly in the ER due to lower compartmental pH within endo-lysosomes and the lack of ER chaperones and PLC components. Based on the marked variations in ER assembly characteristics of HLA class I allotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Peh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rizvi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geng et al., 2018</xref>) and known variabilities in cell surface stability and peptide occupancy among HLA-B allotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized differences in the outcomes of endocytic trafficking and assembly in HLA class I allotype and cell type-dependent manners. This was further investigated using primary human monocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Variable effects of endo-lysosomal pH disruption on surface expression of HLA-B allotypes in moDCs</title><p>We examined whether the disruption of endo-lysosomal pH with bafilomycin, an inhibitor of the V-ATPase responsible for maintaining the endo-lysosomal pH gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forgac, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lafourcade et al., 2008</xref>), would differentially affect the cell surface expression levels of individual HLA-B allotypes. All HLA-B allotypes can be grouped into either the HLA-Bw4 or HLA-Bw6 serotypes, which are recognized by specific antibodies. For the first set of analyses, donors who express one HLA-B-Bw6 and one HLA-B-Bw4 were chosen. Whereas some HLA-A allotypes are recognized by anti-Bw4, donors were selected such that no cross-reactive HLA-A allotypes were expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>). Some HLA-C allotypes are also recognized by anti-Bw6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>), but donor selection ensured the absence of more than one cross-reactive HLA-C for each HLA-B with a Bw6 epitope (Groups 1–8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Previous studies suggest that HLA-C protein expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is at least four- to sixfold lower than HLA-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apps et al., 2015</xref>). The significant dominance of HLA-B protein expression relative to HLA-C protein expression (&gt;fourfold for surface and &gt;threefold for total) was confirmed by comparisons of anti-HLA-Bw6 signals in moDCs from three sets of donors expressing either HLA-B or HLA-C allotypes with Bw6 epitopes, but not both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, in the selected donors (Groups 1–8, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the dominant signals measured by anti-Bw6 or anti-Bw4 arise from individual HLA-B allotypes of interest, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Endosomal pH disruption by bafilomycin has been shown previously to slow receptor recycling to the surface, but not internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson et al., 1993</xref>). The responses of four common HLA-Bw6 allotypes (B*07:02, B*08:01, B*15:01, and B*35:01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and four common HLA-Bw4 allotypes (B*27:05, B*51:01, B*44:02, and B*57:01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) to a 4-hr time course of bafilomycin treatment were examined in moDCs. The HLA-B allotypes display a range of sensitivities to bafilomycin for their cell surface expression. Some allotypes, such as B*08:01 and B*44:02, largely resist downregulation by bafilomycin, while others, such as B*35:01 and B*57:01, are highly sensitive to downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). B*35:01 is consistently highly sensitive to bafilomycin treatment, aligning with its better capability for tapasin and TAP-independent assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). However, relative PLC independence does not fully explain the bafilomycin trends, as the highly PLC-dependent allotype B*57:01 is similarly sensitive to bafilomycin treatment as B*35:01. B*57:01 is distinguished by its relatively diverse peptidome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>), and furthermore, abacavir, an anti-HIV drug, is able to permeate into the peptide-binding site of B*57:01 and alter its peptide repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Illing et al., 2012</xref>). These and other characteristics of B*57:01 could underlie a superior peptide exchange potential of B*57:01. Finally, internalization of HLA class I molecules is dependent on the cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capps et al., 1989</xref>), and for HLA-A and HLA-B molecules, is specifically modulated via a cryptic sorting motif with the conserved tyrosine Y<sup>320</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Le Gall et al., 1998</xref>). However, there are no significant differences between the tails of B*08:01, B*35:01, B*44:02, and B*57:01, other than a C<sup>325</sup>S polymorphism present in B*35:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). It is unknown whether this variation at AA 325 affects HLA class I endocytosis and sorting. While multiple mechanisms could contribute to the variable bafilomycin sensitivity of HLA-B allotypes, overall, the analyses of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref> reveal that a subset of HLA-B allotypes are more reliant on proper endo-lysosomal pH and trafficking for maintaining their constitutive cell surface expression in moDCs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Varying human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B) dependencies on endo-lysosomal pH for surface expression on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs).</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) moDCs from select donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were treated with bafilomycin A1 over a 4-hr time course and stained with monoclonal anti-Bw6 (<bold>A</bold>) or anti-Bw4 (<bold>B</bold>) antibodies to measure surface HLA-B.

The HC10 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stam et al., 1990</xref>) that recognizes ‘open’ HLA class I was used. To verify that this antibody can be used to measure peptide receptivity and loading for both allotypes, we performed a bead-based in vitro assay. Purified B*08:01 and B*35:01 monomers pre-loaded with low-affinity peptides (DAN or APL, respectively) were incubated with allotype-specific peptides of medium- (GPK and EPL, respectively, for B*08:01 and B*35:01) or high affinity (FLR and HPV, respectively, for B*08:01 and B*35:01). Both allotypes efficiently exchange the high-affinity peptide at pH 6–7, indicated by the reduction in HC10 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Significantly smaller but measurable reductions in HC10 signals were also observed with the low-affinity peptides. Thus, HC10 is responsive to peptide loading by both B*08:01 and B*35:01.</p><p>To assess B*08:01 and B*35:01 peptide receptivity in moDCs, their specific peptides were incubated with relevant donor cells for 4 hr.

Peptide binding to the moDC HLA-B was measured as the reduction in HC10 signal by specific peptide relative to control peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>). When moDCs were pulsed with two sets of specific and control peptides, B*35:01 was in general receptive to peptide, whereas B*08:01 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). A similar trend was previously observed in lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>) that have greater HLA class I half-lives compared with moDCs (see Discussions below); thus, more rapid internalization of HLA-Bw6 in moDCs compared to other leukocytes is not explained by suboptimal peptide loading per se. Additionally, B*35:01 peptide receptivity on moDCs is somewhat temperature sensitive, as incubation with peptide at 4°C reduced the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This finding indicates that at least a portion of the peptide binding may occur in the endosomal compartments, since 4°C incubation inhibits endocytic trafficking. Additionally, peptide binding may occur in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or Golgi apparatus, as peptide-receptive MHC class I conformers have been observed in the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Day et al., 1995</xref>), corresponding with observed endosome-to-TGN retrograde recycling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johannes and Popoff, 2008</xref>).

HLA class I is known to traffic constitutively through the endosomal system, first entering the EEA1<sup>+</sup> early endosomes and from there either recycling through the Rab11<sup>+</sup> recycling endosome back to the surface or routing to the lysosome for degradation. Additional trafficking pathways have been described for DCs and other professional antigen-presenting cells, particularly branching from a Rab11<sup>+</sup> perinuclear storage compartment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montealegre and van Endert, 2018</xref>).

Overall, human moDCs are more poised for HLA-Bw6 endosomal assembly and re-expression on the surface compared to monocytes, which fit the more differentiated and specialized state of moDCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Bafilomycin induces moDC B*35:01 accumulation in lysosomes and reduces its peptide occupancy</title><p>To further examine and compare HLA-B assembly within endo-lysosomal compartments of monocytes with moDCs, monocytes were treated over a time course with bafilomycin, and surface HLA-B expression was measured by flow cytometry and compared with the results from moDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>; a subset of the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for B*0801 and B*35:01 are replotted as histograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

These results are in line with the high lysosomal accumulation of HLA-Bw6 observed with confocal microscopy <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; thus, it seems that the increase in lysosomal pH with bafilomycin treatment rescues the HLA-B in this compartment from degradation, particularly in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conversely, as noted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, HLA-Bw6 expression was unchanged in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs after bafilomycin treatment, whereas B*35:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs decreased their HLA-Bw6 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; a subset of the data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> for B*08:01 and B*35:01 are replotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These findings indicate that, unlike in monocytes, low endo-lysosomal pH is important for maintaining B*35:01 surface expression in moDCs. A gradient of V-ATPase subunits is present along the endosomal pathway, with the highest number of active complexes present in the lysosomes and lowest amount present in early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lafourcade et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, it is likely that assembly and trafficking through the entire endo-lysosomal pathway are perturbed by bafilomycin treatment, which negatively affects B*35:01 in moDCs.

Representative images do not show obvious changes in HLA-Bw6 or LAMP1 distribution throughout the cell after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, quantifications indicate increased HLA-Bw6 co-localization with LAMP1<sup>+</sup> lysosomes upon treatment with bafilomycin in B*35:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs, but not in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Additionally, in the untreated condition, there is higher steady-state HLA-Bw6 localization to lysosomes in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs compared with B*35:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs. Bafilomycin treatment increases HLA-Bw6/LAMP1 co-localization in B*35:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs to the B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDC levels. Bafilomycin treatment generally has no effect on HLA-Bw6/Rab11 co-localization in B*35:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), and while object-based co-localization analyses indicate increased co-localization of HLA-Bw6 with Rab11 in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), the Pearson’s correlation analyses do not support this conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

To assess changes to β<sub>2</sub>m-heavy chain heterodimers in bafilomycin-treated cells, we used the monoclonal antibody BBM.1 as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Via a beads-based assay similar to that described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, peptide binding increased the BBM.1 signal (likely resulting from stabilization of β<sub>2</sub>m association with heavy chains and beads in the presence of peptides), particularly at more neutral pH values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). When peptide receptivity experiments were repeated in moDCs with the BBM.1 antibody, in contrast to the HC10-based assays, the addition of specific peptide did not significantly alter the surface BBM.1 signal in B*35:01 donors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Additionally, moDC bafilomycin treatment did not change the surface BBM.1 signal in response to specific peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Based on the considerable global loss of surface BBM.1 signal following bafilomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), the peptide receptivity of individual allotypes is expected to be harder to detect with BBM.1, which likely recognizes multiple classical and non-classical heavy chain-β<sub>2</sub>m heterodimers of the moDCs. In contrast, the smaller and specific allotype-induced changes to the HC10 signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>) are more readily detectable.</p><p>Together, the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> indicates that raising the endo-lysosomal pH via bafilomycin treatment results in reduced surface expression and enhanced lysosomal accumulation of B*35:01, which are coincident with accumulation of more peptide-receptive B*35:01 conformers. HLA-Bw6 surface expression is unaffected by bafilomycin in B*08:01<sup>+</sup> moDCs. Thus, endosomal pH-dependent processes are required by B*35:01, but not B*08:01, for maintaining optimal constitutive expression in moDCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Monocytes and moDCs differ in exogenous antigen uptake efficiencies and processing pathways</title><p>Human moDCs are shown to process and assemble antigens for cross-presentation in their endo-lysosomal (vacuolar) compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang-Huau et al., 2018</xref>), a pathway we predicted would be more permissive for B*35:01 based on the results described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. An additional cytosolic pathway of antigen degradation during cross-presentation has also been well characterized and primarily uses the proteasome for peptide processing after antigen translocation from the endosome/phagosome to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colbert et al., 2020</xref>). Although not much work has been done to investigate antigen processing by monocytes, it is generally believed that differentiation into DCs is required for induction of monocyte cross-presentation function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Döring et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this view, monocytes and moDCs uptake soluble antigen to different extents, with greater moDC endocytosis of fluorescently labeled bovine serum albumin over a 60-min time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To study processing of endocytosed antigen, we used DQ-Ova as a model for antigen degradation. DQ-Ova is a soluble ovalbumin protein labeled with excess, self-quenching BODIPY fluorophores, which become fluorescent upon proteolytic cleavage of the protein. After DQ-Ova pulsing at either 37 or 4°C for 30 min, the cells were chased in media or media + inhibitors, followed by fixation and flow cytometric analysis. When monocytes were chased with lysosome or proteasome inhibitors and normalized to untreated cells, antigen degradation was completely inhibited by bafilomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). MG132 inhibition of the proteasome had no effect, while the inhibitor combination inhibited similarly to bafilomycin alone.

In contrast to monocytes, bafilomycin did not completely block DQ-Ova degradation, and the combination of MG132 and bafilomycin further reduced the degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). As bafilomycin increases the lysosomal pH and inhibits most pH-sensitive proteases present in this compartment, the upregulation of lysosomal degradation by MG132 treatment cannot increase the antigen degradation in the MG132 + bafilomycin combination treatment as seen with MG132 alone. Thus, for soluble protein degradation, moDCs use both cytosolic and lysosomal pathways. Additionally, the extent of lysosomal degradation of antigen differs between moDCs and monocytes, as bafilomycin alone inhibits monocyte antigen degradation to a greater extent than moDCs. Increased uptake and reduced proteolysis within the endo-lysosomal compartments upon moDC differentiation could explain why some endocytosed antigen undergo proteasomal processing in these cells, as more protein may be preserved for export from endosome to cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cross-presentation via B*35:01 is more efficient than B*08:01 even when matched for T cell response sensitivity and is more affected by cathepsin inhibition</title><p>Since endo-lysosomal antigen degradation occurs in both monocytes and moDCs, we further examined the model that B*35:01 could have cross-presentation advantages in both monocytes and moDCs due to its increased propensity both for constitutive endo-lysosomal assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and assembly with exogenous peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To perform cross-presentation assays with human cells, we took advantage of the fact that memory cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) specific for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antigens are broadly prevalent in humans. Two EBV proteins contain known epitopes for both B*08:01 (RAKFKQLL [RAK] and FLRGRAYGL [FLR]) and B*35:01 (EPLPQGQLTAY [EPL] and YPLHEQHGM [YPL]).

Peptide titration experiments with the CTLs demonstrated varied sensitivities of each CTL line to peptide, with B*35:01-YPL eliciting the most sensitive response and B*08:01-RAK the least sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). B*08:01-FLR and B*35:01-EPL CTLs displayed similar sensitivities to peptide. For a given HLA class I allotype, the epitopes with lower response sensitivities have relatively lower predicted affinities for HLA class I (B*08:01-RAK, IC<sub>50</sub> 366 nM and B*35:01-EPL, IC<sub>50</sub> 534 nM) compared with the epitopes with the higher response sensitivities, which have higher predicted affinities (B*08:01-FLR, IC<sub>50</sub> 7 nM and B*35:01-YPL, IC<sub>50</sub> 19 nM). This is likely due to lower cell surface levels achieved of the lower-affinity complexes. Consistent with the greater peptide receptivity for B*35:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the T cell response sensitivity achieved with the lower-affinity B*35:01-EPL epitope was similar to that achieved with the higher-affinity B*08:01-FLR epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Cross-presentation of epitopes derived from Epstein-Barr virus proteins by B*35:01 compared to B*08:01.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) B*08:01-RAK cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from donor 9, B*08:01-FLR CTLs from donor 9, B*35:01-EPL CTLs from donor 16, and B*35:01-YPL CTLs from donor 40 were used in peptide titration experiments to measure sensitivity to peptide.

As these are both lower-affinity peptides for the respective HLA-B compared with FLR and YPL, the peptide activation of both BZLF1 epitopes is less sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), offering conditions to examine cross-presentation differences when lower cell-surface epitope expression is expected to be achieved. Cross-presentation of the RAK epitope was minimal in monocytes but more detectable in moDCs, while the EPL epitope was more readily cross-presented in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Although there are no allotype-dependent differences in peptide-mediated activation in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>), the B*35:01-EPL epitope from the whole BZLF1 antigen activates CTLs to a greater extent than the B*08:01-RAK epitope within the same experiments and same donor APC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The B*35:01-EPL advantage for cross-presentation persists when normalized to peptide activation levels within each experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Although significance was not achieved for cathepsin inhibition of the B*35:01-YPL response in moDCs, there was a trend toward inhibition. The generally greater sensitivity to CTI1 treatment indicates that B*35:01 uses the vacuolar (endo-lysosomal) pathway of cross-presentation in combination with the cytosolic pathway. The ability to use both the vacuolar and cytosolic pathways of assembly for generating B*35:01-EPL epitopes could explain the higher efficiency of B*35:01-EPL cross-presentation relative to B*08:01-FLR in moDCs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings, along with previous studies on HLA class I polymorphisms, provide evidence that assembly characteristics associated with various allotypes confer unique advantages and disadvantages for antigen presentation, depending on the cellular environment. In our study, we observe that human monocytes and moDCs differ in their endo-lysosomal pathways, and that HLA-B allotypes vary in their utilization of these pathways. Compared with monocytes, HLA-B has a similar half-life on the surface of moDCs but is less co-localized with LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Furthermore, moDC B*35:01 is peptide-receptive while B*08:01 is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that suboptimal peptide loading of HLA class I is not a global characteristic of moDCs that accounts for shorter moDC half-lives compared to lymphocytes. While previous studies have shown that optimal peptide loading and complex conformation are one set of determinants for cell surface HLA class I stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ljunggren et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schumacher et al., 1990</xref>), the present findings suggest that cell-type dependent variations in endocytosis, endocytic maturation, and recycling, could also constitute key determinants of cell surface HLA class I residence time. These studies also place into context our previous findings that relative surface expression levels of individual HLA-B molecules are both cell- and allotype-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>), a complex product of individual allotype-dependent assembly characteristics and cellular features. Thus, all relative HLA class I expression measurements must be defined in the context of specific cell types.</p><p>While it is unclear what specialized factors contribute to the enhanced endocytosis of HLA-Bw6 in moDCs, this is likely a mechanism to promote endo-lysosomal antigen sampling. This hypothesis is validated by the greater co-localization of HLA-Bw6 with Rab11<sup>+</sup> endosomes in moDCs compared to other endo-lysosomal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This differs from monocytes, which have more HLA-Bw6 co-localization with LAMP1<sup>+</sup> lysosomes. Greater lysosomal HLA-B localization in monocytes may be a result of enhanced endosome maturation to lysosomes and degradation of endocytosed conformers, as evidenced by the increase in surface HLA-Bw6 upon bafilomycin treatment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Monocytes thus appear more poised for lysosomal degradation due to more rapid endosome to lysosome maturation, which is disrupted by bafilomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bayer et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to monocytes, moDCs appear more poised for HLA-B endosomal assembly, particularly for allotypes such as B*35:01 and B*57:01. As Rab11<sup>+</sup> endosomes are important storage compartments for MHC class I assembly in APCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Montealegre and van Endert, 2018</xref>), the pool of HLA-B present here is indicative of a change in the endosomal system from monocytes for more efficient assembly. Indeed, our data suggest that bafilomycin treatment decreases B*35:01 surface expression because of an inhibitory effect on assembly, as the treatment results both in increased peptide-receptive B*35:01 complexes and greater lysosomal B*35:01 accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These findings are the first to our knowledge to demonstrate allotype-dependent differences in constitutive endo-lysosomal assembly of bulk HLA class I proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated MHC class I assembly with endogenous transmembrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tiwari et al., 2007</xref>) and endogenous HSV-1 antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">English et al., 2009</xref>) via the endo-lysosomes, and we predict in the context of our findings that presentation of these and other related antigens is allotype-dependent.</p><p>Beyond elucidating differences in endogenous HLA-B assembly in the endo-lysosomal system, our findings extend to assembly differences with exogenous antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). The efficiency of cross-presentation is generally higher for B*35:01 when comparing responses to the same exogenous antigens in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–H</xref>), and when comparing across antigens matched for response sensitivities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, monocyte B*35:01-EPL, B*35:01-YPL, and moDC B*35:01-EPL cross-presentation responses all display significant sensitivity to both cathepsin and proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), whereas B*08:01 responses are generally only significantly sensitive to MG132 or lactacystin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that B*35:01 compared to B*08:01 can better exploit vacuolar degradation in monocytes and moDCs to acquire exogenous antigen and thus has greater ability to use multiple (cytosolic and vacuolar) cross-presentation pathways. The locations of processing and assembly may be matched as well; while cathepsins are generally found in lysosomes, cathepsin S has been found located in early endosomal compartments of monocytes and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 2002</xref>). The overall characteristics of B*35:01 that confer the advantages for endo-lysosomal assembly with both endogenous and exogenous antigens include the presence of peptide-receptive forms of B*35:01 to assemble with endosomal-localized antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Greater efficiency of B*35:01 peptide exchange likely produces more peptide-HLA complexes with EBV peptides that can recycle to the cell surface, increasing the probability of CTLs encountering cognate antigen. Endosomal assembly may also be facilitated by the capability of HLA-B*35:01 to assemble independently of chaperones and factors that are primarily ER localized.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model for B*35:01 endo-lysosomal assembly pathways in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs).</title><p>HLA-B*35:01 is assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where a greater abundance of suboptimal peptides is predicted to be present due to a mismatch between transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) specificity and that of B*35:01. The tapasin-independent mode of assembly of B*35:01 could allow for the escape of a fraction of suboptimally loaded B*35:01 from the peptide loading complex (PLC) and ER quality control. Suboptimal B*35:01 complexes on the cell surface are endocytosed. Some B*35:01 molecules are trafficked to Rab11<sup>+</sup> storage/recycling endosomes or another endosomal compartment where they can be re-assembled with endosomally processed endogenous antigens and recycled to the surface. In a competing pathway, empty or suboptimal conformers are trafficked to lysosomes for degradation. B*35:01 is also recruited from the Rab11<sup>+</sup> compartment or another endosomal compartment to antigen-containing endosomes, where exogenous antigens are processed in a cathepsin S-dependent manner. B*35:01 can exchange exogenous peptides within these endosomes, followed by recycling back to the cell surface. moDCs can also transport exogenous antigen to the cytosol for proteasomal processing followed by conventional TAP-dependent assembly.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79144-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Aside from allotype-dependent differences in cross-presentation efficiencies and pathways, our studies provide important insights into cross-presentation differences between monocytes and moDCs. Whereas resting monocytes are considered non-permissive for cross-presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Döring et al., 2019</xref>), we show their capability for cross-presentation just a few hours after exposure to antigens purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Furthermore, the occurrence of more extensive endo-lysosomal antigen degradation in monocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) favors cross-presentation of epitopes with higher affinities, which elicit responses at lower antigen doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). On the other hand, moDCs are more efficient than monocytes at cross-presentation for most antigens, and antigens with high-response sensitivities appear to be better able to exploit the specialized DC environment to achieve high cross-presentation efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). Both monocytes and moDCs are, to different extents, permissive for both the vacuolar and cytosolic cross-presentation pathways, depending on HLA allotypes and epitopes.</p><p>Altogether, based on studies of individual HLA class I allotypes in primary human cells, our findings provide evidence that HLA class I polymorphisms determine not only the specificities of peptide presentation and antigen receptor binding (both innate and adaptive; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Djaoud and Parham, 2020</xref>), but also influence antigen sampling in specific subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We suggest that certain HLA class I allotypes are predisposed for bulk constitutive assembly within endo-lysosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) following suboptimal assembly in the ER, or their peptidome characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which enable efficient exchange within endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While the sensitivity to bafilomycin partially aligns with previously observed dependencies on PLC components, these assembly characteristics do not fully explain the observed results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) and imply that a complex mixture of factors dictate dependence on endosomal recycling for maintenance of surface expression. Thus, the subcellular localization of assembly for some HLA class I allotypes in part overlaps with the sites for HLA class II assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2013</xref>). Whereas in the HLA class II pathway, the invariant chain-derived CLIP peptide maintains an exchange-amenable pool of HLA class II within endo-lysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cresswell, 1994</xref>), in the HLA class I pathway, natural variations in the stability and/or peptidome characteristics create a pool of exchange-amenable HLA class I molecules, but in an allotype selective manner. Under steady state conditions, endo-lysosomal HLA class I assembly is likely to be important for maintaining peripheral tolerance against proteins predominantly localized to endo-lysosomes and secreted factors internalized via bulk endocytosis. Allotypes such as B*08:01, with reduced capability for endo-lysosomal assembly, may be more likely to break peripheral tolerance, which could explain some known associations with autoimmune diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Candore et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Miller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rothwell et al., 2016</xref>). Under inflammatory conditions, increased cross-presentation efficiency could lead to increased priming and better activation of antigen-specific CTL responses mediated by allotypes such as B*35:01. Indeed, these findings could explain why, in HIV infections, tapasin-independent allotypes such as B*35:01 have increased breadth of peptide presentation to HIV-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bashirova et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, allotypes such as B*35:01 may mediate better protection against pathogens that persist within a sub-cellular endo-lysosomal niche, including <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma gondii,</italic> and <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic>.

Data was analyzed by FlowJo.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Materials, with the exception of primary cells, can be procured by writing to the corresponding author.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Informed consent from healthy donors for blood collections and HLA genotyping was procured in accordance with a University of Michigan IRB approved protocol (HUM00071750). The consent document included information that results of the studies could be published in an article without identifying information about blood donors. Donors were genotyped at the HLA locus as previously described (Yarzabek et al., 2018).

Ten primary groups were recruited for this study. Groups 1–8 were selected to be either homozygous for an HLA-B allotype of interest, or heterozygous for one Bw6 allotype and one Bw4 allotype so that anti-Bw6 and anti-Bw4 monoclonal antibodies could be utilized to measure the specific expression/localization of individual HLA-B allotypes. Donors in these groups were selected to have one or less HLA-C allotype that cross-reacts with the anti-Bw6 antibody, or no HLA-A allotypes that cross-react with the anti-Bw4 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yarzabek et al., 2018</xref>). Two cross-reactive HLA-C allotypes (denoted by asterisks) are permitted if the donor is homozygous for the HLA-B allotype of intertest, or if assays not using anti-Bw6 were not performed (e.g. peptide receptivity assays with the HC10 monoclonal antibody). Group 9 donors expressed B*08:01, B*35:01, or both and were selected for use as effector antigen-specific CTLs for all T cell activation assays. Heterozygosity for Bw6/Bw4 was not required for studies with this group. Group 10 contained donors heterozygous for B*08:01 and B*35:01 and were used as antigen-presenting cells for cross-presentation assays. For assays where specific HLA genotype was not required, such as DQ-Ova experiments, non-genotyped donors 248–275 were used, or blood was obtained from the University of Michigan Platelet Core. Donors from the Platelet Core are labeled.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79144-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79144-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The original data have been deposited to Dryad.

While an analysis of epitope-tagged versions of HLA-B allotypes would certainly be advantageous for some assays, we sought to retain endogenous HLA-B expression conditions and human peptide loading complex (PLC) components in primary human cells in order to preserve both the biologically relevant ratios of HLA-I:PLC, and optimal PLC functionality. Our concerns were that single HLA-B expression in BM-DCs would result in altered HLA-:PLC stoichiometries compared with human moDCs. Additionally, there are known functional differences between murine and human tapasin (1-3) and between HLA- heavy chain complexes with human vs mouse β<sub>2</sub>m (4), which could differentially influence cellular HLA-B assembly characteristics in BM-DCs. We want to emphasize that the use of anti-Bw6 allows the measurement of single HLA-B allotypes, based on the selection of Bw6/Bw4 heterozygous donors. Based on the much lower HLA-C expression (Figure 1—supplement 1), the expression and stability measurements are specific for the indicated HLA-B. This point has been thoroughly addressed in a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper (5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biochemically quantify peptide receptivity: This is a standard assay established in the 90s by Pete Cresswell, Hidde Ploegh, Jon Yewdell, and others for MHC-I molecules.

These are shown in a new Figure 2C. Overall, Bw6 expression at 42°C was lower than at 37°C, and significant differences are not measured between the two HLA-B allotypes. We believe that the half-life calculations of Figures 2A and 2B are more sensitive (and more quantitative). The measured stability differences between B*08:01 and B*35:01 in primary cells expressing a normal repertoire of PLC proteins (Figures 2A and 2B) (and Yarzabek et al 2018) may be more subtle than differences that have been measured between various allotypes in cell lines deficient in specific PLC components.

We have added a section acknowledging this possibility on Page 8 of the manuscript. Our main focus with the receptivity assays was to demonstrate that B*35:01 is suboptimally assembled to a greater extent than B*08:01 and more amenable to binding exogenous peptide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The co-localization micrographs are very small, and the resolution is low.

The microscopy was done in consultation with the Microscopy Core staff at the University of Michigan on the use of proper settings and methods for the data analysis, and thus we are confident in our current data. Previous images have been replaced by higher quality versions of the same images, preserving 16-bit acquisition quality instead of 8-bit (Figures 3, 4, and 4—supplement 1) to address this point to the best of our ability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can engineering tapasin binding site/s into B35.1 rescue ER assembly of stable B35.1?

Tapasin-independent allotypes typically don’t differ in their tapasin binding site residues; rather the differences are largely conformational. Recent findings indicate that a closely-related pair of tapasin-dependent and tapasin-independent allotypes that have identical tapasin-binding sites (B*44:02 and B*44:05) are both able to bind tapasin, although with approximately 5-fold different affinities (6). We have previously measured increased stability (reduced aggregation) of peptide-deficient forms of tapasin-independent allotypes compared with tapasin-dependent allotypes (7), suggesting that the increased stability of peptide-deficient conformations of tapasin-independent allotypes could allow faster dissociation of suboptimal versions from the PLC. TAPBPR binding appears more focused on HLA-A compared with HLA-B (8). Very little has been done to examine the role of TAPBPR in endosomal assembly, and we believe this is an important topic of future study. However, this is beyond the scope of the current study, particularly based on the findings of new Figure 1, where we show that bafilomycin sensitivity of HLA-B in moDCs is not fully explained by TAP or tapasin dependencies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MG132 is a reasonable proteasome inhibitor but it has limited specificity.

These can be found in revised Figure 7D and 7E. These experiments revealed some epitopes are cross-presented in a lactacystin-sensitive manner while their presentation was MG132-resistant (suggesting possibly greater potency of lactacystin). The addition of this inhibitor further clarified that most epitopes in both monocytes and moDCs are presented via a cytosolic, proteasome-dependent pathway, with additional cathepsin-dependence of B*35:01-restricted epitopes. Thus, we agree that the cytosolic pathway dominates, and are grateful for the suggestion to clarify this. However, we also emphasize the combined sensitivity of B*35:01 to both proteasomal and cathepsin inhibition. We believe this result reflects the ability of this allotype to assemble in multiple compartments with exogenous antigens, thus providing greater flexibility for maintaining antigen presentation when the canonical ER pathway is inhibited. These points are described in in the Results section related to Figure 7 and the Discussion section (page 18).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Now, there is some evidence that autophagy can dump proteasomes into lysosomes.

We suggest that it is unlikely that the outcomes of MG132/lactacystin inhibition in our experiments result from proteasome activity in lysosomes because the assembly status of B*08:01 prevents efficient peptide exchange in endosomes (demonstrated by a lack of peptide receptivity in Figure 2). We observe the bafilomycin-resistance of B*08:01 for its surface expression and peptide receptivity, indicating it does not utilize endo-lysosomal compartments for endogenous peptide exchange. Additionally, if B*08:01 were more capable of peptide exchange within endosomes/lysosomes during cross-presentation, we would also expect greater sensitivity to cathepsin inhibition, similarly to B*35:01.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, this work is narrowly focused on a single member of the B7 supertype-B*35:01, which is prevalent at low frequency in the African American (AA: 0.05) and White American (WA: 0.07) populations.

Outcomes may also yield insights into the causes and maintenance of HLA-I polymorphisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, and agree with its importance. We have performed additional bafilomycin treatment studies shown in a new Figure 1, including six additional common HLA-B allotypes, following the recruitment of multiple donors for each allotype. The bafilomycin treatment revealed a spectrum of sensitivities to endo-lysosomal pH perturbation, although the sensitivity does not correspond strictly to tapasin-dependence or TAP-dependence as previously hypothesized. We suggest in the Results section corresponding to Figure 1 that there are several factors, including PLC-dependence and peptidome diversity, that could contribute to the individual abilities of allotypes to assemble with peptides in endo-lysosomal compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) The introduction of the manuscript is rather long (5 paragraphs, 3.5 pages) for a research article. While this provides important details, it may also detract from the presentation of the results. Consider shortening and consolidating paragraphs in the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The introduction has been considerably shortened to 3 paragraphs, 2 pages (specific changes are not highlighted). Please see Pages 3 and 4 for the new version. This suggestion has helped tighten the background.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) P8, pp 2: Regarding the very elegant assay using HC10 can probe empty conformers: What are the background levels arising from staining of peptide-loaded molecules using this antibody for the two B allotypes, under the conditions of the experiments? One way to account for this is to incubate with either Bw6 or W6/32 first as blocking antibodies, and then measure background levels with HC10.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, which we have addressed with a bead-based assay in new Figure 2D. Based on this comment, we wanted to ensure that recognition by the HC10 antibody was similarly reduced for both B*08:01 and B*35:01 upon addition of specific peptide. We conjugated purified biotinylated B*08:01 or B*35:01 bound to low affinity peptides to streptavidin beads, followed by pulsing with medium or high-affinity peptides or no peptides at various pH values to mimic different cellular conditions of peptide exchange. These data demonstrate that HC10 can recognize peptide-deficient conformers of both B*08:01 and B*35:01, and that specific peptides reduce empty conformer recognition by HC10 to equivalent levels, and based on peptide affinity for HLA-. Thus, the differences observed in Figures 2 and 4 must be due to factors in moDCs, such as the efficiency of ER assembly and endosomal recycling for each allotype. Based on the findings that HC10 signal changes are sensitive to peptide affinity, we also repeated the moDC B*08:01 HC10 peptide receptivity assays with the high affinity FLR peptide (Figures 2E and 4G), which again confirmed low peptide receptivity for B*08:01.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) P11, pp3 and Figure 3G: HC10 suggests a reduction in B35 (but not B08) peptide receptivity upon bafilomycin treatment, measured by HC10 staining ratio. Are the receptive molecules properly conformed for peptide binding, and do they contain b2m? This is an important detail since the loss of b2m will leads to the formation of heavy chain dimers and re-internalization of MHC-I molecules (see, for example, Dirscherl et al., J cell Sci, 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The HC10 antibody-based peptide receptivity assays suggest an increase in B*35:01 (but not B*08:01) peptide receptivity (greater reduction in HC10 signal following the addition of specific peptide) in bafilomycin-treated cells. Since peptide binding requires β<sub>2</sub>m, we believe that the peptide receptive B*35:01 molecules are still bound to β<sub>2</sub>m. Indeed, in the HLA-B-beads-based assays, similar peptide conditions that induce a reduction in the HC10 signal (Figure 2D), also cause a parallel increase in the b<sub>2</sub>m-specific BBM.1 signal (Figure 4, supplement 1G and 1H).</p><p>This comment additionally prompted us to examine changes to surface β<sub>2</sub>m on moDCs upon bafilomycin treatment. New experiments (Figure 1H) show that after bafilomycin treatment, total surface β<sub>2</sub>m, as measured by the BBM.1 antibody, is reduced on moDCs in multiple donors. Thus, bafilomycin treatment appears to have a general negative consequence for the assembly and recycling of classical and/or non-classical MHC-I complexes, whereas some HLA-B allotypes such as B*08:01 and B*44:02 are resistant to the effects of bafilomycin. In repeating the peptide receptivity experiments using BBM.1, we found that B*35:01 peptides were unable to increase the surface β<sub>2</sub>m both in the presence and in the absence of bafilomycin (new Figure 4—supplement 1H and 1I). The detection of B*35:01 peptide receptivity by HC10 (Figures 2E and 4G) but not BBM.1 (new Figure 4—supplement 1H and 1I) is likely due to broader specificity of BBM.1 (which is β<sub>2</sub>m specific (9) and able to recognize classical and/or non-classical MHC-I complexes) compared with the HC10 antibody (which is specific for HLA-B and HLA-C (10)). We expect that the small peptide-induced changes in BBM.1 signal are more difficult to detect against the larger reduction in the total BBM.1 signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) P13, pp1: the authors employ assays using (likely oligoclonal) tetramer-sorted T cells to probe the formation of properly conformed peptide:MHC-I complexes on the cell surface, however, there could exist cross-reactivity with different antigens which may convolute the results of this analysis. Please provide evidence for the lack of cross-reactivity for the different EBV epitopes arising from the same protein, using tetramer staining or a similar assay to complement the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Peptide activation assays with each CTL were performed and no cross-reactivity between B*08:01 CTLs and B*35:01 peptide, or B*35:01 CTLs and B*08:01 peptide was detected. Results are shown in a new Figure 6—supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) P 14, pp3: the authors provide evidence of different response sensitivities for different EBV epitopes, depending on contributions from the cytosolic or vacuolar pathways. Can they elaborate further on plausible mechanisms for the observed differences, for example, changes in surface expression levels, densities, or distribution of molecules, and if possible, provide a quantitative assessment of the number of pMHC molecules under different conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that is further clarified in the relevant Results section (Pages 14-16). For a given HLA-class I allotype, the epitopes with lower response sensitivities have relatively lower affinities for HLA-class I (B*08:01-RAK, IC<sub>50</sub> 366 nM and B*35:01-EPL, IC<sub>50</sub> 534 nM) compared with the epitopes with the higher response sensitivities, which had higher affinities (B*08:01-FLR, IC<sub>50</sub> 7 nM and B*35:01-YPL; IC<sub>50</sub> 19 nM). This is likely due to lower cell surface levels achieved of the lower affinity complexes. Notably, consistent with the greater peptide receptivity for B*35:01 (Figure 2E), the T cell response sensitivity achieved with the lower affinity B*35:01-EPL epitope was similar to that achieved with the high affinity B*08:01-FLR epitope (Figure 6A). Furthermore, the data of Figure 6 and 7A-C show that with intact protein-derived epitopes as with the peptides, B*35:01 peptide loading during cross-presentation is more efficient than for B*08:01. Based on the additional analyses of Figure 7, we interpret these differences as attributable to the greater peptide receptivity of B*35:01 and its increased loading permissiveness in multiple cellular compartments.</p><p>A direct quantitation of pHLA molecules on the cell surface after cross-presentation by use of mass spectrometry and isotype-labeled standards would certainly emphasize this point, but that type of quantitation also has its limitations. For example, variations in peptide-HLA-class I dissociation rate or cell surface HLA-class I stability could influence the results, or some peptides may not be detectable by MS/MS of cell surface proteins. The extensive independent development that would be needed for this assay to be fully interpretable makes this experiment outside the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Are there differences in glycosylation of MHC molecules at the conserved Asn 86 position processed through the vacuolar or cytosolic pathways? If so, it would be interesting to see if the contribution of different pathways, such as in the case of B08 vs B35 affects the complex glycosylation patterns on the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point by the reviewer, and we agree that an examination of glycosylation and endosomal HLA-B trafficking would be beneficial. A previous study by our group (11) found that B*35:01 traffics to the surface of TAP-deficient cells in a Golgi-independent manner, as evidenced by immature glycans on B*35:01. We compared endo H sensitivities of cell surface HLA-class I in moDC’s from B*35:01 and B*08:01 donors and did not measure differences, and furthermore, we found that the majority of the cell surface HLA-class I (detected by HC10) is endo H resistant. These were new experiments we undertook for the revision in response to the comment, but we do not show these data as they are not directly relevant to the main points of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Figure 7 (the summary figure) is too complex, with too many graphical elements. For a conceptual model figure, this may confuse readers. Consider simplifying by reducing the number of pMHC complexes illustrated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The model figure (now Figure 8) has been greatly simplified to focus on B*35:01 recycling and peptide exchange in moDCs. This has allowed us to clarify the key takeaways from our study.
