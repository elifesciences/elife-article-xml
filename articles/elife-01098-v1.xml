delayed aging. GHRH knockout mice are remarkably long-lived, exhibiting major shifts in the expression of genes related to xenobiotic detoxification, stress resistance, and insulin signaling. These mutant mice also have increased adiponectin levels and alterations in glucose homeostasis consistent with the removal of the counter-insulin effects of growth hormone. While these effects overlap with those of caloric restriction, we show that the effects of caloric restriction (CR) and the GHRH mutation are additive, with lifespan of GHRH-KO mutants further increased by CR. We conclude that GHRH-KO mice feature perturbations in a network of signaling pathways related to stress resistance, metabolic control and inflammation, and therefore provide a new model that can be used to explore links between GHRH repression, downregulation of the somatotropic axis, and extended longevity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01098.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01098.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01098.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There is increasing evidence that the hormonal systems involved in growth, the metabolism of glucose, and the processes that balance energy intake and expenditure might also be involved in the aging process. In rodents, mutations in genes involved in these hormone-signaling pathways can substantially increase lifespan, as can a diet that is low in calories but which avoids malnutrition. As well as living longer, such mice also show reductions in age-related conditions such as diabetes, memory loss and cancer.</p><p>Many of these effects appear to involve the actions of growth hormone. Mice with mutations that disrupt the development of the pituitary gland, which produces growth hormone, show increased longevity, as do mice that lack the receptor for growth hormone. However, these animals also show changes in a number of other hormones, making it difficult to be sure that the reduction in growth hormone signaling is responsible for their increased lifespan.</p><p>Now, Sun et al. have studied mutant mice that lack a gene called GHRH, which promotes the release of growth hormone. These mice, which have normal levels of all other pituitary hormones, lived for up to 50% longer than their wild-type littermates. They were more active than normal mice and had more body fat, and showed greatly increased sensitivity to insulin.</p><p>Some of the changes in these mutant mice resembled those seen in animals with a restricted calorie intake, suggesting that the same mechanisms may be implicated in both. However, Sun et al. found that caloric restriction further increased the lifespans of their GHRH knockout mice, indicating that at least some of the effects of caloric restriction are independent of disrupted growth hormone signaling.</p><p>The results of this study are an important step forward for understanding how growth hormone signaling and caloric restriction regulate aging, both individually and in combination. The GHRH knockout mice are likely to become an important model system for studying these processes and for understanding the complex interactions between diet and hormonal pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01098.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01098.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mice</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>caloric restriction</kwd><kwd>growth hormone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SIU</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SIU CADRD Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Liou Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG031736, AG019899, AG038850</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bartke</surname><given-names>Andrzej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice with a mutation that disrupts the release of growth hormone show greatly increased lifespan, which can be further increased by caloric restriction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genetic studies in a variety of organisms have revealed that the endocrine systems play a central role in lifespan determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tatar et al., 2003</xref>). For example, mutations in the insulin/Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) signaling can robustly increase longevity in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon, 2010</xref>), whereas in mouse, disruptions in growth hormone (GH) pathway dramatically prolong lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ames and Snell dwarf mice are the most studied mutants in which altered GH signals produce dramatic increases in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flurkey et al., 2001</xref>). A number of aging-related phenotypes are also delayed in these mice, including collagen cross-linking, cataract development, kidney diseases, fatal neoplastic diseases and decline in immune function, locomotor activity, learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>). In these models, homozygous mutation of either Prop1 or Pit1 genes cause an abnormal development of the anterior pituitary, which in turn leads to decline in production of GH, thyrotropin (TSH), and prolactin (PRL), with consequent decrease in circulating IGF-I and thyroxine levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>). The specific contribution of GH signaling to lifespan extension in these systems is supported by studies of downstream pathway elements. For instance, mice with disruption of the GH receptor (Ghr−/−) have also markedly increased lifespan with concomitant delay of late life diseases and disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coschigano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">List et al., 2011</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that dampening of the GH pathway is the key contributor to lifespan extension in mice. Nevertheless, the associated lack of TSH and prolactin makes these two models less than optimal in conclusively exclude the influence of the lack of these hormones on the delayed aging phenotype.</p><p>Caloric restriction (CR) has been shown to extend lifespan in many species and has been extensively used in experimental gerontology to modulate development of age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weindruch and Sohal, 1997</xref>). In rodents, CR delays the onset of cancer, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, and typically increases lifespan (by 15% in mice and by 30% in rats) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swindell, 2012</xref>). Although this phenomenon was first described over 70 years ago, the molecular basis mediating the effects of CR on the aging process remains incompletely understood. Intriguingly, phenotypic characteristics of the long-lived mutant mice with disrupted GH axis overlap with some effects of CR, suggesting possible mechanistic connections. Shared characteristics include: (a) small body size; (b) reduced blood glucose and increased insulin sensitivity; and (c) reduced or absent levels of various hormones and growth factors, that is, GH, insulin, and IGF-I; (d) delaying and/or suppression of the occurrence of several age-related diseases. Nevertheless, longevity phenotypes in different mouse models may rely on CR-sensitive pathways to varying degrees. For instance, 30% CR confers additional life extension in Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>), but has no additional effect on longevity in male Ghr−/− mice, and only a modest reduction of late-life mortality in Ghr−/− females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we examined the longevity of mice with isolated GH deficiency due to targeted disruption of the GHRH gene (GHRH-KO). This gene is required for somatotroph cell proliferation and GH secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alba and Salvatori, 2004</xref>). We provide a phenotypic, metabolic and molecular-level characterization of GHRH-KO mice and show that GHRH-KO mutants exhibit lifespan extension comparable to the Ames and Snell dwarf mice. Moreover, we have shown that, in contrast with the Ghr−/− mice, lifespan in GHRH-KO mice is further extended by CR. These findings established the GHRH-KO mice as a novel rodent model for delayed aging and implicate CR-independent mechanisms in longevity assurance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robustly increased longevity in GHRH-KO mice</title><p>To investigate the effect of isolated GH deficiency on lifespan, we evaluated differences in longevity of GHRH-KO (KO) mice and littermate (wild-type) control mice on ad libitum (AL) standard diet.

To evaluate the change of maximal lifespan, we used the Wang/Allison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2004</xref>) method to compare the proportion of live mice in each group at the age at which only 10% of the population remained alive. GHRH deletion also led to a significant increase in maximum lifespan by 33% for females (p&lt;0.05) and by 18% for males (p&lt;0.05) relative to controls. The robust increase in both median and maximal lifespan in GHRH-KO mice is consistent with the notion that inhibition of GH signaling ameliorates age-related disease, potentially slowing the aging process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phenotypic characteristics and blood parameters of GHRH-KO mice</title><p>Both male and female GHRH-KO (KO) mice were markedly smaller than normal littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To estimate fuel utilization, we used the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is a dimensionless ratio comparing the volume of carbon dioxide an organism produces to the volume of oxygen consumed over a given time (RQ = VCO2/VO2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Johnston et al., 2006</xref>). The RQ varies inversely with lipid oxidation. A higher fasting RQ, which indicates lowered fat oxidation, is linked to body weight gain, metabolic inflexibility and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zurlo et al., 1990</xref>). The KO mice had a significantly decreased RQ compared to their wild-type controls during both the dark and light periods under normal housing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), although their oxygen consumption per gram of body weight (measured by VO2) was not different from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, on measures of spontaneous home cage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), KO mice were significantly more active than their wild-type counterparts.</p><p>Heightened insulin sensitivity is a common characteristic of several types of mice with GH-related mutations and extended longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>). Consistent with this observation, plasma glucose concentrations were significantly reduced in both male and female GHRH-KO mice under fasted conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, the lower score of homeostasis model-assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) indicated that GHRH-KO mice had enhanced insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). As expected from deficiency of pituitary GH, IGF-I levels in the circulation were much lower in GHRH-KO mice than controls. Moreover, insulin tolerance tests (ITT) done in mice fasted for 4 hr showed that plasma glucose concentrations decreased more in KO mice than in control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) despite of normal intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these data indicate that isolated GH deficiency results in improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis.</p><p>Decreased ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) activity has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Um et al., 2006</xref>). Since S6K1 signaling is decreased in the tissues of Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sharp and Bartke, 2005</xref>), we speculated that S6K1 signaling may contribute to regulate insulin sensitivity in response to isolated GH deficiency. To investigate this possibility, we examined the levels of phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 and phosphorylation of IRS1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), two downstream targets of S6K1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Um et al., 2006</xref>). Hepatic levels of phosphorylation of these proteins were significantly lower in KO mice when compared with controls. Consistent with the evidence in S6k1−/− mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Selman et al., 2009</xref>), these data suggest that lower activity of S6K1 in GHRH-KO mice might contribute to the improved insulin sensitivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hepatic gene expression profiles in GHRH-KO mice: partial overlap with CR and evidence for Nrf2 activation</title><p>Microarray analysis was performed to identify genes altered in liver tissue from GHRH-KO mice as compared to normal littermates (n = 3 per genotype). Overall, we identified 141 genes with elevated expression in the mutants (FDR &lt; 0.05 and FC &gt; 1.50; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>), along with 164 genes with decreased expression (FDR &lt; 0.05 and FC &lt; 0.67; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

We then used semi-parametric generalized additive logistic models to identify motifs present at significantly elevated frequency among GHRH-KO-altered genes, as compared to all other hepatic related genes. Among the 141 increased genes, the dominant trend was enrichment of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) motifs in upstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The strongest enrichment was observed for an HNF recognition site with consensus sequence 5-GTTAAT-ATT-3 (p=7.3e-10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Among the 164 decreased genes, enrichment for motifs associated with several DNA-binding proteins was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

A most recent study has shown that overexpression of FGF21 markedly extends lifespan in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

In this context, we further evaluated the effect of GHRH deletion and CR on FGF21 expression.

Since liver is the major source of circulating FGF21, hepatic FGF21 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Consistent with plasma levels, the transcriptional levels of FGF21 in the liver were markedly inhibited by CR in both GHRH-KO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

However, deficiencies of multiple hormones in these models might confound the direct and causal effects of GH deficiency.</p><p>In an attempt to overcome this difficulty, we previously found that early life GH (but not thyroxine) replacement almost completely restored Ames dwarf lifespan to the level of wild-type littermate controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Panici et al., 2010</xref>).

In the current study, we find that a robust increase in lifespan in both male and female GHRH-KO mice. Together, our results provide a compelling evidence for the idea that GH pathway is the major regulatory pathway for longevity in mice.</p><p>The remarkable magnitude of the extension of longevity in GHRH-KO mice may be related in some ways to the relatively short lifespan of normal animals from this strain, approximately 21 months, as compared to approximately 24 months in normal siblings of <italic>Ames</italic> dwarfs and approximately 29 months in normal siblings on <italic>Ghr</italic>−/− mice in our colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Studies in <italic>Ghr</italic>−/− mice indicate that the presence of a significant extension of lifespan in animals lacking GH signals does not depend on genetic background but the magnitude of this effect tends to be reduced in a long-lived strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coschigano et al., 2003</xref>). Differences in the genetic background of GHRH-KO mice and <italic>Ames</italic> dwarf, <italic>Snell</italic> dwarf, and <italic>Ghr</italic>−/− mice used in previous studies in different laboratories make it difficult to determine whether absence of GHRH, GH or their receptors have quantitatively similar or differential impacts on longevity. These comparisons are further complicated by differences between the diets used in different laboratories. Nevertheless, the increased longevity we observed in GHRH-KO animals is a robust finding when compared with same genetic background controls.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Potential mechanisms mediating reduced GH signaling with extended longevity</title><p>Improved insulin sensitivity combined with low insulin and glucose levels are characteristics of a series of long-lived mutant mice and mice with long-term CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartke, 2011</xref>). On the contrary, opposite phenotypic features characteristic of metabolic syndrome, including hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance, are associated with increased risk of various age-related diseases and with reduced life expectancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stensvold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noale et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this notion, insulin sensitivity is also improved in the GHRH-KO mice, further supporting that this is a key contributor of lifespan extension of mice. We suspect that at least some of the gene expression responses observed in hepatic tissue of GHRH-KO mice can be attributed to enhanced insulin signaling. For instance, the GHRH-KO-increased genes we identified included Sox4 and Vcam1, each of which have been associated with response to glucose stimulus. In addition, among the 164 GHRH-KO-decreased, upstream regions were enriched with motifs recognized by MYC, which is a transcription factor associated with the TOR branch of the insulin signaling pathway.</p><p>Increased resistance to multiple forms of lethal stress has been consistently associated with lifespan extension in long-lived mutant worms, flies and mice suggested the appealing idea that the longevity seen in these mutants was a consequence of their stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller, 2009</xref>). Our evaluation of changes in hepatic gene expression profiles and stress response pathways also points toward this direction. For instance, several of the genes with increased expression in GHRH-KO liver were associated with the GO biological process term ‘cellular response to stress’ (e.g., Blm, Ccnd1, Dclre1a, Ddx1, Gpx3, Il1rn, Krt20, Morf4l2, Ppargc1a, Prpf19, Rtn4, Slc2a1, Sox4 and Vldlr). Additionally, we noted that several genes with increased expression in GHRH-KO liver had also been induced in experiments where mice had been exposed to injury or toxicity stressors, including partial hepatectomy (e.g., Cenpq, Ccnd1 and Cdkn2c), the HSF-activating compound quercetin (e.g., Gpr146, Il1rn and Tef), and high doses of acetaminophen (e.g., Vcam1, Mafb and Slc2a1).</p><p>The transcription factor Nrf2 plays a central role in regulating many antioxidant-related genes against multiple types of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma, 2013</xref>). Under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytosol by Keap1, the cytosolic repressor of Nrf2. In response to various stress, Nrf2/Keap1 binding is disrupted, and Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus to stimulate the activation of various antioxidant-associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma, 2013</xref>). Overexpression of SKN-1 (Nrf2 ortholog) can prolong <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tullet et al., 2008</xref>). Disruption of Keap1, which in turn increase Nrf2 activity, also increases the male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sykiotis and Bohmann, 2008</xref>). However, whether Nrf2 can contribute to the mammalian aging and affect lifespan remains undemonstrated. Intriguingly, as revealed by our microarray comparison, liver-specific Keap1 knockout mice have increased resistance to hepatic stressor acetaminophen and exhibit a very similar hepatic gene expression pattern to the one of GHRH-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okawa et al., 2006</xref>). Genes induced in Keap1(−/−) and GHRH-KO mice include Nqo1, Adora1, Cyp39a1, Trim24 and Gstt3, while genes decreased in both models include Ttc39c, Tmem19, Egfr, Mcm10 and Slco1a1. Moreover, nuclear Nrf2 protein and many ARE genes were upregulated in GHRH-KO mice suggesting that Nrf2 could play an important role in lifespan extension of these long-lived mice.</p><p>All organisms are continuously exposed to a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous toxic compounds in the environment. Recently, it has been proposed that a generalized up-regulation of xenobiotic detoxification pathways may be a shared feature of long-lived mutants and a key mechanism of longevity assurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McElwee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steinbaugh et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings show both a strong increase and decrease in xenobiotic metabolism genes in GHRH-KO mice. Among GHRH-KO-increased genes, several were associated with P450 drug metabolism (e.g., Cyp2b13, Cyp2c38 and Cyp2c39). Similarly, among GHRH-KO-decreased genes, we noted that several were associated with xenobiotic metabolic processes (e.g., Acsl1, Gstp1 and Ugt2b1).</p><p>The mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic metabolism genes in the absence of environmental toxins remain unknown. Some studies have shown elevation of bile acids (as endogenous xenobiotics) level and altered bile acid metabolism in GH deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amador-Noguez et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2007</xref>). Moreover, several GH-mediated transcriptional factors including Nrf2, STAT 5b, and hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 4alpha have been shown to play an important role in xenobiotic gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waxman and Holloway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we postulate that the activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathway, presumably through inhibition of GH signaling and alterations of the corresponding transcriptional factors, protects the tissues from the damaging effects of endogenous and exogenous molecules and thus contributes to maintaining tissue and metabolic homeostasis during aging.</p><p>We note that an important avenue for future work will be to carry out end-of-life pathology studies of GHRH-KO mice. This will provide information on likely causes of death and how such causes may differ from those in control animals.

Resembling findings in Ames dwarf mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartke et al., 2001</xref>), CR produced a further significant extension of longevity in both sexes of GHRH-KO animals. In contrast to these findings, in GH resistant Ghr−/− mice, CR does not alter longevity of males and produces only a small, although statistically significant reduction of late mortality in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Relating these differential responses to CR to the impact of these mutations on insulin levels lends support to our hypothesis that suppression of insulin levels is an important mechanism of life extension by CR. Indeed CR has no or little impact on longevity of animals in which insulin levels are already profoundly suppressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that differences in the genetic background of animals could also partially explain these differences.</p><p>The CR-induced extension of longevity in GHRH-KO mice was greater in females than in males, while in GHRH-KO mice subjected to CR, longevity was increased in females only. The mechanism for the sex dimorphism in response to CR is poorly understood. Intriguingly, deletion of several genes related to insulin/IGF-I signaling including S6k1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Selman et al., 2009</xref>), IRS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Selman et al., 2008</xref>) extends longevity only in females. Perhaps divergent effects of male and female sex hormones on adiposity, adipose tissue distribution, inflammation, cardiac function and/or neuroprotection renders males less responsive to the beneficial effects of reducing insulin, somatotropic and mTOR signaling by dietary or genetic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartke et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>It deserves emphasis that the ablation of GHRH in female mice markedly extends longevity even though insulin levels are not significantly reduced. Insulin levels are reduced in Ames dwarf, Snell dwarf, and Ghr−/−, but not in transgenic mice expressing a GH antagonist in which longevity is not increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coschigano et al., 2003</xref>). Suppression of insulin levels is one of the most consistent and robust responses to CR in mice and in other mammalian species.

In agreement with the increased obesity, KO mice have elevated serum level of leptin.

These results suggest that GH signaling interacts with CR affecting gene expressions and secretion patterns of adipose tissues in these animals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>GH action, Fgf21 and CR effect</title><p>FGF21 plays a major role in eliciting and coordinating the adaptive starvation response and promotes similar physiological changes caused by CR, including decreased glucose levels, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved lipid mobilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Potthoff et al., 2012</xref>). A most recent study has shown that overexpressing FGF21 in mice prolongs lifespan dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, Fgf21 Tg and CR-fed mice show similarity with respect to their hepatic gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). For these reasons, FGF21 is speculated to increase longevity by partially mimicking the effect of CR in liver and potentially other tissues. In previous studies, however, CR did not induce transcription of hepatic FGF21, nor did CR alter levels of FGF21 in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, our data show that long-term (over 12 months) 40% CR profoundly suppressed hepatic FGF21 mRNA and plasma FGF21 concentrations in both GHRH-KO and control mice. This result differs from previous studies, potentially due to differences in mouse strains or the use of short-term CR in earlier work. Nevertheless, these results do not support FGF21 as a key mediator of the pro-longevity effects of CR.</p><p>Previously, FGF21 has been shown to cause GH resistance and inhibit hepatic GH signaling through Stat5-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inagaki et al., 2008</xref>).

Moreover, our hepatic transcriptome analysis has revealed pretty good overlap in genes affected by GHRH deletion and FGF21 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, our results further support the idea that FGF21 longevity effect is likely mediated by the GH signaling. Also, the regulatory crosstalk between GH signaling and FGF21 action may play a pivotal role in controlling metabolic homeostasis during starvation and chronic dietary restriction.</p><p>It will be imperative, in future work, to better understand how CR and GH signaling interact with each other at both the metabolic and cellular levels.

Hierarchical cluster analysis was also performed to identify potential outliers. All chips were retained for further analyses based upon these quality control evaluations. Expression scores were calculated for each chip using robust multichip average (RMA). The Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0features a total of 45101 probe sets; however, we removed 19956 from consideration since they were not significantly expressed above background in any of the six array hybridizations (Wilxon signed rank test as implemented in the MAS 5.0 algorithm). Our analysis was thus based upon 25145 probe sets with expression significantly above background in at least one of the six hybridizations (13201 unique mouse genes). Probe sets showing increased or decreased expression were identified using empirical Bayes methods as implemented in the limma software package (R Bioconductor). An FDR correction for multiple hypotheses testing among all probe sets was performed using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. Since the Mouse Genome 430 2.0 includes some ‘sibling’ probe sets that target mRNAs associated with the same gene, we limited redundancy in our results by considering only the most significantly altered probe set associated with a given gene (i.e., the probe set with the lowest p value).

This yielded an initial set of 1259 motifs, which were then filtered to exclude repetitive motifs or any motifs fewer than four base pairs in length, yielding the final set of 1209 motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swindell et al., 2013</xref>). For each mouse gene, we retrieved the 2 kb upstream region based upon coordinates provided in UCSC ref gene files and sequences available from Bioconductor (package: BSgenome. Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10). Upstream sequences for all mouse genes were scanned for matches to each of the 1209 motifs, respectively (with masking of protein-coding sequences and repetitive DNA elements). Motif matches were identified using the ‘matchPWM’ function (R package: Biostrings), with an 80% match threshold, that is, a motif match was counted if the position weight matrix (PWM) similarity score exceeded 80% of the maximum score for that PWM. For each mouse gene, this yielded counts for each PWM indicating the frequency of motif matches in 2 kb upstream regions. The same procedure was applied to determine if motifs were enriched with respect to the 141 GHRH-KO-increased genes and the 164 GHRH-KO-decreased genes, respectively. To assess whether GHRH-KO-increased genes were enriched with respect to the number of occurrences for a given motif, for example, we used semi parametric generalized additive logistic regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swindell et al., 2013</xref>). For these models, the response variable was an indicator with value 1 if a gene was included among the 141 GHRH-KO-increased, and with value 0 if the gene was not included among the 141 GHRH-KO-increased. Only liver-expressed genes were included in the analysis. Models included two predictor variables, including the number of motif occurrences in the 2 kb upstream region (x1) and the length of sequence scanned (x2). The variable x1 was estimated using parametric methods, while x2 was included as a non-parametric term with cublic spline smoothing. To assess motif enrichment, we evaluated the significance of the Z statistic associated with the coefficient estimate obtained forx1. Models of this structure were generated for each of the 1209 motifs. To control the false discovery rate with respect to the 1209 tests, p values associated with Z statistics were adjusted using the Benjamini–Hochberg method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Indirect calorimetry</title><p>Mice were subjected to indirect calorimetry (PhysioScan Metabolic System from AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, OH) as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Westbrook et al., 2009</xref>). This system uses zirconia, infrared sensors and light beams arrays to monitor oxygen (VO2), carbon dioxide (VCO2), and spontaneous locomotor activity, respectively inside respiratory chambers in which individual mice were tested. All comparisons are based on animals studied simultaneously in eight different chambers connected to the same O2, CO2 and light beam sensors in an effort to minimize the effect of environmental variations and calibration on data. After a 24-hr acclimation period, mice were monitored in the metabolic chambers for 24 hr with ad libitum access to standard chow (Laboratory Diet 5001) and water. Gas samples were collected and analyzed every 5 min per animal, and the data were averaged for each hour.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Assessment of blood chemistry</title><p>Plasma was obtained from blood collected by cardiac puncture at sacrifice and used for measurement of insulin using Mouse Insulin ELISA Kits (Crystal Chem, Downers Grove, IL). Following the manufacturer’s protocol, total ketone bodies and non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) were measured using colorimetric assays from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA); glycerol was measured using kits from Sigma and triglycerides using kits from Pointe Scientific (Canton, MI), respectively. Adiponectin and resistin levels were assayed using Mouse Adiponectin/Resistin ELISA Kits (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Leptin levels were evaluated using Mouse Leptin ELISA Kits (Crystal Chem Inc., Downers Grove, IL). TNF-α and IL-6 were measured using Mouse TNF-α/IL-6 ELISA Kits (Biosource, Camarillo, CA). Plasma FFAs were assayed using optimized enzymatic colorimetric assays (Roche, Penzberg, Germany). Blood was taken from the tail to measure blood glucose using a glucometer (AgaMatrix, Salem, NH).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity assay</title><p>CYP1A and CYP2B activity was measured by resorufin conversion from methoxyresorufin (7 methoxyresorufin O deethylation, MROD), ethoxyresorufin (7 ethoxyresorufin O deethylation, EROD), or pentoxyresorufin (7 pentoxy-resorufin O deethylation, PROD), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anwar-Mohamed et al., 2011</xref>). Liver samples were collected from mice fed chow containing 1% tBHQ or control chow for 50 days that were exposed to 50 mg/kg diquat or saline for 6 hr prior to dissection. Unfrozen liver samples were briefly homogenized with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and suspended in sucrose buffer. Microsomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation with the commercially available Endoplasmic Reticulum Isolation Kit (ER0100; Sigma-Aldrich). Changes in resorufin fluorescence were measured in a 96-well microtiter plates following the protocol outlined in the commercially available Cytochrome P450 2B Fluorescent Detection Kit (CYTO2B; Sigma).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>LYS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>AS, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>YF, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>CH, Conception and design, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>WRS, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>JAH, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>JDB, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>RW, Acquisition of data, Analysis and interpretation of data</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>RS, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>AB, Conception and design, Analysis and interpretation of data, Drafting or revising the article, Contributed unpublished essential data or reagents</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Sun et al. investigated the role of GHRH on lifespan and studied the endocrinological and cellular changes that may be responsible for the effect of GHRH on longevity extension. They show a major lifespan extension in GHRH-KO mice, comparable to that of GHR-KO mice. Also, they show that GHRH-KO mice are insulin sensitive. Among the possible protective mechanism presented for GHRH-KO is the decreased activity of S6K and the increased expression of xenobiotic genes. This is a very interesting paper that serves as a major and important extension of what has been shown for GHR-KO and GH deficiency. These data provide conclusive evidence that the GHRH-GH-GHR axis is the most potent pro-aging pathway discovered in mammals.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The lifespan of the wild-type mice is relatively short. The authors should discuss the reason for the short lifespan, comparing it to their previous publications, and should also emphasize/discuss the mixed strain background as a possible complicating factor in the analysis of these mice.</p><p>2) If phosphorylation of targets of S6K is used to test the hypothesis that its inactivation may cause insulin sensitivity in GHRH-KO mice, then this activity should also be measured in either muscle or adipose cells.</p><p>3) The authors fail to discuss causes of death – are the causes the same for the KO and wild-type mice?

In addition, it is not clear why the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are so important in mice that are not exposed to any xenobiotics. Is there any indication from the literature for why these genes may be important in the absence of toxic environments?

The authors should discuss the reason for the short lifespan, comparing it to their previous publications, and should also emphasize/discuss the mixed strain background as a possible complicating factor in the analysis of these mice</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers raise an important point. The remarkable magnitude of the longevity extension in GHRH-KO mice may be related in some ways to the relatively short lifespan of normal animals from this strain, approximately 21 months, as compared to approximately 24 months in normal siblings of Ames dwarfs and approximately 29 months in normal siblings on GHR<sup>-/-</sup> mice in our colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown-Borg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartke et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonkowski et al., 2006</xref>). Studies in GHR<sup>-/-</sup> mice from Dr. Kopchick’s laboratory and in our laboratory indicate that the presence of a significant extension of lifespan in animals lacking GH signals does not depend on genetic background (three different backgrounds were tested, two mixed and one inbred). However, the magnitude of this effect tends to be reduced in a long-lived strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coschigano et al., 2003</xref>). Differences in the genetic background of GHRH-KO mice and Ames dwarf, Snell dwarf, GHR<sup>-/-</sup>, and little mice used in previous studies and different laboratories make it difficult to determine whether absence of GHRH, GH or their receptors have quantitatively similar or differential impacts on mouse lifespan. These comparisons are further complicated by differences between the diets used in different laboratories. These considerations are now discussed in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Moreover, mice used in these studies are maintained on a heterogeneous genetic background by avoiding brother x sister matings and genetic “bottle-necks” and thus producing animals that are heterozygous at a significant proportion of the loci (Panici et al., 2009). We feel that this more closely resembles the genetic constitution of animals in nature and also human populations, and thus we believe that our findings are more generalizable (or “translatable”) than data obtained in a single inbred strain. A similar strategy is well employed in the National Institute on Aging's Interventions Testing Program (ITP) (Harrison et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2007).</p><p><italic>2) If phosphorylation of targets of S6K is used to test the hypothesis that its inactivation may cause insulin sensitivity in GHRH-KO mice, then this activity should also be measured in either muscle or adipose cells</italic>.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed the suggested experiments to compare the phosphorylation status of ribosomal protein S6 in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in GHRH-KO and control mice. The new data (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) have shown that adipose S6 phosphorylation is significantly reduced in GHRH-KO mice compared to controls, whereas there is no significant difference in muscle S6 phosphorylation between the two genotypes. These results imply that the inactivation of S6K in GHRH-KO mice might be tissue-specific.</p><p><italic>3) The authors fail to discuss causes of death – are the causes the same for the KO and wild-type mice? Is cancer incidence affected</italic>?</p><p>We certainly agree that future end-of-life pathology studies aimed at identifying causes of death in these animals would be of great interest. We have preserved carcasses of these animals for histopathological studies and our collaborator will analyze these materials. However, these pathology studies will require a great deal of time to complete and thus we will need to include these results in a future manuscript. Nevertheless, extrapolating from findings in other long-lived mutants with reduced somatotropic signaling, we suspect that reduced incidence and/or delayed onset of cancer may have been involved. This is now mentioned in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, the weigh curves for the male wild-type CR mice show that the male CR mice weighed almost the same as the AL mice. What is the explanation for this</italic>?</p><p>The expected pronounced difference of body weight between N-AL and N-CR males was seen up to the age of approximately 80 weeks, which approaches their median life expectancy. Afterward, body weight of N-AL animals began to exhibit a decline, which is normally seen during the final phase of life. The average body weights at advanced age may also have been influenced by deaths of some of the animals, especially in the N-AL group. The age-related decline of body weight in the N-CR group was delayed and diminished, as would be expected from the impact of CR on aging and longevity. The net result was that after the age of approximately 80 weeks, body weights of N-AL and N-CR males began to gradually converge. This is now stated in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) Given the dramatic changes in expression of the xenobiotic genes, it seems important to perform western blot analysis on at least a subset to determine to what extent the protein levels increase. Also, the tissue specificity is striking. It should be tested whether these changes are specific to liver, or whether they are apparent in other tissues, particularly metabolic tissues like skeletal muscle and adipose. In addition, it is not clear why the genes involved in xenobiotic metabolism are so important in mice that are not exposed to any xenobiotics. Is there any indication from the literature for why these genes may be important in the absence of toxic environments? This should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate the insightful comment of the reviewers. Regrettably, only a few of the xenobiotic enzymes can be measured by Western blot because specific antibodies are not currently available. We did, however, find an antibody specific for Cyp2b10, whose mRNA was seen to be elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in GHRH-KO mice, and used this antibody to measure Cyp2b10 expression in liver of GHRH-KO and littermate control mice by Western blot. We found that Cyp2b10 expression was significantly elevated in GHRH-KO mice relative to the controls also at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>) similar to the observed elevation seen at the mRNA level. In parallel, we also performed Resorufin conversion assay to measure cytochromeP450 enzymatic activity in liver tissues. GHRH-KO mice were found to have significantly higher hepatic cytochrome p450 activity than control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that these changes in xenobiotic metabolism enzymes are tissue-specific. These enzymes are usually more concentrated in the organs that are most directly exposed to the environment and toxins (i.e., liver, intestines, or lungs). We have found that other metabolic tissues including muscle and adipose have very low (undetectable) expression and activity of these xenobiotic enzymes in both GHRH-KO and control mice.</p><p>Lastly, the activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathways has been recently linked to lifespan extension in different slow-aging models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amador-Noguez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McElwee et al., 2004</xref>; Shore and Ruvkun, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Steinbaugh et al., 2012</xref>). However, the mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic metabolism genes in the absence of environmental toxins remain unknown. Some studies have shown elevation of bile acids (as potential endogenous xenobiotics) level and altered bile acid metabolism in GH deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amador-Noguez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amador-Noguez et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, several GH-mediated transcriptional factors, including Nrf-2, STAT 5b, and hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) 4alpha, have been shown to play an important role in xenobiotic gene expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Waxman and Holloway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we postulate that activation of xenobiotic metabolism pathways, presumably through inhibition of GH signaling and alterations of the corresponding transcriptional factors, protects the tissues from the damaging effects of endogenous and exogenous molecules and thus contributes to maintaining tissue and metabolic homeostasis during aging. We have added this information to the Discussion section of our paper.</p><p><italic>6) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>suggest that there is at least a trend toward higher oxygen consumption in the KO mice. While the data as generated may not reach significance, the authors should consider whether it really reflects no change, particularly in the daytime measurements</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that KO mice seem likely to have higher oxygen consumption rate. However, further analysis did not reveal any statistical significance. We speculate that GH signaling-related alternations in energy expenditure (i.e., oxygen consumption, thermogenesis, heat loss) could be differentially regulated at various developmental stages.</p></body></sub-article></article>
