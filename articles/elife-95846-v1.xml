To this end, imbalanced expression of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) is not only a consequence but also a driver of neoplastic growth. eIF3 is the largest, multi-subunit translation initiation complex with a modular assembly, where aberrant expression of one subunit generates only partially functional subcomplexes. To comprehensively study the effects of eIF3 remodeling, we contrasted the impact of eIF3d, eIF3e or eIF3h depletion on the translatome of HeLa cells using Ribo-seq. Depletion of eIF3d or eIF3e, but not eIF3h reduced the levels of multiple components of the MAPK signaling pathways. Surprisingly, however, depletion of all three eIF3 subunits increased MAPK/ERK pathway activity. Depletion of eIF3e and partially eIF3d also increased translation of TOP mRNAs that encode mainly ribosomal proteins and other components of the translational machinery. Moreover, alterations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry were often associated with changes in translation of mRNAs containing short uORFs, as in the case of the proto-oncogene MDM2 and the transcription factor ATF4. Collectively, perturbations in eIF3 subunit stoichiometry exert specific effect on the translatome comprising signaling and stress-related transcripts with complex 5’ UTRs that are implicated in homeostatic adaptation to stress and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>eIF3</kwd><kwd>MAPK pathway</kwd><kwd>translational control</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>ribosomal proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-25821X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valášek</surname><given-names>Leoš Shivaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004240</institution-id><institution>Akademie Věd České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Praemium Academiae</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valášek</surname><given-names>Leoš Shivaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001823</institution-id><institution>Ministerstvo Školství, Mládeže a Tělovýchovy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZ.02.01.01/00/22_008/0004575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Valášek</surname><given-names>Leoš Shivaya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001824</institution-id><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-08013S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vomastek</surname><given-names>Tomáš</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000156</institution-id><institution>Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Santé</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Investigator award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001823</institution-id><institution>The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LM2023055</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jelínek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LX22NPO5102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brábek</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>eIF3, despite being a general translation initiation factor, functions in mRNA-specific regulation, having a profound impact on the synthesis and activation of the MAPK pathway components and ribosomal proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translational control contributes significantly to the overall regulation of gene expression. Indeed, regulation at the level of translation provides quicker adaptive and usually reversible responses to environmental cues than transcriptional regulation as it acts on pre-existing mRNAs by simply turning their expression on or off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>). As such, translational control critically contributes to the maintenance of overall cellular homeostasis, suggesting that its dysregulation has detrimental effects on cell proliferation and, more broadly, on health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Scheper et al., 2007</xref>). In a rapidly growing number of cases, mutations and/or impaired expression of many translational components have been shown to either directly lead to or significantly contribute to various pathological conditions, including cancer (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de la Parra et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Robichaud and Sonenberg, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Spilka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Sriram et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Translation can be divided into four stages with the initiation stage playing the most critical role with respect to translational control. It begins with the formation of the 43 S pre-initiation complex (PIC) composed of the 40 S ribosomal subunit, the eIF2*GTP*Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> ternary complex (eIF2-TC), and eIFs 1, 1 A, 3, and 5 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Valásek, 2012</xref>). The next step is the mRNA recruitment to form the 48 S PIC, which is facilitated by the eIF4F cap-binding complex in concert with eIF3. Once the mRNA is loaded, the 48 S PIC starts scanning the mRNA’s 5’ untranslated region (UTR) until the start codon has been recognized by base-pairing with the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub><sup>Met</sup> anticodon. This drives conformational changes in the 48 S PIC, co-operatively mediated by eIF1, eIF1A, eIF2, eIF3 and eIF5, resulting in the closure of the 40 S mRNA binding channel and subsequent ejection of the eIF2*GDP*eIF5 subcomplex to allow subunit joining to commence (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hinnebusch, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cellular stresses primarily inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation <italic>via</italic> the eIF4F and eIF2-TC complexes. The former is under the control of two major stress-signaling hubs – the anabolic kinase – the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). They promote growth under nutrient-rich and stress-free conditions and deactivate in response to limited supply of amino acids, oxygen, ATP, growth factors or nutrients and play a role in the unfolded protein response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lindqvist et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roux and Topisirovic, 2018</xref>). These pathways are hyperactive in the vast majority of cancers, mainly due to activating mutations of RAS, BRAF and PI3K or loss-of-function mutations of the tumor suppressor PTEN, which are among the most common genetic perturbations in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kandoth et al., 2013</xref>). The latter – eIF2-TC – is a major target of the pro-survival, adaptive pathway called integrated stress response (ISR) encompassing four members of the eIF2α kinase family (PERK, PKR, GCN2, and HRI) that respond to a multitude of stimuli including nutrient limitation and endoplasmic reticulum stress by rapidly shutting down general translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been shown to play a key role in the transduction of extracellular signals into cellular responses. Three families of MAPK signaling pathways have been well characterized in mammalian cells: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK), and p38 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Zhang and Liu, 2002</xref>). The activation of MAPKs is a multistep process. In case of the best described Raf-MEK-ERK pathway, the essential linkers of epidermal growth factor receptors and other receptor tyrosine kinases with the MAPK cascade include adaptor protein Grb2, a Son of Sevenless (SOS) family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors, and a small GTP binding protein Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The MAPK cascade begins with MAPKKK (represented by c-Raf) which phosphorylates and activates MEK1 and MEK2 (MAPKKs). MEKs eventually phosphorylate, and thereby activate p44 MAPK and p42 MAPK, also known as ERK1 and ERK2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lavoie et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Stokoe et al., 1994</xref>). The activated ERKs then translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate and transactivate various transcription factors such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and c-Fos, thereby altering gene expression to promote growth, differentiation, or mitosis. The ERK/MAPK pathway also directly regulates translational machinery, for example by stimulating the activity of both ribosomal S6 protein kinases (RSKs; RSK1-4 in humans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carriere et al., 2008</xref>) and MAPK-interacting kinases (MNKs; MNK1 and 2 in humans; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buxade et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fukunaga and Hunter, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Waskiewicz et al., 1997</xref>). MNKs interact with eIF4G and phosphorylate eIF4E at Ser209, a site that increases the oncogenic potential of eIF4E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Topisirovic et al., 2004</xref>) and facilitates translation of specific mRNAs related to migration, metastasis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Furic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pyronnet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Robichaud et al., 2015</xref>). Following the stimulation of the ERK pathway, activated RSKs phosphorylate rpS6, eIF4B, eEF2K, and PDCD4, which are all important translational regulators (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Robichaud and Sonenberg, 2017</xref>). RSKs have also been implicated in the regulation of other signaling pathways involved in growth control, stress-response and cancer including the regulation of mTORC1 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Roux and Topisirovic, 2018</xref>). For example, RSKs have been shown phosphorylate and inhibit tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) that acts as the negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Roux et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic models of the core of MAPK/ERK pathway and human eIF3 complex.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The MAPK/ERK pathway activation by growth factors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).

Active ERK phosphorylates numerous substrates, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, to affect gene transcription, protein translation, cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Both RTKs and Ras also activate PI3K-AKT pathway that affect cell survival and growth. Conventional PAKs (PAK1-3) phosphorylate c-Raf and contribute to its activation.

Naturally, this leads to various pathologies. Overexpression of eIF4F complex components, for example, has been observed in various cancer entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">De Benedetti and Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lazaris-Karatzas et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ruggero, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Shuda et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Truitt and Ruggero, 2016</xref>). In addition to eIF4F components, dysregulation of the multi-subunit eIF3 complex is also involved in oncogenesis. Ten of the 12 eIF3 subunits have been linked to human cancers, many due to overexpression (a, b, c, d, g, h, m or i), some due to underexpression (e and f) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de la Parra et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gomes-Duarte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hershey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valášek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). In this regard, it is worth stressing that some eIF3 subunits have been shown to directly interact with specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), eIF3d together with DAP5 was shown to facilitate alternate form of cap-dependent mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de la Parra et al., 2018a</xref>), and eIF3k was recently proposed to serve as a regulator of the balanced ribosome content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duan et al., 2023</xref>). Despite all these observations, the exact mechanism(s) by which eIF3 affects various pathologies is virtually unknown. Moreover, previous studies that investigated the effect of eIF3 in specific diseases focus on altered levels of only one of the eIF3 subunits, while neglecting the need to consider the context of altered expression of the entire eIF3 complex.</p><p>Here, we draw attention to this unfortunate trend. eIF3 is the largest and most complex eIF of all eIFs, it is modular in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valášek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolf et al., 2020</xref>), and plays multiple roles not only in translation initiation, but also in termination, ribosomal recycling and stop codon readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beznosková et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beznosková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Pisarev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Poncová et al., 2019</xref>). Each of these roles may be regulated differently by individual subunits and/or their combinations, making it practically impossible to study them in isolation. Eight eIF3 subunits (a, c, e, f, h, k, l, and m) form a structural scaffold called the PCI (<bold>P</bold>roteasome, <bold>C</bold>OP9, e<bold>I</bold>F3) / MPN (<bold>M</bold>pr1-<bold>P</bold>ad1 <bold>N</bold>-terminal) octamer, whereas the remaining four non-octameric subunits (b, d, g, and i) are likely to be more flexible.

Using a systematic individual downregulation strategy, we showed that the expression of all 12 eIF3 subunits is interconnected such that perturbance of the expression of one subunit results in the down-regulation of entire modules leading to the formation of partial eIF3 subcomplexes with limited functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmannová et al., 2020</xref>). eIF3d is the only exception in this respect, as its downregulation does not influence expression of any other eIF3 subunit.

In particular, using the siRNA technology, we examined HeLa cells with reduced levels of eIF3d, eIF3e, or eIF3h subunits and cells treated with non-targeting (NT) siRNA. These eIF3 subunits were selected because the eIF3d depletion leads to a reduction in protein levels of only eIF3d and leaves the rest of the eIF3 complex intact, whereas downregulation of eIF3e or eIF3h generates partial eIF3 subcomplexes as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, targeting eIF3e with siRNA results in reduced protein levels of eIF3e, eIF3d, eIF3k, and eIF3l, whereas downregulation of eIF3h produces a partial eIF3 complex lacking subunits eIF3h, eIF3k, and eIF3l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Using qPCR, we measured mRNA levels of the siRNA targeted eIF3 subunits (eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3h), as well as of eIF3b as a negative control and a housekeeping gene ALAS1 for normalization purposes. Routinely, a difference of 4–5 cycles was achieved for each downregulated subunit, corresponding to ~16–32 fold decrease in mRNA levels; the mRNA levels of the control subunit eIF3b remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we determined protein levels of selected eIF3 subunits by Western blotting.

Finally, we performed polysome profiling to assess the impact on translation and obtained essentially the same results as before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>). The eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> showed the most pronounced defect in translation initiation, marked by a robust increase of the 80 S monosome peak and a concomitant decrease of polysome content, similar to eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, while eIF3h<sup>KD</sup> had only a modest effect on polysome formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>Ribo-Seq libraries were generated from each knock-down and NT control in three biological replicates as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ingolia et al., 2012</xref>.

(<bold>G</bold>) A gene could be either DTG (Differentially Transcribed Gene) and/or DTEG (Differential Translation Efficiency Gene), and based on the direction of change would fall into one of the eight gene-regulatory possibilities (sig: significant, n.s.: not significant). Translationally forwarded genes are DTGs that have a significant change in mRNA and FP at the same rate, with no significant change in TE. Conversely, translationally exclusive / translation only genes are DTEGs that have a significant change in FP, with no change in mRNA leading to a significant change in TE. Several genes are both DTGs and DTEGs, and their regulatory class is determined based on a combination of the relative direction of change between transcription and translation efficiency. Specifically, translationally buffered genes have a significant change in TE that counteracts the change in RNA; hence, buffering the effect of transcription. Translationally intensified genes have a significant change in TE that acts with the effect of transcription. In all cases, the change in RNA can be either positive or negative, and where buffering or intensifying takes place, the direction of change is taken into account. For example, a gene that exhibits an increase in transcription and an increase in translation efficiency is classified as intensified, while a gene that exhibits an increase in transcription but a decrease in translational efficiency is classified as buffered.

Consistently, the overall distribution of fold-changes in TE showed most pronounced changes in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It should be noted, however, that in contrast to polysome profiling, differential expression analysis of Ribo-Seq data normalizes out global changes in translational rates, and reveals only specific shifts of ribosome localization on individual mRNAs between the NT and KD datasets. Therefore, the fact that all three knock-downs showed an increase in TE (not just a decrease) for approximately half of the affected genes, clearly points to an impairment of a specific mode of regulation rather than simply to a non-specific global translational shutdown.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a considerable overlap between the knock-downs studied, such that only 1045 DTEGs are unique for eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and the rest (926) are shared with other two knock-downs; in particular 923 with eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> and 21 with eIF3h<sup>KD</sup> – in the latter case, the overlap reaches 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>).

Thus, despite reduced MAPK/ERK pathway protein levels, MAPK/ERK signaling appears to be activated when eIF3 function in translation is compromised.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Intact eIF3 contributes to translational regulation of ATF4 and MDM2</title><p>Knocking down eIF3h generates an eIF3 subcomplex lacking eIF3h and two nonessential subunits eIF3k and eIF3l (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), having only negligible impact on overall translation.

In eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, it can be classified as a translationally buffered gene because it has strongly upregulated mRNA levels, but this increase is not accompanied by a concomitant increase in the FP count, thereby resulting in decreased TE. In eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, it is even significantly translationally repressed (FPs are decreased). Using qPCR, we confirmed ATF4 mRNA upregulation in all three knock-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Because ATF4 protein levels are on the verge of the western blot detection limit under non-stress conditions, we examined whether all three knock-downs tested had any effect on ATF4 induction upon 3 hour-long ER stress provoked by 1 µM Thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Harding et al., 2000</xref>). Indeed, stress-mediated ATF4 induction was almost abolished in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, and strongly decreased in eIF3h<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This differential effect correlates well with our sequencing data, where the decrease in TE was also stronger in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>. The ATF4 protein levels in DMSO control are shown as a no stress reference. Overall, these findings further confirm that an intact eIF3 complex is required for proper translational control of ATF4, as we and others have previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hronová et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wagner et al., 2020</xref>), and as discussed below.</p><p>As both <italic>ATF4</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> are known to contain uORFs in their 5’ UTR that regulate their translation under stress vs. non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akulich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Lu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smirnova et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>), we examined the footprint coverage in the 5’ UTR of these genes in more detail. In the case of <italic>ATF4</italic>, a markedly increased accumulation of footprints was observed at the most 5’ Start-stop (St-st) element, specifically in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, while coverage of uORF1 decreased, and so did also the basal level of uORF2 (modestly) and <italic>ATF4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).

Regarding <italic>MDM2</italic>, footprint coverage was increased specifically for uORF1 in all three knock-downs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), consistent with its several-fold stronger inhibitory role on MDM2 expression compared to uORF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2003</xref>), which seems to be magnified in the absence of fully functional eIF3. Collectively, these results are in line with the well-established role of eIF3 in translation reinitiation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Valášek et al., 2017</xref>).

We divided them into those with significantly changed TE (decreased and increased) and those with unchanged TE and searched for significant differences in the median values of the tested traits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). In accordance with the Spearman correlation, in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, mRNAs of downregulated DTEGs had longer 5’ UTRs, while upregulated DTEGs possessed shorter 5’ UTRs, when compared to mRNAs with unchanged TE. The same trend is seen for the 3’ UTR length in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, but with lower significance.

For eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, we only observed differences of low significance due to the low number of DTEGs that were only translationally regulated (only 8 downregulated and 1 upregulated) (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, mRNAs with decreased TE in cells wherein eIF3d and eIF3e were depleted exhibited on average longer 5’ and 3’ UTRs and lower GC content in the CDS and 3’ UTRs.

We did not identify any specific sequence motif, but expectedly, the 5’ UTRs of ‘downregulated translation only DTEGs have a strong tendency to contain uORFs starting with AUG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>).

We focused on differential translation efficiency genes (DTEGs) and identified several distinct groups of DTEGs associated with individual eIF3 knock-downs.</p><p>Interestingly, while DTEGs identified in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> largely overlapped, considerably more DTEGs were identified in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> then in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, correlating well with the severity of the growth phenotype of both knock-downs, with the former being more detrimental despite not affecting eIF3 integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wagner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Why it is so is currently unknown. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that the higher number of DTEGs identified in the same pathways in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> vs. eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> originated in different eIF3d protein levels between the two knock-downs. Despite being markedly co-downregulated in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, eIF3d levels were more dramatically reduced in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> compared to eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, as expected. Furthermore, eIF3d is a peripheral subunit that binds to the head of the 40 S subunit (mainly via the small ribosomal protein Rps16 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Herrmannová et al., 2020</xref>) and is connected to the eIF3 octamer not only via eIF3e but also via the eIF3a and c subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bochler et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that eIF3d may remain partially operational even in the absence of eIF3e, and therefore the more severe phenotype in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> is likely to stem from lower levels of the eIF3d protein compared to eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>. Following this logic, phenotypes that are common to eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> are likely a consequence of reduction in eIF3d protein levels. Another way to explain this ostensible paradox is that eIF3d could have functions outside of the eIF3 complex. The fact that in the absence of eIF3e – its interaction partner, eIF3d gets rapidly degraded, however, speaks against this option. It is also possible that eIF3d, as a head-interacting subunit close to an important head-situated ribosomal protein RACK1, which interacts with eIF3c and serves as a landing pad for regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kouba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Nilsson et al., 2004</xref>), could be a target of signaling pathways. This may render this eIF3 subunit critically important for translation of specific mRNAs. In support, eIF3d (in the context of entire eIF3) was shown to be regulated by stress-triggered phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lamper et al., 2020</xref>) and, together with DAP5, it was shown to promote translation by an alternate cap-dependent (eIF4F-independent) mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">de la Parra et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In any case, perhaps the most intriguing finding is that eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and, to a large extent, also eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> result in translational repression of a marked number of the MAPK pathways constituents, significantly reducing their protein levels, despite the apparent compensatory mechanisms that increase their mRNA levels. Somewhat unexpectedly, despite the downregulation of a number of its components, eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> but also eIF3h<sup>KD</sup> appear to activate MAPK/ERK pathway as evidenced by the elevated ERK1/2 and c-Jun phosphorylation. Notably, the eIF3d influence on the MAPK/ERK pathway was previously demonstrated in HTR-8/SVneo cells, where overexpression of eIF3d led to hypo-phosphorylation of MEK1 and ERK1/2, while downregulation had the opposite effect; however, no significant effect on the protein levels of its components was detected in this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, since the increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed not only in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> but also in eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, where expression of MAPK pathways proteins is unaffected, we conclude that activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway is a general consequence of the compromised eIF3 function.</p><p>Expression of the transcription factor c-Jun is partially controlled by the MAPK/ERK pathway and, consistently, we found that it is strongly upregulated in all three knock-downs. Moreover, we observed that all three knockdowns activated c-Jun as evidenced by its increased nuclear translocation. Although <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA was previously shown to interact directly with eIF3 through a stable stem loop occurring in its 5’ UTR, which positively stimulated its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), in this study we observed upregulation of the <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA abundance, whereby the depletion of eIF3d, e, or h had no conspicuous effect on its translational efficiency. This can be explained by a recent report showing that eIF3d binds to <italic>JUN</italic> mRNA with increased affinity during chronic ER stress, suggesting that eIF3d-dependent translational regulation may be triggered by stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Mukhopadhyay et al., 2023</xref>). Because c-Jun is a component of the AP1 transcription factor complex, wherein it either homodimerizes or heterodimerizes with other AP1 proteins, we examined the effects of eIF3 subunit depletion on mRNA, FP and TE trends of other AP1 family members. Similarly to c-Jun, only FOSL1 and ATF3 showed increased mRNA levels and FP counts with no net changes in TE, whereas other members of the JUN (JUNB and JUND) and FOS (FOS, FOSB, FOSL2) families remained unaltered. In addition, the ATF family members ATF2 and ATF4 were even downregulated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notwithstanding that our data suggest that impairment of eIF3 function may be compensated by the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, further research is required to unravel the full spectrum of changes associated with the MAPK pathways in eIF3-impaired cells. At the current state of our knowledge, we can only speculate that when translation is compromised, cells attempt to counteract it in two ways: (1) they produce more ribosomes to increase translational rates, and (2) activate MAPK signaling to send pro-growth signals that may ultimately further increase ribosome biogenesis, as further discusses below.</p><p>Recently, Lin et al. carried out Ribo-seq analysis in MCF-10A cells downregulated for eIF3e (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lin et al., 2020</xref>). They identified 240 downregulated and 220 upregulated eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>-specific DTEGs that overlap very poorly with our DTEGs (data not shown). In addition, they identified a set of 2683 eIF3e-dependent mRNAs encoding many proteins associated with mitochondrial and membrane functions that showed increased ribosome density between codons 25 and 75 in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>. Those mRNAs were therefore proposed to require eIF3e to recruit chaperons to promote their early elongation. While this set of genes displayed a significant overlap with our DTEGs (see below), we did not observe a similar phenomenon (a specifically increased ribosome density early on) in our datasets. In metagene analysis, we did observe some accumulation of footprints at the beginning of the CDS, but this was present in all samples, including NT, whereby peaks were located around codon 20 downstream of the translation initiation sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, still considering that the ‘accumulation effect’ observed by Lin et al., most probably resulting from ribosome stalling and/or slower elongation rates, could artificially increase FPs and TE without actually increasing synthesis of the corresponding proteins in our datasets, we trimmed the first 225 nt (75 codons) from all mRNA’s CDSs, and repeated the differential expression analysis in the same way. When compared, the two DE analyses showed approximately 80–90% identical DTEGs and high correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient of eIF3d<sup>KD</sup>: 0.924, eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>: 0.925, eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>: 0.834), suggesting that our DE analysis is not biased by ribosome accumulation in the first 75 codons and reflects true changes in translation efficiency.</p><p>Despite this ‘accumulation effect’ discrepancy, comparing our DTEGs with the Lin et al. eIF3e-dependent data, we found a very significant overlap of 446 genes between the eIF3e-dependent mRNAs and our eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> ‘all upregulated’ dataset (p&lt;1 × 10<sup>–53</sup>), while the overlap with eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> ‘all upregulated’ – 251 genes – was surprisingly smaller (p&lt;1 × 10<sup>–24</sup>). Moreover, our KEGG enrichment analysis of eIF3e-dependent mRNAs from Lin et al. revealed the same top 2 KEGG pathways (data not shown) as in case of eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> ‘all upregulated’ groups; that is Lysosome and Protein processing in ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Considering that eIF3d was co-depleted with eIF3e in the eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> of Lin et al., it is conceivable that not eIF3e but the eIF3d subunit (or cooperatively both subunits together) ensures loading of quality control factors to promote elongation of transmembrane proteins. In any case, resolving this issue will require further research.</p><p>Based on our analysis, eIF3e seems to be primarily involved in controlling the balanced production of mature ribosomes, as its loss resulted in significant number of ‘unique upregulated’ DTEGs with strong enrichment for the KEGG Ribosome and GO Translation and Ribosome biogenesis terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Focusing directly on RPs, nearly twice as many RPs with significantly altered TEs were identified in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> compared to eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> (32 vs 16) and a similar pattern was also evident at the FP level (91 vs 64). However, despite this obvious difference, RPs were increased similarly in both eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F and H</xref>). This discrepancy between our Ribo-Seq and Western blot results in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> <italic>versus</italic> eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D vs. E</xref>) might be explained by the enhanced stabilization of RPs by the previously described compensatory dosage mechanism at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ishikawa, 2021</xref>). In particular, to preserve the stoichiometry of the ribosome when numerous RPs are translationally upregulated, the rest of the RPs would be protected from degradation. This speculation can be supported by the impact of all knock-downs on translation efficiency of different E3 ubiquitin ligases, as described for eIF3h<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). Similar effect of increased RPs production was recently reported also for eIF3k<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Duan et al., 2023</xref>). Of note, eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> also decreases protein levels of eIF3k and eIF3l and thus this RP-specific effect could be at least partially attributed to the loss of eIF3k. However, increased RP production was also observed in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup>, where eIF3k is normally present, but was not observed in eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, where eIF3k and eIF3l are also co-depleted. Thus, although it now seems well-established that the eIF3 complex exerts control over RP production, the exact contribution of its individual subunits to this regulation awaits further analysis.</p><p>An important hint could be that all cytoplasmic RPs with increased TE in eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> (and most of mitochondrial RPs) were upregulated solely at the translational level (their mRNA levels did not change), which may well correspond to the fact that RP mRNAs belong to the TOP mRNAs family. These mRNAs contain a polypyrimidine tract in their 5’ UTR and were suggested to be regulated solely at the translational level in response to stress or unfavorable growth conditions through mTORC1 or PI3-kinase pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cockman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Philippe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Stolovich et al., 2002</xref>). Besides RPs, this family also includes some translational initiation and elongation factors (for the list of TOP mRNAs see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Accordingly, we found that TOP transcripts were significantly translationally activated in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), suggesting a role of eIF3e and eIF3d in repressing translation of TOP mRNAs under normal cellular conditions. Interestingly, since mTOR-activated translation of non-TOP transcripts was predominantly translationally offset (buffered) in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), it appears that both effects are independent of each other; that is, mTOR does not generally operate <italic>via</italic> eIF3 and eIF3 does not require mTOR activation to fine tune RP production. It is also noteworthy that upregulation of cytosolic ribosomal proteins has previously been reported in association with the eIF3m downregulation – albeit only at transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Smekalova et al., 2020</xref>), or with downregulation of eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gerashchenko et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition, as we were unable to find any specific sequence motif in the 5’ UTRs of the mRNAs whose TE was affected in eIF3 subunit-depleted cells, we cross-referenced our eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> ‘all’ and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup> ‘all’ groups with transcripts that physically interact with eIF3 as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lee et al., 2015</xref>. We found that out of the 402 transcripts with a putative eIF3 binding sites in their 5’ UTRs, 92 and 65 had significantly altered TE in the eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>, respectively (51 were common for both eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This notable overlap involving for example the MAPK1 gene further underscores the robustness of our screening approach.</p><p>Among the few downregulated DTEGs in eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, we found <italic>ATF4</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> mRNAs, whose translation is tightly regulated by the presence of uORFs in their 5’ UTRs in response to specific stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akulich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Smirnova et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>). Here, we showed that these mRNAs were translationally downregulated in our knock-downs under non-stress conditions and, accordingly, their most 5’ short uORFs (or St-st in the case of <italic>ATF4</italic>) accumulated FPs, most probably slowing down the flow of ribosomes downstream. The fact that transcripts of these genes contain uORFs in their 5’ UTRs also correlates well with our finding that 5’ UTRs of ‘downregulated translation only’ DTEGs have a strong tendency to contain AUG-initiated uORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). Noteworthy, the impaired <italic>ATF4</italic> induction in our eIF3 knock-downs under ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), was reported before also for knock-downs of eIF3a, eIF3c, eIF3d, eIF3g, but not eIF3l (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guan et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, eIF3h and specifically modified eIF3a have been directly shown to modulate resumption of scanning from <italic>ATF4</italic>’s uORF1 for efficient reinitiation downstream; that is one of the key steps in the <italic>ATF4</italic> translational control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hronová et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shu et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the intact eIF3 complex is required for stimulation of reinitiation on uORF-containing mRNAs, such as <italic>ATF4</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic> to ensure their efficient translation on demand. Interestingly, the impact on translation of <italic>MDM2</italic> mRNA could indicate that eIF3 is also linked to the key tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Marine and Lozano, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Among a few upregulated DTEGs in eIF3h<sup>KD</sup>, we noticed PRRC2A, which was significantly upregulated in all three knock-downs and was recently identified by the Teleman’s group as a protein interacting with the translational machinery, including eIF3. Interestingly, they found that PRRC2 proteins affected translation initiation by promoting leaky scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bohlen et al., 2023</xref>) and that the triple knock-down of all PRRC2 proteins (PRRC2A, PRRC2B, PRRC2C) specifically decreased translation efficiency of mRNAs harboring uORFs in their 5’ UTRs, including <italic>ATF4</italic> and <italic>RAF1</italic> studied also here, similar to our eIF3 knock-downs. They concluded that uORFs are a key element determining PRRC2-dependence. Thus, we speculate that by increased expression of PRRC2A (and also PRRC2B and PRRC2C in eIF3d<sup>KD</sup> and eIF3e<sup>KD</sup>), cells attempt to compensate for ineffective translation of mRNAs with short uORFs, which often encode regulatory proteins. Intriguingly, all PRRC2 proteins themselves have a highly translated overlapping-uORF in their 5' UTR, suggesting that they might be a subject to an autoregulatory mechanism.</p><p>Although our results presented here and summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> are limited to HeLa cells and future work is needed to confirm their universal validity in other cells and tissues, a growing body of evidence suggests that eIF3 plays a critical role in translational regulation of specific mRNAs encoding regulatory proteins, very often utilizing uORFs and/or specific secondary structures in their 5’ UTRs. Here, we demonstrate that alterations in the eIF3 subunit stoichiometry and/or eIF3 subcomplexes have distinct effects on the translatome; for example, they affect factors that play a prominent (either positive or negative) role in cancer biology (e.g. MDM2 and cJUN), but the resulting impact is unclear so far. Considering the complex interactions between these factors as well as the complexity of the eIF3 complex per se, future studies are required to delineate the specific oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways that play a predominant role in mediating the effects of perturbations in the eIF3 complex in the context of neoplasia. Taking into account that malignant cells exhibit augmented activity of many components of the translation machinery and are inherently believed to become ‘addicted’ to elevated protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ruggero, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Silvera et al., 2010</xref>), this type of research is important because it is increasingly apparent that targeting general components of the canonical translational machinery, such as eIF3, which acts upstream of effector proteins directly involved in tumorigenesis, may hold promise for overcoming the major obstacle associated with intratumor heterogeneity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines, culture conditions, and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells (ATCC Cat# CCL-2, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0030">CVCL_0030</ext-link>) were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Ø 15 cm dishes in DMEM (Sigma, cat #D6429) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, cat # 10270–106).

Specifically, the 13-subunit eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex is critical for translation initiation as it aids in 48S PIC assembly to allow for ribosome scanning. In addition, eIF3 has been shown to drive transcript-specific translation by binding mRNA 5' cap structures through the eIF3d subunit. Dysregulation of eIF3 has been implicated in oncogenesis, however the precise eIF3 subunit contributions are unclear. Here, Herrmannová et al. aim to investigate how eIF3 subcomplexes, generated by knock down (KD) of either eIF3e, eIF3d or eIF3h, affect the global translatome. Using Ribo-seq and RNA-seq, the authors identified a large number of genes that exhibit altered translation efficiency upon eIF3d/e KD, while translation defects upon eIF3h KD were mild. eIF3d/eKD share multiple dysregulated transcripts, perhaps due to both subcomplexes lacking eIF3d. Both eIF3d/e KD increase translation efficiency (TE) of transcripts encoding lysosomal, ER and ribosomal proteins, suggesting a role of eIF3 in ribosome biogenesis and protein quality control. Many transcripts encoding ribosomal proteins harbor a TOP motif, and eIF3d KD and eIF3e KD cells exhibit a striking induction of these TOP-modified transcripts. On the other hand, eIF3d KD and eIF3e KD leads to a reduction of MAPK/ERK pathway proteins. Despite this downregulation, eIF3d KD and eIF3e KD activates MAPK/ERK signaling as ERK1/2 and c-Jun phosphorylation was induced. Finally, in all three knockdowns, MDM2 and ATF4 protein levels are reduced. This is notable because MDM2 and ATF4 both contain short uORFs upstream of the start codon, and further supports a role of eIF3 in reinitiation. Altogether, Herrmannová et al. have gained key insights to precise eIF3-mediated translational control as it relates to key signaling pathways implicated in cancer.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have provided a comprehensive set of data to analyze RNA and ribosome footprinting upon perturbation of eIF3d, eIF3e, and eIF3h. As described above in the summary, these data present many interesting starting points to understand additional roles of the eIF3 complex and specific subunits in translational control.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- The differences between eIF3e and eIF3d knockdown are difficult to reconcile, especially since eIF3e knockdown leads to reduction in eIF3d levels.</p><p>- The paper would be strengthened by experiments directly testing what RNA determinants allow for transcript-specific translation regulation by the eIF3 complex. This would allow the paper to be less descriptive.</p><p>- The paper would have more biological relevance if eIF3 subunits were perturbed to mimic naturally occurring situations where eIF3 is dysregulated. For example, eIF3e is aberrantly upregulated in certain cancers, and therefore an overexpression and profiling experiment would have been more relevant than a knockdown experiment.</p><p>The first review is unchanged as no additional experiments were provided to address the first review.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.95846.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, Hermannova et al catalog the changes in ribosome association with mRNAs when the multisubunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 is disrupted by knocking down individual subunits. They find that RNAs relying on TOP motifs for translation, such as ribosomal protein RNAs, and RNAs encoding modification enzymes in the ER and components of the lysosome are upregulated. In contrast, proteins encoding components of MAP kinase cascades are downregulated when subunits of eIF3 are knocked down, but retain elevated levels of activity.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors use ribosome profiling of well-characterized mutants lacking subunits of eIF3 and assess the changes in translation that take place. They supplement the ribosome association studies with western blotting to determine protein level changes of affected transcripts.

Changes observed by both ribosome profiling and western blotting supports their claims that eIF3 functions in mRNA-specific control of translation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The paper would be strengthened if there were a clear model tying the various effects together or linking individual subunit knockdown to cancerous phenotypes.

We did not discuss the comment 4, however, as we are really not sure what is the true effect and did not want to go into wild speculations in our manuscript. We thank this reviewer for his insightful comments and understanding.</p><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) The authors report the potential translational regulation of Raf kinase by re-initiation. It would be interesting to show that Raf is indeed regulated by uORF-mediated translation, and that this is dependent on an intact eIF3 complex. Analyzing the potential consequences of Raf1 regulation for cancer cell proliferation or apoptosis would be a plus.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an interesting and likely possibility. In fact, another clue that translation of Raf1 is regulated by uORFs comes from Bohlen et al. 2023 (PMID: 36869665) where they showed that RAF1 translation is dependent on PRRC2 proteins (that promote leaky scanning through these uORFs). We noted in the discussion that our results from eIF3d/e/hKD and the PRRC2A/B/CKD partly overlap. It is a subject of our follow-up research to investigate whether eIF3 and PRRC2 co-operate together to regulate translation of this important mRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors show that eIF3 d/e -but not 3h- has an effect on cell proliferation. First, this indicates that proliferation does not fully correlate with eIF3 integrity. Depletion of eIF3d does not affect the integrity of eIF3, yet the effects on proliferation are similar to those of eIF3e. What is the possibility that changes in proliferation reflect functions of eIF3d outside the eIF3 complex? What could be the real consequences of disturbing eIF3 integrity for the mammalian cell? Please, discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, proliferation does not fully correlate with eIF3 integrity. Downregulation of eIF3 subunits that lead to disintegration of eIF3 YLC core (a, b, c, g, i) have more detrimental effect on growth and translation than downregulation of the peripheral subunits (e, k, l, f, h, m). Our previous studies (Wagner et al. 2016, PMID: 27924037 and Herrmannová et al. 2020, PMID: 31863585) indicate that the YLC core of eIF3 can partially support translation even without its peripheral subunits. In this respect eIF3d (as a peripheral subunit) is an amazing exception, suggesting it may have some specialized function(s). Whether this function resides outside of the eIF3 complex or not we do not know, but do not think so. Mainly because in the absence of eIF3e – its interaction partner, eIF3d gets rapidly degraded. Therefore, it is not very likely that eIF3d exists alone outside of eIF3 complex with moonlighting functions elsewhere. We think that eIF3d, as a head-interacting subunit close to an important head ribosomal protein RACK1 (a landing pad for regulatory proteins), is a target of signaling pathways, which may make it important for translation of specific mRNAs. In support is these thoughts, eIF3d (in the context of entire eIF3) together with DAP5 were shown to promote translation by an alternate capdependent (eIF4F-independent) mechanism (Lee et al. 2016, PMID: 27462815; de la Parra et al. 2018, PMID:30076308). In addition, the eIF3d function (also in the context of entire eIF3) was proved to be regulated by stress-triggered phosphorylation (Lamper et al. 2020, PMID: 33184215).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 6D: Surprisingly, reduced levels of ERK1/2 upon eIF3d/e-KD are compensated by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and net activation of c-Jun. Please comment on the functional consequences of buffering mechanisms that the cell deploys in order to counteract compromised eIF3 function. Why would the cell activate precisely the MAPK pathway to compensate for a compromised eIF3 function?</p></disp-quote><p>This we do not know. We can only speculate that when translation is compromised, cells try to counteract it in two ways: (1) they produce more ribosomes to increase translational rates and (2) activate MAPK signaling to send pro-growth signals, which can in the end further boost ribosome biogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Regarding DAP-sensitive transcripts, can the authors discuss in more detail the role of eIF3d in alternative cap-dependent translation versus re-initiation? Are these transcripts being translated by a canonical cap- and uORF-dependent mechanism or by an alternative capdependent mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed not an easy question. On one hand, it was shown that DAP5 facilitates translation re-initiation after uORF translation in a canonical cap-dependent manner. This mechanism is essential for translation of the main coding sequence (CDS) in mRNAs with structured 5' leaders and multiple uORFs. (Weber et al. 2022, PMID: 36473845; David et al., 2022, PMID: 35961752). On the other hand, DAP5 was proposed to promote alternative, eIF4F-independent but cap-dependent translation, as it can substitute the function of the eIF4F complex in cooperation with eIF3d (de la Parra et al., 2018, PMID: 30076308; Volta et al., 2021 34848685). Overall, these observations paint a very complex picture for us to propose a clear scenario of what is going on between these two proteins on individual mRNAs. We speculate that both mechanisms are taking place and that the specific mechanism of translation initiation differs for differently arranged mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>(5) Figure S2C: why is there a strong reduction of the stop codon peak for 3d and 3h KDs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have checked the Ribowaltz profiles of all replicates (in the Supplementary data we are showing only a representative replicate I) and the stop codon peak differs a lot among the replicates. We think that this way of plotting was optimized for calculation and visualization of P-sites and triplet periodicity and thus is not suitable for this type of comparison among samples. Therefore, we have performed our own analysis where the 5’ ends of reads are used instead of P-sites and triplicates are averaged and normalized to CDS (see below please), so that all samples can be compared directly in one plot (same as Fig. S13A but for stop codon). We can see that the stop codon peak really differs and is the smallest for eIF3hKD. However, these changes are in the range of 20% and we are not sure about their biological significance. We therefore refrain from drawing any conclusions. In general, reduced stop codon peak may signal faster termination or increased stop codon readthrough, but the latter should be accompanied by an increased ribosome density in the 3’UTR, which is not the case. A defect in termination efficiency would be manifested by an increased stop codon peak, instead.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-95846-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figures 5 and S8: Adding a vertical line at 'zero' in all cumulative plots will help the reader understand the author's interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a dashed grey vertical line at zero as requested. However, for interpretation of these plots, the reader should focus on the colored curve and whether it is shifted in respect to the grey curve (background) or not.

The reported p-value then indicates the statistical significance of the shift.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The entire Figure 2 are controls that can go to Supplementary Material.

Figure S3B is now the main Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) There are 3 replicates for Ribo-Seq and four for RNA-Seq. Were these not carried out in parallel, as it is usually done in Ribo-seq experiments? Why is there an extra replicate for RNASeq?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the three replicates were carried out in parallel. We have decided to add the fourth replicate in RNA-Seq to increase the data robustness as the RNA-Seq is used for normalization of FP to calculate the TE, which was our main analyzed metrics in this article. We had the option to add the fourth replicate as we originally prepared five biological replicates for all samples, but after performing the control experiments, we selected only the 3 best replicates for the Ribo-Seq library preparation and sequencing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Please, add another sheet in Table S2 with the names of all genes that change only at the translation (RPF) levels.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have added three extra sheets (one for each downregulation) for differential FP with Padjusted &lt;0.05 in the Spreadsheet S2. We also provide a complete unfiltered differential expression data (sheet named “all data”), so that readers can filter out any relevant data based on their interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Page 5, bottom: ' ...we showed that the expression of all 12 eIF3 subunits is interconnected such that perturbance of the expression of one subunit results in the down-regulation of entire modules...'. This is not true for eIF3d, as shown in Fig1B and mentioned in Results.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer is correct. By this generalized statement, we were trying to summarize our previous results from Wagner et al., 2014, PMID: 24912683; Wagner et al.,2016, PMID: 27924037 and Herrmannova et al.,2020, PMID: 31863585. The eIF3d downregulation is the only exception that does not affect expression of any other eIF3 subunit. Therefore, we have rewritten this paragraph accordingly: “We recently reported a comprehensive in vivo analysis of the modular dynamics of the human eIF3 complex (Wagner <italic>et al</italic>, 2020; Wagner <italic>et al</italic>, 2014; Wagner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2016). Using a systematic individual downregulation strategy, we showed that the expression of all 12 eIF3 subunits is interconnected such that perturbance of the expression of one subunit results in the down-regulation of entire modules leading to the formation of partial eIF3 subcomplexes with limited functionality (Herrmannova <italic>et al</italic>, 2020). eIF3d is the only exception in this respect, as its downregulation does not influence expression of any other eIF3 subunit.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Page 10, bottom: ' The PCA plot and hierarchical clustering... These results suggest that eIF3h depletion impacts the translatome differentially than depletion of eIF3e or eIF3d.' This is already obvious in the polysome profiles of Figure S2C.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this result is surely not surprising given the polysome profile and growth phenotype analyses of eIF3hKD. But still, we think that the PCA plot and hierarchical clustering results represent valuable controls. Nonetheless, we rephrased this section to note that this result agrees with the polysome profiles analysis: “The PCA plot and hierarchical clustering (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 4A) showed clustering of the samples into two main groups: Ribo-Seq and RNA-seq, and also into two subgroups; NT and eIF3hKD samples clustered on one side and eIF3eKD and eIF3dKD samples on the other. These results suggest that the eIF3h depletion has a much milder impact on the translatome than depletion of eIF3e or eIF3d, which agrees with the growth phenotype and polysome profile analyses (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Page 12: ' As for the eIF3dKD &quot;unique upregulated&quot; DTEGs, we identified one interesting and unique KEGG pathway, the ABC transporters (Supplementary Figure 5A, in green).' This sentence is confusing, as there are more pathways that are significant in this group, so it is unclear why the authors consider it 'unique'.</p></disp-quote><p>The eIF3dKD “unique upregulated” group comprises genes with increased TE only in eIF3dKD but not in eIF3eKD or eIF3hKD (500 genes, Fig 2G). All these 500 genes were examined for enrichment in the KEGG pathways, and the top 10 significant pathways were reported (Fig S6A). However, 8 out of these 10 pathways were also significantly enriched in other gene groups examined (e.g. eIF3d/eIF3e common). Therefore, the two remaining pathways (“ABC transporters” and “Other types of O-glycan biosynthesis”) are truly unique for eIF3dKD. We wanted to highlight the ABC transporters group in particular because we find it rather interesting (for the reasons mentioned in the article). We have corrected the sentence in question to avoid confusion: “Among the eIF3dKD “unique upregulated” DTEGs, we identified one interesting KEGG pathway, the ABC transporters, which did not show up in other gene groups (Supplementary Figure 6A, in green). A total of 12 different ABC transporters had elevated TE (9 of them are unique to eIF3dKD, while 3 were also found in eIF3eKD), 6 of which (ABCC1-5, ABCC10) belong to the C subfamily, known to confer multidrug resistance with alternative designation as multidrug resistance protein (MRP1-5, MRP7) (Sodani <italic>et al</italic>, 2012).</p><p>Interestingly, all six of these ABCC transporters were upregulated solely at the translational level (Supplementary Spreadsheet S2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Note typo ('Various') in Figure 4A.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) The introduction could be shortened.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very subjective requirement. In fact, when this manuscript was reviewed in NAR, we were asked by two reviewers to expand it substantially. Because a number of various research topics come together in this work, e.g. translational regulation, the eIF3 structure and function, MAPK/ERK signaling, we are convinced that all of them demand a comprehensive introduction for non-experts in each of these topics. Therefore, with all due respect to this reviewer, we did not ultimately shorten it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>- In Figure 2, it would be useful to know why eIF3d is destabilized by eIF3e knockdown - is it protein degradation and why do the eIF3d/e knockdowns not more completely phenocopy each other when there is the same reduction to eIF3d as in the eIF3d knockdown sample?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we do think that protein degradation lies behind the eIF3d destabilization in the eIF3eKD, but we have not yet directly demonstrated this. However, we have shown that eIF3d mRNA levels are not altered in eIF3eKD and that Ribo-Seq data indicate no change in TE or FP for eIF3d-encoding mRNA in eIF3eKD. Nonetheless, it is important to note (and we discuss it in the article) that eIF3d levels in eIF3dKD are lower than eIF3d levels in eIF3eKD (please see Supplementary Figure 1C). In fact, we believe that this is one of the main reasons for the eIF3d/e knockdowns differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The western blots in Figures 4 and 6 show modest changes to target protein levels and would be strengthened by quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the quantifications as requested by this reviewer and the reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For Figure 4, this figure would be strengthened by experiments showing if the increase in ribosomal protein levels is correlated with actual changes to ribosome biogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we performed polysome profiling in the presence of EDTA to monitor changes in the 60S/40S ratio, indicating a potential imbalance in the biogenesis of individual ribosome subunits. We found that it was not affected (Figure 3G). In addition, we performed the same experiment, normalizing all samples to the same number of cells (cells were carefully counted before lysis). In this way, we confirmed that eIF3dKD and eIF3eKD cells indeed contain a significantly increased number of ribosomes, in agreement with the western blot analysis (Figure 3H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 6, there needs to be a nuclear loading control.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment was repeated with Lamin B1 used as a nuclear loading control – it is now shown as Fig. 5F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- For Figure 8, these findings would be strengthened using luciferase reporter assays where the various RNA determinants are experimentally tested. Similarly, 5′ TOP RNA reporters would have been appreciated in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a logical continuation of our work, which represents the current work in progress of one of the PhD students. We apologize, but we consider this time- and resource-demanding analysis out of scope of this article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Within the many effects observed, it is mentioned that eIF3d is known to be overexpressed while eIF3e is underexpressed in many cancers, but knockdown of either subunit decreases MDM2 levels, which would be expected to increase P53 activity and decrease tumor cell transformation. In contrast, they also report that 3e/3d knockdown dramatically increases levels of cJUN, presumably due to increased MAPK activity, and is expected to increase protumor gene expression. Additional discussion is needed to clarify the significance of the findings, which are a bit confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed true. However, considering the complexity of eIF3, the largest initiation factor among all, as well as the broad portfolio of its functions, it is perhaps not so surprising that the observed effects are complex and may seem even contradictory in respect to cancer. To acknowledge that, we expanded the corresponding part of discussion as follows: “Here, we demonstrate that alterations in the eIF3 subunit stoichiometry and/or eIF3 subcomplexes have distinct effects on the translatome; for example, they affect factors that play a prominent (either positive or negative) role in cancer biology (e.g., MDM2 and cJUN), but the resulting impact is unclear so far. Considering the complex interactions between these factors as well as the complexity of the eIF3 complex <italic>per se</italic>, future studies are required to delineate the specific oncogenic and tumor suppressive pathways that play a predominant role in mediating the effects of perturbations in the eIF3 complex in the context of neoplasia.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There are places in the text where the authors refer to changes in transcriptional control when RNA levels differ, but transcription versus RNA turnover wasn't tested, e.g. page 16 and Figure S10, qPCR does not confirm &quot;transcriptional upregulation in all three knockdowns&quot; and page 19 &quot;despite apparent compensatory mechanisms that increase their transcription.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed true, the sentences in question were corrected. The term “increased mRNA levels” was used instead of transcriptional upregulation (increased mRNA stabilization is also possible).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, the authors suggest that steady-state LARP1 protein levels are unaffected based on ribosome footprint counts (page 21). It is incorrect to assume this, because ribosome footprints can be elevated due to stalling on RNA that isn't being translated and doesn't yield more protein, and because levels of translated RNA/synthesized proteins do not always reflect steady-state protein levels, especially in mutants that could affect lysosome levels and protein turnover. Also page 12, 1st paragraph suggests protein production is down when ribosome footprints are changed.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we are well-aware of this known limitation of Ribo-seq analysis. Therefore, the steadystate protein levels of our key hits were verified by western blotting. In addition, we have removed the sentence about LARP1 because it was based on Ribo-Seq data only without experimental evaluation of the steady-state LARP1 protein levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The translation buffering effect is not clear in some Figures, e.g. S6, S8, 8A, and B. The authors show a scheme for translationally buffered RNAs being clustered in the upper right and lower left quadrants in S4H (translation up with transcript level down and v.v.), but in the FP versus RNA plots, the non-TOP RNAs and 4E-P-regulated RNAs don't show this behavior, and appear to show a similar distribution to the global changes. Some of the right panels in these figures show modest shifts, but it's not clear how these were determined to be significant. More information is needed to clarify, or a different presentation, such as displaying the RNA subsets in the left panels with heat map coloring to reveal whether RNAs show the buffered translation pattern defined in purple in Figure S4H, or by reporting a statistical parameter or number of RNAs that show behavior out of total for significance. Currently the conclusion that these RNAs are translationally buffered seems subjective since there are clearly many RNAs that don't show changes, or show translation-only or RNA-only changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that S4H does not indicate a necessity for changes in FPs in the buffered subsets. Although opposing changes in total mRNA and FPs are classified as buffering, often we also consider the scenario where there are changes to the total mRNA levels not accompanied by changes in ribosome association.</p><p>In figure S6, the scatterplots indicate a high density of genes shifted towards negative fold changes on the x-axis (total mRNA). This is also reflected in the empirical cumulative distribution functions (ecdfs) for the log2 fold changes in total mRNA in the far right panels of A and B, and the lack of changes in log2 fold change for FPs (middle panels). Similarly, in figure S8, the scatterplots indicate a density of genes shifted towards positive fold changes on the x-axis for total mRNA. The ecdfs also demonstrate that there is a significant directional shift in log2 fold changes in the total mRNA that is not present to a similar degree in the FPs, consistent with translational offsetting. It is rightly pointed out that not all genes in these sets follow the same pattern of regulation. We have revised the title of Supplementary Figure S6 (now S7) to reflect this. However, we would like to emphasize that these figures are not intended to communicate that all genes within these sets of interest are regulated in the same manner, but rather that when considered as a whole, the predominant effect seen is that of translational offsetting (directional shifts in the log2 fold change distribution of total mRNA that are not accompanied by similar shifts in FP mRNA log2 fold changes).</p><p>The significance of these differences was determined by comparing the ecdfs of the log2 fold changes for the genes belonging to a particular set (e.g. non-TOP mTOR-sensitive, p-eIF4E-sensitive) against all other expressed genes (background) using a Wilcoxan rank sum test. This allows identification of significant shifts in the distributions that have a clear directionality (if there is an overall increase, or decrease in fold changes of FPs or total mRNA compared to background). If log2 fold changes are different from background, but without a clear directionality (equally likely to be increased or decreased), the test will not yield a significant result. This approach allows assessment of the overall behavior of gene signatures within a given dataset in a manner that is completely threshold-independent, such that it does not rely on classification of genes into different regulatory categories (translation only, buffering, etc.) based on significance or fold-change cut-offs (as in S4H). Therefore, we believe that this unbiased approach is well-suited for identifying cases when there are many genes that follow similar patterns of regulation within a given dataset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Page 10-&quot;These results suggest that eIF3h depletion impacts the translatome differentially than depletion of eIF3e or eIF3d&quot; ...These results suggest that eIF3h has less impact on the translatome, not that it does so differently. If it were changing translation by a different mechanism, I would not expect it to cluster with control.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was rewritten as follows: “The PCA plot and hierarchical clustering (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 4A) showed clustering of the samples into two main groups: RiboSeq and RNA-seq, and also into two subgroups; NT and eIF3hKD samples clustered on one side and eIF3eKD and eIF3dKD samples on the other. These results suggest that the eIF3h depletion has a much milder impact on the translatome than depletion of eIF3e or eIF3d, which agrees with the growth phenotype and polysome profile analyses (Supplementary Figure 1A and 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor issues:</p><p>(1) There are some typos: Figure 2 leves, Figure 4 variou,</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 3, font for genes on volcano plot too small</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, maybe, however the resolution of this image is high enough to enlarge a certain part of it at will. In our opinion, a larger font would take up too much space, which would reduce the informativeness of this graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure S5, highlighting isn't defined.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure legend for S5A (now S6A) states: “Less significant terms ranking 11 and below are in grey. Terms specifically discussed in the main text are highlighted in green.” Perhaps it was overlooked by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) At several points the authors refer to &quot;the MAPK signaling pathway&quot;, suggesting there is a single MAPK that is affected, e.g in the title, page 3, and other places when it seems they mean &quot;MAPK signaling pathways&quot; since several MAPK pathways appear to be affected.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any terminological inaccuracies. There are indeed several MAPK pathways operating in cells. In our study, we focused mainly on the MAPK/ERK pathway. The confusion probably stems from the fact that the corresponding term in the KEGG pathway database is labeled &quot;MAPK signaling pathway&quot; and this term, although singular, includes all MAPK pathways. We have carefully reviewed the entire article and have corrected the term used accordingly to either: (1) MAPK pathways in general, (2) the MAPK/ERK pathway for this particular pathway, or (3) &quot;MAPK signaling pathway&quot;, where the KEGG term is meant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Some eIF3 subunit RNAs have TOP motifs. One might expect 3e and 3h levels to change as a function of 3d knockdown due to TOP motifs but this is not observed. Can the authors speculate why the eIF3 subunit levels don't change but other TOP RNAs show TE changes? Is this true for other translation factors, or just for eIF3, or just for these subunits? Could the Western blot be out of linear range for the antibody or is there feedback affecting eIF3 levels differently than the other TOP RNAs, or a protein turnover mechanism to maintain eIF3 levels?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a very interesting question. In addition to the mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins, we examined all TOP mRNAs and added an additional sheet to the S2 supplemental spreadsheet with all TOP RNAs listed in (Philippe et al., 2020, PMID: 32094190). According to our Ribo-Seq data, we could expect to see increased protein levels of eIF3a and eIF3f in eIF3dKD and eIF3eKD, but this is not the case, as judged from extensive western blot analysis performed in (Wagner et. al 2016, PMID: 27924037). Indeed, we cannot rule out the involvement of a compensatory mechanism monitoring and maintaining the levels of eIF3 subunits at steady-state – increasing or decreasing them if necessary, which could depend on the TOP motif-mediated regulation. However, we think that in our KDs, all non-targeted subunits that lose their direct binding partner in eIF3 due to siRNA treatment become rapidly degraded. For example, co-downregulation of subunits d, k and l in eIF3eKD is very likely caused by protein degradation as a result of a loss of their direct binding partner – eIF3e. Since we showed that the yeast eIF3 complex assembles co-translationally (Wagner et. al 2020, PMID: 32589964), and there is no reason to think that mammalian eIF3 differs in this regard, our working hypothesis is that free subunits that are not promptly incorporated into the eIF3 complex are rapidly degraded, and the presence or absence of the TOP motif in the 5’ UTR of their mRNAs has no effect. As for the other TOP mRNAs, translation factors eEF1B2, eEF1D, eEF1G, eEF2 have significantly increased FPs in both eIF3dKD and eIF3eKD, but we did not check their protein levels by western blotting to conclude anything specific.</p></body></sub-article></article>
