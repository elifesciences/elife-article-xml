germ cell proliferation, differentiation, and maturation, is the basis of male fertility. In the seminiferous tubules of the testes, spermatozoa are constantly generated from spermatogonial stem cells through a stereotyped sequence of mitotic and meiotic divisions. The basic physiological principles, however, that control both maturation and luminal transport of the still immotile spermatozoa within the seminiferous tubules remain poorly, if at all, defined. Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport toward the rete testis. Using a mouse model for in vivo imaging, we describe and quantify spontaneous tubular contractions and show a causal relationship between peritubular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and peristaltic transport. Moreover, we identify P2 receptor-dependent purinergic signaling pathways as physiological triggers of tubular contractions both in vitro and in vivo. When challenged with extracellular ATP, transport of luminal content inside the seminiferous tubules displays stage-dependent directionality. We thus suggest that paracrine purinergic signaling coordinates peristaltic recurrent contractions of the mouse seminiferous tubules to propel immotile spermatozoa to the rete testis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As sperm develop in the testis, the immature cells must make their way through a maze of small tubes known as seminiferous tubules. However, at this stage, the cells do not yet move the long tails that normally allow them to ‘swim’; it is therefore unclear how they are able to move through the tubules.</p><p>Now, Fleck, Kenzler et al. have showed that, in mice, muscle-like cells within the walls of seminiferous tubules can create waves of contractions that push sperm along. Further experiments were then conducted on cells grown in the laboratory. This revealed that a signaling molecule called ATP orchestrates the moving process by activating a cascade of molecular events that result in contractions. Fleck, Kenzler et al. then harnessed an advanced microscopy technique to demonstrate that this mechanism occurs in living mice. Together, these results provide a better understanding of how sperm mature, which could potentially be relevant for both male infertility and birth control.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermatogenesis</kwd><kwd>purinergic signaling</kwd><kwd>male reproduction</kwd><kwd>germ cell development</kwd><kwd>P2 receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>368482240/GRK2416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Mundt</surname><given-names>Nadine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>412888997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fleck</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>245169951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayerhofer</surname><given-names>Artur</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001663</institution-id><institution>Volkswagen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I/83533</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spehr</surname><given-names>Marc</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>233509121</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merhof</surname><given-names>Dorit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Purinergic signaling controls mammalian sperm transport.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spermatogenesis ranks among the most complex, yet least understood developmental processes in postnatal life. Inside the seminiferous tubules, which represent the functional units of the testis, this intricate course of mass cell proliferation and transformation events generates haploid spermatozoa from diploid spermatogonial stem cells. The seminiferous epithelium is composed of Sertoli cells, each intimately associated with ≥30 germ cells at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Mruk and Cheng, 2004</xref>). Sertoli cells provide the microenvironment critical for spermatogenesis by establishing the blood-testis barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng and Mruk, 2010</xref>), forming the spermatogonial stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>), and controlling epithelial cyclicity via auto-, para-, and endocrine feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Heindel and Treinen, 1989</xref>). Different types of spermatogonia (type A, intermediate, type B) are localized along the seminiferous tubule basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chiarini-Garcia and Russell, 2001</xref>). Upon detachment, type B spermatogonia enter meiosis as preleptotene spermatocytes. During meiotic divisions and subsequent maturation steps, germ cells progress from primary to secondary spermatocytes and round to elongated spermatids.</p><p>Accumulating evidence implicates purinergic signaling in testicular paracrine communication. While the general picture is still incomplete, cell- and stage-specific testicular expression of different purinoceptor isoforms has been reported in Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Foresta et al., 1996</xref>), Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Veitinger et al., 2011</xref>), both pre- and postmeiotic germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fleck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Glass et al., 2001</xref>), testicular peritubular cells (TPCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Walenta et al., 2018</xref>), as well as mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Navarro et al., 2011</xref>), albeit with contradictory results. Functionally, several studies have suggested purinergic paracrine control of gonadotropin effects on Leydig and Sertoli cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Filippini et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gelain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gelain et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lalevée et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Meroni et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Poletto Chaves et al., 2006</xref>), including steroidogenesis and testosterone/17β-estradiol secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Foresta et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rossato et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Members of the P2 purinoceptor family are activated by extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burnstock, 1990</xref>). P2 receptors subdivide into ionotropic P2X (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bean, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bean and Friel, 1990</xref>) and metabotropic P2Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnard et al., 1994</xref>) receptors, comprising seven (P2X) and eight (P2Y) isoforms, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller et al., 2020</xref>). All P2X channels display substantial Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and show distinct pharmacological profiles, ligand affinities, and desensitization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Khakh and North, 2012</xref>). G-protein-coupled P2Y receptors are sensitive to both ATP and UTP and they form two subgroups that either activate phospholipase C via G<sub>αq</sub>/G<sub>α11</sub> (P2Y1, 2, 4, 6, and 11) or couple to G<sub>αi/o</sub> (P2Y12, 13, and 14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, several P2 receptor isoforms affect smooth muscle cell physiology, with P2X1, P2X2, P2X4, P2X7, P2Y1, and P2Y2 acting as the principle subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Burnstock, 2014</xref>). So far, the most prominent role for a specific subunit in reproductive physiology has been attributed to P2X1, which is critical for vas deferens smooth muscle contraction and male fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mulryan et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In mice, stimulation-dependent ATP secretion from both Sertoli and germ cells was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gelain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gelain et al., 2003</xref>) and may itself be under endocrine control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gelain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lalevée et al., 1999</xref>). The mechanism(s) of cellular ATP release, however, remain subject to debate. ATP secretion via exocytotic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bodin and Burnstock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>) has been proposed. Alternative ATP release pathways include connexin/pannexin hemichannels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cotrina et al., 1998</xref>), transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lohman et al., 2012</xref>), voltage-gated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Taruno et al., 2013</xref>) or large-conductance anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bell et al., 2003</xref>) channels, or even P2X7 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pellegatti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Suadicani et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Along the seminiferous epithelium, spermatogenesis has been conceptualized by attribution of sequential cellular ‘stages’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which progress through coordinated cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hess and De Franca, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Russell, 1990</xref>). First initiated in mice about 7 days postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kolasa et al., 2012</xref>), each spermatogenic cycle comprises 12 stages and lasts 8.7 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Hermo et al., 2010</xref>). After approximately 39 days (4.5 cycle repetitions), spermatogenesis completes with the release of immotile spermatozoa from the seminiferous epithelium into the lumen of the tubule (spermiation). Once detached from the Sertoli cells, sperm must be transported to the <italic>rete testis</italic> and epididymis for final maturation. Precisely regulated tubular transport mechanisms are, thus, imperative for reproduction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ATP is a potent TPC stimulus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic sketch of the mouse seminiferous tubule (ST) highlighting 12 stages (I – XII) of the spermatogenic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hess and De Franca, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Russell, 1990</xref>), which are arranged in consecutive order along the length of the tubule. A single layer of flat testicular peritubular cells (TPC; green) lines the tubular wall. Sertoli cells (SC) span the tubule from the basal lamina to the lumen. Developing germ cells (GC) are distributed between Sertoli cells. Spermatogonia are located near the basal membrane. Prophase spermatocytes move across the blood-testis barrier (BTB) to the adluminal compartment where they complete meiosis. The resulting haploid spherical cells (round spermatids) differentiate into elongated spermatids and, eventually, into highly condensed and compartmentalized spermatozoa (spermiogenesis). These mature, yet still immotile germ cells are then released into the lumen (spermiation).

Therefore, we asked if mouse TPCs are sensitive to extracellular ATP. Primary TPC cultures retain high purity for ≥14 days in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A&amp;B</xref>) and cells express transcripts for several ionotropic (P2X2, P2X4, P2X7) and metabotropic (P2Y2, P2Y6) purinoceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The specific biophysical and pharmacological profile of ATP-dependent transmembrane currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–H</xref>) strongly suggests functional expression of P2X2 and/or P2X4, but not P2X7 receptors. As reported for both P2X2 and P2X4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">North, 2002</xref>), TPC currents are saturated at ≤100 µM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D&amp;E</xref>), whereas P2X7 receptors display strongly reduced ATP sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donnelly-Roberts et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, currents recorded from TPCs showed modest but persistent desensitization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D&amp;F</xref>), which is similarly observed for recombinant P2X2 and P2X4, but not P2X7 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coddou et al., 2011</xref>). TPCs also displayed reduced BzATP sensitivity (data not shown), which is a potent activator of P2X7 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Donnelly-Roberts et al., 2009</xref>).

We next reduced the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>) to 100 nM, a concentration approximately equimolar to cytosolic levels, by adding an appropriate chelator/ion concentration ratio (1 mM EGTA/0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). This treatment, which drastically diminishes the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, did substantially reduce, but not abolish ATP response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K&amp;L</xref>). The selective P2Y receptor agonist UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2019b</xref>) also triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (data not shown), indicating a role for G protein-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal storage organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Müller et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, ~46% of all ATP-sensitive TPCs additionally displayed a delayed, but long-lasting inward current that gradually developed over tens of seconds after ATP stimulation ended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M&amp;N</xref>). We hypothesized that this slower current could result from P2Y receptor-/G protein-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, likely mediated by the P2Y2 isoform since P2Y6 receptors lack substantial ATP sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Jacobson et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, occurrence of the delayed current depends on presence of intracellular GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O</xref>). Moreover, selective recruitment of G protein-coupled P2Y receptors with UTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>) exclusively triggered such slowly developing currents. Largely carried by Cl<sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), this current likely results from P2Y receptor-mediated phosphoinositide turnover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, and activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated Cl<sup>–</sup> channels. Together, these data suggest that mouse TPCs functionally express both ionotropic and metabotropic purinoceptors.</p><p>Next, we asked if TPCs also exhibit ATP sensitivity in their physiological setting. Therefore, we examined purinergic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals from mouse TPCs in acute seminiferous tubule sections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fleck et al., 2016</xref>). In parallel approaches, we employed two different fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporters, a synthetic ratiometric Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (fura-2) as well as a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator (GCaMP6f). The dual excitation ratiometric indicator fura-2 allows semi-quantitative Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bootman et al., 2013</xref>), but lacks cell type specificity as tubules are bulk-loaded with a membrane-permeable acetoxymethyl ester conjugate. By contrast, conditional gene targeting via the Cre/Lox system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Smith, 2011</xref>) allows TPC-specific expression of the single-wavelength indicator GCaMP6f. First, we confirmed inducible TPC-targeted testicular expression of fluorescent reporter proteins in SMMHC-CreER<sup>T2</sup> x Ai14D mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

Second, TPC-specific GCaMP6f expression in SMMHC-CreER<sup>T2</sup> x Ai95D mice revealed robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in cells of the tubular wall upon ATP exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D&amp;E</xref>). Third, fura-2/AM loading of acute seminiferous tubule sections preferentially labeled the outermost cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), allowing semi-quantitative in situ imaging of ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in mouse TPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G&amp;H</xref>).

Brief ATP exposure resulted in a peripheral band of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity at the edge of the tubule. Such signals usually coincided with a pronounced contractile motion of the seminiferous tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

First, we asked whether influx of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in TPC force generation. Similar to in vitro observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K&amp;L</xref>), diminishing or even reversing the driving force for transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux by reducing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> to 100 nM or 12 nM, respectively, for variable durations, significantly decreased both TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and tubular contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–H</xref>). While, upon [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> reduction, ATP-dependent responses (both Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and contractions) were still detected in the vast majority of cells/experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), response strength was strongly diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These effects were independent of both the extent (12 nM or 100 nM) and the duration (1–10 min) of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> reduction and were fully reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Second, we examined a potential role of ATP-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal storage organelles. Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum via pharmacological inhibition of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase by cyclopiazonic-acid (CPA) essentially abolished both ATP-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), with very few cells/tubules retaining some residual ATP sensitivity during CPA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Importantly, all results from ratiometric fura-2 imaging were qualitatively indistinguishable from those obtained with genetically targeted GCaMP6f (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–G</xref>), showing that both approaches to TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurement provide comparable results. Third, given the pronounced effect of pharmacological store depletion, we aimed to quantify the specific contribution of metabotropic purinoceptors to the overall ATP-mediated effect. The P2Y receptor-selective agonist UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coddou et al., 2011</xref>) evoked both TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and tubular contractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E&amp;F</xref>). However, under control [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> conditions, UTP-evoked responses were substantially reduced compared to control ATP stimulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Notably, these UTP responses were statistically indistinguishable from the diminished ATP-dependent signals we observed under low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>Together, these data strongly suggest that (i) extracellular ATP acts as a potent TPC stimulus that triggers seminiferous tubule contractions in situ, that (ii) P2X and P2Y receptors act in concert to mediate TPC responses to ATP exposure, that (iii), while P2X receptor-dependent external Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx apparently boosts responses to ATP, P2Y receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is necessary to evoke TPC responses, and consequently – since store depletion essentially abolishes ATP-dependent signals – that (iv) influx of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> via ionotropic P2X receptors is not sufficient to drive TPC signals and evoke contractions. Notably, our general finding of ATP-induced mouse TPC contractions is likely transferable to human peritubular cells. When primary human TPC cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Walenta et al., 2018</xref>) were exposed to extracellular ATP, morphological changes were observed within seconds-to-minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A&amp;B</xref>). Moreover, embedding cells in collagen gel lattices revealed considerable contractile force in response to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C&amp;D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ATP drives directional luminal transport</title><p>We hypothesized that ATP-induced tubular contractions could impact the transport of luminal fluid and spermatozoa. To test this, we custom-built a whole-mount macroscopic imaging platform, designed to allow both widefield and fluorescence time-lapse imaging of intact seminiferous tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, this setup enables visual categorization of the spermatogenic cycle into three distinct stage groups following published protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hess and De Franca, 2008</xref>) and allows precisely timed focal perfusion (methods). First, we asked if brief focal purinergic stimulation triggers seminiferous tubule contractions and, consequently, luminal content movement. Flow field change analysis reveals some basal luminal motion independent of mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, ATP exposure triggered a strong increase in luminal flow that outlasted the presence of ATP for several tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Second, we analyzed if luminal movement depends on the tubule’s cycle stage and, consequently, luminal sperm count. When we analyzed ATP-induced movement in directly stimulated luminal regions (each designated as region-of-interest (ROI) 0) and compared stage groups with a high (group II) vs. a relatively low (groups I and III) amount of luminal sperm, we observed no difference in stimulation-dependent motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>I</sub></xref>). Thus, direct ATP exposure triggers tubular contractions independent of cycle stage and luminal sperm count. Third, we investigated if luminal movement is restricted to the area of stimulation or, by contrast, if fluid flow propagates beyond the directly stimulated tubule section. When we analyzed luminal motion in equidistant tubule sections adjacent to the directly stimulated area ROI 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we found a significant, though relatively small bidirectional wave of propagating movement in stage groups I and III, which exhibit a low luminal sperm count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>II</sub></xref>). Strikingly, we observed strong unidirectional luminal movement upon ATP stimulation of stage group II tubule sections which show high luminal sperm density associated with spermiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C<sub>II</sub></xref>). In this stage group, luminal content is predominantly propelled toward areas of ascending spermatogenic cycle stages.

Both spontaneous and ATP-dependent contractions trigger fast, stage-dependent, and directional transport of luminal content. It is thus tempting to speculate that seminiferous tubule contractility in general, and purinergic TPC signaling in particular, are promising targets for male infertility treatment and/or contraceptive development.</p><p>The site(s)/cellular origin of testicular ATP release as well as the mechanism(s) that trigger ATP secretion in vivo currently remain elusive. The apparent absence of efferent nerve endings in the seminiferous tubules and interstitial tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tripiciano et al., 1996</xref>) suggests that tubule contractility is under endo-/paracrine control. By contrast, autonomic innervation of the testicular capsule mediates smooth muscle cell contraction of the <italic>tunica albuginea</italic>, using ATP as a (co)transmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banks et al., 2006</xref>). Regulated ATP release has been reported for both Sertoli and germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gelain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gelain et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, TPCs express P2Y6 receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), which were reported to mediate ATP release upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carneiro et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, TPCs could themselves participate in regenerative nucleotide release.</p><p>During spermatogenesis, apoptosis is a vital process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Print and Loveland, 2000</xref>). In fact, up to 75% of germ cells undergo apoptosis under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Huckins, 1978</xref>). This substantial germ cell loss is called ‘density-dependent regulation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Hess and De Franca, 2008</xref>). Since ATP release from apoptotic cells is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Elliott et al., 2009</xref>) it is likely that cell density-dependent waves of apoptosis could regularly generate local ATP surges. We have previously shown that one result of seminiferous extracellular ATP elevation is signal amplification by increased ATP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fleck et al., 2016</xref>), although the mechanistic basis of this positive feedback pathway is yet unknown. Given (i) the robust cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients observed in response to ATP exposure in various testicular cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fleck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gelain et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Liévano et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Veitinger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Walenta et al., 2018</xref>) and (ii) the usually millimolar ATP content in secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bodin and Burnstock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), the most parsimonious explanation for ATP-induced ATP release would be an inevitable ATP ‘co-secretion’ upon any Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis event. In addition, ATP release has been observed in several cell types as a result of mechanical deformation, shear stress, stretch, or osmotic swelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Button et al., 2013</xref>) adding another putative mechanism of regenerative signaling in purinergic contraction control.</p><p>Notably, extracellular ATP is rapidly degraded by ecto-nucleotidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Zimmermann et al., 2012</xref>), rendering its interstitial half-life relatively short and, thus, narrowing its paracrine radius to a few hundred micrometers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Fitz, 2007</xref>). Combined with its fast diffusion – approximately 1 μm in less than 10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Khakh, 2001</xref>) – extracellular ATP bears all characteristics of a fast paracrine agent in testicular communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Praetorius and Leipziger, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Excitation–contraction coupling in TPCs is poorly described. Our results strongly suggest that a combination of P2X (isoforms 2 and/or 4) receptor-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and P2Y (likely isoform 2) receptor-activated phospholipase C<italic>β</italic>-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum – the latter being critical and resembling the recently reported mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cell contraction in small pulmonary veins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Henriquez et al., 2018</xref>) – provides the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> elevation required for force generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berridge, 2008</xref>). P2X and P2Y receptors act on different time scales and display different ligand sensitivity, with EC<sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar (P2Y) vs. micromolar (P2X) range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">North, 2002</xref>). It is possible that the co-activation of an ionotropic (P2X) and a metabotropic (P2Y) signaling pathway serves functions analogous to the concomitant exposure to both ATP and noradrenaline in mesenteric artery smooth muscle. Here, activation of P2X1 receptors generates a small initial contraction that is followed by larger noradrenaline-induced contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lamont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lamont et al., 2003</xref>). Regarding TPC [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> elevation, our data suggest that P2X receptor activation also targets Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores, as their depletion inhibits excitation–contraction coupling entirely. Therefore, it is likely that P2X receptors act as signal boosters that mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, possibly via activation of ryanodine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berridge, 2008</xref>). This way, the combined action of P2X and P2Y receptors might equip TPCs with a broader ‘two-step’ stimulus integration range.</p><p>Whole-mount imaging of isolated seminiferous tubules reveals propagation of luminal content that extends beyond the confines of the stimulated/contracted area and displays stage-dependent directionality. While peristaltic contractions are driven by propagating wave-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in vivo, focal ATP stimulation appears insufficient to trigger a regenerative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave in isolated tubules. We, thus, conclude that the observed directionality results from other, likely structural characteristics, for example anatomical features of stage group II and III tubules that favor a specific flow direction (increased tubule diameter and reduced luminal resistance along the stage II-to-III transition zone). We cannot, however, rule out that the use of large field-of-view/low numerical aperture objectives for ‘macroscopic’ imaging simply prevents the detection of low-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal spread.</p><p>Translation of our findings from the mouse model to humans awaits further in-depth investigation. We have recently reported that ATP activates Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in human TPCs in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Walenta et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, our present findings reveal ATP-induced contractions in cultured human TPCs. There are, however, notable differences between the human and the mouse tubular walls. While a single layer of TPCs surrounds the mouse seminiferous tubules, the human tubular wall architecture is more complex, containing several TPC layers, substantial amounts of extracellular matrix proteins, and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mayerhofer, 2013</xref>). Impaired spermatogenesis in sub-/infertile men typically coincides with tubular wall remodeling and a partial loss of TPC contractility proteins has been reported in infertile men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Welter et al., 2013</xref>). Accordingly, interference with TPC contractility had been proposed as a promising strategy for human male contraception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Romano et al., 2005</xref>). However, a causal relationship between contractility (or the lack thereof) and male (in)fertility has never been established. In fact, seminiferous tubule contractions had, so far, never been observed in vivo and most in vitro reports were based on indirect and non-quantitative evidence, for example from <italic>post-hoc</italic> fluorescence or scanning electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fernández et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Losinno et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Losinno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tripiciano et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tripiciano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tripiciano et al., 1996</xref>), morphometry of single cells in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rossi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Santiemma et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Santiemma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tripiciano et al., 1996</xref>), or intraluminal pressure analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Miyake et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yamamoto et al., 1989</xref>). The fact that expression of TPC contractility proteins initiates with puberty under androgen control and that selective androgen receptor knock-out in TPCs renders mice infertile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Welsh et al., 2009</xref>) underscores a potential role of TPC contractions in male fertility. Accordingly, pharmacological targeting of purinergic signaling pathways to (re)gain control of TPC contractility represents an attractive approach for male infertility treatment or contraceptive development.</p><p>Among several remaining questions, future experimental efforts will have to address (i) whether TPCs are coupled by gap junctions to display coordinated activity; (ii) whether and, if so, how the final ATP metabolite adenosine affects seminiferous tubule physiology; (iii) whether Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathways modulate TPC contractility as frequently observed in other smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Somlyo and Somlyo, 2003</xref>); (iv) what, if any, role is played by P2X receptor-dependent changes in membrane potential; (v) which function is served by the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated Cl<sup>–</sup> current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>); (vi) why periods of enhanced contractile activity are interrupted by longer quiescent episodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>); (vii) which additional or complementary roles in TPC physiology are played by previously proposed activators, including vasopressin, oxytocin, prostaglandins, and endothelin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albrecht et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mayerhofer, 2013</xref>); (viii) whether an additional cytosolic and/or membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berridge, 2008</xref>) provides an endogenous pacemaker mechanism that acts independent of purinergic stimulation; and (ix) whether, similar to vascular smooth muscle cells, some specific tone is maintained between contractions by spatial averaging of asynchronous oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Berridge, 2008</xref>), a mechanism that could explain the occurrence of spontaneous low-amplitude ‘vibratory’ movements and local indentations that we (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ellis et al., 1981</xref>;

Next, we applied Gaussian filter functions (<italic>GausBlur</italic> (five px radius) and <italic>Gaussian Blur3D</italic> (x = 0, y = 0, z = 5)). We calculated flow change via the <italic>Gaussian Window MSE</italic> function (sigma = 1; max distance = 3). Tubule selection used the polyline tool (line width adjusted to tubule diameter). Selected tubules ranged from 200 µm to 3.4 mm length. Next, flow fields of individual tubules were straightened. Average movement intensity was calculated from transversal line profiles (perpendicular to the straightened longitudinal axis of each tubule) and plotted as kymographs (space-time plots) to measure movement progression speed from linear regressions.</p><p>Multiphoton time-lapse imaging data was recorded in dual-channel mode, with (i) a target channel recording GCaMP6f fluorescence and some background signal (525\50 nm), and (ii) a background channel mainly recording autofluorescence (585\40 nm), allowing for background correction of the GCaMP6f signal using a dye separation routine. Slow constant movement in both channels was registered and removed to correct for steady drift. After Gaussian filtering (<italic>GausBlur</italic> (five px radius); <italic>Gaussian Blur3D</italic> (x = 0, y = 0, z = 5)), flow fields were calculated from the background signal. Again, flow change was calculated via the <italic>Gaussian Window MSE</italic> function (sigma = 1; max distance = 3). Time-lapse epifluorescence in vivo recordings were processed to isolate transient fluorescence signals from static background noise using custom ImageJ code with Fiji’s build-in functions (see <bold>Data and materials availability</bold>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Corinna Engelhardt, Jessica von Bongartz, and Stefanie Kurth (RWTH Aachen University) for assistance, Andreas Meinhardt and Jörg Klug (Justus-Liebig-University Giessen) for kindly providing detailed information about the mouse TPC cell culture protocol, Andrea Mietens and Ralf Middendorff (Justus-Liebig-University Giessen) for comments and suggestions, J Ullrich Schwarzer (Andrology-Center, Munich) and Frank-Michael Köhn (Andrologicum, Munich) for providing human samples, and all members of the Spehr laboratory for discussions.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Validation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: Mice were maintained and sacrificed according to European Union legislation (Directive 2010/63/EU) and recommendations by the Federation of European Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen Anna Akhmanova as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Ivan Manzini (Reviewer #1); Johannes Reisert (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this is an excellent paper that adds a lot of new information to the field. However, the reviewers also agreed that to make this paper suitable for the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, it is essential to revise and extend both the Introduction and the Discussion and to improve data presentation according to the specific comments listed below. Furthermore, reviewer 3 would particularly like to see clarification of the roles of P2X vs. P2Y receptors and also the potential dichotomy of the spread of contraction vs. the spread of Ca signaling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;ATP activation of peritubular cells drives testicular sperm transport&quot; by Davis Fleck and co-workers deals with the involvement of purinergic signaling in testicular sperm transport.</p><p>To obtain their results the authors used several state-of-the-art methods. In many of the conducted experiments they skilfully combined some of these methods to obtain unprecedented results. The authors verified their results employing different testis preparations (from cultured cells to in vivo recordings) and using different calcium sensors. They developed a very elegant custom-built 3D printed imaging stage that allowed experiments in the testis of living mice.</p><p>The whole study is very well conducted, the methodology is sound, the statistical analysis is well done, and the authors provide convincing evidence for all their claims. They unambiguously show that nucleotide-triggered coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm cell transport along seminiferous tubules.</p><p>The results are extremely interesting for the fields of reproductive biology and reproductive medicine, but also for the whole field of physiology. The obtained results will with no doubt significantly influence the future research in the relevant fields.</p><p>I do feel, however, that prior to publication a few points (see below) need to be clarified. Clarifying this points will improve the comprehensibility and readability of the manuscript.</p><p>1) Abstract: The authors mention peritubular Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in the Abstract, but do not mention them again in the whole manuscript. This is a little disturbing. I expected to find more information about these waves throughout the manuscript. How do the authors define these waves? Please clarify.</p><p>2) Although I generally like concise introductions, I feel that in the present manuscript the Introduction is too short. The authors should give more information about the cellular composition of the seminiferous tubules, the stages of sperm cell maturation, and the current knowledge of sperm cell transport in the tubules. The authors should consider including a schematic figure that gives an easy to understand overview of the above points. This will make all the performed experiments and the whole story easier to understand, especially for readers that are not experts in the field of reproductive biology and medicine.</p><p>3) Subsection “ATP triggers seminiferous tubule contractions” and corresponding Figure 4E-G: I have difficulties to understand what is shown here. It might be only me, but the authors should consider trying to explain this part of their results better.</p><p>4) Subsection “ATP drives directional luminal transport”: The authors state that in their preparation it is possible to visually categorize the twelve seminiferous epithelium cycle stages. I have difficulties to identify them. The authors should consider giving more information what exactly this twelve cycle stages are and how they can be distinguished in the picture (corresponding Figure 5). Part of this information could be included in an overview figure (see my first point above).</p><p>5) Subsection “ATP drives directional luminal transport”: In this subsection the authors state that their finding indicates that ATP acts as a local paracrine messenger that, by itself, is not sufficient to trigger a signal that propagates in a wave-like fashion along the tubules. They speculate that transport directionality in the tubules likely results from morphological characteristics rather than peristaltic contractility.</p><p>What do the authors mean with &quot;morphological characteristics&quot; and how can these characteristics explain the transport directionality? Also, why is the transport directionality probably not connected to peristaltic contractility?</p><p>6) Subsection “ATP induces tubular contractions in vivo”: In this subsection the authors state that the movement analysis along the length of digitally straightened tubules demonstrates wave-like unidirectional motions that propagate with high velocities. What factors do drive this propagation? The authors should consider adding some information.</p><p>7) Discussion: I generally like concise discussions, but in my opinion in this manuscript also the Discussion, like the Introduction, is way too short. It is more like a short conclusion. Here a few points that could/ should be speculated about:</p><p>– What could be the in vivo origin of ATP (cell type, production site)?</p><p>– What could be the trigger for the physiological ATP release?</p><p>– Why do nucleotides act &quot;only&quot; as paracrine mediators and do not induce calcium waves like in other tissues?</p><p>– The authors could speculate about how likely it is that the same mechanisms are present also in human testis.</p><p>– The authors could speculate about how their results could help finding treatments for infertility and / or be useful for the development of male contraception.</p><p>– etc.</p><p>8) I had problems with Videos 5 and 8. Somehow they did not run on my computers. I know that.mov-files are often requested, but there are certainly better formats for online videos. It could be a problem that my computers have, but I recommend checking these videos. Videos in an MP4 format would probably be better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Fleck et al. investigates the molecular mechanism regulating smooth muscle contractions in the testis. Overall, this is an excellent manuscript using innovative imaging techniques to visualize almost simultaneously intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and peritubular cells movement. In addition, conclusions throughout the manuscript are sound and figure legends are clear. Because this manuscript is relevant for different fields, the authors should improve the writing significantly. First, the Introduction is very superficial and does not elaborate on the rationale behind this manuscript. Moreover, the authors assume that reproductive biologists are familiar with purinergic signaling and avoid any explanation on the pathways. Although short introductions are usually welcome, this one in particular has only two lines more than the Abstract (21 vs. 19 lines). The Results section is better; however, there are many sections in which the authors give for granted knowledge on the system (e.g. the use of specific agonists and antagonists for purinergic receptors; depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; and others). Finally, if the Introduction was short, the Discussion is almost absent (only 15 lines). The Discussion is also superficial, repeating some sections from the Abstract and Introduction. As the authors said, the topic of smooth muscle regulation in the testis has been underexplored for many years, there is much to say on the relevance of their findings that cannot be written in such a short Discussion.</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport toward the rete testis and epididymis.&quot; This sentence should be toned down; I agree that this manuscript shows coordinated contractions of smooth muscle. This finding suggests a possible mechanism for the propulsive force required for sperm transport; however, the manuscript does not make a direct observation of the sperm movement through the rete testis and epididymis.</p><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors claim &quot;Consequently, our findings could have substantial pharmaceutical implications for both infertility treatment and / or male contraception.&quot; As the authors recognized at the end of the manuscript, this sentence is speculative and does not belong to the Abstract.</p><p>3) Introduction: The Introduction is not informative. The authors should give information on the purinergic system and its role in regulating smooth muscle. They should also incorporate to the Introduction text that let the reader knows on the main signaling pathways involved in purinergic signaling as well as on the type of purinergic receptors, agonists and antagonists.</p><p>4) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”, explain briefly the conclusion that P2X2 or P2X4 but not P2X7 are responsible for the currents observed.</p><p>5) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”: Explain the rationale of the conclusion &quot;this current likely results from P2Y receptor-mediated phosphoinositide turnover&quot; Why? Also, the authors state that these cells are sensitive to UTP and dependent on the presence of intracellular GTP. How were these experiments designed? Which is the conclusion of these findings? In general, more rationale is needed to explain why the experiments were conducted. For example, in Figure 1, ivermectin and suramin are used without introducing the mode of action of these compounds.</p><p>6) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”: Explain briefly how the Ca<sup>2+</sup> was reduced to 100 nM to avoid the reader to go to Materials and methods while reading the Results.</p><p>7) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”: The UTP action is mentioned; however, only later in the same paragraph, the authors state that UTP is a selective P2Y agonist.</p><p>Overall, the results are clear; however, it is very difficult to follow the rationale from the Results section text. As written this section is not more helpful than the figure legend.</p><p>8) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”. Give a rationale for the use of GCaMP6f, explain briefly the strategy.</p><p>9) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”: Define Ai14D mice, define SMMHC.</p><p>Subsection “ATP triggers seminiferous tubule contractions”: Briefly explain the high frequency rippling observed.</p><p>10) Subsection “ATP triggers seminiferous tubule contractions”: Mention the pharmacological inhibitor used and the time used for the treatment to avoid the reader to go to the Materials and methods section. In Figure 4 legend, the authors mentioned that they use CPA (please define) and they state that they pre-incubate for &gt;= 15 min., could the time frame be more precise?</p><p>11) Subsection “ATP triggers seminiferous tubule contractions”: Conclusions 'a' to 'c' are clear. Regarding the last conclusion 'd', briefly re-state the evidence supporting it; without stating the evidence, this conclusion is not sound.</p><p>12) Figure 4. This figure lacks explanation in the main text. The reader needs to carefully analyze Figure 4 legend to understand the logic of the experiments performed. A summary of each panel in the main text will be helpful and should be added. In particular, there is no explanation of panel H in the main text. This panel is difficult to follow even after careful reading of the figure legend. The authors should make a significant effort to explain their thought process to scientists that are not necessarily experts in the field of purinergic signaling.</p><p>13) Discussion:</p><p>The authors speculate that their findings on purinergic signaling in the testis can have implications for male infertility and/or contraception. This sentence is repeated from the Abstract. Although there is nothing wrong to mention some putative translational implication, as written this sentence is not connected with the rest of the manuscript. To leave this sentence in a final manuscript, the authors should elaborate a rationale on how these findings can be used for either improving male fertility or for contraception. On the other hand, this speculation is not an important part of the manuscript and does not belong to the Abstract.</p><p>14) Overall, the Discussion section is short and superficial. There is almost no analyses of the findings; some of the questions that should be addressed are: How results in this manuscript relates to other works in the area? Which are the unknowns that will need further investigation (gap in the knowledge)? How the purinergic system in the testis can be related to clinical applications (male fertility and/or contraception)? Which are the advances obtained in terms of imaging methodologies? How the authors think that the system is regulated: is it paracrine as they propose? If this is the case, what would be the signaling for the release of ATP? It is ok not to know the answer, it is not ok to avoid discussing these topics.</p><p>15) In summary, this is an excellent manuscript; however, it is written as a lab report for internal consumption. In general, the Results section needs a little more explanation on the rationale behind the experimental strategy and some clarification on the results. On the other hand, the authors should make a significant effort to improve the Introduction and Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Fleck and colleagues addresses the role of ATP and its receptors in sperm transport in the seminiferous tubules in the testis. They conclude that ATP, in a paracrine manner, drives intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in testicular peritubular cells (TPCs) and hence their contractions in a directional manner. The manuscript is mostly very clearly laid out, experiments are well designed using broad and also entirely novel and quite impressive methodologies for in vivo recordings. Their results are an exciting and important contribution to a field fraught with confusion and they will lead to a deeper and further understanding of transport in seminiferous tubules.</p><p>1) The roles of P2X and P2Y receptors and their contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in TPCs is somewhat confusing. In Figure 1J, the authors demonstrate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in TPCs originates both from extracellular sources (P2X mediated) as well as intracellular sources (P2Y mediated). But depletion of intracellular stores (Figure 4D) seems to entirely eliminate the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, suggesting P2Y mediated signaling only? Also, given that P2Y-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do play a role, it might be worth considering moving data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into Figure 1 of the main paper to give them more prominence.</p><p>2) Figures 5 and 6 describe directional luminal transport and TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals respectively following focal application of ATP, with contraction occurring in a stage-dependent directional manner, while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is confined locally to where ATP was applied with no spread. This seems puzzling as it raises the question of what signal drives the contractions (and their directionality) in the TPCs that contract (one assumes) without an apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal?</p><p>3) Along similar lines, what signal drives the directionality of the contractions? ATP diffusing along the tubules? Or Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves spreading from cell to cell (although that should become evident in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging)? While this might be outside the scope of the manuscript, it might be worth addressing this issue in the currently quite focused Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62885.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] The results are extremely interesting for the fields of reproductive biology and reproductive medicine, but also for the whole field of physiology.

We now show a representative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave that travels in a unidirectional manner along a tubule’s longitudinal axis (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2D). We use a sequence of successive single frames from time-lapse in vivo recordings (5 Hz image acquisition rate), in which we overlay a brightfield image with a pseudocolor fluorescence intensity image that indicates elevations in TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.

We acknowledge his argument and, accordingly, we have now added “a schematic figure that gives an easy to understand overview of the above points”. This new schematic diagram is now introduced as Figure 1A and it illustrates both “cellular composition of the seminiferous tubules” and “the stages of sperm cell maturation.” The legend of Figure 1 has been revised accordingly.</p><p>We have also added new text to the Introduction, which now reads: “The seminiferous epithelium is composed of Sertoli cells, each intimately associated with ≥30 germ cells at different developmental stages (Mruk and Cheng, 2004).

We apologize for the somewhat vague description of our approach and, accordingly, we have extensively revised the corresponding Results section.</p><p>We added several explanatory remarks to the relevant paragraphs, which now read: “First, we asked whether influx of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> is involved in TPC force generation. […] Together, these data strongly suggest that (i) extracellular ATP acts as a potent TPC stimulus that triggers seminiferous tubule contractions in situ, that (ii) P2X and P2Y receptors act in concert to mediate TPC responses to ATP exposure, that (iii), while P2X receptor-dependent external Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx apparently boosts responses to ATP, P2Y receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization from the sarcoplasmic reticulum is necessary to evoke TPC responses, and consequently that (iv) influx of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> via ionotropic P2X receptors is not sufficient to drive TPC signals and evoke contractions. Notably, our general finding…”</p><p>In addition, we added explanatory notes to the legend of Figure 4, which now reads: “(F) Signal amplitudes (Ca<sup>2+</sup>, black; contractions, red) of responding TPCs / tubules, quantified as a function of stimulus, treatment, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor. Data (mean ± SEM) are normalized to the respective initial responses to ATP (10 µM) under control conditions (dotted horizontal line; see first stimulations in (B and C)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “ATP drives directional luminal transport”: The authors state that in their preparation it is possible to visually categorize the twelve seminiferous epithelium cycle stages. I have difficulties to identify them. The authors should consider giving more information what exactly this twelve cycle stages are and how they can be distinguished in the picture (corresponding Figure 5). Part of this information could be included in an overview figure (see my first point above).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for pointing this out. Our wording has obviously been misleading. In fact, we cannot identify each of the twelve seminiferous epithelium cycle stages in the whole-mount preparation that we established. What we can do, however, is following the approach first proposed by Hess and De Franca, 2008, and categorize stages I-V as ‘early’, stages VI-VIII as ‘middle’, and stages IX-XII as ‘late’. The corresponding ‘stage groups I, II and III’ are characterized by different densities of luminal sperm that can be distinguished clearly by standard widefield microscopy.</p><p>To clarify, we followed the expert’s advice and have now added this information to “an overview figure” (Figure 1A; also see response to (2) above). We now also refer to the three groups again in Figure 5A, using the same color code. Moreover, we have revised the Results that now reads:</p><p>“In addition, this setup enables visual categorization of the spermatogenic cycle into three distinct stage groups following published protocols (Hess and De Franca, 2008) and allows precisely timed focal perfusion (Materials and methods). […] When we analyzed ATP-induced movement in directly stimulated regions (each designated as region-of-interest (ROI) 0), comparing stage groups with a high (group II) versus a relatively low (groups I and III) amount of luminal sperm, we observed no difference in stimulation-dependent motion (Figure 5C<sub>I</sub>).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “ATP drives directional luminal transport”: In this subsection the authors state that their finding indicates that ATP acts as a local paracrine messenger that, by itself, is not sufficient to trigger a signal that propagates in a wave-like fashion along the tubules. They speculate that transport directionality in the tubules likely results from morphological characteristics rather than peristaltic contractility.</p><p>What do the authors mean with &quot;morphological characteristics&quot; and how can these characteristics explain the transport directionality? Also, why is the transport directionality probably not connected to peristaltic contractility?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 1 raises another important point that is also brought up by reviewer 3 (main points 2 and 3). It is thus becoming clear that we did not manage to communicate these results and, specifically, our interpretation in a clear and compelling way. We apologize and, accordingly, we have extensively revised both the corresponding Results text and the Discussion.</p><p>In Figure 5, we show that focal application of ATP triggers contractions that translate into movement of luminal content. This read-out (luminal flow change 𝑐𝑐<sub>𝑖𝑖</sub>) is different from the contraction measurements (flow strength 𝑠𝑠<sub>𝑖𝑖</sub>) conducted in Figures 3, 4 and 7. We describe the difference in the “Data analysis” subsection of the Materials and methods. We believe that this important distinction did not become sufficiently clear in the previous version of the manuscript. In a nutshell, the results shown in Figure 5 cannot be interpreted as evidence for propagating longitudinal contractions (nor do they argue against such a phenomenon). What the results <italic>do</italic> show is that (i) a local ATP stimulus provides the impulse to push luminal content – with or without triggering a peristaltic wave – and that (ii) for epithelial regions in stage group II, this movement displays directionality.</p><p>In Figure 6, we then ask if the underlying mechanism might be a peristaltic contraction, which we do assume must be causally related to TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Since we do not find evidence for a regenerative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (Figure 6), we assume that, under the present experimental conditions, other features are involved. “Morphological characteristics” such as an anatomical setting in which Sertoli cells effectively function as ‘nonreturn valves’ could, for example, be involved (see below).</p><p>The absence of a regenerative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave in isolated seminiferous tubules could, of course, have several reasons, including any number of missing environmental factors present in the intact testis or simply the inability to register low-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals when using large field-of-view / low numerical aperture objectives. Importantly, we always detect coincident Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals when monitoring seminiferous tubule contractions in vivo (Figure 7A and B, Video 6). Moreover, propagation of wave-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is also regularly observed in vivo (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2D).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now make an effort to describe the data and their interpretation in clear terms in the Results. Moreover, we have added a dedicated paragraph to the Discussion that picks up on the issue of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal – contraction coupling and propagation. Specifically, we have revised / added the following text:</p><p>Results: “Third, we investigated if luminal movement is restricted to the area of stimulation or, by contrast, if fluid flow propagates beyond the directly stimulated tubule section. […] These findings demonstrate directionality of sperm transport upon focal purinergic TPC stimulation in isolated seminiferous tubules.”</p><p>Results: “As expected, ATP-induced tubule contractions also manifest as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in TPCs (Figure 6A and B, Video 5). […] However, local contractions generate sufficient force to move luminal content beyond the directly stimulated area and, in turn, directionality of flow along short-to-medium distances (≤600 µm; Figure 5C<sub>II</sub>) is not critically dependent on peristaltic contractility.”</p><p>Discussion: “Whole-mount imaging of isolated seminiferous tubules reveals propagation of luminal content that extends beyond the confines of the stimulated / contracted area and displays stage-dependent directionality. […] We cannot, however, rule out that the use of large field-of-view / low numerical aperture objectives for ‘macroscopic’ imaging simply prevents the detection of low-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal spread.”</p><p>Discussion: “Among several remaining questions, future experimental efforts will have to address (i) whether TPCs are coupled by gap junctions to display coordinated activity; (ii) whether… […] …(viii) whether an additional cytosolic and / or membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillator (Berridge, 2008) provides an endogenous pacemaker mechanism that acts independent of purinergic stimulation; and…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “ATP induces tubular contractions in vivo”: In this subsection the authors state that the movement analysis along the length of digitally straightened tubules demonstrates wave-like unidirectional motions that propagate with high velocities. What factors do drive this propagation? The authors should consider adding some information.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, reviewer 1 makes a valid point that also refers to his points 1, 5, and 7 (see above and below, respectively). As outlined in our response to these points, the primary factor that drives this propagation is wave-like TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, which we now refer to several times in the manuscript and we also show a representative example (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2D). The detailed mechanisms underlying the spread of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and, therefore, the propagation of contractions / luminal content motion currently remain subject to debate and speculation. Accordingly, we have now added several relevant new paragraphs to the Discussion (see our response to point 7 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion: I generally like concise discussions, but in my opinion in this manuscript also the Discussion, like the Introduction, is way too short. It is more like a short conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent suggestion. We acknowledge his argument and, therefore, we have now substantially revised the Discussion. Several new paragraphs have been added to address the reviewers concerns.</p><p>Specifically, the following text has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here a few points that could/ should be speculated about:</p><p>– What could be the in vivo origin of ATP (cell type, production site)?</p></disp-quote><p>Discussion: “The site(s) / cellular origin of testicular ATP release as well as the mechanism(s) that trigger ATP secretion in vivo currently remain elusive.

Overall, this is an excellent manuscript using innovative imaging techniques to visualize almost simultaneously intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> and peritubular cells movement. In addition, conclusions throughout the manuscript are sound and figure legends are clear. Because this manuscript is relevant for different fields, the authors should improve the writing significantly. First, the Introduction is very superficial and does not elaborate on the rationale behind this manuscript. Moreover, the authors assume that reproductive biologists are familiar with purinergic signaling and avoid any explanation on the pathways. Although short introductions are usually welcome, this one in particular has only two lines more than the Abstract (21 vs. 19 lines). The Results section is better; however, there are many sections in which the authors give for granted knowledge on the system (e.g. the use of specific agonists and antagonists for purinergic receptors; depletion of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores; and others). Finally, if the Introduction was short, the Discussion is almost absent (only 15 lines). The Discussion is also superficial, repeating some sections from the Abstract and Introduction. As the authors said, the topic of smooth muscle regulation in the testis has been underexplored for many years, there is much to say on the relevance of their findings that cannot be written in such a short Discussion.</p><p>1) Abstract: &quot;Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport towards the rete testis and epididymis.&quot; This sentence should be toned down; I agree that this manuscript shows coordinated contractions of smooth muscle. This finding suggests a possible mechanism for the propulsive force required for sperm transport; however, the manuscript does not make a direct observation of the sperm movement through the rete testis and epididymis.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 makes a valid point. We did not intend to claim that we “make a direct observation of the sperm movement through the rete testis and epididymis.” In fact, we are not able to make any statement that refers to the passage of sperm within the rete testis and epididymis. We would like to respectfully point out to the reviewer that we intentionally referred to “sperm transport <italic>towards</italic> the rete testis”, not “<italic>through</italic> the rete testis.” We believe that this is still a valid point to make. In conclusion, we acknowledge the reviewer’s argument and, accordingly, we have deleted the reference to the epididymis and rephrased the relevant sentence, which now reads:</p><p>“Here, we show that coordinated contractions of smooth muscle-like testicular peritubular cells provide the propulsive force for luminal sperm transport towards the rete testis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Abstract, the authors claim &quot;Consequently, our findings could have substantial pharmaceutical implications for both infertility treatment and / or male contraception.&quot; As the authors recognized at the end of the manuscript, this sentence is speculative and does not belong to the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s argument and, accordingly, we have now deleted this speculative sentence from the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Introduction: The Introduction is not informative. The authors should give information on the purinergic system and its role in regulating smooth muscle. They should also incorporate to the Introduction text that let the reader knows on the main signaling pathways involved in purinergic signaling as well as on the type of purinergic receptors, agonists and antagonists.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 emphasizes an important point. We agree that the Introduction, in its original form, may have been too superficial. Thus, we acknowledge the reviewer’s argument and, accordingly, we have now added “information on the purinergic system and its role in regulating smooth muscle” as well as on “the main signaling pathways involved in purinergic signaling”. The relevant paragraphs in the revised Introduction now read:</p><p>“Accumulating evidence implicates purinergic signaling in testicular paracrine communication.

[…] Alternative ATP release pathways include connexin / pannexin hemichannels (Bao et al., 2004; Cotrina et al., 1998), transporters (Lohman et al., 2012), voltage-gated (Taruno et al., 2013) or large-conductance anion (Bell et al., 2003) channels, or even P2X7 receptors (Pellegatti et al., 2005; Suadicani et al., 2006).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “ATP is a potent TPC stimulus”, explain briefly the conclusion that P2X2 or P2X4 but not P2X7 are responsible for the currents observed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an explanatory section to the relevant Results paragraph, which now reads:</p><p>“The specific biophysical and pharmacological profile of ATP-dependent transmembrane currents (Figure 1D–H) strongly suggests functional expression of P2X2 and / or P2X4, but not P2X7 receptors.

Also, the authors state that these cells are sensitive to UTP and dependent on the presence of intracellular GTP. How were these experiments designed? Which is the conclusion of these findings? In general, more rationale is needed to explain why the experiments were conducted. For example, in Figure 1, ivermectin and suramin are used without introducing the mode of action of these compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for pointing this out.

This figure lacks explanation in the main text. The reader needs to carefully analyze Figure 4 legend to understand the logic of the experiments performed. A summary of each panel in the main text will be helpful and should be added. In particular, there is no explanation of panel H in the main text. This panel is difficult to follow even after careful reading of the figure legend. The authors should make a significant effort to explain their thought process to scientists that are not necessarily experts in the field of purinergic signaling.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 makes a valid point. Accordingly, we have now made “a significant effort to explain” the rationale, particularly with respect to Figure 4H. The substantially revised Results paragraph that now reads:</p><p>“We next investigated the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling mechanism(s) underlying ATP-dependent TPC contractions.

This sentence is repeated from the Abstract. Although there is nothing wrong to mention some putative translational implication, as written this sentence is not connected with the rest of the manuscript. To leave this sentence in a final manuscript, the authors should elaborate a rationale on how these findings can be used for either improving male fertility or for contraception. On the other hand, this speculation is not an important part of the manuscript and does not belong to the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank reviewer 2 for pointing this out. As mentioned above (see response to point 2) we deleted this sentence from the Abstract. In agreement with a request from reviewer 1 (point 7), we have now added “a rationale on how these findings can be used for either improving male fertility or for contraception” to the Discussion, which now reads:</p><p>“Impaired spermatogenesis in sub- / infertile men typically coincides with tubular wall remodeling and a partial loss of TPC contractility proteins has been reported in infertile men (Welter et al., 2013). […] Accordingly, pharmacological targeting of purinergic signaling pathways to (re)gain control of TPC contractility represents an attractive approach for male infertility treatment or contraceptive development”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Overall, the Discussion section is short and superficial. There is almost no analyses of the findings; some of the questions that should be addressed are: How results in this manuscript relates to other works in the area? Which are the unknowns that will need further investigation (gap in the knowledge)? How the purinergic system in the testis can be related to clinical applications (male fertility and/or contraception)? Which are the advances obtained in terms of imaging methodologies? How the authors think that the system is regulated: is it paracrine as they propose? If this is the case, what would be the signaling for the release of ATP? It is ok not to know the answer, it is not ok to avoid discussing these topics.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for making this important point, which is in agreement with a concern raised by reviewer 1 (point 7). Therefore, we have now substantially revised the Discussion. Several new paragraphs have been added to address the reviewers concerns.</p><p>Specifically, the following text has been added:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How results in this manuscript relates to other works in the area?

As outlined above, we have now provided the required “clarification on the results” and we made “a significant effort to improve the Introduction and Discussion section.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] (1) The roles of P2X and P2Y receptors and their contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in TPCs is somewhat confusing. In Figure 1J, the authors demonstrate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in TPCs originates both from extracellular sources (P2X mediated) as well as intracellular sources (P2Y mediated). But depletion of intracellular stores (Figure 4D) seems to entirely eliminate the cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, suggesting P2Y mediated signaling only? Also, given that P2Y-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals do play a role, it might be worth considering moving data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into Figure 1 of the main paper to give them more prominence.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 makes a valid point. At first glance, the role of P2X receptors – given the critical role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum – appears puzzling. However, it is likely that P2X receptors act as signal boosters that mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, possibly via activation of ryanodine receptors (Berridge, 2008). To clarify, we have added a new paragraph to the Discussion, which now reads:</p><p>“Excitation–contraction coupling in TPCs is poorly described. […] Therefore, it is likely that P2X receptors act as signal boosters that mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, possibly via activation of ryanodine receptors (Berridge, 2008). This way, the combined action of P2X and P2Y receptors might equip TPCs with a broader ‘two-step’ stimulus integration range.”</p><p>In addition, we acknowledge the reviewer’s argument that “it might be worth considering moving data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into Figure 1 of the main paper to give them more prominence.” Accordingly, we now show the relevant data (previously shown as Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F) as new Figure 1M–P. For coherence, we now present data showing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>–</sup> current as new Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figures 5 and 6 describe directional luminal transport and TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals respectively following focal application of ATP, with contraction occurring in a stage-dependent directional manner, while the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is confined locally to where ATP was applied with no spread. This seems puzzling as it raises the question of what signal drives the contractions (and their directionality) in the TPCs that contract (one assumes) without an apparent Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 raises an important point that is also brought up by reviewer 1 (point 5; see above). It is clear that we did not manage to communicate these results and, specifically, our interpretation in a clear and compelling way. We apologize and, accordingly, we have extensively revised both the corresponding Results text and the Discussion.</p><p>In Figure 5, we show that focal application of ATP triggers contractions that translate into movement of luminal content. This read-out (luminal flow change 𝑐𝑐<sub>𝑖𝑖</sub>) is different from the contraction measurements (flow strength 𝑠𝑠<sub>𝑖𝑖</sub>) conducted in Figures 3, 4 and 7. We describe the difference in the “Data analysis” subsection of the Materials and methods. We believe that this important distinction did not become sufficiently clear in the previous version of the manuscript. In a nutshell, the results shown in Figure 5 cannot be interpreted as evidence for propagating longitudinal contractions (nor do they argue against such a phenomenon). What the results <italic>do</italic> show is that (i) a local ATP stimulus provides the impulse to push luminal content – with or without triggering a peristaltic wave – and that (ii) for epithelia in stage group II, this movement displays directionality.</p><p>In Figure 6, we then ask if the underlying mechanism might be a peristaltic contraction, which we do assume must be causally related to TPC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Since we do not find evidence for a regenerative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave (Figure 6), we assume that, under the present experimental conditions, other features are involved. For example, Sertoli cell morphology could effectively cause them to function as ‘nonreturn valves’.</p><p>The absence of a regenerative Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave in isolated seminiferous tubules could, of course, have several reasons, including any number of missing environmental factors present in the intact testis or simply our inability to register low-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals when using large field-of-view / low numerical aperture objectives. Importantly, we always detect coincident Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals when monitoring seminiferous tubule contractions in vivo (Figure 7A and B, Video 6). Moreover, propagation of wave-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals is also regularly observed in vivo (new Figure 7—figure supplement 2D).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we now make an effort to describe the data and their interpretation in clear terms in the Results. Moreover, we have added dedicated paragraphs to the Discussion that pick up on the issue of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal contraction coupling and propagation. Specifically, we have revised / added the following text in the Results:</p><p>“Third, we investigated if luminal movement is restricted to the area of stimulation or, by contrast, if fluid flow propagates beyond the directly stimulated tubule section. […] These findings demonstrate directionality of sperm transport upon focal purinergic TPC stimulation in isolated seminiferous tubules.”</p><p>“As expected, ATP-induced tubule contractions also manifest as Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in TPCs (Figure 6A and B, Video 5). However, these Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations appear to be limited to those areas directly exposed to ATP (ROI 0). […] However, local contractions generate sufficient force to move luminal content beyond the directly stimulated area and, in turn, directionality of flow along short-to-medium distances (≤600 µm; Figure 5C<sub>II</sub>) is not critically dependent on peristaltic contractility.”</p><p>Discussion: “Whole-mount imaging of isolated seminiferous tubules reveals propagation of luminal content that extends beyond the confines of the stimulated / contracted area and displays stage-dependent directionality. […] We cannot, however, rule out that the use of large field-of-view / low numerical aperture objectives for ‘macroscopic’ imaging simply prevents the detection of low-amplitude Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal spread.”</p><p>“Among several remaining questions, future experimental efforts will have to address (i) whether TPCs are coupled by gap junctions to display coordinated activity; (ii) whether… […] …(viii) whether an additional cytosolic and / or membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillator (Berridge, 2008) provides an endogenous pacemaker mechanism that acts independent of purinergic stimulation; and…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along similar lines, what signal drives the directionality of the contractions? ATP diffusing along the tubules? Or Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves spreading from cell to cell (although that should become evident in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging)? While this might be outside the scope of the manuscript, it might be worth addressing this issue in the currently quite focused Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 emphasizes another important point. As he stated, an in-depth analysis of the mechanism(s) that govern excitation–contraction coupling and its longitudinal spread in TPCs is “outside the scope of the manuscript” and warrants systematic full analysis and an independent publication. Nonetheless, we follow the reviewer’s advice to address “this issue in the currently quite focused Discussion.” Accordingly, we have revised the Discussion as outlined in our response to concern 2 (see above). In addition, we have now added several relevant paragraphs to the Discussion that now reads:</p><p>“During spermatogenesis, apoptosis is a vital process (Print and Loveland, 2000). […] In addition, ATP release has been observed in several cell types as a result of mechanical deformation, shear stress, stretch, or osmotic swelling (Button et al., 2013) adding another putative mechanism of regenerative signaling in purinergic contraction control.”</p><p>“Notably, extracellular ATP is rapidly degraded by ecto-nucleotidases (Zimmermann et al., 2012), rendering its interstitial half-life relatively short and, thus, narrowing its paracrine radius to a few hundred micrometers (Fitz, 2007). Combined with its fast diffusion – approximately 1 μm in less than 10 ms (Khakh, 2001) – extracellular ATP bears all characteristics of a fast paracrine agent in testicular communication (Praetorius and Leipziger, 2009).”</p><p>“Excitation–contraction coupling in TPCs is poorly described. […] This way, the combined action of P2X and P2Y receptors might equip TPCs with a broader ‘two-step’ stimulus integration range.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
