However, how cells are segregated into tissue precursors remains largely unknown. Cornea development is a perfect example of this process whereby neural crest cells aggregate in the periocular region prior to their migration and differentiation into corneal cells. Our recent RNA-seq analysis identified upregulation of nephronectin (Npnt) transcripts during early stages of corneal development where its function has not been investigated. We found that Npnt mRNA and protein are expressed by various ocular tissues, including the migratory periocular neural crest (pNC), which also express the integrin alpha 8 (Itgα8) receptor. Knockdown of either <italic>Npnt</italic> or <italic>Itgα8</italic> attenuated cornea development, whereas overexpression of <italic>Npnt</italic> resulted in cornea thickening. Moreover, overexpression of Npnt variants lacking RGD-binding sites did not affect corneal thickness. Neither the knockdown nor augmentation of Npnt caused significant changes in cell proliferation, suggesting that Npnt directs pNC migration into the cornea. In vitro analyses showed that Npnt promotes pNC migration from explanted periocular mesenchyme, which requires Itgα8, focal adhesion kinase, and Rho kinase. Combined, these data suggest that Npnt augments cell migration into the presumptive cornea extracellular matrix by functioning as a substrate for Itgα8-positive pNC cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>periocular neural crest</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>corneal development</kwd><kwd>nephronectin</kwd><kwd>integrin alpha 8</kwd><kwd>cornea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY031381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lwigale</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY022158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lwigale</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>National Institutes of Health</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lwigale</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new role for nephronectin and integrin α8 signaling during neural crest cell migration in the developing cornea has been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In vertebrates, the cornea comprises three cellular layers: epithelium, stroma, and endothelium. The corneal epithelium is derived from the ectoderm, whereas the stromal keratocytes and corneal endothelium are derived from cranial neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lwigale et al., 2005</xref>). In birds and humans, neural crest migration from the periocular region into the presumptive cornea occurs in two waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feneck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hay, 1980</xref>). The first wave forms a monolayer of the nascent corneal endothelium, which is accompanied by a second wave of mesenchymal migration into the acellular matrix between endothelium and ectoderm to form the cornea stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay and Revel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Noden, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lwigale et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Creuzet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feneck et al., 2020</xref>). Several mechanisms pertaining to the role of growth factors and guidance cues have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beebe and Coats, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Saika et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lwigale and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2014</xref>), but the functional role of extracellular matrix (ECM)/integrin signaling in establishing the cornea remains unclear.</p><p>Among the initial effects of the signaling that takes place between the nascent ocular tissues is the synthesis of the corneal ECM by the corneal epithelium in response to inductive signals from the lens vesicle to form the primary stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay and Revel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hendrix et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fitch et al., 1988</xref>). In birds and humans, the primary stroma serves an important role as a scaffold for periocular neural crest (pNC) migration throughout the process of corneal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay and Revel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bard and Hay, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quantock and Young, 2008</xref>). It consists of multiple ECM proteins, including hyaluronan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Toole and Trelstad, 1971</xref>), collagen type I and II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fitch et al., 1988</xref>), laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doane et al., 1996</xref>), and fibronectin (Fn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fitch et al., 1991</xref>). Following the second wave of pNC migration into the developing cornea, the primary stroma is concomitantly replaced by the secondary stroma that is synthesized by differentiating stromal keratocytes. The secondary stroma comprises the bulk of the adult cornea and consists of collagens and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayashi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Quantock and Young, 2008</xref>) that are arranged in patterns that result in transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Over the past decades, the roles of collagens and proteoglycans have been the focus of several investigations due to their indispensable functions in corneal transparency. However, most of these studies were conducted in rodents, in which early corneal development does not involve the primary stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pei and Rhodin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haustein, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Feneck et al., 2019</xref>). Although the ECM plays a critical role during organogenesis by providing cell adhesion substrate, sequestering signaling molecules, providing structural support and mechanical cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hynes, 2014</xref>), the function of the primary stroma during early corneal development remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Our recent RNA-seq analysis of pNC differentiation into corneal cells identified novel expression and upregulation of nephronectin (Npnt) transcripts during corneal development. Npnt was discovered as an ECM ligand for integrin α8β1 (α8β1) during mouse kidney development, consisting of 70–90 kDa proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brandenberger et al., 2001</xref>) generated by alternate splicing (561–609 amino acids). At the same time, it was also identified as preosteoblast epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeat protein with meprin A5 protein and receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ domain (POEM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Morimura et al., 2001</xref>). Npnt consists of five EGF-like domains in the N-terminal, a central region containing an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence, and a meprin-A5 protein-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase μ (MAM) domain in the C-terminal. The EGF-like and RGD domains have been functionally characterized and shown to play critical roles in development and tissue homeostasis. The RGD domain signals through α8β1 receptor during epithelial–mesenchymal interactions involved in kidney development and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Miner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Linton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Müller et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Inagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Müller-Deile et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zimmerman et al., 2018</xref>). These observations in mice were recently confirmed by the identification of recessive mutation in the Npnt gene that caused bilateral kidney agenesis in human fetuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dai et al., 2021</xref>). The EGF-like domains of Npnt are associated with inducing differentiation and proliferation in osteoblasts and dental stem cells through the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kahai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arai et al., 2017</xref>) and to induce vascular endothelial cell migration via phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38MAPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuek et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies have also implicated Npnt to play a role in heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Patra et al., 2011</xref>), attachment of the arrector pili muscle to hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fujiwara et al., 2011</xref>), and during forelimb formation in amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Daya et al., 2011</xref>). Other studies have also demonstrated that Npnt plays a potential role in diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saferali et al., 2020</xref>), diabetic glomerulosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nakatani et al., 2012</xref>), Fraser syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kiyozumi et al., 2012</xref>), and in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Magnussen et al., 2021</xref>). Despite the pleiotropic functions of Npnt in development and disease, its expression and function have not yet been described in the cornea.</p><p>Inspired by our observation that Npnt transcripts were upregulated during corneal development, we sought to establish its role during pNC migration into the developing avian cornea. We first characterized the spatiotemporal expression of Npnt mRNA and protein at stages that correspond with pNC migration. Next, we used replication-competent ASLV long terminal repeat with a splice acceptor (RCAS)-mediated gene knockdown to investigate the role of <italic>Npnt</italic>. We identified Itgα8 as a potential receptor for Npnt during cornea development and confirmed its role in pNC using an in vitro migration assay coupled with inhibitors for α8β1, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Rho signaling pathway, and in vivo using gene knockdown. Lastly, we performed misexpression studies using either the full-length, RGD mutant, and truncated versions of Npnt to further confirm its role during pNC migration and that it functions through the RGD domain. Together, our findings show that Npnt secreted into the ECM of the nascent cornea provides a substrate that promotes migration of Itgα8-positive pNC during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Npnt mRNA and protein are expressed during early ocular development</title><p>Our previous RNA-seq analysis of gene expression during pNC differentiation into corneal cells identified upregulation of <italic>Npnt</italic> transcripts during chick corneal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bi and Lwigale, 2019</xref>).

At E4, Npnt is localized in the optic cup, lens epithelium, surrounding the pNC cells adjacent to the nascent cornea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, arrow), and in the primary stroma of the cornea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, asterisk). At E5, strong Npnt staining is observed in the primary stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>, asterisk). By E6, vivid Npnt staining was localized in the anterior region of the cornea and diffusely throughout the primary stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–L</xref>). At this time, the migratory pNC also stained positive for Npnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, arrowheads). Strong expression of Npnt persists in the basement membrane of the corneal epithelium through (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) and is also faintly detectable in the corneal epithelial cells by E12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly, the protein expression did not correlate with the strong mRNA expression in the stroma during later stages of cornea development. This mismatch could be due to post-transcriptional regulation that prevents protein expression. It is also possible that post-translational modification by enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are temporally and spatially regulated in the corneal ECM during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huh et al., 2007</xref>), could lead to protein degradation. A previous study showed that Npnt can be modified by MMP cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Toraskar et al., 2019</xref>). Given that the changes in protein localization occur after the second wave of migration, we can conclude from our results that the expression of Npnt coincides with pNC ingression into the cornea, implicating a potential role during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Knockdown of <italic>Npnt</italic> disrupts corneal thickness during early development</title><p>To investigate the function of Npnt during early corneal development, we generated several RCAS-GFP-Npnt-shRNA (<italic>Npnt<sup>kd</sup></italic>) constructs in chick DF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

For this analysis, we generated and tested several RCAS-GFP-Itgα8-shRNA constructs and validated one that showed highest knockdown of <italic>Itgα8</italic> in DF-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As a first step, we analyzed the effect of <italic>Itgα8</italic> knockdown on the first wave of pNC migration that forms the corneal endothelium at E5. We found that at this time point relatively fewer GFP-positive cells expressing the <italic>Itgα8<sup>kd</sup></italic> construct appeared to migrate into the cornea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, arrows) compared to RCAS-GFP control, which showed robust occupation of GFP-positive cells in the corneal endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Despite the attenuated migration of pNC expressing the <italic>Itgα8<sup>kd</sup></italic> construct during the first wave, we did not observe defects in the corneal endothelium. One possibility is that pNC, which do not endogenously express Itgα8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), may also contribute to the corneal endothelium, albeit at a lower level, but they are able to compensate for the <italic>Itgα8</italic> knockdown, resulting in the formation of a normal endothelial layer. Nonetheless, histological analysis at E7 revealed reduction in corneal thickness following <italic>Itgα8</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) compared to control corneas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

In addition, our analysis indicated that the ROCK inhibitor significantly decreased the density of migratory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Given that the cells covered a wider area, it is possible that the decrease in cell density could be due to the increased surface area or decreased cell migration.

Our results revealed that in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor cells exhibited a significantly reduced preferred orientation (90° ± 30°) compared to Npnt alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Thus, in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor, the pNC spread out on the Npnt substrate with limited directional migration. To test if loss of directionality was caused by changes to the cytoskeletal structure, we examined the cytoskeletal machinery of the cells using phalloidin staining and focal adhesions by immunostaining for pY118 paxillin, which provides a docking site for assembly of the actin fibers that is required for cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Turner, 2000</xref>).

Cells in both conditions stained positive for pY118 paxillin, but the number of puncta per cell significantly increased in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor.

Specifically, we have identified novel expression of Npnt and its Itgα8 receptor at critical time points during pNC migration into the nascent cornea. Our data reveal that disruption of Npnt/Itgα8 signaling either in ovo or in vitro perturbs pNC migration, which subsequently results in corneal thickness defects, but formation of the cellular layers is not affected. Our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) provides a context in which Npnt functions in the presence of Fn during corneal development. Fn is a well-known substrate for neural crest cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfandari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bronner-Fraser, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Newgreen and Thiery, 1980</xref>) that is robustly expressed in the periocular mesenchyme and cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doane et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kurkinen et al., 1979</xref>). In comparison, Npnt is expressed in an increasing gradient from the edge of the periocular region towards the cornea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We posit that all pNC cells express α5β1 and previously showed that they robustly migrate on Fn substrate in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lwigale and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>). However, in vivo, it is most likely that the pNC, which express both α5β1 and α8β1, and thus can respond to Npnt and Fn, migrate into the cornea. Based on this study, we conclude that Npnt/Itgα8 signaling plays an essential role in pNC migration during corneal development.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of periocular neural crest (pNC) response to the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the context of the expression of nephronectin (Npnt) and fibronectin (Fn) during corneal development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cross-section of embryonic day (E)5 eye immunostained for Npnt and Fn.

Our immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Npnt protein staining consistently corresponded with the mRNA expression during pNC migration into the developing cornea. In addition, we observed that Npnt was localized in the acellular primary stroma, suggesting that prior to its expression by the migratory pNC in the cornea, the optic cup and lens vesicle are the primary sources of Npnt in the nascent corneal ECM. The link between the primary stroma and the presumptive corneal epithelium and endothelium was established in classical studies, which showed that the lens and corneal endothelium induce the corneal epithelium to synthesize collagen and glycosaminoglycans into the underlying space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fitch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hay et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hay and Revel, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Toole and Trelstad, 1971</xref>).

We showed that disruption of <italic>Npnt</italic> expression in the anterior ocular tissues via RCAS-mediated knockdown resulted in decreased corneal thickness. In addition to functioning in epithelial–mesenchymal interactions, Npnt has been shown to promote migration in various tissues, including vascular endothelial cells during osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuek et al., 2016</xref>), infiltration of immune cells into the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Inagaki et al., 2013</xref>), and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Magnussen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Given that Npnt is localized in the primary stroma during corneal development, we hypothesized that it may play a potential role in pNC migration. In agreement with our hypothesis, our in vitro migration assays confirmed that robust pNC migration from mesenchyme explant occurred on Npnt substrate but was abrogated in the presence of the Itgα8 inhibitor. We also observed that knockdown of <italic>Itgα8</italic> reduced pNC migration into the cornea and phenocopied the reduction of corneal thickness observed following <italic>Npnt</italic> knockdown. In addition, we found that reduction in corneal thickness was accompanied by a decrease in cell count, but cell density and proliferation were not affected, suggesting that Npnt/Itgα8 signaling mediates pNC migration during corneal development. Given that the primary function of keratocytes is to synthesize the corneal ECM comprising collagens and proteoglycans, and represents approximately 90% of the corneal thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fini, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Funderburgh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kao, 2010</xref>), our observation that there was no change in stromal cell density raises a possibility that matrix synthesis by the pNC that differentiated into keratocytes is not a major contributing factor to the reduction in corneal thickness. However, additional studies may be required to determine how the disruption in corneal thickness observed in this study may affect the corneal ECM and transparency at later stages of development.</p><p>Our overexpression studies showed the opposite effect whereby the full-length construct caused increased corneal thickness at E9. We also found that increased corneal thickness persisted at E15 when Npnt appears to be downregulated in the cornea. Surprisingly, the E7 corneas were not affected in the overexpression studies. This could be caused by limited pNC migration potential due to their expression of Neuropilin1, which prevents them from entering the corneal environment that contains a repulsive Semaphorin3A signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lwigale and Bronner-Fraser, 2009</xref>). As observed in the knockdown studies, there were no differences in cell proliferation between control and <italic>Npnt<sup>oe</sup></italic> corneas, suggesting that there was an increase in pNC migration. The mutant Npnt-RAE construct overexpresses approximately the same-size protein as the endogenous Npnt, while maintaining its MAM domain to support ECM–ECM interactions, but it did not impact cornea thickness. This indicates that the expression of high levels of protein does not affect cornea thickness, further implicating that Npnt functions in directing cell migration specifically through its RGD sequence during early cornea development. The reduction in cell count and density could be attributed to the mutant RAE domain outcompeting the expression of the endogenous RGD by the pNC. Similarly, the truncated version of Npnt containing only the EGF-like repeats did not affect cornea thickness, further confirming that Npnt signals through the RGD domain and Itgα8 to modulate pNC migration into the cornea.</p><p>Furthermore, our in vitro culture experiments revealed that directed migration of pNC from the explant requires activation of FAK by α8β1 to promote focal adhesions. Previous studies have shown that activation of the Rho/Rock pathway via integrin signaling drives actin remodeling that is necessary for cell adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Price et al., 1998</xref>). Our data also revealed that in the presence of the ROCK inhibitor pNC transformed into a rounded morphology in which assembly of the actin cytoskeletal machinery was disrupted and the number of focal adhesions increased. These results indicate a drastic change in migratory behavior that was less polarized from the explant, implying a potential involvement of the Rho/ROCK pathway in the directed migration pNC into the cornea. Given that pNC migrate on both Fn and Npnt in vitro, and that both α5β1 and α8β1 activate the Rho/Rock pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zargham et al., 2007</xref>), it is possible that Rho activity increases as the cells migrate from the periocular region into the matrix of the developing cornea due to the presence of additional cues from Npnt.</p><p>Precise coordination of multiple signals from surrounding ocular tissues orchestrates the spatiotemporal migration and differentiation of multipotent pNC during the formation of the avian corneal endothelium and stromal keratocytes. Disruptions in the sequence of these early events can lead to significant defects in corneal development. Our study provides the first characterization of Npnt/Itgα8 function in pNC that contribute to the cornea. Despite being surrounded by an ECM rich in Fn, pNC remain relatively immobile in the periocular region until some become competent to respond to Npnt cues via the expression of α8β1. This transformation may be crucial for the timely induction of directional migration of pNC towards the gradient of additional cues generated by Npnt in the primary stroma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>), and therefore plays a vital role in segregating the cornea progenitors from the rest of the periocular mesenchyme. In this study, we focused on the role of Npnt/Itgα8 signaling during pNC migration. Our observation that the Npnt protein subsequently localizes to the basement membrane of the epithelial layer, combined with its pleiotropic functions during development and in disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yamada and Kamijo, 2016</xref>), implies that Npnt may have other functions at later stages of cornea development. One possibility is that Npnt mediates epithelial–mesenchymal interactions between the cornea epithelium and stroma by signaling through the EGF-like domain to EGFRs in the epithelial cells. Future studies will expand on these findings to determine whether the corneal thinning and thickening phenotypes observed in this study affect transparency, which develops at later stages. Elucidation of the link between Npnt signaling and corneal cell differentiation may provide useful insights for future therapeutic applications for wound healing and regeneration studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">shRNA: Npnt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods, section ‘Production of RCAS virus’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Transfected construct (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">shRNA: Itga8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods, ‘Production of RCAS virus’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Primary periocular neural crest</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">See Materials and methods, section ‘In vitro explant culture’</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>G. gallus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DF-1 cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# CRL12203</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lot# 58217603, no mycoplasma contamination detected</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-Npnt (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biorbyt</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# orb221700;

Virus pellets were resuspended in DMEM and stocks at approximately 1–7 × 10<sup>6</sup> Ifu/mL were stored in –80°C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Generation of shRNA and viral constructs</title><p>shRNA target sequences used for <italic>Npnt<sup>kd</sup></italic> and <italic>Itgα8<sup>kd</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) were designed using the BLOCK-iT RNAi Designer tool (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and linked to their reverse complementary sequence by a loop sequence, TTCAAGAGA. A short termination sequence and restriction enzyme sites were added at each end to create fragments that were ligated into a pSLAX shuttle vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hughes et al., 1987</xref>) and to add a chick U6 (Cu6) promoter and a GFP reporter. The shRNA sequences were cloned into the RCAS vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) by homologous recombination using a CloneEZ kit (GenScript) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kwiatkowski et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ojeda et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Npnt<sup>oe</sup></italic> overexpression constructs were either generated by substitution of the shRNA with a full-length coding sequence of Npnt in the vector above or using a modified vector where the full-length Npnt protein was driven by a promoter within the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs) with eGFP linked by an IRES motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

All constructs were validated using primers for Npnt and Itga8 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>BrdU staining</title><p>BrdU was used to assay for cell proliferation. The BrdU solution was prepared at a final concentration of 10 µM in complete media. Eyes were collected at desired stages and injected into the anterior chamber between the cornea and lens with BrdU solution (approximately 50–100 µL depending on development stage), then cultured in BrdU solution for 2 hr at 37°C. Eyes were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline , fixed in 4% PFA, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned as described above. BrdU-positive cells were identified by immunohistochemistry using anti-BrdU antibody (1:30; G3G4, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank). Sections were counterstained with DAPI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>In vitro explant culture</title><p>Embryos were collected at E4 in Ringer’s solution, and the anterior eyes were dissected and digested in dispase (1.5 mg/mL, Worthington) for 10 min at 37°C. The periocular mesenchyme was isolated by physically removing the presumptive cornea epithelium, lens, and the optic cup. The mesenchyme ring was further trimmed using tungsten needles to obtain cells that are proximal to the presumptive cornea, then dissected into approximately 120 × 120 µm explants. Nunc Lab-tek II 8-well chamber slides (Sigma) were coated with 1.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> with poly-<sc>d</sc>-lysine (MP Biomedicals) for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by recombinant mouse or human Npnt (R&amp;D Systems) at 1.5 µg/cm<sup>2</sup> for 2 hr at 37°C. Mesenchyme explants were transferred to the coated slides containing complete media, with and without inhibitors and incubated at 37°C in a humidified tissue culture incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 12–24 hr. The α8β1 peptide inhibitor following the 23-mer sequence P<bold>RGD</bold>VFIPRQPTN<bold>DLFEIFEIER</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sato et al., 2009</xref>) was commercially generated (GenScript) and used at a 10 µM working concentration. The small-molecule FAK inhibitor PF-573228 (Sigma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Slack-Davis et al., 2007</xref>) and ROCK inhibitor Y27632 (Sigma; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Uehata et al., 1997</xref>) were used at 10 µM working concentration. Explants with migratory cells were imaged with a Rebel T6s camera (Canon) mounted on an Axiovert 40C microscope (Carl Zeiss). The magnitude of cell migration from explants was calculated by measuring the density of cells in a 175 µm × 175 µm area located 270 µm from the center of the explant. The orientation of pNC migration from explants was analyzed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babaliari et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, confluent regions of cells proximal to the explant were segmented and linearized, then the ImageJ Directionality plugin using local gradient orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liu, 1991</xref>) was applied. The cellular features oriented to 90° ± 30° were considered to be aligned perpendicular to the explant. Mean integrated peak areas, bounded by 60° and 120°, were used to compare the magnitude of perpendicular alignment in all conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Time-lapse video microscopy</title><p>Mesenchyme explants were prepared and cultured as described above in media containing 0.1 µg/mL Hoechst dye solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific) used to label all nuclei. Chamber slides containing attached explants were imaged at 3 min and 27 s intervals for 17 hr using an FV1200 laser scanning microscope (Olympus) with a stage top incubator (Tokai Hit). Movies were generated using Imaris Software (Oxford Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of corneal measurements</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Corneal thickness</title><p>Differences in corneal thickness between control and knockdown samples were determined by averaging measurements taken at three separate locations along the cornea. All measurements were taken perpendicular to the radial curvature of the cornea. Since corneal thickness is not always uniform in overexpression samples, measurements were taken at three locations across the center of the thickened region.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Cornea cell counts and density</title><p>Nuclei labeled by the DAPI staining of corneal sections were used to count stromal cells within a width of 200 µm along the entire height of that region. Cells were either counted manually or using the threshold particle analysis in ImageJ software in which nuclei from the epithelium and endothelium are discounted from the final tally. Cell density was determined by dividing the number of nuclei and the area, which was measured by multiplying the value of the corneal thickness by the width of the selected region. A comparison of cell counts and density between the anterior vs. posterior corneal region was determined by taking similar areas for all corneas, which was set at a value of 20% the average thickness of control corneas.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-3"><title>Cell proliferation</title><p>Cell proliferation was determined in corneal sections by first utilizing the cell count technique described above. The total number of cells was represented by all the DAPI-positive nuclei, out of which the BrdU-positive cells were quantified. Cell proliferation was calculated as a percentage of the total DAPI-positive nuclei that were BrdU positive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Software and statistics</title><p>ImageJ software was used to measure the staining intensity or tissue morphological features, such as cornea thickness and cell density. The number of cornea sections analyzed is summarized in each figure legend. All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Software. Data are presented as scatterplot with mean values. Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test and was used to compare the differences between means.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ales Cvekl (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript the authors examine early stages in avian corneal development, focusing on how neural crest derived cells migrate into the space between the corneal epithelium and lens to form the corneal endothelium and stroma. The authors examine the functional interplay of nephronectin (Nptm) and alpha8-integrin (Itga8) and find that both overexpression and knockdown of Npnt and Itga8 Kd cause changes of corneal thickness, but do not significantly impact corneal transparency and function. In general the reviewers felt that this work would be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic> if some specific points could be addressed.</p><p>1) The authors should should examine the expression of corneal differentiation markers such as keratocan, lumican and collagen to determine if overexpression /knockdown of Npnt/ Itga8 impact corneal differentiation beyond cell migration.</p><p>2) The authors should provide data showing what signals/targets downstream of Npnt-integrin a8 underlie the attenuation of cell migration.</p><p>3) Please indicate if the corneas are transparent after over expression/ KD of Npnt /integrin 8a and discuss whether these manipulations lead to pathological phenotypes? (eg did they develop corneal disorder such as corneal ectasia, corneal opacity etc?)</p><p>4) There is some concern about the specificity/sensitivity of the Npnt antibody given that there is very strong signal in mRNA but little signal in protein level in several figures.For example there is abundant expression of mRNA but little Npnt protein detected in the corneal stroma from E7, E9 and E12. At E7, Npnt mRNA is highly expressed but Npnt protein is not detected. Similarly in Figure 5, the expression pattern of Npnt mRNA and protein are not consistent. Since Npnt is ECM component, it should be evenly distributed throughout the corneal stroma instead of punctate expression. Given these concerns, for the experiments in Figure 2, the authors should perform immunostaining to show that Npnt protein levels are indeed reduced.</p><p>5) In Figure 4B the first wave migration of pNC to form endothelium was attenuated by Itga8 KD but in Fig4D endothelium formation does not appear to have any defect. How do the authors explain this? One might have expected cornea-lens fusion due to the impairment of endothelium formation.</p><p>6) When talking about the range of 70-90 kDa Npnt proteins, it would be useful to state that these are generated by alternate splicing and give a range of aa residues (e.g. 536 to 595aa) to avoid confusion with complex posttranslational modifications.</p><p>7) At least four additional proteins interacting with NPNT include ESR2, FLT3, insulin and WDR76. Are these genes expressed in the system and what we can learn from their known roles in other systems for corneal cell biology?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74307.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this manuscript the authors examine early stages in avian corneal development, focusing on how neural crest derived cells migrate into the space between the corneal epithelium and lens to form the corneal endothelium and stroma.

To avoid an excessively large manuscript, the current study only focused on the role of Npnt during periocular neural crest migration. To address the reviewers concern, we would like to share some of our preliminary data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) showing that keratocyte differentiation is not disrupted at E8 following overexpression of <italic>Npnt</italic>. The keratocyte markers Coll2, KSPG, and Decorin are all expressed although they appear at relatively less intense levels following overexpression of Npnt. We also examined the basement membrane proteins Perlecan and Laminin, which were strongly expressed in the epithelial basement membrane, but appeared to be affected in the Descemet membrane. We addressed the reviewers comment by adding the statements below in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74307-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Page 17; Line 384-386:</p><p>“However, additional studies may be required to determine how the disruption in corneal thickness observed in the current study may affect the corneal ECM and transparency at later stages of development.”</p><p>Page 19; Lines 426-436:</p><p>“In this study, we focused on the role of Npnt/Itga8 signaling during pNC migration. Our observation that the Npnt protein subsequently localizes to the basement membrane of the epithelial layer combined with its pleiotropic functions during development and in disease (Yamada and Kamijo, 2016), imply that Npnt may have other functions at later stages of cornea development. One possibility is that Npnt mediates epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between the cornea epithelium and stroma by signaling through the EGF-like domain to EGFR receptors in the epithelial cells. Future studies will expand on these findings to determine whether the corneal thinning and thickening phenotypes observed in the current study affect transparency, which develops at later stages. Elucidation of the link between Npnt signaling and corneal cell differentiation may provide useful insights for future therapeutic applications for wound healing and regeneration studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should provide data showing what signals/targets downstream of Npnt-integrin a8 underlie the attenuation of cell migration.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the excellent suggestion that substantially improved the paper. To investigate the downstream signals, we conducted pNC explant culture experiments on Npnt substrate and focused on focal adhesion kinase (FAK inhibitor), focal adhesion complex (phospho paxillin), and Rho-associated kinase (ROCK inhibitor), and generated a new Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Our results indicate that Npnt/Itga8 signaling induces pNC migration through activation of Rho mediated by FAK and paxillin. We addressed the new findings in the Results section (Pages 13-14; Lines 277-312), Discussion section (Pages 18-19; Lines 404-416), and also in various parts of the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please indicate if the corneas are transparent after over expression/ KD of Npnt /integrin 8a and discuss whether these manipulations lead to pathological phenotypes? (eg did they develop corneal disorder such as corneal ectasia, corneal opacity etc?)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. In the current study, we focused on the early events of cornea development and analyzed the corneal defects prior to development of corneal transparency, which occurs gradually between E15-19 in the chick. As part of our ongoing studies, we plan to analyze whether corneal thinning that follows knockdown of <italic>Npnt</italic> or <italic>Itga8</italic> persists into later stages of development and if so, we will determine whether this defect leads to corneal ectasia and/or loss of transparency. We will also examine whether the corneal thickening defect affects transparency. To address the reviewers comment, we are sharing some of our promising preliminary data from E15 overexpression studies showing substantial loss of transparency, defects in the iris (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, arrow) indicated by the large pupil and coloboma (arrowhead), and in some cases, apparent increase in corneal diameter. We addressed this concern in the revised manuscript in our response to comment 1 above.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-74307-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There is some concern about the specificity/sensitivity of the Npnt antibody given that there is very strong signal in mRNA but little signal in protein level in several figures.For example there is abundant expression of mRNA but little Npnt protein detected in the corneal stroma from E7, E9 and E12.

In fact, one of the patterns we see is that despite strong mRNA expression in the stroma, the majority of the protein accumulates in the anterior region and subsequently localizes to the basement membrane of the epithelial layer. This is not surprising since Npnt localizes to the basement membranes during development of several tissues including the kidney, teeth, and skin. To address this part of the reviewers’ concern, we added the clarification below elaborating on the localization of the protein vs mRNA expression in the Results section (Page 7; Lines 142-150).</p><p>“Interestingly, the protein expression did not correlate with the strong mRNA expression in the stroma during later stages of cornea development. This mis-match could be due to posttranscriptional regulation that prevents protein expression. It is also possible that posttranslational modification by enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are temporally and spatially regulated in the corneal ECM during development (Huh et al., 2007), could lead to protein degradation. A previous study showed that Npnt can be modified by MMP cleavage (Toraskar et al., 2019). Given that the changes in protein localization occur after the second wave of migration, we can conclude from our results that expression of Npnt coincides with pNC ingression into the cornea, implicating a potential role during development.”</p><p>To address the second part of the reviewers’ concern, we would also like to refer to the dynamic distribution of the Npnt that localizes the protein in the epithelial basement membrane at E7 and later stages of development, which makes it difficult to distinguish Npnt protein levels in the stroma of control vs knockdown. For this reason, we chose to use mRNA expression to assess the change in <italic>Npnt</italic> expression induced by our knockdown construct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 4B the first wave migration of pNC to form endothelium was attenuated by Itga8 KD but in Fig4D endothelium formation does not appear to have any defect. How do the authors explain this? One might have expected cornea-lens fusion due to the impairment of endothelium formation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern that our experiments do not show defects related to absence of the corneal endothelium at E5. A potential reason is that the pNC contain a heterogenous population that either express or do not express <italic>Itga8</italic> (Figure 3A), and in the <italic>Itga8</italic> knockdown experiments, some of the cells that do not endogenously express Itga8 may compensate for this loss of cell migration and form a normal endothelial cell layer. A similar explanation applies to the second wave, although in this case, the corneal thinning defect persists due to the large number of cells required for the stroma. We clarified this in the Results section of the manuscript as indicated below.</p><p>Page 9; Lines 201-205:</p><p>“Despite the attenuated migration of pNC expressing the Itga8<sup>kd</sup> construct during the first wave, we did not observe defects in the corneal endothelium. One possibility is that pNC which do not endogenously express Itga8 (Figure 3A), may also contribute to the corneal endothelium albeit at a lower level, but they are able to compensate for the Itga8 knockdown resulting in the formation of a normal endothelial layer.”</p><p>Page 10; Lines 211-214:</p><p>“As indicated in our analysis at E5, it is likely that non-Itga8 expressing pNC may compensate during the second wave of pNC migration, but not to the extent that abrogates the corneal thinning defect, possibly due to the relatively large number of cells required for the formation of the stroma.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) When talking about the range of 70-90 kDa Npnt proteins, it would be useful to state that these are generated by alternate splicing and give a range of aa residues (e.g. 536 to 595aa) to avoid confusion with complex posttranslational modifications.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comment. We agree with the reviewers that the ranges in sizes of the Npnt proteins is generated by alternate splicing. We cited the sizes of Npnt from one of the initial studies that discovered this protein in the mouse (Brandenberger et al., 2001). Interestingly this study only provided two isoforms (561, 578 aa), although currently there are four isoforms of mouse Npnt (561, 578, 592, and 609 aa). To accurately cite the study and provide the range of amino acids, we edited the sentence as indicated below.</p><p>Page 4: lines 82-85:</p><p>“Npnt was discovered as an ECM ligand for integrin a8b1 (a8b1) during mouse kidney development, consisting of 70-90 kDa proteins (Brandenberger et al., 2001) generated by alternate splicing (561 to 609 amino acids).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) At least four additional proteins interacting with NPNT include ESR2, FLT3, insulin and WDR76. Are these genes expressed in the system and what we can learn from their known roles in other systems for corneal cell biology?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their insightful comment that brought attention to the recent publication of the human interactom (Huttlin et al., 2021), which identified 10 proteins that interact with Npnt including ITGA8, <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, CRLF1, ESR2, IGFL1, INS, LY6G5C, TAL1, WDR76, and FLT3. We agree with the reviewers that it would be interesting to explore other proteins that may interact with Npnt in other contexts of corneal development, but in the current study we focused on Npnt/Itga8 and the role of this interaction on pNC migration during early development of the cornea. Nonetheless, we identified from literature searches that among these 10 proteins, <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, ESR2, IGFL1 and INS are expressed in the cornea epithelium.</p><p>Furthermore, our previous RNAseq data (Bi and Lwigale, 2020) indicate that ESR2 and WDR76 are expressed by the pNC and during their differentiation into corneal endothelium and keratocytes. Whereas INS transcripts are upregulated only in the corneal endothelium. We are grateful for this comment and are looking forward to incorporate these proteins in future studies addressing the potential role of Npnt on pNC differentiation and later stages of corneal development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
