used to medicate patients with schizophrenia, but may cause metabolic side effects such as diabetes, which has been considered to result from obesity-associated insulin resistance. Olanzapine is particularly well known for this effect. However, clinical studies have suggested that olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia in certain patients cannot be explained by such a generalized mechanism. Here, we focused on the effects of olanzapine on insulin biosynthesis and secretion by mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells. Olanzapine reduced maturation of proinsulin, and thereby inhibited secretion of insulin; and specifically shifted the primary localization of proinsulin from insulin granules to the endoplasmic reticulum. This was due to olanzapine’s impairment of proper disulfide bond formation in proinsulin, although direct targets of olanzapine remain undetermined. Olanzapine-induced proinsulin misfolding and subsequent decrease also occurred at the mouse level. This mechanism of olanzapine-induced β-cell dysfunction should be considered, together with weight gain, when patients are administered olanzapine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proinsulin</kwd><kwd>misfolding</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18K06216</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ninagawa</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19K06658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ishikawa</surname><given-names>Tokiro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H01432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H06419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mori</surname><given-names>Kazutoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007106</institution-id><institution>Gunma University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#18021 Joint Research Program of the Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ninagawa</surname><given-names>Satoshi</given-names></name><name><surname>Torii</surname><given-names>Seiji</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007449</institution-id><institution>Takeda Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okumura</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005865</institution-id><institution>Mochida Memorial Foundation for Medical and Pharmaceutical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Okumura</surname><given-names>Masaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mechanism identified here that mediates olanzapine-induced b-cell dysfunction should be considered, along with weight gain, in mitigating adverse side effects when patients with schizophrenia are prescribed olanzapine.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Patients with schizophrenia are typically prescribed first- or second-generation antipsychotics (FGAs or SGAs, respectively). FGAs block dopamine signaling in the brain by inhibiting the function of its receptors, resulting in recovery from conditions such as acute mania and agitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Divac et al., 2014</xref>). However, because of excessive inhibition of the dopamine pathway, FGAs can cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including dystonia, akathisia, and Parkinsonism, and are now widely replaced by SGAs due to their reduced risk of causing adverse extrapyramidal effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Høiberg and Nielsen, 2006</xref>) and greater effectiveness in alleviating symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sirota et al., 2006</xref>). These effects of SGAs are caused by their inhibition of signaling through the dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> serotonin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Divac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasper et al., 1999</xref>). Of note, SGAs have higher risks of causing metabolically adverse side effects such as obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gothelf et al., 2002</xref>), dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gothelf et al., 2002</xref>) and diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Citrome and Volavka, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Koller and Doraiswamy, 2002</xref>).</p><p>The SGA olanzapine affects neurotransmitter receptors (called multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotics) and thereby exhibits significantly greater effectiveness in alleviating various symptoms than other SGAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sirota et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">van Bruggen et al., 2003</xref>). However, it carries a higher risk of diabetes than other SGAs such as risperidone, and its frequent use therefore represents a clinical problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deng, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Newcomer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rummel-Kluge et al., 2010</xref>). Generally, olanzapine-induced diabetes is attributed to weight gain caused by increased appetite through the effect on the feeding center via blocking of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor, leading to insulin resistance-mediated development of diabetes.</p><p>Nonetheless, olanzapine-induced diabetes includes atypical cases, as follows. First, while it usually takes years to develop diabetes via insulin resistance, olanzapine-induced diabetes occurs within 6 months after commencing treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinoshita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura and Nagamine, 2010</xref>). Second, discontinuing olanzapine treatment cures diabetes even after the level of HbA1c (a marker for blood glucose level) reaches &gt;10%, a ratio which normally representing an irreversible level in patients with type I or type II diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura and Nagamine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nathan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Young et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, diabetic ketoacidosis, which is caused by insulin hyposecretion, often occurs in patients with type I diabetes, but also rapidly (within 6 months after treatment with olanzapine) affects patients with no diabetic symptoms before medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinoshita et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsuchiyama et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, epidemiological data show that patients receiving olanzapine incur an approximately 10-times higher risk of diabetic ketoacidosis than the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Polcwiartek et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting the possibility that olanzapine directly impairs the function of pancreatic β cells, the exclusive source of insulin, in a speculated few percent of medicated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nagamine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nagamine, 2018</xref>).</p><p>We are interested in the mechanism of the development of olanzapine-induced atypical diabetes from the viewpoint of the protein quality control system operating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Secretory and membrane proteins gain their tertiary and quaternary structures in the ER, which is assisted by ER-localized molecular chaperones, glycosyltransferases and oxidoreductases (collectively referred to here as ER chaperones). Only correctly folded molecules are transported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and then to their destination. However, proteins that fail to fold correctly, even with the assistance of ER chaperones, are retrotranslocated into the cytosol and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Qi et al., 2017</xref>). This disposal system is called ER-associated degradation (ERAD).</p><p>Although eukaryotic cells perform quality control of proteins through ER chaperone-assisted productive folding and ERAD, the requirements for protein synthesis may exceed the protein folding capacity of the ER under physiological and pathological conditions. To counteract such ER stress, namely the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is triggered, leading to the activation of three ER transmembrane sensor proteins PERK, ATF6, and IRE1. Interestingly, their activation effects come out sequentially. First, phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) by activated PERK transiently suppresses translation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) so that the burden of the ER is mitigated because of reduced translocation of newly synthesized proteins into the ER. Next, activated ATF6 upregulates the transcription of ER chaperone genes to increase the folding capacity of the ER. Subsequently, activated IRE1 together with activated ATF6 upregulates the transcription of ERAD component genes, which increases degradation capacity. If ER stress is prolonged, apoptotic signaling is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mori, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tabas and Ron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Effect of olanzapine on secretion of insulin from MIN6 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of protein quality control in the ER, PERK-mediated translational attenuation, and storage and secretion of insulin (see Introduction). GSK2656157 inhibits protein kinase activity of PERK.

After culture in a medium containing 25 mM glucose, MIN6 cells were starved for 1 hr in medium containing 3 mM glucose (Stav), and then cultured in medium containing 25 mM glucose (Stim or 3 mM glucose as control). The amount of insulin secreted into the medium during the 1 hr incubation was determined using an ELISA.

(<bold>E</bold>) Schematic representation of the signaling cascade for insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulation. Cells intake glucose (①). Glucose metabolism (②) triggers an increase in cellular ATP/ADP ratio (③), which inhibits K<sup>+</sup> channels and induces depolarization (④). This leads to opening of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (⑤) and increased influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (⑥), inducing the fusion of insulin granules to the plasma membrane for secretion (⑦). Mastoparan (Mast) enhances insulin secretion by increasing the intracellular concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> independently of glucose intake. (<bold>F</bold>) MIN6 cells were pretreated with 50 μM olanzapine or risperidone for 14 hr before glucose starvation as shown in (<bold>B</bold>). Mastoparan (Mast, 20 μM) was added at the time of glucose stimulation to aliquots of cells not pretreated or pretreated with 50 μM olanzapine for 14 hr.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60970-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Pancreatic β cells synthesize preproinsulin, fold proinsulin in the ER, and store large quantities of insulin in insulin granules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In these roles, they are frequently subject to ER stress, and the UPR accordingly plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis. Immediate translational control mediated by the PERK pathway, rather than time-consuming transcriptional control of ER chaperones etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoshida et al., 2003</xref>), is particularly important for the folding of proinsulin, a very small molecule compared with ER chaperones; when translation is generally attenuated by the activation of PERK, stochastically unfolded or misfolded proinsulin can be efficiently refolded by the action of preexisting ER chaperones. If PERK is not active, synthesis of misfolded proinsulin continues, leading to proteotoxicity-mediated apoptosis of β cells. Accordingly, PERK knockout mice develop diabetes after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 2001</xref>). Further, PERK mutation causes human Wolcott-Rallison syndrome, which induces diabetes in infancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delépine et al., 2000</xref>). We previously found that olanzapine induces mild ER stress in hamster pancreatic β-cell line HIT-T15, which secretes insulin. However, phosphorylation of eIF2α is not elevated despite mild activation of PERK in olanzapine-treated HIT-T15 cells, leading to sustained protein synthesis followed by induction of apoptosis, although we used olanzapine at the concentration of 100 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozasa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also previously found that olanzapine markedly inhibits insulin secretion by HIT-T15 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozasa et al., 2013</xref>).

We then investigated the stage of protein quality control at which insulin secretion is blocked in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells, and then whether the identified stage is indeed compromised in islets of mice after daily oral administration of olanzapine.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Inhibition of insulin secretion in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells</title><p>MIN6 cells exhibit an approximately 7-fold increase in insulin secretion in 2 hr when the extracellular glucose concentration is increased from 5 to 25 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ishihara et al., 1993</xref>).

For this purpose, we used the mouse pancreatic β−cell line MIN6 to show that olanzapine produced aberrantly disulfide-bonded proinsulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and caused retention of misfolded proinsulin in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) which then underwent ERAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Inhibition of insulin secretion as well as proinsulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B</xref>) and retention of misfolded proinsulin in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) was observed in MIN6 cells treated with 10 μM olanzapine, which is comparable with concentrations of olanzapine in patients sera (0.016–0.24 µM) and in postmortem serum (0.032–16 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Robertson and McMullin, 2000</xref>), as well as with the observation that olanzapine concentrations in tissues are 4- to 46-fold higher than those in the plasma of rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aravagiri et al., 1999</xref>). It should be noted that olanzapine-induced apoptosis was not previously observed in MIN6 cells or in the hamster pancreatic β−cell line HIT-T15 treated with 10 μM olanzapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozasa et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that olanzapine-induced misfolding of proinsulin is an early event which evokes ER stress in pancreatic β cells.</p><p>Importantly, olanzapine-induced misfolding of proinsulin, which is targeted to ERAD, also occurred when mouse islets were treated with olanzapine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–D</xref>). Furthermore, misfolding of proinsulin was induced in mouse islets after daily oral administration of 3 mg/kg/day olanzapine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E and F</xref>). Patients usually take 10–20 mg olanzapine a day (0.17–0.33 mg/kg assuming 60 kg as body weight), which may correspond to 2.0–4.0 mg/kg in mice, if the difference in body surface areas is considered (multiply by 12.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nair and Jacob, 2016</xref>). This mechanism can explain why certain patients rapidly develop diabetes as well as diabetic ketoacidosis after receiving olanzapine, without gaining weight, and why such patients recover when olanzapine is discontinued.</p><p>In this connection, Peter Arvan and colleagues recently showed that aberrantly disulfide-bonded proinsulin dimers and higher ladder complexes (trimer, tetramer, pentamer, ---) exist in rat pancreatic β-cell-derived INS1E cells as well as in mouse and human islets, and that the levels of these misfolded forms of proinsulin were markedly increased and instead the level of insulin was markedly decreased in islets of leptin receptor mutant LepR<sup>db/db</sup> mice, a mouse model of diabetes, compared with islets of wild-type mice, before the onset of diabetes. They therefore proposed that proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arunagiri et al., 2019</xref>). The levels of these misfolded forms of proinsulin were dramatically increased after treatment of INS1E cells and islets of mouse and human with 2 μM GSK2656157, a potent PERK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkins et al., 2013</xref>), for 20 hr and overnight, respectively, but not for 5 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arunagiri et al., 2019</xref>), supporting the importance of the PERK branch of the UPR for maintenance of homeostasis of β cells, as described in the Introduction.</p><p>We confirmed the much more profound misfolding of proinsulin after treatment of mouse islets for 20 hr with 2 μM GSK2656157 than with 10 μM olanzapine, which was observed even under reducing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>; depicted by $, and data not shown). Interestingly, however, production of HMPs was observed after treatment of mouse islets for 20 hr with 10 μM olanzapine but not with 2 μM GSK2656157 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), and a ladder of HMPs bigger than HMP-1 was observed more clearly in mouse islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) than in MIN6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This rapidity and broad extensiveness of olanzapine’s action on the folding status of proinsulin in mouse islets suggests that β-cell dysfunction may infrequently dominate and diabetes might develop without weight gain or insulin resistance in the minority of patients with potentially lower catabolism of olanzapine or by other unidentified factors. For example, it is known that olanzapine is catabolized by the action of cytochrome p450 (CPY) 1A2 and polymorphic CPY2D6 in the liver and that the induction of CPY1A2 by smoking significantly diminishes the concentration of olanzapine in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrillo et al., 2003</xref>); as hospitalized patients cannot smoke, the concentration of olanzapine may be elevated in plasma and possibly in β cells of ex-smokers. The clearance of olanzapine also appears to vary by race, sex and age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meibohm et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Correct formation of three intramolecular disulfide bonds is essential for insulin folding and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haataja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2003</xref>), which may be difficult even in unstressed cells. A part of newly synthesized proinsulin is therefore constitutively degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We show that treatment with olanzapine markedly inhibited maturation and secretion of proinsulin, and instead induced aberrant disulfide bond-formation during the folding of proinsulin, leading to the formation of HMP-1 and HMP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), although we could not detect direct interaction between olanzapine and oxidoreductases in the ER by ITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Proinsulin in Akita mice with the <italic>Ins2</italic> C96Y mutation fails to form the correct disulfide bonds, and is degraded by ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">He et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ron, 2002</xref>).

Similarly, olanzapine-induced HMP-1 and HMP-2 may be recognized by Grp170 for targeting to ERAD as well.

The heats of dilution were subtracted from the raw binding data before analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Expression and purification of human proinsulin</title><p>Recombinant human proinsulin was expressed as inclusion bodies in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> cells. Purification of proinsulin was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okumura et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, inclusion bodies were treated with 100 mM Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 8 M urea and 10 mM DTT, and the solution was stood for 3 hr at 50°C. Reduced and denatured proinsulin was purified by RP-HPLC using Cosmosil 5C<sub>18</sub>-AR-II (4.6 mm I.D. ×250 mm, Nacalai Tesque) monitored at 220 nm. Molecular mass of purified proinsulin was calculated using ProteinProspectors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm">http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm</ext-link>) and its identity was confirmed by MALDI-TOF/MS. Purified proinsulin was lyophilized at −80°C until used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Animals</title><p>Male BALB/c mice (8 weeks old) were purchased from Shimizu Laboratory Supplies. All mouse experiments were conducted under pathogen-free conditions and in line with Institutional Animal Care protocols approved by Kyoto University (Q 19–68). Administration of vehicle or olanzapine was conducted using a reusable oral gavage needle once a day. Olanzapine was dissolved in 1% acetic acid in saline buffered with 1M NaOH to a pH &gt;5.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCormick et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Isolation of mouse pancreatic islets</title><p>To isolate islets from BALB/c mice, pancreas was inflated by injection of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) containing 0.15 mg/ml collagenase P (Roche Diagnostics) via the common bile duct. Distended pancreas was then excised and incubated at 37°C for 18 min. After digested pancreas had dissociated, the tissue was washed with HBSS twice. The islets in the dissociated pancreatic tissue were purified on discontinuous gradients (1.110, 1.103, 1.096, and 1.070 g/ml) of OptiPrep (Axis-Shield) and ET Kyoto (ETK) solution (Otsuka Pharmaceutical). Isolated islets were cultured (37°C/5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air humidified atmosphere) in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This analysis of the effect of the anti-psychotic olanzapine on misfolding and secretion of pro-insulin suggests a framework for understanding how such treatments might trigger rapid onset diabetes in patients. The authors elegantly show that olanzapine treatment alters the processing of pro-insulin such that an aggregation-prone intermediate accumulates, which is recalcitrant to secretion and thus accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. This has important implications for protein folding, secretion and ER stress in patients and provides a foundation for understanding the molecular basis by which this drug impacts protein folding.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Antipsychotic olanzapine targets proinsulin for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation by inducing its misfolding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Elizabeth A Miller as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Although there was enthusiasm for the research topic and the potential importance for human health, reviewers voiced significant concerns about the model systems. In particular, there was agreement that choice of the model is insufficient to support the claims with respect to disease/therapeutic relevance. Both reviewers 2 and 3 raised the problem of the lack of detection of insulin as a major concern, and had some suggestions regarding overcoming the different antibody specificity that might be helpful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall, this work provides strong evidence that OLA indirectly impairs insulin secretion by perturbing disulfide bond formation or rearrangement, thereby rendering pro-insulin trapped in the ER and subject to ERAD. This provides a nice explanation for physiological observations of diabetes induction in patients treated with this anti-psychotic medication and is therefore of general interest. However, whether the observed effects are direct or indirect remains to be clarified, which seems essential to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>I have several specific concerns:</p><p>1) The quality of the immunofluorescence images is not particularly good.</p><p>2) A second disulfide-containing substrate should be investigated to show broad effects versus insulin-specific effects.</p><p>3) The activity of PDI should be assessed by proteomic analysis to test whether it is also forming mixed disulfides in a more promiscuous way, or if it is defective and thus the likely target of OLA.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) This paper wishes to address diabetes caused by olanzapine but there are no studies from drug-treated human or animal islets, which is a missed opportunity. Without islet work, the cell culture analysis really should be deeply insightful. In their previous publication they suggested that olanzapine blocks PERK action on eIF2α and &quot;apoptosis was induced by olanzapine at the concentration of more than 50 μM&quot; but neither PERK nor apoptosis appears in the current manuscript. In this manuscript, the authors show data suggesting that olanzapine does not bind proinsulin. So what is the primary drug target in β cells? It seems that most of what are measured in this manuscript are secondary effects of the drug without clarifying the primary effect. And, based on their previous paper, are the observed effects occurring in dying cells?</p><p>2) Figure 2B Figure legend says that the 26 ng of proinsulin run next to 2.9 micrograms of purified insulin, were subject to immunoblotting. The Results section concluded: &quot;this antibody was more reactive with purified recombinant human proinsulin than purified recombinant human insulin&quot;. But no information is provided on whether the SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing or non-reducing conditions (the specific antibody also should be cited). It is essential that both conditions be shown in Figure 2B. Under reducing conditions, the band shown in the figure would not be insulin but one of the insulin chains split apart from insulin. If the immunoreactivity is much stronger with intact (non-reduced) insulin – then this might require significant re-interpretation of data within this manuscript – see below.</p><p>3) Figure 6C nonreducing gel shows three bands in all lanes in the region labeled as Proinsulin.

There is a simple question – do the untreated control β cells used in this study have any insulin? If not, is this a suitable β cell model?

It is troubling if the authors cannot distinguish a &quot;processed form&quot; (label on Figure 2) from &quot;partially degraded proinsulin&quot; (subsection “Inhibition of insulin secretion and retention of proinsulin in the ER in olanzapine-treated cells”). Is this an artifact of the cell line?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> by Mori and colleagues reports on a potential molecular mechanism that may lead to metabolic disease in individuals taking second generation antipsychotics, such as olanzapine. A previous conjecture was that the drug increased appetite as a result of its effect on serotonin receptors, ultimately leading to diabetes. However, data in this paper potentially indicate why a more immediate effect on diabetic syndrome is evident, uncover why olanzapine led to mild UPR/PERK activation in a prior study, and identify a putative underlying cause of this more rapid effect.</p><p>The authors first report that olanzapine shuts-down the levels of secreted insulin in a murine insulinoma cell model in a dose-dependent manner, and that the drug blunts the level of secreted proinsulin in a pulse-chase analysis. The production/secretion of two other trafficked proteins were unaffected. Olanzapine also altered the steady-state localization of proinsulin, leading to its residence in the ER instead of in secretory granules. Consistent with these data as well as the effect of the drug on the UPR, ERAD-targeting of proinsulin increased under the conditions used in these experiments. In addition, the use of non-reducing gels indicated that olanzapine administration led to the presence of a high molecular weight species that was primarily composed of proinsulin dimers and trimers, and it was the &quot;HMI-1&quot; form that was mostly degraded via the ERAD pathway.</p><p>While the experiments support the idea that olanzapine triggers the ERAD of proinsulin, resulting in lower circulating levels and potentially in metabolic syndrome, there are numerous caveats of the study as it currently stands. These are outlined below. In addition, only one cell line was used and the relevance to human physiology is questionable for several reasons, which are also outlined below. Finally, the mechanism by which olanzapine affects the ER redox balance and leads to proinsulin misfolding is completely mysterious. In short, the manuscript only hints at the major conclusions claimed by the authors.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) What is the justification for using MIN6 cells, other than the use of a convenient antibody for pulse-chase studies (Figure 2C)? These cells actually lose glucose-sensitive insulin secretion over time. There is also no justification of why 25 mM glucose was administered in the MIN6 cell experiments. This concentration is well beyond what might be encountered in vivo after feeding.</p><p>2) Similar to the concerns raised above, drugs were apparently administered for 14 hours for steady state studies and 4 hours for the pulse-chase. What are the pharmacodynamics of the drug in the body, and in patients what is the actually effective concentration that is &quot;seen&quot; by β cells? How much of the drug is protein-bound? This knowledge is vital as only small percentages of drug are &quot;free&quot; in sera. Moreover, the authors claim that patient sera harbors 0.016 – 0.24 μm olanzapine, which is still far below the doses used here. They also claim that this may be negated by patients with &quot;lower catabolism&quot;. Which cytP450s are used to metabolize the drug, and is there any evidence that this varies in patients? Overall, it is not clear whether the concentrations and conditions used in these experiments is physiologically relevant.</p><p>3) The inability to detect insulin production in the pulse-chase is problematic (Figure 2D). However, a pseudo pulse-chase could be performed by brief starvation, medium removal/wash, followed by a glucose pulse, addition of CHX, and subsequent ELISA for insulin in the medium. Therefore, insulin secretion could be directly detected over time, which is essential to show.</p><p>4) Does an amino acid starvation period in a pulse-chase assay impact insulin production/secretion?</p><p>5) The fluorescence images are of low quality (Figure 4) and the reticular network of the ER is not apparent.</p><p>6) Does combined administration of BFA and ± olanzapine also show increased ERAD of proinsulin? This would prevent the confounding variable of having to take secretion efficiency into account. More trivially, why are the data in Figure 5D presented first?</p><p>7) While the authors focus on the &quot;HMI&quot; species, the drug also increases the amount of protein &gt;38 kDa. In fact, this species is more prevalent than the HMI forms and may reflect aggregated species (Figure 6C). Indeed, these species may or may not also be targeted for ERAD (molecular weight markers were not included in Figure 8B).</p><p>8) The authors state that the experiment in Figure 8 was &quot;more reliable&quot; under the conditions of &quot;these conditions&quot;. If so, then the magnitude of the olanzapine effect on the ERAD of proinsulin (±MG132) in Figure 8B, bottom, is quite modest, especially given some of the caveats noted above.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The antipsychotic olanzapine-induced misfolding and ERAD of proinsulin accounts for atypical development of diabetes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Elizabeth A Miller as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. After discussion among the reviewers and senior editor, we agreed that your study provides some thought-provoking new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which diabetes may arise rapidly after onset of patient treatment with olanzapine. That said, there was agreement among reviewers that some of the claims should be toned down, and you should state more clearly the limitations and caveats. Most importantly, the focus on ERAD (including in the title) was considered unwarranted. There was concern about the extent to which ERAD can account for the observed phenotypes, as well as the problem that MG132 treatment does not rescue secretion even if degradation is blocked. Therefore, ERAD is unlikely to explain insulin secretion defect, although reduced insulin secretion could partially explain the ERAD (this was the point of the BFA experiment suggested by Reviewer 3 in the original evaluation). ERAD should thus be appropriately de-emphasized as a driving mechanism. The other over-riding concern was about the concentrations of olanzapine that might accrue in patient cells. Of course, such measures are difficult to make, but by our estimates the effective concentration in your in vitro proinsulin folding experiment is at more than an order of magnitude higher than could possibly be achieved in patient tissue. Thus, the experiment shown in Figure 8C is particularly problematic, where a very high level of drug is required to see a quite subtle in vitro effect. The reviewers agreed that these data muddy the waters and should be removed. Thus, the ultimate conclusion is that although the mechanism of action remains unclear, your findings still provide insight into proinsulin misfolding as a potential side-effect of olanzapine treatment. You should be more careful in claiming a direct mechanism since that is not supported by the data shown.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this revised version, the authors have added another antibody to establish the secretion of pro-insulin and insulin in their cell model, but many of the key experiments are all still only performed with the original antibody that doesn't recognise insulin. Thus, the primary concern (expressed by both other reviewers) that the precursor-product relationship cannot be established, has not been fully resolved. My interpretation of the data is that OLA treatment prevents the production of the P' (&quot;processed proinsulin&quot;) form, but it was hard for me to know exactly what the P' protein corresponds to. One interpretation is that P' is aggregation prone (to yield the HMP products) and subject to ERAD. So, I suspect that most of the conclusions are correct but greater clarity is needed regarding the P' protein (what it is and how it changes with OLA treatment). This should therefore be quantified in all of the pulse-chase experiments presented (it is currently missing from many). The full precursor-product analysis requested in the original critique would go a long way to clarifying this.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript submitted to <italic>eLife</italic>, Mori and colleagues have added new data and models, and have addressed many of the comments that previously precluded publication. A better characterization of the antibodies, the inclusion of data with islets and other (unaffected) substrates, an effect with lower doses of olanzapine, and improved fluorescence images further support the authors' earlier conclusions. However, there is still the question of whether the effect of the drug is direct or indirect. An attempt to show interaction with PDIs, which was a long-shot, provided negative data (also see below), and even at the lower concentration of 10 uM, this value is still ~40x higher than serum levels in humans taking the drug. It is likely that the intracellular concentration in patients is even lower, given considerations regarding logP and the free vs bound population of the drug. Two reviewers also expressed doubt that ERAD targeting was a major contributor to reduced levels of pro-insulin. With the exception of a modest effect of MG132, there are no further supporting data. Therefore, the title and statements such as &quot;indicating that a part of newly synthesized proinsulin is constitutively subjected to ERAD&quot; are premature. In fact, it was surprising that a putative effect of MG132 in the islets was not examined, especially since &quot;the level of proinsulin was markedly decreased 20 hours after incubation with 5 μm and 10 μm olanzapine&quot;. Moreover, a previous comment to determine whether enhanced ERAD targeting might be apparent when ER protein export is inhibited (for, example, with BFA or dominant negative SAR1) was completely misinterpreted by the authors in the rebuttal, who replied &quot;We have not used BFA in this manuscript&quot;.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments using ITC are problematic. 1 mM olanzapine was used, so any acquired data may be irrelevant to the results in cells or rodents.

Does 1 mM risperidone also have the same, subtle effect?</p><p>In the experiments using mice in which there is an increase in the amount of HMP-1, there is similarly no control for olanzapine.

(Another reviewer commented on the prolonged passage of these cells and whether they truly reflect islet biology.) More mundane, the statement &quot;Intracellular localization of A1PI was not affected…&quot; is not clear. Do the authors mean that secretion was unaffected? Finally, what is the significance of using the anti-KDEL antibody. This is mentioned in the absence of any context.</p><p>The labeling of lanes/times in Figure 2E and Figure 3B needs to be fixed, and the labeling/spacing at the top of Figure 10A-C is odd.</p><p>In the Discussion section, the authors state, &quot;olanzapine produced aberrantly disulfide-bonded proinsulin….leading to β-cell dysfunction&quot;.

But no information is provided on whether the SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing or non-reducing conditions (the specific antibody also should be cited). It is essential that both conditions be shown in Figure 2B. Under reducing conditions, the band shown in the figure would not be insulin but one of the insulin chains split apart from insulin.

The full precursor-product analysis requested in the original critique would go a long way to clarifying this.</p></disp-quote><p>The precursor-product relationship for proinsulin 2 and insulin 2 was already and clearly shown by pulse (20 minutes)-chase experiment using I2018 (Figure 3E and Figure 4B, lanes 15-18). We have added that “This also demonstrated the precursor-product relationship for proinsulin 2 and insulin 2 in MIN6 cells” (subsection “Retention of proinsulin in the ER in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells”). We have also shown that olanzapine did not alter the localization of insulin (Figure 8A and 8B), allowing us to focus on the behavior of proinsulin in olanzapine-treated cells.</p><p>We have now shown the precursor-product relationship for proinsulin 2 and processed proinsulin 2 by conducting shorter pulse (3 min)-chase experiments using #8138 (Figure 3C).</p><p>We have noted that “The lower band was considered to be processed proinsulin 2, such as the B chain connected to the C peptide but not to the A chain as observed in isolated rat islets (Harding et al., 2012), or somewhat cleaved proinsulin, because only proinsulin 2 was detected after a shorter pulse (3minutes) and processed proinsulin 2 appeared after the 30-minutes chase (Figure 3C)” (subsection “Retention of proinsulin in the ER in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells”).</p><p>We believe that processed proinsulin is unlikely to be aggregation prone (to yield the HMP products) because it was secreted (Figure 3B) and that it is likely to be produced around the Golgi apparatus because the level of processed proinsulin was markedly decreased by treatment with brefeldin A (Figure 3D). Our explanation for why OLA treatment prevents the production of processed proinsulin is that OLA treatment induced misfolding of proinsulun and retention of misfolded proinsulin in the ER.</p><p>We have noted that “Processed proinsulin 2 is likely to be produced after moving out from the ER, because its level was markedly decreased by treatment with brefeldin A, an inhibitor of anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (Figure 3D)” (subsection “Retention of proinsulin in the ER in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the revised manuscript submitted to eLife, Mori and colleagues have added new data and models, and have addressed many of the comments that previously precluded publication. A better characterization of the antibodies, the inclusion of data with islets and other (unaffected) substrates, an effect with lower doses of olanzapine, and improved fluorescence images further support the authors' earlier conclusions. However, there is still the question of whether the effect of the drug is direct or indirect. An attempt to show interaction with PDIs, which was a long-shot, provided negative data (also see below), and even at the lower concentration of 10 uM, this value is still ~40x higher than serum levels in humans taking the drug. It is likely that the intracellular concentration in patients is even lower, given considerations regarding logP and the free vs bound population of the drug.</p></disp-quote><p>We would draw your attention to the finding that daily oral administration of olanzapine produced HMP-1 and even higher molecular weight forms of proinsulin in mouse islets (Figure 10E-F), albeit that we could not determine the concentration of olanzapine in serum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two reviewers also expressed doubt that ERAD targeting was a major contributor to reduced levels of pro-insulin. With the exception of a modest effect of MG132, there are no further supporting data. Therefore, the title and statements such as &quot;indicating that a part of newly synthesized proinsulin is constitutively subjected to ERAD&quot; are premature.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the word “ERAD” from the title.</p><p>We consider that the increase in the level of intracellular proinsulin in MIN6 cells treated with both olanzapine and MG132 over that in MIN6 cells treated with olanzapine alone is marked (Figure 5D, right top panel). Instead of toning this down, we have added that “Nonetheless, ERAD of retained proinsulin alone cannot explain olanzapine-induced blockage of proinsulin secretion, because proinsulin secretion was still blocked in MIN6 cells treated with both olanzapine and MG132 (Figure 5D, right bottom panel), in contrary to the case with control cells (Figure 5D, left bottom panel)” (subsection “Induction of proinsulin misfolding in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In fact, it was surprising that a putative effect of MG132 in the islets was not examined, especially since &quot;the level of proinsulin was markedly decreased 20 hours after incubation with 5 μm and 10 μm olanzapine&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now shown this effect and added that “Reducing SDS-PAGE analysis followed by immunoblotting showed that the level of proinsulin was decreased 4 hours after incubation with 50 µM olanzapine (Figure 10A) and that this decrease was blocked by the addition of 30 µM MG132 from 1 hour earlier (total 5 hours) (Figure 10D)” (subsection “ERAD of misfolded proinsulin in olanzapine-treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets”).</p><p>We have avoided the use of MG132 for 20 hours, considering its toxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, a previous comment to determine whether enhanced ERAD targeting might be apparent when ER protein export is inhibited (for, example, with BFA or dominant negative SAR1) was completely misinterpreted by the authors in the rebuttal, who replied &quot;We have not used BFA in this manuscript&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for our insufficient explanation. We tried to examine the effect of combined administration of brefeldin A and ± olanzapine on ERAD of proinsulin. To this end, we must treat MIN6 cells with (1) none, (2) olanzapine, (3) brefeldin A, (4) olanzapine and brefeldin, and (5) olanzapine, brefeldin A and MG132. During this experiment, we found that brefeldin A is quite toxic to MIN6 cells. In most cases, when MIN6 cells were treated with brefeldin A for longer periods, a lower amount of radioisotope was incorporated into proteins, as shown below. We thought that it is difficult to obtain meaningful results with this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The experiments using ITC are problematic. 1 mM olanzapine was used, so any acquired data may be irrelevant to the results in cells or rodents.
