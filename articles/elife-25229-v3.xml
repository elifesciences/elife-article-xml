pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25229.001</object-id><p>Nonribosomal peptides represent a large class of metabolites with pharmaceutical relevance. Pteridines, such as pterins, folates, and flavins, are heterocyclic metabolites that often serve as redox-active cofactors. The biosynthetic machineries for construction of these distinct classes of small molecules operate independently in the cell. Here, we discovered an unprecedented nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase hybrid biosynthetic gene cluster in <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> using genome synteny analysis. <italic>P. luminescens</italic> is a Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes phenotypic variation and can have both pathogenic and mutualistic roles. Through extensive gene deletion, pathway-targeted molecular networking, quantitative proteomic analysis, and NMR, we show that the genetic locus affects the regulation of quorum sensing and secondary metabolic enzymes and encodes new pteridine metabolites functionalized with <italic>cis</italic>-amide acyl-side chains, termed pepteridine A (<bold>1</bold>) and B (<bold>2</bold>). The pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic phenotypic variant and represent the first reported metabolites to be synthesized by a hybrid NRPS-pteridine pathway. These studies expand our view of the combinatorial biosynthetic potential available in bacteria.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25229.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25229.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25229.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria produce small molecules that can be used as a basis for developing new drugs. The instructions for the pathways that make these molecules are stored in the genome – the complete set of genetic material – of the bacteria. With the advancements in genome sequencing over the last decade, these instructions are becoming much more readily available in sequence databases. “Genome mining” is a strategy that involves searching these databases to identify unknown biochemical pathways and help to characterize them. This strategy could help us to discover many more ecologically and medically relevant molecules.</p><p>A bacterium called <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> produces many antibiotics and other molecules that play a variety of roles in the bacterium’s lifecycle. The bacteria live in the gut of roundworms, and the two species have a mutually beneficial relationship where they help each other to acquire food. However, the bacteria are less friendly to the insects that the roundworms infect. When <italic>P. luminescens</italic> is released into the body of an insect, it takes on a disease-causing form and releases toxic molecules that kill the insect.</p><p>Park, Perez et al. have now used genome mining to identify a biochemical pathway in <italic>P. luminescens</italic> that combines the pathways used to create two different types of small molecules produced by the bacteria. This “hybrid” pathway produces a new set of molecules – called pepteridines – that are released by the disease-causing form of the bacteria.</p><p>Park, Perez et al. also identified a regulator protein that controls the hybrid pathway. This regulator is known to help the bacteria to change into the form that kills insects. The pathway also affects the production of proteins known to be involved in “quorum sensing”. In this process, bacteria use a diverse set of chemical signals to report how many other bacteria are nearby, which enables the bacteria to launch coordinated biological responses – for example, releasing toxic molecules – when their numbers are great enough.</p><p>In the future, further experiments will be pursued to rigorously characterize how the components of the new hybrid pathway work together. While the hybrid pathway responsible for the production of the pepteridines serves as one example of the utility of genome mining, there is still much room for further discovery. Applying a similar strategy to different organisms has the potential to uncover other pathways of biomedical relevance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25229.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25229.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>natural products</kwd><kwd>biosynthesis</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd><italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Chemistry Biology Interface Training, 5T32GM067543-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>Corey E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1122492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barber</surname><given-names>Karl W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM117230</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rinehart</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Searle Scholars</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-SSP-210</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRR 39-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-GM097096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2-CA186575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Crawford</surname><given-names>Jason M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new type of hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like-pteridine synthase biosynthetic pathway has been illuminated via genome mining.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nonribosomal peptides are a structurally and functionally privileged class of natural products constructed from a highly diverse pool of potential proteinogenic and nonproteinogenic amino acid building blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Walsh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Walsh, 2016</xref>). Members of the family include well-known pharmacologically relevant agents, such as vancomycin, daptomycin, penicillin, cyclosprin, and many others. The core catalytic domains of a minimal nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) extender module include condensation (C), adenylation (A), and peptidyl-carrier protein (PCP, a.k.a., thiolation, T) domains. The NRPS first selects its cognate amino acid from the available substrate pool, a step controlled by the selectivity of the A domain, activates it as an aminoacyl adenylate, and subsequently loads it onto the PCP domain. The C domain then typically catalyzes the formation of a <italic>trans</italic>-amide bond establishing individual peptide backbone linkages through nucleophilic attack of the free amino group present on a downstream aminoacyl-PCP on the upstream peptidyl-PCP. NRPSs can also engage in ‘hybrid’ pathways to dramatically expand their biocatalytic capabilities. Of note are the NRPS-polyketide synthase (PKS) hybrid pathways, which produce important molecules, including rapamycin, bleomycin, epothilone, colibactin, and others.</p><p>In contrast to the ‘assembly line’ logic of the majority of NRPSs, pteridines, such as the cofactors biopterin and folate, are derived from guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown, 2006</xref>). Pteridines are composed of fused pyrimidine and pyrazine rings, and natural pteridines are typically functionalized at the C-6 position of the pteridine core (<italic>vide infra</italic>). The electronic properties of this scaffold underlie its role in redox active cofactors critical to a host of metabolic transformations, such as hydroxylation of aromatic compounds and generation of the neurotransmitter nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Groehn et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, functionalized pteridines serve as reactants in a number of one-carbon group transfer reactions in metabolism and, more recently, were implicated in catalysis of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition-mediated decarboxylation reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Payne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">White et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The increase in genomic sequence information from diverse microbial sources has highlighted enormous untapped metabolic potential for discovery of novel nonribosomal peptides and pteridines among other metabolite groups, including groups synthesized by new enzyme classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimermancic et al., 2014</xref>). As a result of horizontal gene transfer events during evolution, it is known that the bacterial secondary metabolic pathways encoding many of these metabolites often reside on genomic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shankar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Penn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ziemert et al., 2014</xref>). Genome synteny analyses platforms enable <italic>in silico</italic> visualization of co-localized genetic loci among phylogenetically related organisms and represent general tools to aid in identifying genomic islands. We have previously used genome synteny analysis to aid in identification of ‘atypical pathways’ and to determine the biocatalytic functions of hypothetical proteins located on genomic islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guo and Crawford, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vizcaino et al., 2014b</xref>). Here, we employ genome synteny analysis to identify a genomic island in the entomopathogen <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> TT01 harboring an unprecedented combination of nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS)-like and pteridine synthase biosynthetic machineries, suggesting a novel type of hybrid pathway. We demonstrate that this pathway encodes new metabolites dependent on the hybrid enzymatic machinery, the pepteridines. <italic>P. luminescens</italic> is a Gram-negative Gammaproteobacterium that undergoes stochastic phenotypic variation, and through the use of genetically ‘locked’ variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Somvanshi et al., 2012</xref>), we show that the pepteridines are produced in a specific variant associated with pathogenesis. Allelic-exchange mutagenesis in <italic>P. luminescens</italic> and comparative quantitative proteomic analysis further reveal that the genetic locus affects production of several groups of proteins related to the biosynthesis of known quorum sensing and secondary metabolite systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genome synteny illuminates a hybrid NRPS-pteridine genomic island</title><p><italic>P. luminescens</italic> is a Gammaproteobacterium mutualistically associated with nematodes, and the pair prey on insect larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Waterfield et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>P. luminescens</italic> produces an assortment of bioactive molecules and antibiotics to regulate its mutualistic and pathogenic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vizcaino et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Challinor and Bode, 2015</xref>). Consequently, this genus, which includes one human pathogen, rivals the <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus in terms of the number of secondary metabolic pathways in a given genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchaud et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tobias et al., 2016</xref>). Using the MicroScope bioinformatics platform, we identified a genomic island (<italic>plu2792-plu2799</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), harboring mixed NRPS-pteridine synthase machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Protein sequence homology analysis demonstrated predicted pteridine biosynthetic enzymes, such as GTP cyclohydrolase (GTPCH) Ι, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, pteridine reductase, and pteridine pyrophosphokinase. Interestingly, a NRPS carrier protein (thiolation domain, T) and a condensation domain (C) were genetically fused to a pyruvate dehydrogenase E2-like subunit (<italic>plu2796</italic>). The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (E1, E2, and E3 subunits) is a well-studied set of enzymes that converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Patel and Roche, 1990</xref>), serving as a key metabolic bridge between glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. A complementary E1-like subunit is also encoded in the pathway. This pathway was not detected by early versions of the antiSMASH algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blin et al., 2013</xref>) used for identifying the biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites; however, recent integration of the ClusterFinder algorithm which aids in identifying divergent biosynthetic gene clusters of unknown classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cimermancic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Weber et al., 2015</xref>) allowed detection of part of the pathway (<italic>plu2796-plu2798</italic>) as a likely pathway of secondary metabolic enzymes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25229.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The pepteridine biosynthetic locus.</title><p>Green, pteridine synthesis genes; Blue, pyruvate dehydrogenase-like genes; Red, NRPS-like genes.

Relative to the control vector, we identified 224 molecular features in butanol extracts that were dependent on the presence of the wild-type pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). These include small molecules that are encoded by the pathway, shunt metabolites emerging from the pathway, and host metabolites that are enhanced by the pathway from an undetectable to a statistically significant level. Of these, 114 were dependent on the GTPCH Ι homolog, Plu2793, which is predicted to convert GTP to 7,8-dihydroneopterin triphosphate, initiating pteridine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burg and Brown, 1968</xref>). The predicted functional redundancy with primary metabolic enzymes is expected to account for the larger number of metabolic perturbations observed for <italic>plu2793</italic>. Thirty-seven molecular features were dependent on the atypical dehydrogenase E2-NRPS fusion enzyme, Plu2796, and only 12 were dependent on both.

Molecular networking is a powerful approach to network molecules based on tandem MS fragmentation similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Watrous et al., 2012</xref>). Pathway-targeted molecular networking focuses on networking of metabolites dependent on the presence of a functional pathway (e.g., wild-type versus a secondary metabolic pathway mutant). By assessing and mapping the relative production levels of the metabolites onto the larger wild-type pepteridine network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>), we could visualize how individual genetic mutations affect overall metabolite distributions at a systems level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). White nodes represent metabolites abolished in a given mutant strain, thereby dramatically focusing metabolite discovery efforts. Some deletions led to a decrease in, rather than complete abolishment of, select molecular feature production, indicating that substantial metabolic crosstalk occurs between this specific hybrid secondary metabolic pathway and primary metabolism. With the observed crosstalk, we focused our structural characterization efforts on the smaller number of molecular features that were dependent on the atypical E2-NRPS machinery. We also included pterin (<bold>4</bold>, green node in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as a standard in our network generation to aid in defining metabolites possessing pteridine structural scaffolds. Through this analysis, two prominent metabolites were selected for NMR-based structural characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25229.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Relative abundances of wild-type pathway-dependent metabolites in wild-type and mutant pepteridine pathways.</title><p>The average ionization intensity is depicted for each molecular feature under a given genetic condition (wild-type and Δ<italic>plu2793</italic> through Δ<italic>plu2799</italic>).

Although a much lower yield was observed, the isolation was streamlined in the absence of amino acid supplements. The clarified medium was lyophilized, and the dried residue was extracted with 50% aqueous methanol (2 l). Flash column chromatography (C<sub>18</sub>) followed by several rounds of reverse-phase liquid chromatography separation led to isolation of pure compounds <bold>1</bold> (0.8 mg) and <bold>2</bold> (1.2 mg), which we named pepteridines A and B, respectively.</p><p>Structural elucidation of pepteridine A (<bold>1</bold>) and B (<bold>2</bold>) was achieved through interpretation of 1D- (<sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C) and 2D-NMR (gCOSY, gHSQCAD, gHMBCAD, and NOESY) spectral data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).

Interpretation of gCOSY and gHMBCAD NMR spectra established the two partial structures to be 2-amino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropteridin-4(3<italic>H</italic>)-one and a propionyl group. Key HMBC correlations from the propionyl protons and the methylene protons at C-6 in the pteridine scaffold demonstrated the sharing of an amide carbonyl.

The presence of predicted GTPCH Ι, 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase, and pteridine reductase homologs in the pathway supports the formation and redox control of a tetrahydropterin substrate. The presence of the pyruvate-dehydrogenase-like E1 and E2-NRPS fusion enzymes supports derivation of the pepteridine acyl-appendages from α-keto acids through an analogous dehydrogenase mechanism. It is likely, however, that the pathway interacts with other pteridine and dehydrogenase biosynthetic enzymes encoded in the genome of the heterologous host, <italic>E. coli</italic>, such as the E3 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which is required for lipoamide regeneration but absent from the pathway. Rather than producing an acyl-CoA, as in the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction, the CoA-derived carrier protein arm (T-domain) could be directly primed in place of CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Analogous carrier protein priming mechanisms have been proposed for branched chain fatty acid substrate utilization in the formation of <italic>N</italic>-acyl-amides and the pristinamycin IIa streptogramin antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Brady, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brachmann et al., 2012</xref>); and for a glycolicacyl-NRPS extender unit in formation of the naphthyridinomycin antitumor antibiotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Peng et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to these pathways, we propose that the resulting loaded acyl-carrier protein in pepteridine biosynthesis would be unusually condensed with a free tetrahydropterin substrate by the atypical NRPS C domain to install the <italic>cis</italic>-amide acyl-linkage. It is currently unclear whether the C domain catalyzes direct <italic>cis</italic>-amide bond formation or whether a <italic>trans</italic>-amide is formed and then isomerized to the observed <italic>cis</italic>-conformation in the pepteridines.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25229.021</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Proposed pepteridine biosynthesis.</title><p>α-Ketobutyrate is processed by the atypical dehydrogenase-NRPS-like complex to generate a propionyl-loaded carrier protein (blue).

Novel classes of putative biosynthetic enzymes, including enzymes belonging to new types of “hybrid&quot; metabolic pathways, can be identified in expanding genome sequence databases through genome mining approaches. Integration of two or more distinct types of metabolic pathways provides combinatorial biosynthetic routes to expand the structural and functional properties of natural products. In this study, using genome synteny analysis, we identified an unprecedented genomic island in <italic>P. luminescens</italic> that harbored both NRPS-like and pteridine biosynthetic machineries. This hybrid biosynthetic pathway is responsible for synthesis of new pteridine metabolites, the pepteridines. Pepteridine A (<bold>1</bold>) and B (<bold>2</bold>), which respectively harbor atypical <italic>cis</italic>-amide functionalized C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> acyl-chains off a free pterin substrate, a particularly unusual feature for a NRPS, were extensively characterized by NMR. The genetic determinants of pepteridine production were assessed in a heterologous host and networked at the systems level, providing global pathway-dependent maps to visualize relative metabolite distributions among wild-type and mutant strains. The pepteridine metabolites were also identified in the wild-type host, <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, specifically associated with its phenotypic variant linked to pathogenesis (the P-form). Quantitative proteomic analysis further demonstrated that when the LysR-type transcriptional repressor is derepressed (Δ<italic>hexA</italic>), the pepteridine genetic locus positively affects pyrone qurourm sensing and select secondary metabolic pathways (<italic>i.e.</italic>, these pathways were downregulated in the <italic>ΔhexA/locus</italic> strain relative to the <italic>ΔhexA</italic> strain). The pepteridines likely participate in chemical signaling. Indeed, in the Gram-negative plant pathogen <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic>, pterin signaling was recently implicated in biofilm regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feirer et al., 2015</xref>). The pepteridines discovered here by targeting atypical genomic sequence space, to the best of our knowledge, represent the first metabolites to be characterized from a hybrid NRPS-pteridine biosynthetic gene cluster. Characterization of these types of atypical hybrid pathways expands our view on the combinatorial biosynthetic potential available in nature’s metabolic toolbox.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cloning of the pepteridine pathway</title><p>The genomic island spanning genes <italic>plu2793</italic> to <italic>plu2799</italic> from <italic>Photorhabdus luminescens</italic> TT01 were amplified via PCR using Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolabs (NEB), USA) and primers <italic>2796-cluster-5</italic> and <italic>2796-cluster-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

Biosynthetic pathway expression was carried out in M9 minimal media supplemented with 5 g/l casamino acids, 0.5 g/l L-phenylalanine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and 25 µg/ml kanamycin. Expression cultures were inoculated at 1:1000 from stationary phase cultures grown overnight. Seven expression cultures were prepared. Six of these were biological replicates and one was a technical replicate that was solely used to monitor growth. As each sample set reached the desired OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5–0.6, it was briefly placed on ice to cool. Once all sample sets had reached density and had sufficiently cooled, expression was then induced with 0.1 mM IPTG, and the culture sets were allowed to grow for 72 hr at 25°C and 250 rpm. The cell mass was then pelleted via centrifugation at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant from each sample was collected (~5 ml) and subsequently extracted with 6 ml of water-saturated butanol. The organic layer was collected and dried under reduced pressure on a Genevac HT-4X evaporation system. Dried extracts were stored under nitrogen at −80°C until use. Samples were prepared for HR-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis by resuspension in 200 µl methanol (LC-MS grade, Fisher, USA). Insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and 50 µl of the supernatant was placed in an HPLC vial for analysis. The remaining sample was dried and stored as previously described for future analysis. The Agilent iFunnel 6550 QTOF system was used for sample analysis. 2 µl of sample was injected and analyzed at 25°C and 0.7 ml/min on a Phenomenex Kinetex C<sub>18</sub> (100 Å) 5 µm (4.6 × 250 mm) column with a water:ACN gradient solvent system containing 0.1% formic acid: 0–30 min, 5–100% ACN; hold for 5 min, 100% ACN; 0.1 min, 100–5% ACN; hold for 1.9 min, 5% ACN; 6.1 min re-equilibration post-time, 5% ACN. Mass spectra were acquired in the range of 25–1700 <italic>m/z</italic> at a scan rate of 1 spectra/s using Dual Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) ESI in positive mode. Source parameters were set as follows: drying gas temp, 225°C; drying gas flow, 12 l/min; nebulizer pressure, 35 psig; sheath gas temperature, 275°C; sheath gas flow, 12 l/min; fragmentor voltage, 125 V; skimmer voltage, 65 V; OCT 1 RF Vpp, 750 V; capillary voltage, 3500 V; nozzle voltage, 1000 V. Data were acquired and analyzed using MassHunter Workstation Data Acquisition (Version B.05.01, Build 5.01.5125.1, Agilent Technologies) and MassHunter Qualitative Analysis (Version B.06.00, Agilent), respectively. Comparison of the six biological replicates for each sample set allowed for selection of the five with the highest overall chromatographic similarity for further processing. Molecular feature extraction was performed with the following parameter alterations: peak spacing tolerance, 0.0025 <italic>m/z</italic> plus 7 ppm; limit assigned charge states to a maximum of, 1; restrict charge states to, 1. In importing data into Mass Profiler Professional (MPP, Agilent), ‘minimum number of ions’ was set to 1. In performing the initial abundance analysis on the samples, a minimal normalized abundance of 18 was set. For controls, a molecular feature found in any one of the five samples was tabulated. Conservatively for wild-type, all five biological replicates had to possess the molecular feature for it to be tabulated. To ensure that all molecular features present in mutant strains throughout the five biological replicates were tabulated, a feature was tabulated if found in any one of the five biological replicates. Molecular features found in control samples were removed from both the wild-type and individual mutant feature lists. Wild-type pathway molecular features were subsequently compared withmutant pathway molecular features. Features present in the wild-type and absent in a given mutant were deemed to be dependent on that given mutant. An inclusion list was generated around these features for subsequent pathway-targeted tandem MS (MS<sup>2</sup>) analysis. MS<sup>2</sup> analysis was run following the previously described acquisition method with some changes: nebulizer pressure, 50 psig; fragmentor voltage, 200 V. Auto MS<sup>2</sup> data collection was used with spectra being acquired at 1 spectra/s in the mass range of 25–1700 <italic>m/z</italic>. Fixed collision energies were set at 0, 25, 40, 45, 50, and 100 V. Auto MS<sup>2</sup> precursors were limited to those determined to be fully pathway-dependent or dependent on a given enzyme in the pathway. A maximum of 20 precursor ions were analyzed per cycle and a minimum precursor threshold was set at 10,000 counts (absolute) or 0.01% (relative). Isotope models were inactivated and scan speed was varied based on precursor abundance with a target of 25,000 counts/spectrum. The MS<sup>2</sup> accumulation time limit was employed. All target masses were allowed within a 10 ppm range and a 0.5 min retention time margin of error. Additionally, Auto MS<sup>2</sup> was used without a preferred ion list on the wild-type sample to establish an untargeted molecular network. The collision energy dependence of the fragmentation patterns of select molecular features was assessed, and we determined that 40 V was optimal for fragmentation of the pepteridines. After data conversion to the mzXML file format, each file was edited to remove non-optimal collision energies while maintaining the preferred 40 V collision energy. This was done as the presence of multiple fragmentation patterns for a single molecular feature can result in the presence of said feature multiple times in the molecular network. In establishing molecular networks through the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking Platform (GnPS, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gnps.ucsd.edu">http://gnps.ucsd.edu</ext-link>), the following parameters were varied from their default values: parent mass tolerance, 0.001 Da; ion tolerance, 0.5 Da; min cos, 0.5; all filtering was disabled and filter below STD DEV and min peak intensity were both set to 0. Cytoscape (Cytoscape Consortium, USA) was used to visualize and edit the final networks. Parent ion masses networked in GnPS that did not match those present on our initial inclusion list based on precise retention time and high-resolution mass data, were removed from the network. Additionally, all features present in the wild-type inclusion list were validated against the control. Any features that were discovered to be false positives were subsequently removed from the network. When single nodes lacking connectivity were generated during this process, these nodes were removed from the network. The charge state for each feature was evaluated manually against the computationally generated charge state and any inaccuracies were corrected. For all networks, the thickness of the edges connecting nodes is representative of the strength of interaction between the nodes, with thicker lines denoting stronger interactions. The minimum thickness was set at 2 pts representing a cosine score of 0.5 while the thickest possible edge possessing a cosine score of 1 was set to 15 pts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Validation of pepteridine biosynthetic dependence on NRPS carrier protein machinery</title><p>To decouple the NRPS machinery from that of the fused dehydrogenase E2 subunit in Plu2796, a point mutation in the wild-type pathway was generated (pEplu2796-S434A). In NRPS logic, the biosynthetic pathway intermediates are ferried through the various rounds of enzymatic modification via attachment to a phosphopantetheine arm. This phosphopantetheine tether is post-translationally coupled to a conserved Ser residue. Removal of this Ser destroys carrier protein activity. Bioinformatic assessment of Plu2796 demonstrated a phosphopantetheinyl binding site in the T domain. This conserved Ser was identified as S434 by pattern matching with known amino acid motifs indicative of a phosphopantetheinyl attachment site. Using the mutagenesis strategy outlined in ‘Construction of scar-less deletion constructs’ with the modifications detailed subsequently, S434 was mutated to A434. This mutation prevents the attachment of phosphopantetheine thereby inactivating the NRPS functionality of the Plu2796 enzyme. The primers <italic>PluS434AF</italic> and <italic>PluS434AR</italic> were used in the PCR reactions. The wild-type pEplu2796 vector was used as a template. Successful point mutagenesis was assessed via sequencing using the <italic>Seq 8</italic> primer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref>).

This construct was transformed into <italic>E. coli</italic> BAP1 (see ‘Preparation of constructs for heterologous expression studies’). Subsequently, LC-HR-ESI-QTOF-MS analysis was performed on this construct in comparison with the wild-type (pEplu2796), negative control (pET28a), and Δ2796 constructs according to the instrument parameters and chromatography method outlined in ‘Comparative metabolomic profiling and molecular networking.’ Comparison of extracted ion chromatograms demonstrated the dependence of pepteridine A and B on the NRPS thiolation domain present in Plu2796. Extracted ion chromatograms of the S434A mutant match with those for the full deletion of Plu2796. All experiments were conducted in triplicate.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Larger-scale growth and organic extraction</title><p>A 5 ml LB liquid culture supplemented with 25 µg/ml kanamycin was initiated by inoculation of a single colony of the <italic>E. coli</italic> BAP1 strain carrying the wild-type pepteridine construct, pEplu2796.

The structure of compound <bold>3</bold>, which was elucidated by 1D- and 2D- (gCOSY and gHMBCAD) NMR experiments, was identified as the 7,8-dihydroxanthopterin (<bold>3</bold>) and supported by comparing its NMR spectral data with a commercial standard of <bold>3</bold>. The structure of pterin (<bold>4</bold>) was unambiguously characterized by HR-ESI-QTOF-MS data, HPLC co-injection with standard pterin, and by comparison of the UV absorption spectral data with that of a pterin commercial standard. Compound <bold>1</bold> was isolated as a white powder. The molecular formula was assigned as C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ([M+H]<sup>+</sup> at <italic>m/z</italic> 224.1141) based on HR-ESI-QTOF-MS spectroscopic data. The <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectral data recorded in DMSO-<italic>d</italic><sub>6</sub> displayed two NH protons [<italic>δ</italic><sub>H </sub>10.07 (1H, br s), 6.96 (1H, br s)], an NH<sub>2</sub> proton [<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub>6.25 (2H, br s)], three methylene groups [(<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 4.54, 2.33), (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 3.30, 2.79), (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 2.57, 2.15)], and one methyl triplet (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 0.88). Interpretation of the HSQC data coupled with <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectral data showed a total of nine signals, which allowed us to assign all protons to the four directly bonded carbons (<italic>δ</italic><sub>C</sub> 41.9, 38.5, 26.5, and 9.7), together with the resonances of five quaternary carbons (<italic>δ</italic><sub>C</sub> 174.0, 157.3, 154.6, 153.1 and 93.1), suggesting the presence of a 2-amino-4-oxo-tetrahydropteridine moiety and a propionyl group. The sequential COSY correlations from a NH proton (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 6.96) to a methylene group (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 4.54, 2.33) established a dimethylene diamine-type partial structure and the COSY cross-peaks between a triplet methyl signal (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 0.88) and a methylene group (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 2.57, 2.15) also supported the presence of the propionyl group. The HMBC correlations from a NH proton (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 6.96) and a methylene group (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 2.57, 2.15) to a quaternary carbon (<italic>δ</italic><sub>C</sub> 93.1) allowed us to construct a 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrazine ring system and the three bond HMBC correlation sharing a carbonyl amide (<italic>δ</italic><sub>C</sub> 174.0) from a methyl signal (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 0.88) and a methylene group (<italic>δ</italic><sub>H</sub> 4.54, 2.33) led to attachment of the propionyl group to the tetrahydropyrazine ring via N-acylation at the 5-position of the pteridine ring.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Genome mining unearths a hybrid nonribosomal peptide synthetase-like-pteridine synthase biosynthetic gene cluster&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick as the Senior Editor and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Clardy (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about many aspects of your manuscript, especially the genome mining effort that led to identifying the pepteridine cluster along with the rigor of the chemical and biochemical characterization of the pepteridines and their pathway. Those features provided meticulously characterized and important chemical and biochemical insights.</p><p>However, the referees also perceived some shortcomings in the manuscript. One was the lack of any significant biological activity. This lack could be related to your not screening in physiologically or ecologically relevant assays. It could also be related to a second issue: Are the pepteridines the intended product of the pathway, or could they be the partial products produced by an incomplete pathway. The referees feel that you 1) need to do additional experiments to establish, or try to establish, pepteridine production in the native strain, and 2) address the shortcomings noted in the biological activity section. You could either find a significant level of activity in a therapeutically relevant assay, or activity in an ecologically relevant assay, or deleting the entire section. Finally, the suggestion of additional bioinformatic analysis to establish the distribution of the cluster would add to the manuscript's significance.</p><p>If you elect to revise the manuscript to address these issues, we would be pleased to look at a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Park et al. describes a genome mining analysis that revealed an unconventional biosynthetic pathway that incorporates features from two well-known biosynthetic pathways – nonribosomal (NRPS) peptide synthetase and pteridine synthase – to create a hybrid pathway that makes intriguing small molecules called &quot;pepteridines.&quot; Given the intense research activity in both genome mining for small molecule pathways and NRPS pathways, this discovery will be important to many researchers.</p><p>NRPS pathways make many important therapeutic agents and pteridines are important redox active cofactors, this hybrid pathway, or its relatives, could produce molecules with important biological and/or medical activity. The discovery of the pepteridines was made possible by a genome mining approach based on genome synteny rather than the more conventional similarity to previously known pathway approach. The pathway was analyzed using heterologous expression, gene deletion, mutagenesis, and 'pathway-targeted molecular networking.' The pepteridines were thoroughly characterized spectroscopic, especially NMR, methods and chemical synthesis. All in all this is an impressive report with important lessons on research carried out at the highest technical level. There are, of course, some issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>The brief section on biological activity is well below the standard of the rest of the manuscript. The authors report &quot;moderate cytotoxic activities against a colon cancer cell line (HCT-116, 77.57 and 79.26 mean growth percent for (1) and (2), respectively, whereas 2 selectively exhibited moderate activity against a breast cancer cell line (TD-47D, 77.11 mean growth percent.&quot; These data, which were cherry picked from a much larger NCI screen (Figure 4—figure supplements 14 and 15), show little selectivity and little potency, i.e. they would not be identified by the NCI screen as worthy of additional studies. The antifungal activity, ~200 µM MIC, is essentially nonexistent, and another screen against a panel of kinases showed nothing of interest.</p><p>The authors also report speculative activity based on structural comparisons with molecules with known activity, but if associating molecular structures with biological activity were that easy, drug discovery would be a very different enterprise. The pepteridines are similar to a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and screening them as pteridine reductase inhibitors would be a good idea as they are redox inactive analogs of the endogenous substrates. But such a screen wasn't done. The manuscript also points out that they could be MR1 (a MHC class I-like molecules) based on structural similarity, but this screen was also not done.</p><p>I think that the manuscript would be stronger without this section as it undercuts the important aspects of the report.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Nonribosomal peptides and pteridines are both large and biologically significant classes of metabolites that are typically produced through their own independent biosynthetic machinery. Through the genome mining of <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, the authors of this current study have identified the first example of a mixed NRPS-pteridine biosynthetic gene cluster. By way of the heterologous expression of this new hybrid cluster, the authors produced, isolated, and structurally characterized two novel cytotoxic pteridine metabolites, pepteridine A and B. Gene deletion studies, molecular networking analyses, stable-isotope feeding experiments and molecule characterization studies all appear to have been done very well and support the authors' general conclusions. A few items that the authors might think about are outlined below:</p><p>1) It would be nice if the authors could discuss in more detail whether they believe pepteridine A and B are the intended metabolites produced by this gene cluster.</p><p>A) A brief discussion (in the manuscript) of the genes flanking this bioinformatically identified island would be helpful to convince the reader that the set of genes studied by the authors constitute an entire gene cluster.</p><p>B) 1 and 2 are minor metabolites observed in heterologous expression experiments using <italic>E. coli</italic>:BAP1. In this system the pteridine intermediate is produced at a much higher level. Are short acyl chains added to the pepteridine intermediate at such a low level because they are only the best available substrates in <italic>E. coli</italic>? As the authors mention in their introduction an NRPS A domain &quot;selects its cognate amino acid from the available substrate pool&quot;.

One was the lack of any significant biological activity. This lack could be related to your not screening in physiologically or ecologically relevant assays. It could also be related to a second issue: Are the pepteridines the intended product of the pathway, or could they be the partial products produced by an incomplete pathway. The referees feel that you 1) need to do additional experiments to establish, or try to establish, pepteridine production in the native strain, and 2) address the shortcomings noted in the biological activity section. You could either find a significant level of activity in a therapeutically relevant assay, or activity in an ecologically relevant assay, or deleting the entire section. Finally, the suggestion of additional bioinformatic analysis to establish the distribution of the cluster would add to the manuscript's significance.</italic> </p><p><italic>If you elect to revise the manuscript to address these issues, we would be pleased to look at a new submission.</italic> </p><p>Over the last 6-7 months, we have conducted additional experiments and have revised our manuscript in accordance with the reviewers’ comments, requests, and recommendations.</p><p>Specifically, the <italic>eLife</italic> editors/reviewers welcomed our resubmission if we could address the following points: 1) metabolite production in the native strain; 2) bolstering or deleting our prior in vitro bioactivity studies; and 3) providing bioinformatics support of the pathway’s phylogenetic distribution. We 1) established pepteridine production in the native strain, <italic>P. luminescens</italic>. Specifically, we identified pepteridine production only in one of the two established phenotypic variants of <italic>P. luminescens</italic> using genetically “locked” variant strains. These experiments connect pepteridine structure to bacterial phenotypic variation status. We 2) deleted the in vitro biological characterization section and added a new quantitative proteomic section to determine the genomic island’s signaling contributions in the producer strain. This focused our revised manuscript on cellular pathway analysis, the major and strong themes of the paper, and added two new authors. We 3) added additional bioinformatics statements in regards to the detection of the unprecedented hybrid enzyme Plu2796. In sum, we believe that we have suitably addressed the three perceived shortcomings of our original submission. Additionally, we believe the innovative review process at <italic>eLife</italic> has substantially strengthened our study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] The brief section on biological activity is well below the standard of the rest of the manuscript. The authors report &quot;moderate cytotoxic activities against a colon cancer cell line (HCT-116, 77.57 and 79.26 mean growth percent for (1) and (2), respectively, whereas 2 selectively exhibited moderate activity against a breast cancer cell line (TD-47D, 77.11 mean growth percent.&quot; These data, which were cherry picked from a much larger NCI screen (Figure 4—figure supplements 14 and 15), show little selectivity and little potency, i.e. they would not be identified by the NCI screen as worthy of additional studies. The antifungal activity, ~200 µM MIC, is essentially nonexistent, and another screen against a panel of kinases showed nothing of interest.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors also report speculative activity based on structural comparisons with molecules with known activity, but if associating molecular structures with biological activity were that easy, drug discovery would be a very different enterprise. The pepteridines are similar to a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and screening them as pteridine reductase inhibitors would be a good idea as they are redox inactive analogs of the endogenous substrates. But such a screen wasn't done. The manuscript also points out that they could be MR1 (a MHC class I-like molecules) based on structural similarity, but this screen was also not done.</italic> </p><p><italic>I think that the manuscript would be stronger without this section as it undercuts the important aspects of the report.</italic> </p><p>The in vitro biological assay section describing moderate inhibitory activities for the new pepteridine metabolites was deleted in the revised manuscript. To initiate functional cellular studies in <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, we generated a pepteridine genetic locus mutant in a wild-type background and in a hexA mutant background. We included hexA, as very recent global transcriptomic analysis suggested that the pathway was upregulated in hexA strains (Bode and co-workers referenced herein). We analyzed these strains by quantitative proteomics. In a wild-type background, little effect was observed (indeed, many pathways are cryptic under standard cultivation conditions). However, in a hexA background, the pepteridine genetic locus significantly affected the proteome. We show that the pathway is under the control of HexA located elsewhere in the genome and that the pathway positively affects pyrone quorum sensing and select secondary metabolic pathway enzyme production. These studies support that the pepteridine genetic locus contributes to chemical signaling, which may explain the moderate in vitro bioactivities we previously noted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] 1) It would be nice if the authors could discuss in more detail whether they believe pepteridine A and B are the intended metabolites produced by this gene cluster.</italic> </p><p>In the revised manuscript, we show that the pepteridines are produced in the pathogenic P-form phenotypic variant of <italic>P. luminescens</italic>, further supporting our proposal.</p><p><italic>A) A brief discussion (in the manuscript) of the genes flanking this bioinformatically identified island would be helpful to convince the reader that the set of genes studied by the authors constitute an entire gene cluster.</italic> </p><p>We emphasized the genome synteny approach in the revised manuscript and have a dedicated supporting Figure showing the genomic island and its synteny-defined boundaries.</p><p><italic>B) 1 and 2 are minor metabolites observed in heterologous expression experiments using E. coli:BAP1.

We also supplemented a variety of other α-ketoacids, such as the ones derived from branched chain amino acid degradation and others, and we did not observe an effect with these substrates. These studies importantly link pepteridine structure to α-ketoacid substrates rather than simple acyl-CoA substrates. In the revised manuscript, detection of the two products in <italic>Photorhabdus</italic> now further supports this enzyme selectivity. We provide a response below to reviewer 3 in regards to protein biochemistry, which further supports our assignment as well.

The P-form is pathogenic to insects and the M-form is thought to participate in the colonization of its nematode host. Between the two forms, the metabolites were only detected in the P- form phenotypic variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

We tried these recommended experiments. However, the pepteridines did not show substantial antimicrobial activities under anaerobic conditions.

Pterin signaling is a known phenomenon, so we considered whether the pepteridine genetic locus has an alternative signaling role.
