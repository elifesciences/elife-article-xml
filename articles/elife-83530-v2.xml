Presynaptic G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical in this problem as they locally influence synaptic strength and can operate on a wide range of time scales. Among the mechanisms by which GPCRs impact neurotransmission is by inhibiting voltage-gated calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx in the active zone. Here, using quantitative analysis of both single bouton Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and exocytosis, we uncovered an unexpected non-linear relationship between the magnitude of action potential driven Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and the concentration of external Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>). We find that this unexpected relationship is leveraged by GPCR signaling when operating at the nominal physiological set point for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, 1.2 mM, to achieve complete silencing of nerve terminals. These data imply that the information throughput in neural circuits can be readily modulated in an all-or-none fashion at the single synapse level when operating at the physiological set point.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>calcium channel</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NINDS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS036942</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM148935</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS117139</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ryan</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005831</institution-id><institution>Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRTG-02-15-2020-Cook</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Weill Cornell Physician-Scientist Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cook</surname><given-names>Daniel C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single bouton measurements of calcium influx shows that activating GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors at nerve terminals can lead to complete inhibition of calcium entry when one is operating at the physiological setpoint of extracellular calcium concentration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>GPCRs serve a key control function in the brain, modifying the efficacy or time course of neurotransmission through pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nadim and Bucher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovinger et al., 2022</xref>). Ligands of GPCRs are often secreted near synapses and exert their effects locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van den Pol, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Westen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ding et al., 2019</xref>). They can thereby modify region-specific synaptic properties and change the weighting of targeted synapses, in turn altering local computation. A canonical mode of presynaptic modulation occurs via the binding of voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) by G-protein Î²Î³ subunits after they dissociate from the trimeric G-protein complex following GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herlitze et al., 1996</xref>). The impact of GPCR-mediated inhibition of VGCCs on neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kreitzer and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamada et al., 1999</xref>) is amplified by the exquisite sensitivity of exocytosis to the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which underlies the ability to rapidly change exocytotic rates at sites of neurotransmitter release. This sensitivity is driven by the cooperative binding of multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions to one or more Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors that form core elements of the exocytic machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heidelberger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bollmann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel and Ryan, 2010</xref>). Modifying the open probability of VGCCs, therefore, serves as a potent means of presynaptic control, as small changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx can lead to large changes in neurotransmitter release.</p><p>The impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on exocytosis depends on local changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration near the active zone, which in turn depend on the external Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration bathing the nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dittman and Ryan, 2019</xref>). Thus, the steepness of the relationship between exocytosis rates and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx depends crucially on resting [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. In vivo, plasma [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] is strictly regulated, and the CNS is very sensitive to plasma [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] perturbations, with seizures precipitated by hypocalcemia and psychiatric symptoms progressing to lethargy or coma with worsening hypercalcemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Riggs, 2002</xref>). Feedback loops controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors of the parathyroid gland act to maintain plasma [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] at a set point of 1.2 mM in most mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hannan et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we used quantitative optical tools to investigate the sensitivity of exocytosis rates at the single-synapse level when operating at the physiological set point for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. In a narrow range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> near the physiologic concentration, our experiments revealed an unexpected sub-proportionality of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx relative to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, indicating that a minimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is needed to sustain robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during AP firing. We show that three different approaches to modestly decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, (1) blocking a fraction of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, (2) lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, or (3) application of a GPCR agonist, baclofen, known to reduce Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx lead to complete silencing of a subset of nerve terminals. Thus, in this operating regime, decreasing presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> current may act as a digital switch to eliminate single bouton synaptic throughput.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into nerve terminals is not 1:1 proportional to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> near the physiologic set point</title><p>In order to examine how Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx driven by action potentials (APs) at nerve terminals is impacted by changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, we used the genetically-encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator physin-GCaMP6f transfected sparsely into primary cultures of dissociated rat hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We measured the changes in the GCaMP6f signal in response to a 20 AP burst stimulus (20 Hz) at 0.8, 1.2, and 2.0 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Signals were corrected for the local abundance of the protein by determining the GCaMP6f fluorescence under saturating Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (determined following ionomycin application) and converted to absolute intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, see methods). Previous studies investigating the dependency of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in nerve terminals of the CNS found the relationship obeyed a simple saturable pore model with a K<sub>d</sub> of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> ~2.5 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel and Ryan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>). This model predicts that changes in Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> will exhibit 1-to-1 proportionality to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> at concentrations well below K<sub>d</sub>, which is substantially higher than the physiologic set point ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> = 1.2 mM). One important confound, however, is that previous measurements were not carried out at physiological temperatures. Here, where the temperature was set to 37 Â°C, we observed an unexpected sub-proportional relationship of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> as the concentration was lowered below 2.0 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The magnitude of difference between the expected and experimentally measured Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was greater at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 0.8 mM compared to 1.2 mM, highlighting that this discrepancy manifests most prominently below the set point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A linear extrapolation from the mean Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> measurements relative to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> predicts the cessation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into nerve terminals at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> of 0.47 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Experiments carried out using [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> = 0.4 mM confirm that there is almost no measurable residual Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx under these conditions (estimated Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]~1.6 nM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), far below the value expected (10.4 nM) if Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx obeyed a simple linear proportionality.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Unexpected sub-proportionality in dependence of presynaptic calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) influx on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the experimental protocol.

To further probe the apparent non-zero threshold of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> that enables Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, we assessed physin-GCaMP responses at individual nerve terminals with varying [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that a subset of terminals exhibited an all-or-none response to lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> below the physiologic set point such that Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is selectively abolished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To rigorously quantify this behavior, we employed a modest cutoff of one standard deviation of the pre-stimulus noise above the mean fluorescence to separate responding terminals from those without measurable synaptic activity, termed silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Ryan, 2010</xref>). This definition of presynaptic silencing has been used previously in neurons expressing GCaMP3, a less sensitive indicator than GCaMP6f, and compared to the low-affinity, synthetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dye Magnesium Green with an excellent agreement, indicating that GCaMP sensors can reliably distinguish responding and silent terminals despite their non-linear Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Ryan, 2013</xref>). To evaluate the effectiveness of our thresholding, we compared cumulative frequency curves of ÎF for terminals separated into silent and responding populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Responding terminals exhibit a clear shift towards higher ÎF with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, as expected, but the distribution of silent terminals was invariant with respect to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. This analysis demonstrates that silent terminals are appropriately classified as incapable of generating detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that would otherwise scale with [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. We observed that silencing occurred despite robust Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and even if synaptic neighbors of a terminal exhibited persistent Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at a lower concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), suggesting the impact of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> on neuronal function is exerted at the single synapse level. To further evaluate whether silencing may be driven by changes in the excitability of individual branches of neurons, we expressed GCaMP6f in the cytosol to clearly label the axon and marked terminals by co-expression of mRuby-synapsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We limited our analysis to regions unambiguously representing a single branch that had at least 10 terminals to provide a robust sample. These experiments showed that individual axonal branches have both silent and responding terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C, D</xref>), indicating that branch point failure cannot account for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> mediated silencing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Selective nerve terminal silencing is caused by changing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> around the physiologic set point.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pre-stimulus average (left) and difference images (right) of AP stimulation (20 APs in 1 s) of a neuron expressing physin-GCaMP.

Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at hippocampal nerve terminals occurs predominantly via N- and P/Q-type VGCCs, with substantial heterogeneity between neurons in their proportional contribution to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ariel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ermolyuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoppa et al., 2012</xref>).

We, therefore, hypothesized that N-type channels may exhibit a greater propensity to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-driven silencing as compared to P/Q-type channels, accounting for neuronal variability in the proportion of silent terminals. To examine whether [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>-mediated silencing exhibits subtype selectivity, we utilized Ï-conotoxin-GVIA and Ï-agatoxin IVA, potent toxins that specifically inhibit N- and P/Q-type channels, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The R-type toxin, SNX-482, was employed in these experiments to exclude the minor but possibly confounding contribution of these channels to overall Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ermolyuk et al., 2013</xref>).

To do so, we utilized iGluSnFR3 v857 (iGluSnFR), a genetically-encoded, fluorescent biosensor of extracellular glutamate concentrations with an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution enabling quantification of glutamate release from one AP at individual nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>). Co-expression of mRuby-synapsin allowed measurements to be localized to neurotransmitter release sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>); however, because iGluSnFR is anchored by glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) to the cell surface, the indicator does not necessarily discriminate between glutamate released by the transfected cell or neighboring terminals from non-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>). Accordingly, while fluorescent signals at mRuby-synapsin puncta may receive contributions from additional terminals, silent terminals are definitively assigned as inactive.

One such canonical mechanism is the agonism of the GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor (GABA<sub>B</sub>R), which lowers I<sub>Ca</sub> by approximately 50% via interactions of the GÎ²Î³ subunit with presynaptic VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mintz and Bean, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herlitze et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isaacson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laviv et al., 2011</xref>).

Uncovering the mechanisms regulating Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into nerve terminals is therefore critical to understanding the molecular underpinnings of CNS function.

Fewer studies have sought to determine the effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> on Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and, to our knowledge, none have examined this in the range encompassing the physiological set point for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> at physiological temperature. In general, the narrowing of the AP at warmer temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hodgkin and Katz, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) results in lowering of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during AP firing, so additionally studying lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> results in a much lower regime of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Previous attempts (carried out at sub-physiological temperatures) modeled this relationship with Michaelis-Menten kinetics, where Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> obeyed a simple saturation of VGCCs, but predicted a simple 1:1 relationship extrapolating to lower [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariel and Ryan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneggenburger et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show an unexpected and impactful behavior of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in the lower Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> regime, which is that small modulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx leads to dramatic silencing of individual nerve terminals. We discovered that a substantial subset of terminals (~40%) exhibited silencing of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and SV exocytosis at physiologic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, and this proportion increased steeply as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> was lowered to 0.8 mM and 0.4 mM (to ~60% and &gt;90%, respectively). In comparison, the change in the proportion of silent terminals in the transition from [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM to 1.2 mM, a difference of ~15%, was smaller despite a larger step in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Previous estimates of synaptic silencing were drawn from experiments conducted at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM and agree with our findings at this concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altrock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Ryan, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moulder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moulder et al., 2006</xref>). However, our results highlight that the proportion of silent terminals in cultured neurons is substantially higher under conditions of physiologic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Thus, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> is a crucial variable to consider in future studies examining synaptic silencing. The agreement of our findings in the silencing of both Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and SV exocytosis indicate that silencing of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> is driving the effect as opposed to an independent mechanism operating on SV exocytosis alone.</p><p>The proportion of silencing across different neurons was steeply related to absolute Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, such that lowering of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> was associated with increased proportions of silent terminals. Interestingly, this relationship persisted despite the selective blockade of VGCC subtypes by potent toxins, demonstrating the propensity for silencing is not related to their relative distribution at nerve terminals. Due to this effect, our analysis suggests that the minimal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> needed to sustain any neurotransmission is ~0.4â0.5 mM. Moreover, the degree of silencing caused by acutely blocking VGCC subtypes followed this relationship. Taken together, our results suggest the operation of a feedback mechanism causing the selective shutdown of terminals not meeting a threshold for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. This mechanism has important implications for the impact of neuromodulators that regulate I<sub>Ca</sub> because relatively small changes in Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> could cause a substantial proportion of terminals to become silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dolphin, 2003</xref>). As an example, we investigated the impact on synaptic function resulting from the inhibition of presynaptic VGCCs by GÎ²Î³ subunits using agonism of GABA<sub>B</sub>R by baclofen. Previous studies have demonstrated that the GÎ²Î³ interacts with presynaptic VGCCs to lower I<sub>Ca</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Isaacson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laviv et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kajikawa et al., 2001</xref>). We observed that, in responding terminals, baclofen was associated with ~40% decrease in Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. This decrement in Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx led to an increase in the proportion of silent terminals from ~40 to 60%. Notably, this difference in the degree of silencing and Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> agreed excellently with results from decreasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 1.2â0.8 mM, supporting the conclusion that the effect of baclofen is mediated by decreasing presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. In addition, baclofen caused substantially fewer terminals to become silent in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM, highlighting the importance of physiologic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in dictating synaptic function.</p><p>While our findings have shown that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> contributes importantly to presynaptic neuromodulation, we have not identified the precise molecular mechanism. Previous investigations indicate that silencing is a drastic form of synaptic homeostasis, as chronic suppression of neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) decreases the proportion of silent terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moulder et al., 2006</xref>) and increasing activity with chronic depolarization increases this proportion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moulder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moulder et al., 2006</xref>). Several intracellular signaling pathways have been identified to set the fraction of silent terminals, including those involving adenylyl cyclase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moulder et al., 2008</xref>), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ninan and Arancio, 2004</xref>), and calcineurin/cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Ryan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim and Ryan, 2013</xref>). The disparate molecular pathways that converge on the regulation of synaptic silencing suggest that it is an important mode of plasticity for neurons in the CNS. Notably, in experiments investigating the impact of GPCR modulation, only a subset of GPCRs tested was able to alter silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2011</xref>). The silencing caused by GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonism was dependent on proteasome function, and the authors concluded that protein degradation was necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2011</xref>). However, these experiments utilized 4 hr incubation with baclofen, as opposed to 5 min here, so an acute effect of GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonism independent of proteasomal activity may have been missed. Indeed, silencing may have both proteasome-dependent and independent pathways, operating on slow (hours) or acute (&lt;1 hr) time scales, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome function prevents depolarization-induced silencing, so the effect of proteasome inhibition may not be specific to GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, our results suggest a separate, rapid mechanism by which nerve terminals can be silenced, adding to the diversity of pathways by which this form of plasticity is achieved.</p><p>We classified terminals for which the ÎF of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry falls below one standard deviation of pre-stimulus fluorescence as silent. This previously used definition agrees well with the other approaches used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moulder et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moulder et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crawford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hogins et al., 2011</xref>). Given that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is itself non-linearly related to SV exocytosis, even if Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry has only been inhibited to undetectable levels, this level would lead to even rarer neurotransmitter release. The sub-proportional relationship of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> and the heterogeneous changes of individual nerve terminals to changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> refutes the simple biophysical model of the relationship of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. Rather, our results support nerve terminal specificity in the propensity to have presynaptic function diminished by perturbations that lower the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry.</p><p>Our experiments have also not assessed whether silencing occurs independently at individual release sites. The sensor iGluSnFr3 can resolve spontaneous glutamate exocytosis that represents a single vesicle and, therefore, the output of a single release site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>). However, quantifying the proportion of release sites that are silenced is limited by the variable number of active zones per nerve terminal in a population of CA1-CA3 hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schikorski and Stevens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rigby et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, iGluSnFr can detect glutamate released from neighboring but non-transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, it would be difficult with our approach to unambiguously identify a release site and, therefore, to quantify the proportion of sites silenced. We speculate that because Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at the terminal is prevented, all active zones within a terminal are equally impacted by [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> mediated silencing.</p><p>Our findings highlight that the physiologic set point of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> in the CNS functions as an important lever in the modulation of synaptic function because further lowering of Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> substantially increases the proportion of silent terminals. Although [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] of the CSF is tightly regulated globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forsberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones and Keep, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barkai and Meltzer, 1982</xref>), models of the synapse that account for its limited volume and restriction of diffusion have predicted that drastic reductions of local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> may occur during repetitive presynaptic firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egelman and Montague, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">King et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, the phenomenon we observed may be important in vivo as a homeostatic mechanism to prevent excessive or runaway synaptic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stringer et al., 2007</xref>). Our results suggest that the magnitude of the decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> does not need to be large to shut down a sizable proportion of terminals.</p><p>In summary, we have utilized highly sensitive, genetically-encoded fluorescent biosensors to dissect the effects of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> near the physiologic set point on presynaptic function. We discovered that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> has a potent effect in setting the proportion of silent terminals which is driven by Î[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. These findings provide evidence that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> is an important lever contributing to neuromodulation. Future studies will address the intracellular molecular targets responsible for this acute mechanism of synaptic silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All experiments involving animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Weill Cornell Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

Fluorescence was stimulated with OBIS 488 nm LX or OBIS 561 nm LS lasers (Coherent) passing through a laser speckle reducer (LSR 3005 at 12Â° diffusion angle, Optotune). Live-cell imaging was performed with a custom-built, epifluorescence microscope. Emission was acquired with a 40 x, 1.3 numerical aperture objective (Fluar, Zeiss) and Andor iXon + Ultra 897 electron-multiplying charge-coupled device camera. APs were evoked with platinum-iridium electrodes generating 1 ms pulses of 10 V cm<sup>â1</sup> field potentials via a current stimulus isolator (A385, World Precision Instruments). For physin-GCaMP and vGpH, neurons were stimulated with 20 and 200 AP, respectively, delivered at 20 Hz. For iGluSnFR, neurons were stimulated with a single AP, with averaging performed over 15 trials delivered every 20 s. A custom-designed Arduino board coordinated AP and laser stimulation with frame acquisition. Frame rates for AP recordings with vGpH, GCaMP6f, and iGluSnFR were 5, 50, and 100 Hz, respectively. To achieve frame rates of 50 and 100 Hz, a subregion of the EMCCD chip was used (347 pixels and 169 pixels, respectively, compared to 512 pixels). In experiments with neurons expressing vGpH, Tyrodeâs solution with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl 50 mM replacing an equimolar concentration of NaCl was perfused at the end of the experiment to alkalinize intra-vesicular pHluorin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sankaranarayanan et al., 2000</xref>) and enable normalization of fluorescence to the total pool of internal vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim and Ryan, 2010</xref>).

extracellular calcium concentrations shift individual presynaptic terminals between active and inactive states. This discovery is extended to the action of inhibitory synaptic modulation via GABA, emphasizing potentially broad relevance for our understanding of how synaptic transmission is stabilized and modulated throughout the brain. The evidence for the observed phenomenon is compelling, given the use of multiple functional reporters and rigorous analyses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83530.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Graeme W</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Graeme W</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/043mz5j54</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.16.508300">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.16.508300v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Graeme W Davis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Huguenard as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The essential revisions are representative of conversation among reviewers, attempting to synthesize the individual reviews.</p><p>1. Two reviewers focused on a specific issue: The obvious challenge is distinguishing between a very small response and a non-responder. The data, throughout the paper, are categorized (yes/no) and presented as a percentage. Thus, the crux of the manuscript relies upon thoroughly demonstrating that the discrimination between a responder and non-responder is not confounded. Suggestions for how this might be achieved are presented, but these are not intended to be the only solution to addressing this issue â it is entirely up to the authors.</p><p>2. The data set could be broadly strengthened by including data from individual release sites, rather than simply presenting averages. This is particularly the case with the GluSnFr data where the probabilistic release of single vesicles could be resolved, inclusive of amplitudes associated with spontaneous release events (when possible).</p><p>3. Two reviewers highlight a circular argument regarding the classification of silent sites, that are then shown to be silent. This should be addressed either through changes to the figures or the text. Reviewer 3 (comment 3). Reviewer 2 (final comment).</p><p>4. It would be important, in at least one experimental paradigm, to see that release returns to baseline following restoration of external calcium.</p><p>5. The issue of neuronal excitation can and should be evaluated. It is understood that these are sparse cultures. None-the-less, it remains possible that fields of view contain axons originating in more than one neuron, or in the case that they reside on different branches of the same axon, that branch point failures could 'cause' boutons to appear to function differently. A solution would be to systematically track whether sets of ROI unambiguously residing on single branches still function differently with respect to release (some being silenced and others not a lower calcium).'</p><p>6. A core feature of the manuscript is the quantification of calcium entry via the genetically encoded calcium sensor. There was a healthy debate among reviewers regarding the necessity of utilizing synthetic dyes. On the one hand, the superior properties of the dyes allow for highly quantitative validation of existing transgenic reporters and central conclusions. On the other hand, this requires loading (likely through patch pipettes). Addressing the robustness of the existing measures, either through dyes or validation with additional variants of transgenic reporters would strengthen the work. Again, however, the precise nature of the experiment is entirely up to the authors.</p><p>7. Two reviewers, while agreeing that the GABA data are interesting, commented that the data are somewhat under-developed. On the one hand, the title emphasizes &quot;neuromodulation&quot; and this could be modified to better reflect the single experiment shown regarding GABA. At another level, reviewer #3 argues that &quot;The interesting issue would be to reveal how the effect of GABAB activation depends on the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e. This information is essential to see whether there is indeed a shoulder in its effectiveness curve.&quot; The title likely should be changed, at a minimum.</p><p>8. There was discussion about the main conclusion of the manuscript. 'Thus, as with Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, SV recycling is modulated in an all-or-none manner by modest changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e around the physiological set point.' It seems equally likely that authors have identified a steeper continuum rather than 'all or none' control. As this is a central tenant of the manuscript, it could perhaps be addressed through changes in the text to shore up the argument, differently emphasized through data presentation or through the addition of new data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While fascinating, the conclusions are most powerful when the data can be distilled to direct observation of single release sites. Yet throughout, the data are presented as all-or-none discriminations at regions of interest (ROI) that may or may not represent single release sites. Specific criticisms are listed below.</p><p>1. One obvious challenge is distinguishing between a very small response and a non-responder. The data, throughout the paper, are categorized (yes/no) and presented as a percentage. Thus, the crux of the manuscript relies upon thoroughly demonstrating that the discrimination between a responder and non-responder is not confounded. For example, in several figures, nice example traces are provided showing a large initial response that results in a failure upon lowering extracellular calcium. But, beyond these examples, there are no quantitative data demonstrating that this is, indeed, routinely the case. Could the authors bin their data into quartiles based on the amplitude of the initial GCamp signal at 2.0 external calcium. Then, for each quartile, calculate the fractional silencing that occurs. If the fraction of silencing is constant across quartiles, then the authors have a good argument that the method of detection (GCamp) is not contributing to the observed effects.</p><p>2. Figure 6 uses GluSnFr to directly measure vesicle release, testing synapse silencing. Data are presented as the average of 15 single action potentials. Given that release is probabilistic, a silent synapse is a zero responder over some number of these trials, but we do not know how many. Two issues arise. First, individual successes could be averaged out to appear as a failure in the averaged trace. Second, a true release probability depends on the number of active zones that are present at a single R01. It seems that the true power of GluSnFr is not being deployed. Can the authors utilize spontaneous miniature amplitudes (or sucrose evoked miniatures) to achieve an estimate of single vesicle release event amplitude. Then, if sufficiently above the noise, define the release probability at high and low calcium.</p><p>3. In general, data from single RO1 would be nice to see, as opposed to averages and percentages per culture dish.</p><p>4. It would be important, in at least one experimental paradigm, to see that release returns to baseline following restoration of external calcium.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors illustrate two terminals in which the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e around 0.8 mM results in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. They also show that at higher [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e the terminal has detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry. In the following figure, they demonstrate that approximately 25% of the boutons are 'silent' even in 2 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]e. What does this mean? Is there any evidence that they are functional boutons? This is inconsistent with the literature. In cortical pyramidal neuron axons, each AP results in detectable Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry is 100% reliable from AP to AP. If there is no Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry, it is always the consequence of the lack of an active zone (i.e. not functional bouton).</p><p>Keeping the superior properties of the synthetic dyes in mind, all [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] measurements should be repeated with high affinity synthetic dyes.</p><p>An interesting finding of the MS is that N and P/Q type Ca channels have no special role in Ca entry and in creating silent synapses. This should be emphasized.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Membrane excitability â Two observations are relevant here: The qualitative preservation of the phenomenon when two types of voltage gated calcium channels are blocked separately, and the large heterogeneity of the % of silenced boutons among neurons at a given extracellular calcium concentrations, which is at least as great as the range of modulation of the % of silenced synapses by extracellular calcium concentrations at single neurons. One then wonders if the findings might be attributed to a) the fidelity of the field potential-based stimulation system, that is, the degree to which neurons track the stimuli trains; b) the heterogeneity of neurons in this regard, c) this fidelity at different extracellular calcium concentrations for different neurons, and d) the identity of presynaptic sites analyzed in one run (are they all part of the same axon?). Along these lines, there is an assumption that the field potential-based stimulation system is the sole driver of excitation in these networks, which is reasonable given that excitatory synaptic transmission is mostly blocked pharmacologically (by CNQX and APV). Inhibitory transmission, however, was not blocked and thus, there is no guarantee that the inhibitory input neurons receive and its modulation by extracellular calcium does affect the degree to which neurons fire precisely and reliably at 20 Hz at all conditions. If it could be shown, at least for a substantial subset of the data, that all terminals analyzed for a particular neuron are part of an unambiguously identified axon stretch, with no branches (potential conduction failure points) and still demonstrate the claimed heterogeneity, this potential confound would be less of an issue.</p><p>2) It would seem that the x-axis intercept in Figure 1D (0.47 mM) predicts that at this concentration of extracellular calcium, pretty much all presynaptic terminals will be silent. Why not test this directly? This would nicely strengthen the findings.</p><p>3) Page 4, line 23. For the silenced population it is indeed expected, because, by definition, they did not respond and were consequently classified as silenced. As this is circular, the inclusion of these data in Figure 3D (and 6E) is a bit confusing and should probably be removed.</p><p>4) Figure 4 â end of legend â Data are fit as in D (should probably be E)</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83530.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The essential revisions are representative of conversation among reviewers, attempting to synthesize the individual reviews.</p><p>1.

To address this issue, we compared the frequency distributions of fluorescence responses (ÎF) across all nerve terminals separated into silent or responding populations (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 1). This analysis reveals two key aspects: (1) the distribution shape of ÎF signals in the silent population is unchanged as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> varies from 0.8 to 2.0 mM, while the distribution of responders shifts, as expected, to higher ÎF with increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>. This indicates that our cutoff criterion for defining silencing was not artificially being biased by the absolute size of the signal at these different concentrations. (2) We observe a marked, clear separation in these frequency distribution of the silent versus responding populations reinforcing that our cutoff criterium yields distinct populations. Last, our results for silencing at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2 mM are consistent with previous publications using the same cutoff criterium or other definitions of presynaptic silencing, bolstering our observations and quantification in this manuscript. Conversely, for the first time to our knowledge, we have extended this methodology to investigate silencing at near-physiologic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>, discovering substantially different proportions of silent terminals within a physiologic range.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data set could be broadly strengthened by including data from individual release sites, rather than simply presenting averages. This is particularly the case with the GluSnFr data where the probabilistic release of single vesicles could be resolved, inclusive of amplitudes associated with spontaneous release events (when possible).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that extending our analysis to the level of single release sites would be interesting to establish whether they act independently within nerve terminals. With our approach, analysis of individual release sites is complicated by the possible activation of iGluSnFr by glutamate exocytosed from neighboring, non-transfected terminals and the variable number of release sites per terminal in CA1-CA3 hippocampal neurons. Thus, we would be limited in our ability to discriminate between neighboring release sites and characterize the proportion of silent release sites between different [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> concentrations. We have added this consideration as a limitation in the discussion of the manuscript (page 12, lines 7-15). However, the abolishment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx at terminals despite a robust train of action potentials suggests that all release sites within a terminal are simultaneously silenced by this mechanism. Furthermore, the central importance of nerve terminals to neurotransmission, the ability to readily identify them through various targeted fluorescent proteins, and the widespread use of this marker in other studies of silencing underscore its biologic and experimental relevance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

It would be important, in at least one experimental paradigm, to see that release returns to baseline following restoration of external calcium.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for recommending inclusion of this important control experiment. We quantified the percentage of silent terminals and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in neurons that were stimulated initially in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM, then 0.8 mM, and finally returned to 2.0 mM. We observed that both the proportion of silent terminals and the net influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> recovered to their initial values as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> was reverted to its starting level (Figure 3 âfigure supplement 2). Importantly, these results demonstrate that presynaptic silencing is a reversible process that is under the control of [a<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We examined this possibility with neurons expressing GCaMP6f in the cytosol to provide a good morphological fill of the axonal volume and co-expressing mRuby-synapsin to mark terminals. We performed the analysis for [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 0.8 mM, the concentration we hypothesized would most likely cause branch point failure. To provide robust quantification, we limited our analysis to branches with at least 10 nerve terminals. This analysis demonstrates silent and responding terminals on the same branches of an axon, thereby excluding the possibility that these effects are driven by selective changes in excitability (Figure 2 âfigure supplement 2). The overall percentage of silent terminals, though, is similar in this population of branches compared to the results of cell-wide percentages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

Previous studies investigating presynaptic silencing (Kim and Ryan, 2013) utilized a less sensitive genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP3, and compared these measurements to the low-affinity, synthetic calcium dye, Magnesium Green. There was excellent agreement between the dye and GCaMP3, arguing against a limitation of GCaMP in detecting responses. Given the superiority of GCaMP6f to GCaMP3, we would expect a lower proportion of terminals classified as silent in our current experiments compared to the prior publication. However, we found a modest increase in the percentage of silent terminals (~15-20% compared to ~20-30%). We attribute the higher proportion of silent terminals in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM in the current studies to performing experiments at physiologic temperature as opposed to 30Â°C, which narrows the action potential waveform and thereby reduces Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. However, the overall similarity in our current results with this publication argues against a limitation of GCaMP as responsible for the silencing ofa<sup>2+</sup> entry we observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

As suggested, we investigated the effect of GABA<sub>B</sub>R agonism with baclofen on silencing at [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> 2.0 mM to compare to our previous results at 1.2 mM. Interestingly, the net change in percentage of silent terminals is substantially lower at 2.0 mM compared to 1.2 mM (7.6 Â± 3.4% vs 20.5 Â± 4.8%, respectively; Figure 7 âfigure supplement 1).
