therapy. However, the rapid emergence of phage-resistant mutants poses a potential risk. Here, using <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> ATCC 43816 and its lytic phage Kp11 as a model system, we investigated bacterial persistence against phages, characterized by heterogeneous survival, analogous to antibiotic persistence. We found that heat treatment enhanced persistence and increased bacterial survival under phage exposure, subsequently promoting the evolution of phage resistance. Further experiments demonstrated that heat stress leads to a reduction in envelope components, thereby inhibiting phage DNA injection. Additionally, this heat-induced reduction resulted in systematic alterations in envelope stress responses, rendering bacteria tolerant to the antibiotic polymyxin while making them hypersensitive to pH changes and immune clearance. Our findings provide novel insights into bacteria-phage interactions and highlight potential challenges in implementing phage therapy in clinical settings.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Klebsiella pneumoniae</kwd><kwd>phages</kwd><kwd>host-phage interaction</kwd><kwd>heat stress</kwd><kwd>phage tolerance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC2303202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tsing-Pekin Joint Center for Life Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20111770319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tsinghua University Dushi program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20231080044</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Jia-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bacterial persistence against phages enables survival under infection, and heat treatment enhances this tolerance, facilitating resistance evolution and influencing the effectiveness of phage therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to global public health, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative strategies to combat bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luong et al., 2020</xref>).

In analogy with the concept of antibiotic persistence, the majority of bacteria were rapidly eliminated following lytic phage treatment, while a small fraction (~10<sup>–5</sup> to 10<sup>–6</sup>) survived, resulting in a bi-phasic killing curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). However, the bacteria that survived likely comprised both persisters and resistant mutants. To quantitatively distinguish between resisters and persisters, colonies of surviving bacteria post-phage treatment were individually plated on media with and without phage. The fraction of persisters was estimated by subtracting the number of resisters from the total colony-forming units (CFU; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>). Subsequent killing experiments on the descendants of persisters revealed a comparable survival fraction to the ancestral population, suggesting that this survival was not attributable to genetic mutation but rather to phenotypic heterogeneity, that is phage persistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Bacterial persistence against phage infection.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic illustration of the experiments demonstrating the existence of phage persisters.

This increased frequency for bacterial division facilitates the evolution of phage resistance, highlighting the impact of heat treatment on bacterial survival under phage infection.</p></caption></media></fig-group><p>To determine whether heat treatment directly conferred increased phage resistance, we quantified the fraction of phage-resistant mutants before and after heat treatment. Survivors from the phage killing assay were collected and plated on both phage-containing and phage-free plates, with only resistant colonies detectable on the phage-containing plates. Our analysis revealed a negligible presence of resistant mutants in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Consistent with this, mutation rates estimated using Delbrück-Luria tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luria and Delbrück, 1943</xref>) confirmed no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Furthermore, although the survival rate of heat-treated bacteria substantially increased after 2 hours of phage infection, the proportion of phage-resistant mutants remained comparatively small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). These findings indicated that the enhanced defense against phage infection observed following heat treatment was not due to an increase in phage-resistant mutants, but rather reflected a phenotypic boost in survival analogous to antibiotic persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauner et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the observed increase in resistance frequency is due to the cumulative effect of a net increase in survival, similar to how antibiotic tolerance promotes resistance.</p><p>Inspired by this concept, we conducted experiments using a very small bacterial inoculum (~10³) to minimize the presence of preexisting resistant mutants, ensuring that any observed resistance arose during phage infection. To maximize phage-bacteria interactions, we used a high multiplicity of infection (MOI ≥1) and a small culture volume (100 µL). After 24 hr of incubation with or without heat treatment and phages, untreated bacteria were completely eradicated, resulting in clear wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>).

Recent studies have shown that heat shock potentiates aminoglycosides against Gram-negative bacteria by enhancing antibiotic uptake and promoting protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2023</xref>), indicating that heat stress can contribute to bacterial sensitivity to antibiotics, which could also extend to phages in our study.</p><p>This phenomenon may also occur in the heat-tolerant mutant <italic>pspA</italic>*, where the reduction in envelope components resulted in insusceptibility to phages and polymyxins, highlighting a potential regulatory balance governed by PspA. PspA, a key regulator in the phage shock protein system, functions as part of the envelope stress response system in bacteria, preventing membrane depolarization and ensuring the envelope stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flores-Kim and Darwin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horstman and Darwin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kleerebezem and Tommassen, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamaguchi et al., 2010</xref>). Recent studies have shown that PspA is analogous to ESCRT-III, a component of the ESCRT machinery in eukaryotic cells, which plays a crucial role in membrane remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Junglas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial envelope acts both as a defense barrier against external stresses and as a conduit for invaders. While it reduces the invasion of harmful substances and maintains intra-extracellular balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raivio, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wood, 2015</xref>), it also provides contacts for invaders; for example, capsules serve as receptors for phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Latka et al., 2021</xref>), and LPS interacts with polymyxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manioglu et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, heat-induced alteration to the envelope could be a double-edged sword. Clinically, heat stress would not only impact phage susceptibility but also alter the interaction between <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and the host immune system. This dual impact underscores the complexity of bacterial adaptive responses and suggests that environmental factors can significantly influence the outcome of phage therapy. Furthermore, increased sensitivity to acidic conditions and bile salts induced by heat stress challenges bacterial survival, particularly relevant to <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> colonization sites in the human body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gasink et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, the envelope stress responses induced by heat in bacteria lead us to consider the role of fever. We found that heat-induced phage tolerance is both time- and temperature-dependent; even moderately elevated temperatures, such as 42 °C, can induce phage tolerance with prolonged treatment, indicating alterations in the bacterial envelope. This suggests that elevated body temperature, akin to fever, may affect bacterial survival and colonization by modulating their responses to the host immune system and antimicrobial agents. Since elevated temperatures also alter life-history traits in phage communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenrod et al., 2024</xref>), they may similarly impact bacterial responses to heat stress, phage, and antibiotic treatments, underscoring the need for further research into the role of fever in bacterial growth and survival during therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacteria, phages, and plasmids</title><p><italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in this work are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain <italic>DH5α</italic> was used for DNA cloning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seidman and Struhl, 2001</xref>).

Samples were taken at indicated time points, washed three times with PBS buffer, and CFUs were evaluated by plating on LB agar plates before and after phage infection. To determine the persistence fraction and obtain phage persisters, a single colony from post-phage treatment was inoculated into fresh LB broth and grown at 37 °C with shaking at 220 rpm for 6 hr. Then each culture was collected and dropped on solid LB agar plates supplemented with and without phages. Phage persisters were identified as those solely capable of growth on phage-free plates, with the fraction of persisters estimated by subtracting the number of resistant mutants from the total CFUs.

After allowing the bacterial lawn to dry for 15 min, 5 µL of 10-fold serial dilutions of phages in SM buffer were dropped to the lawn. Once the drops had dried, the plates were inverted and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Plaque-forming units (PFUs) were determined by counting the derived plaques after incubation, with lysate titers calculated as PFUs per mL. If no individual plaques could be observed, a faint lysis zone across the drop area was considered equivalent to 10 plaques.

Bacteria in each well were incubated with phages at various MOIs for 24 hr. Given the exceptionally low total bacterial load utilized in this experiment, the potential for phage-resistant bacteria due to stochastic mutations would be minimized. The high MOI guaranteed that each bacterium was likely to be infected by at least one phage particle. Due to the rapid infection and lysis in this system, the probability of observing turbid wells after 24 hr was minimal. The fraction of turbid wells was used to calculate the phage resistance emergence from three biological repeats of 14 replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Time-lapse microscopy and image acquisition</title><p>To observe bacterial dynamics under phage treatment, time-lapse microscopy was performed using an FV3000 with a temperature-controlled stage. <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> cultures with and without heat treatment were exposed to lytic phage Kp11 at an MOI of 100.

However, the paper needs some work in clarifying specific and central conclusions that the authors draw. More specifically, it needs to improve the connection between what is shown in some figures, how these figures are described in the caption, and how they are discussed in the main text. This is especially glaring with respect to the central claim of the paper from the title, namely that tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance. I am sympathetic to that claim, especially because this has been shown elsewhere, not for phage resistance but for antibiotic resistance. However, in the description of the results, this is perhaps the weakest aspect of the paper, so I'm a bit mystified as to why the authors focus on this claim. As I mentioned above, the paper could stand on its own even without this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. We understand your concern regarding the central claim that tolerance facilitates the evolution of resistance, while the paper can stand on its own without this claim, we think it provides an important layer to the interpretation of our findings. Considering your comments, we plan to revise the title and adjust to “Heat Stress Induces Phage Tolerance in Bacteria”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More specific examples where clarification is needed:</p><p>(1) A key figure of the paper seems to be Figure 2D, yet it was one of the most confusing figures. This results from a mismatch between the accompanying text starting on line 92 and the figure itself. The first thing that the reader notices in the figure itself is the huge discrepancy between the number of viable colonies in the absence of phage infection at the two-hour time point. Yet this observation is not even mentioned in the main text. The exclusive focus of the main text seems to be on the right-hand side of the figure, labeled &quot;+Phage&quot;. It is from this right-hand panel that the authors seem to conclude that heat stress facilitates the evolution of resistance. I find this confusing, because there is no difference between the heat-treated and non-treated cells in survivorship, and it is not clear from this data that survivorship is caused by resistance, not by tolerance/persistence. (The difference between tolerance and resistance has only been shown in the independent experiments of Figure 1B.)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your helpful comment. Figure 2d presents colony counts from a plating assay following the phage killing experiment in Figure 2c. Bacteria collected after 0 and 2 hours of phage exposure were plated on both phage-free (−phage) and phage-containing (+phage) plates. The “−phage” condition reflects total survivors, while the “+phage” condition indicates the resistant subset.</p><p>As seen in Figure 2d (left part), heat-treated bacteria showed markedly higher survival on phage-free plates than untreated cells, which were largely eliminated by phage. However, resistant colony counts on phage-containing plates were similar between two groups (as shown in figure 2d right part), suggesting that heat stress increased survival but did not promote resistance.</p><p>To clarify, we have revised the labels in Figure 2d as follows: “Total” will replace “-phage” to indicate the total survivors from the phage killing assay, and “Resisters” will replace “+phage” to indicate the resistant survivors, which are detected on phage-containing plates. This adjustment should eliminate any confusion and better reflect the experimental design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2F supports the resistance claim, but it is not one of the strongest experiments of the paper, because the author simply only used &quot;turbidity&quot; as an indicator of resistance. In addition, the authors performed the experiments described therein at small population sizes to avoid the presence of resistance mutations. But how do we know that the turbidity they describe does not result from persisters?</p><p>I see three possibilities to address these issues. First, perhaps this is all a matter of explaining and motivating this particular experiment better. Second, the central claim of the paper may require additional experiments. For example, is it possible to block heat induced tolerance through specific mutations, and show that phage resistance does not evolve as rapidly if tolerance is blocked? A third possibility is to tone down the claim of the paper and make it about heat tolerance rather than the evolution of heat resistance.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the interpretation of Figure 2f and the rationale behind the experimental design. We agree that turbidity alone cannot fully distinguish resistance from persistence. However, our earlier experiments (Figures 2d and 2e) demonstrated that heat-treated survivors remained largely susceptible to phage, indicating that heat stress does not directly induce resistance. This led us to hypothesize that heat enhances phage tolerance, which in turn increases the likelihood of resistance emergence during subsequent infection.</p><p>To test this, we used a low initial bacterial population (~10³ CFU per well) to minimize the chance of pre-existing resistance. Bacteria were exposed to phages at MOIs of 1, 10, and 100 and incubated for 24 hours in 100 µL volumes. This setup ensured:</p><p>(1) The low initial population minimizes the presence of pre-existing resistant mutants, ensuring that any phage-resistant bacteria observed arise during the infection process.</p><p>(2) The high MOI (≥ 1) ensures that each bacterial cell has a high probability of infection by at least one phage.</p><p>(3) The small volume (100 µL per well) maximizes the interaction between bacteria and phages, ensuring rapid infection of susceptible bacteria, which leads to clear wells. If resistant mutants arise, they will grow and cause turbidity.</p><p>Thus, the turbidity observed in heat-treated samples reflects de novo emergence and outgrowth of resistant mutants from a tolerant population. This assay supports the idea that heat-induced tolerance increases the probability of resistance evolution, rather than directly causing resistance.</p><p>We have revised the text to better explain this experimental logic and adjust the framing of our conclusions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A minor but general point here is that in Figure 2D and in other figures, the labels &quot;-phage&quot; and &quot;+phage&quot; do not facilitate understanding, because they suggest that cells in the &quot;-phage&quot; treatment have not been exposed to phage at all, but that is not the case. They have survived previous phage treatment and are then replated on media lacking phage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. To clarify, we have revised the labels in Figure 2d as follows: “Total” will replace “-phage” to indicate the total survivors from the phage killing assay, and “Resisters” will replace “+phage” to indicate the resistant survivors, which are detected on phage-containing plates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Another figure with a mismatch between text and visual materials is Figure 5, specifically Figures 5B-F. The figure is about two different mutants, and it is not even mentioned in the text how these mutants were identified, for example in different or the same replicate populations. What is more, the two mutants are not discussed at all in the main text. That is, the text, starting on line 221 discusses these experiments as if there was only one mutant. This is especially striking as the two mutants behave very differently, as, for example, in Figure 5C. Implicitly, the text talks about the mutant ending in &quot;...C2&quot;, and not the one ending in &quot;...C1&quot;. To add to the confusion, the text states that the (C2) mutant shows a change in the pspA gene, but in Figure 5f, it is the other (undiscussed) mutant that has a mutation in this gene. Only pspA is discussed further, so what about the other mutants? More generally, it is hard to believe that these were the only mutants that occurred in the genome during experimental evolution. It would be useful to give the reader a 2-3 sentence summary of the genetic diversity that experimental evolution generated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. In our heat treatment evolutionary experiment, we isolated six distinct bacterial clones, of which two are highlighted in the manuscript as representative examples. One clone, BC2G11C1, acquired both heat tolerance and phage resistance, while another clone, BC3G11C2, became heat-tolerant but did not develop resistance to phage infection. This variation highlights the inherent diversity in evolutionary responses when exposed to selective pressures. It demonstrates that not all evolutionary pathways lead to the same outcome, even under similar stress conditions. This variability is a key observation in our study, illustrating that different genetic adaptations may arise depending on the specific mutations or genetic context, and not every strain will evolve phage resistance in parallel with heat tolerance. We have updated the manuscript to better reflect this diversity in the evolutionary trajectories observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>An initial screening of pretreatment with different stress treatments of K. pneumoniae allowed the identification of heat stress as a protection factor against the infection of the lytic phage Kp11.

(2024) into the discussion to enrich the context of our findings. As this article pointed out, a temperature of 42°C can indeed limit phage infection in bacteria, acting as a barrier from the phage’s perspective. Our study builds on this by demonstrating that bacteria pre-treated with high temperatures exhibit tolerance to phage infection. These findings, together with the work you referenced, underscore the importance of heat stress or elevated temperature in host-phage interactions, with 42°C being particularly relevant in the context of fever.

(2023) into the discussion of our manuscript, highlighting how sublethal temperatures may facilitate the killing of bacteria by antibiotics like kanamycin. This is consistent with our data showing enhanced susceptibility of heat-shocked bacteria to kanamycin. The study also provides insights into the potential role of PMF, which is relevant to our work on PspA, and strengthens the broader context of heat stress influencing both antibiotic resistance and tolerance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Perhaps the most relevant overlooked fact was that recently it was demonstrated for <italic>E. coli</italic>, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas that pretreatment with lytic phages induced antibiotic persistence!

While our manuscript focuses on the role of heat stress in bacterial tolerance and resistance, we acknowledge that bacterial persistence against phages is an established concept. We have incorporated this finding into our discussion, emphasizing how persistence and tolerance can overlap in their effects on bacterial survival, especially under stress conditions like heat treatment. This will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how phage interactions with bacteria can lead to both persistence and resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Finally, you observed a tradeoff pf the pspA* mutant increased phage/heat/polymyxin resistance and decreased immune evasion (perhaps by being unable to counteract phagocytosis), those tradeoffs between gaining phage resistance but losing resistance to the immune system, virulence impairment and resistance against some antibiotics had been extensively documented, see:</p><p>Majkowska-Skrobek G, Markwitz P, Sosnowska E, Lood C, Lavigne R, Drulis-Kawa Z.

The findings in these studies, which describe the cross-sensitization to antimicrobials and the loss of multidrug resistance in phage-resistant bacteria, align with our observations of trade-offs in the <italic>pspA</italic> mutant. Specifically, our results show that while the <italic>pspA</italic> mutant exhibits increased resistance to phage, heat, and polymyxins, it also experiences a decrease in immune evasion and potential virulence. These trade-offs are significant in understanding the broader consequences of developing resistance to phages and other stressors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
