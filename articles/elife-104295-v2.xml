Herein, we show unique properties of zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> mutants in which spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) do not differentiate or upregulate rRNAs.

Further, Piwil1 interacted with Setdb1 and HP1α, and <italic>meioc<sup>-/-</sup></italic> spermatogonia exhibited high levels of H3K9me3 and methylated CpG in the 45S-rDNA region. These results indicate that zebrafish SSCs maintain low levels of rRNA transcription with repressive marks similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> piRNA targets of RNA polymerase II, and that Meioc has a unique function on preventing localization of Piwil1 in nucleoli to upregulate rRNA transcripts and to promote SSC differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spermatogonial stem cell</kwd><kwd>rRNA transcription</kwd><kwd>meioc</kwd><kwd>piwil1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP23116709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakai</surname><given-names>Noriyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Jst-A step JPMJTR204F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakai</surname><given-names>Noriyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The UMB Initiative for Maximizing Student Development program, NIH award R25 GM076321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramos</surname><given-names>Carina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25251034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakai</surname><given-names>Noriyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP25114003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakai</surname><given-names>Noriyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004091</institution-id><institution>Kumamoto University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Inter-University Research Network for High Depth Omics, IMEG, Kumamoto University</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakai</surname><given-names>Noriyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R15HD107594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Siegfried</surname><given-names>Kellee R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analyses of zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> mutants revealed that spermatogonial stem cells with low rRNA transcription caused by nucleolar Piwil1 require Meioc to keep Piwil1 in cytoplasm for the upregulation of rRNA transcription necessary for differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The maintenance and control of the differentiation of adult stem cells are indispensable for living animals. In this decade, the relationship between the stem cell system and translation activity control has been revealed. Compared with that of differentiating progenitor cells, the global translation activity is relatively lowered in most adult and embryonic stem (ES) cells, and low translation activity is required for stem cells to maintain undifferentiated status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ni and Buszczak, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saba et al., 2021</xref>). Despite this common feature of low translational activity, differences in the state of ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) have been observed across stem cell types. ES cells, hair follicle stem cells, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> germline stem cells (GSCs) are characterized by high levels of RiBi, whereas quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) have low levels of RiBi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Llorens-Bobadilla et al., 2015</xref>). Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have higher RiBi levels than differentiated bone marrow cells, but they have lower RiBi levels than their immediate progenitors, suggesting that cell type-specific mechanisms may regulate RiBi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarzebowski et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, phenotypes of RiBi defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GSCs appear to be controversial; attenuation of Pol I activity and the U3 snoRNP complex member <italic>wiched</italic> (<italic>wcd</italic>) mutant show premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fichelson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), while knockdown of ribosome assembly and loss of DExD/H-box proteins (Aramis, Athos, and Porthos) that govern RiBi result in a loss of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, the mechanisms by which RiBi is coupled to low translational activity and proper stem cell differentiation are still obscure.</p><p>By using an ENU mutagenesis screen to identify gonadogenesis defects in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2011</xref>), we isolated a unique mutant, <italic>minamoto</italic> (<italic>moto</italic>), in which germ cells arrest at the early stage of spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). By whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we found that the <italic>moto</italic> phenotype is tightly linked to a mutation within a gene (ENSDARG00000090664) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowen et al., 2012</xref>), which encodes the coiled-coil domain-containing protein Meioc. Database analysis shows orthologs of MEIOC in vertebrates and most invertebrates, but not in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The mouse MEIOC functions to maintain an extended meiotic prophase I with its binding partner YTHDC2 (YTH-domain containing 2), which is a 3'–5' RNA helicase containing an RNA helicase motif and YT521-B homology (YTH) RNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abby et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soh et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, a <italic>Drosophila</italic> complex of <italic>bam</italic> (<italic>bag of marbles</italic>), a divergent homolog of <italic>Meioc</italic> sharing conserved amino acid sequences within the coiled-coil domain, and <italic>bgcn</italic> (<italic>benign gonial cell neoplasm</italic>), a paralog of <italic>Ythdc2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain et al., 2018</xref>), plays a pivotal role in promoting stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Perinthottathil and Kim, 2011</xref>). Although zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> (<italic>moto</italic>) is orthologous to the mice gene, it appears to be functionally similar to <italic>Drosophila bam</italic>, making it interesting to see how it controls the development of germ cells.</p><p>The present study revealed that zebrafish had spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) with low rRNA transcription, a characteristic that differed from many other stem cells, and that Meioc was required for upregulation of rRNA transcription and SSC differentiation. Independently of Ythdc2, Meioc regulated intracellular localization of the Argonaute/Piwi family protein Piwil1 (Piwi-like protein 1) that interacted with transcriptional silencing proteins, Setdb1 (Eggless) and HP1α (Cbx5). Our results suggested that low rRNA transcription maintained the undifferentiated state of zebrafish SSCs, providing a new insight on the relationship between the stem cell system and the RiBi control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Failure to differentiate spermatogonia in the zebrafish <italic>meioc</italic> mutant</title><p>In fish testes, germ cells are surrounded by Sertoli cells within a basement membrane compartment and develop synchronously in cysts. Thus, the developmental stage of spermatogonia can be determined by the number of cells within the cyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type spermatogonial cells undergo nine rounds of cell division before entering meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Leal et al., 2009</xref>); however, <italic>moto<sup>t31533</sup></italic> mutant testes had only up to three rounds of division, containing 2–8 spermatogonia per cyst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mutant spermatogonia were positive for the undifferentiated spermatogonia marker, Plzf, which is expressed in single- to 8-cell (1- to 8-cell) cyst spermatogonia in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ozaki et al., 2011</xref>), but negative for meiotic prophase I markers, Sycp1 and Sycp3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2011</xref>). Histone H3 phospho-S10 immunostaining indicated that mutant spermatogonia proliferated, but apoptotic cells were increased in the mutant spermatogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In zebrafish, mutants disrupting early stages of oocyte development become male (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Saito et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Houwing et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kamminga et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodríguez-Marí et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shive et al., 2010</xref>).

Furthermore, high levels of H3K9me3 and HP1α correlated with higher levels of nucleolar Piwil1. This is similar to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Piwi in piRNA-dependent gene silencing for Pol II transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jia et al., 2022</xref>). These data support the model that nucleolar Piwil1 interacts with Setdb1 in the nucleolus to maintain low levels of rRNA transcription via H3K9me3 and recruiting HP1α while Meioc promotes differentiation by blocking Piwil1 nucleolar localization and allowing rRNA transcription. The epigenetic state of tandem repeats of the zebrafish rDNA IGS region was similar to human silenced rDNA with CpG hypermethylation, levels of H3K9me3, and HP1α association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grummt, 2007</xref>).

In addition to different timing of phenotype expression between mice and zebrafish, the amino acid sequence of Meioc between mice and zebrafish is not well conserved (28.5%), while that of Ythdc2 is well conserved (65.5%). It is likely that zebrafish Meioc have different binding partners and regulate different processes of germ cell development from mouse MEIOC, causing the distinct phenotypes between these mutants.

For example, 1-2 cell spermatogonia is used in Figure 1C, GSC is used in Figure 1F, and SSC is used in Figure 1 legend. The use of all three terms without definitions as to how they each relate with one another is confusing, particularly to those outside the zebrafish spermatogenesis field. It would be best to only use one term if the three terms are used interchangeably or to define each term if they represent different populations.</p></disp-quote><p>GSC is a writing mistake. In this study, <italic>sox17</italic>-positive cells, which have been confirmed to self-renew and differentiate (Kawasaki et al., 2016), are considered SSCs.
