As a result, excess stress may predispose people to fall ill more often or age faster. It is difficult to measure stress. Some studies suggest that measuring the ends of chromosomes, known as telomeres, may be one way to measure stress. Like the plastic tips on shoelaces, telomeres protect chromosomes from fraying. All peoplesâ telomeres shorten over their lifetime with each cell division. Many studies show that telomeres shorten faster in people who experience more stress. When telomeres become too short, cells die faster without being replaced, and the body ages.</p><p>Most studies on telomere length have looked at adults. Few studies have looked at children early in life or asked whether there are ways to intervene to stop or reverse stress-related telomere shortening. The first two years of life are a crucial period for the developing brain and immune system, which could set children on a lifelong course toward health or disease. Young children living in low-resource settings often encounter many sources of stress, like poor nutrition, infectious diseases or violence. Studies are needed to determine if interventions in early childhood aimed at reducing some sources of stress improve telomere length or long-term health.</p><p>Now, Lin et al. show that interventions to provide safe water, sanitation, handwashing facilities, and better nutrition to children in rural Bangladesh unexpectedly shortened telomeres. As part of a larger study, pregnant women in rural Bangladesh were divided, at random, into groups. One group received a suite of interventions, which included more sanitary toilets, handwashing facilities, and nutritional supplements for their infants. Another group served as a control and did not receive this extra help. Lin et al. looked at telomere length, growth, and infections in a subset of 713 children whose mothers participated in the study.</p><p>Children who got the extra help grew faster and were less likely to get diarrhea or parasitic infections than the children in the control group. Unexpectedly, children in the intervention group had shorter telomeres at 14 months of age than the children in the control group. Lin et al. suggest that the telomere shortening in the intervention group might be a consequence of rapid growth and immune system development in the first year of life rather than resulting from biological stress. More studies are needed to ask whether telomere shortening is indeed linked to faster growth and development early in life. The strong and unexpected findings highlight how little is known about how the length of telomeres can be used to predict future health or disease. Interpreting the length of telomeres over a personâs lifetime could prove more nuanced than originally thought.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>telomere length</kwd><kwd>child intervention</kwd><kwd>low-income</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>water, sanitation, hygiene</kwd><kwd>nutrition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Global Development Grant (OPPGD759)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Colford</surname><given-names>John M</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder approved the study design, but was not involved in data collection, analysis, interpretation or any decisions related to publication.

During early life, children exhibit heightened developmental plasticity and are more sensitive to environmental conditions than later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker, 2007</xref>). The theory of developmental origins of health and disease postulates that multiple, cumulative early life exposures to adverse environmental factors may increase allostatic load (the cumulative biological damage from chronic stress) and susceptibility to adult diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juster et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Accumulating evidence implicates telomere length (TL) attrition as a potentially important underlying mechanism that links early life insults with adverse health outcomes later in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2013</xref>). Telomeres, the repetitive DNA sequences and protein complexes protecting the ends of linear chromosomes, gradually shorten during normal cell division. Progressive telomere shortening leads to chromosome instability and cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackburn, 2001</xref>). Shorter TL has been linked to several age-related conditions including diabetes, heart disease, and early mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cawthon et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzpatrick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salpea et al., 2010</xref>). It remains an open debate whether TL serves as a âmolecular clockâ that gauges cumulative stress exposures over a lifespan or plays a role in the etiology of various diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blackburn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hamad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhan et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Acute or chronic infections may contribute to childhood TL attrition, and inflammation and oxidative stress may be potential mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houben et al., 2008</xref>). Infections may induce T-cell proliferation and accelerated telomere attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aviv, 2004</xref>). Although no studies have directly investigated the relationship between infection and childhood TL, related studies in adults and animals support the plausibility of an association. Animal models have demonstrated that repeated exposures to <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> cause telomere attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ilmonen et al., 2008</xref>), and prenatal chronic malaria infections shorten offspring TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghar et al., 2015</xref>). In adult humans, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and experimentally induced respiratory infection have been associated with shorter TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cohen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gianesin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zanet et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, caregiver-reported diarrhea in the first two years of life predicted shorter adult TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Early life water, sanitation, and handwashing (WSH) interventions could potentially prevent or reduce infections and slow telomere attrition. A systematic review and meta-analysis of WSH interventions reported a reduction in diarrheal illness (pooled estimate of relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 0.59â0.76) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fewtrell et al., 2005</xref>), and a randomized controlled trial in Pakistan showed that promotion of handwashing decreased acute respiratory infections in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luby et al., 2005</xref>). To our knowledge, no studies have examined the impact of WSH interventions on TL.</p><p>Early life nutrition may affect childhood TL. Breast milk could potentially reduce telomere attrition by protecting against inflammation and oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cacho and Lawrence, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matos et al., 2015</xref>) â exposures associated with telomere attrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Houben et al., 2008</xref>). Studies have found an association between exclusive breastfeeding and preschool TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wojcicki et al., 2016a</xref>), but no association with adult TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Improved intake of micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) may promote telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bull and Fenech, 2008</xref>). Studies in adult populations have found mixed evidence for associations between TL, multivitamin usage, and various micronutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cassidy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paul et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Richards et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials have assessed the effect of nutritional interventions on child TL.</p><p>Telomeres shorten fourfold faster in infants compared to adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zeichner et al., 1999</xref>); however, only a few studies have assessed the potential associations between environmental factors and TL in early childhood, a sensitive window of growth and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Entringer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marchetto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Theall et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Theall et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wojcicki et al., 2016a</xref>). The trajectories of infant TL in low-income countries and the potential impact of early life health-improvement interventions on TL are unknown. We conducted a substudy within a randomized trial in rural Bangladesh to evaluate if an intensive, early life nutrition, water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention would slow telomere attrition among children in their first two years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The objective of the WASH Benefits trial was to compare the effects of individual and combined interventions on child health in the first two years of life â the critical window to prevent growth faltering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). Between 31 May 2012 and 7 July 2013, in the overall trial, 5551 compounds (collections of related households) with pregnant women in their first or second trimester were randomly allocated to one of the six intervention groups or a double sized control group as follows: (1) chlorinated drinking water and safe storage vessel, (2) upgraded sanitation (child potties, sani-scoop hoes to remove feces, and a double pit latrine with a hygienic water seal), (3) handwashing promotion (handwashing stations with detergent soap), (4) combined waterÂ +Â sanitationÂ + handwashing (5) nutrition (lipid-based nutrient supplements and age-appropriate recommendations on maternal nutrition and infant feeding practices), (6) combined nutritionÂ +Â waterÂ + sanitationÂ +Â handwashing (NÂ +Â WSH), (7) control group, which did not receive any interventions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Community health promoters visited study compounds in the intervention arms to promote behaviors. We conducted a substudy within the trial to evaluate if the NÂ +Â WSH intervention would slow telomere attrition among children in their first two years of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). The substudy team visited 996 index children after 1 year of intervention (Y1) and 1021 children after 2 years of intervention (Y2) in the control and NÂ +Â WSH arms only. TL outcomes were measured in 66.5% of the children (NÂ =Â 662) at Y1% and 69.8% of the children (NÂ =Â 713) at Y2, but not at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We expect TL at birth to be similar for the intervention and control arms because household enrollment characteristics were balanced between both arms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table

In rural Bangladesh, an intensive, combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention delivered to compounds of newborn children increased TL attrition during the critical first year of life. This result is contrary to many studies that reported increased TL attrition associated with prenatal psychosocial stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Entringer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marchetto et al., 2016</xref>), childhood institutional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drury et al., 2012</xref>), disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzpatrick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salpea et al., 2010</xref>), and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cawthon et al., 2003</xref>); however, these prior studies did not examine participants in the same age range (1â2 years) as this study. The difference between the intervention and control arms in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was borderline significant, and at Y2, we found no difference in relative TL between the arms. In high- and low-resource settings, there is a dearth of evidence on the effect of environmental exposures on TL trajectories in this age range and its implications for adult health outcomes.</p><p>The accelerated TL attrition observed during the first year of life in the intervention arm may reflect improved immune system development. The WASH Benefits trial found that children in the intervention arm had reductions in caregiver-reported diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth infections, and <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> infections compared with the control arm (S. P. Luby <italic>et al.</italic>, A. Ercumen <italic>et al.</italic>, and A. Lin <italic>et al.</italic> in review). It is plausible that the interventions improved immune system development resulting in subsequent protection against infections or that the decreased exposure to pathogens may have improved immunity. The concept of accelerated TL attrition during the first year of life as a reflection of better immune system development is consistent with studies that have reported rapid telomere attrition and accelerated differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), stem cells that give rise to all lineages of immune cells, during the first year of life. A healthy individual experiencesÂ ~Â 17 HSC divisions in the first year of life, followed byÂ ~2.5 divisions/year between ages 3â13 years, andÂ ~0.6 divisions/year in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rufer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sidorov et al., 2009</xref>). Since TL shortens in proportion to the number of cell replications, HSC progenitor divisions correspond with TL attrition rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Elwood, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kimura et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rufer et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sidorov et al., 2009</xref>). In the first year of life, children in the control group with poor immune system development would potentially experience less HSC divisions and slower rates of TL attrition compared to the intervention group.</p><p>The accelerated TL attrition during the first year of life in the intervention arm may also reflect better linear growth. The intervention improved child linear growth at both Y1 and Y2 measurements (S. P. Luby <italic>et al.</italic> in review). An evolutionary adaptation of organisms during infections is to restrict growth, and instead redirect nutrients and energy to ensure survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">O'Connor et al., 2008</xref>). We postulate that the decreased pathogen exposure and the subsequent reduction in acquired infections are potential mechanisms by which better growth was attained in the intervention arm. Some studies have reported high synchrony between peripheral blood and TL attrition rates within other somatic tissues in the same individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Takubo et al., 2002</xref>), while others have found differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dlouha et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thomas et al., 2008</xref>). Although the results of these prior investigations are equivocal, the accelerated peripheral blood TL attrition in the intervention group during the first year of life could potentially indicate rapid muscle or bone cell division involved in growth. We hypothesize that early life TL may be a proxy measure for growth and development of the immune system, the brain, and other vital tissues. Forthcoming WASH Benefits studies focused on child inflammation and enteric pathogen burden will provide evidence on mechanistic pathways leading to different TL, growth, and development outcomes.</p><p>After the initial period of rapid linear growth during Y1, our borderline significant finding that telomere length increased in the intervention arm and decreased in the control arm from Y1 to Y2 seems to represent a preview of the TL trajectories that are set: we hypothesize that the intervention children will experience slower lifetime TL attrition and more physiological resistance to stress-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Juster et al., 2010</xref>). The change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was small (0.04 T/S 95% confidence interval 0.00, 0.08) and the p-value borderline (p=0.050). Nevertheless, our diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth, <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic>, and growth results suggest that these interventions are potentially interrupting key infection and malnutrition pathways to reduce exposure to biological adversity and allostatic load (S. P. Luby <italic>et al.</italic>, A. Ercumen <italic>et al.</italic>, and A. Lin <italic>et al.</italic> in review). In a Filipino cohort, decreased infant diarrheal prevalence was associated with longer adult TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eisenberg et al., 2017</xref>). In observational studies, various vitamins were associated with longer adult TL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), and early exclusive breastfeeding was associated with longer child TL at ages 4â5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wojcicki et al., 2016a</xref>). Our nutrition intervention included promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and micronutrient fortified lipid-based nutrient supplements. The Y1 to Y2 changes in TL that we observed are consistent with these studies. The smaller than expected treatment effect and the borderline p-value indicate that the trial was slightly underpowered to detect differences in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 among the intervention and control groups.</p><p>Alternatively, our finding of a modest, borderline impact from Y1 to Y2 may suggest that the effect of the interventions is diminished in children over 1 year of age. This potential waning of intervention effects as a child ages could be due to less consumption of breast milk and thus, reductions in its protective effects or the increased mobility of children in environments contaminated with animal feces. This interpretation would also be consistent with no differences in relative TL observed at Y2 between the two groups, underscoring the importance of targeting interventions early in life during the sensitive period when they are likely to have the largest impact on childhood TL.</p><p>This study had several limitations. These results from a rural, low-resource area in Bangladesh may not generalize to other populations. The lack of geographic matching in the substudy could have resulted in imbalances between study arms in factors associated with geography. In addition, differential loss to follow-up in the control and intervention arms may have biased results due to differences in unmeasured characteristics. However, our IPCW analysis showed that bias from loss to follow-up was unlikely based on a large set of measurable characteristics. The lithium heparin additive in the whole blood may have inhibited the qPCR reaction and the long duration of time from sample collection to TL measurement may have affected TL, but any systematic measurement errors would likely affect both study groups equally. These factors may provide potential explanations for the shorter average TL observed in this study compared to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Factor-Litvak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frenck et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wojcicki et al., 2016a</xref>). We only measured TL in whole blood, which might yield different results compared to TL measured in less proliferative tissue types (e.g., muscle or fat) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daniali et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, we did not measure TL at birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wojcicki et al., 2016b</xref>), but we would expect it to be similar for both groups because household characteristics were balanced by randomization.</p><p>Our findings are surprising, and they represent important contributions to the nascent and rapidly expanding field of infant telomere biology. Most studies to date have highlighted shorter TL as a measure of intrauterine or childhood stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drury et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Entringer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Marchetto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2013</xref>), disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzpatrick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salpea et al., 2010</xref>), and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cawthon et al., 2003</xref>). However, our results motivate an intriguing hypothesis: here, we suggest that during the first year of life, accelerated TL attrition could reflect better child growth, neurodevelopment, and immune function. Although TL was a sensitive outcome that responded to an intervention, this trial underscores our limited understanding of environmental exposures contributing to TL dynamics during early life and the critical physiological pathways linking TL and lifelong health trajectories. Since potential confounding could plague observational studies, evaluating the relationship between modifiable exposures and TL within the context of randomized controlled trials could provide valuable contributions to the field of telomere biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MaterialsÂ andÂ methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a cluster-randomized trial in the rural subdistricts in Gazipur, Mymensingh, Tangail and Kishoreganj districts of Bangladesh.

The average coefficient of variation for TL measurement in this study was 2.1%.</p><p>Tubes containing 26, 8.75, 2.9, 0.97, 0.324 and 0.108 ng of a reference DNA (pooled genomic DNA from 100 females) were included in each PCR run so that the quantity of targeted templates in each research sample could be determined relative to the reference DNA sample by the standard curve method. The same reference DNA was used for all PCR runs. To control for inter-assay variability, eight control DNA samples were included in each run. In each batch, the T/S ratio of each control DNA was divided by the average T/S for the same DNA from 10 runs to calculate a normalizing factor. This is done for all eight samples and the average normalizing factor for all eight samples was used to correct the participant DNA samples to calculate the final T/S ratio. The assay was performed as plates of 96 samples. Control and intervention samples were randomly interspersed to minimize potential plate effects. DNA extraction and TL assay were performed in two batches (3.5 months apart). The first batch contained 663 samples and the second batch contained 721 samples. All assays were performed using the same lots of reagents. To adjust for assay batch variations, 48 samples from the first batch were re-assayed together with the second batch of samples and data from the second batch of samples were adjusted based on the systematic difference between the first batch values versus the second batch values for these 48 samples. This adjustment factor was 1.05.</p><p>To determine the conversion factor for the calculation of approximate base pair telomere length from T/S ratio, the above method was used to determine the T/S ratios, relative to the same reference DNA, for a set of genomic DNA samples from the ATCC authenticated human fibroblast primary cell line IMR-90 (ATCC: CCL-186, cell line authentication method: STR profiling; ATCC determined the cell line was free of mycoplasma contamination) at different population doublings, as well as with the telomerase protein subunit gene (hTERT) transfected into a lentiviral construct. The mean TRF length from these DNA samples was determined using Southern blot analysis. Comparison of T/S ratios versus base pairs derived from the Southern blot analysis generated the following equation for conversion from T/S ratio to base pairs: base pairsÂ =Â 3274Â +Â 2413 * (T/S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farzaneh-Far et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The pre-specified outcome measures were TL (T/S ratios) measured at 1 year and 2 years after intervention delivery (Y1 and Y2 respectively), and the change in TL from Y1 to Y2.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The complete pre-registered analysis protocol is available (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/cjjwa/">https://osf.io/cjjwa/</ext-link>). We provide a summary of our analyses below. Analyses were conducted using R statistical software version 3.2.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Assuming a standard deviation of 887 base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Entringer et al., 2013</xref>), a range of cluster-level intra-class correlations for repeated measures (0.01 to 0.20), and a two-sided alpha of 5%, the substudy had 90% power to detect a 207 to 273 base pair difference between the NÂ +Â WSH arm and the control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Statistical parameters</title><p>All analyses were intention-to-treat. We compared the NÂ +Â WSH arm versus the control separately at each time point: 1 year after intervention initiation (Y1; median age 14 months) and 2 years after intervention initiation (Y2; median age 28 months). Between the NÂ +Â WSH versus control arms, we also compared the change in TL between Y1 and Y2.</p><p>The pre-registered analytic approach for these analyses generally followed the same methods as described for the main trial outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). We used generalized linear models with robust standard errors that account for repeated measures within clusters and reported two-tailed p-values. Randomization led to balance in observed covariates across arms, so, in accordance with our pre-specified analysis plan, we relied on the unadjusted analysis as our primary analysis for the TL outcomes. We conducted two sets of secondary adjusted analyses: (1) adjusted for child age and sex only and (2) fully adjusted for child age, sex, and significantly related covariates (likelihood ratio test p-value&lt;0.20).</p><p>We conducted a pre-specified subgroup analysis stratified by sex because biological differences, differential care practices, or other behavioral practices could modify the effect of the combined NÂ +Â WSH intervention when stratifying by gender.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Missing outcomes</title><p>The study carefully tracked enrolled participants and the recovery rates of whole blood specimens per participant. We compared rates of missing blood specimens across randomized arms and also the characteristics of those with missing specimens versus those with a full set of specimens to determine whether missing specimen rates were random. Using the full data (from the main trial) of enrolled mothers in the double-sized control and NÂ +Â WSH arms, as if every index child with a live birth had TL measured, we used inverse probability weighting to correct for potential bias due to informative censoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2012</xref>). The inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) approach follows best practices for removing potential bias owing to missing outcome measurements in trials, according to a definitive methodologic review conducted by the National Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2012</xref>). Logistic regression models were used to predict the probability of TL measurement given baseline characteristics. The baseline characteristics used to fit the models were selected by the same covariate prescreening method used in the fully adjusted analysis. TL differences between the control and intervention group were then estimated using adjusted linear regression weighted by the inverse probability of TL measurement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Registration</title><p>The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01590095).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The funder approved the study design, but was not involved in data collection, analysis, interpretation or any decisions related to publication.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Eduardo Franco as Reviewing Editor and Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Comments from the reviewers were edited for brevity but the first-person form was kept whenever useful to emphasize a point. Please note that the main points in the compiled critique below are grouped by heading but they may imply corrections or additions at different sections in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents the results of a randomized controlled trial of a nutrition and sanitation intervention in Bangladesh, examining its effects on telomere length and telomere attrition. The results are intriguing and suggest telomere length may be affected by healthy interventions in the first years of life and lead to improved growth. The central element of the investigation was a relatively large (n=713) longitudinal cohort substudy based on multiple hygiene measures in impoverished households. The authors compared white blood cell (WBC) telomere length (T/S ratio) at 2 time points in young children from control and intervention households. Linear growth of the intervention group improved. Relative to controls, WBC T/S ratio was shorter after 1 year of intervention and similar between groups after 2 years. Between the 2 time points T/S ratio increased in the intervention group and decreased in the controls, a significant difference. In contrast with their hypotheses and other literature, results support an association between rapid growth (reflecting better health) in very early life and telomere shortening.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The overarching concerns that should orient the revision are:</p><p>1) There should be significant re-framing of the Introduction (i.e., this is a nutrition/sanitation intervention but the authors primarily discuss &quot;adversity&quot;).</p><p>2) There should be additional analyses to investigate differential loss to follow-up, which is a major source of bias.</p><p>3) The results should be reframed as primarily null, emphasizing the more robust models rather than the unadjusted results.</p><p>4) More detail must be added to the Materials and methods section regarding blood processing, calculation of telomere length (as absolute base pairs â which are short for newborns/infants, etc.).</p><p>5) Discussion on potential mechanisms for the findings, including sources of bias.</p><p>Title:</p><p>The title as presented is not very descriptive. It should specify that the study is a nutrition and sanitation intervention, as opposed to generically stating &quot;early life&quot; intervention.</p><p>Methodological concerns relative to study design:</p><p>1) There needs to be more description of the intervention up front, especially since the results may be heavily influenced by the mechanisms through which the intervention is expected to operate. If not in the Results, then at the end of the Introduction. Otherwise it's hard to understand why such an intervention would influence TL and how.</p><p>2) It is unclear from the wording whether the control arm is group (1) or an entirely different group that received no intervention. (Results, first paragraph). (In the Materials and methods, a 7th control arm is a listed, which might be a better way to describe it here.)</p><p>3) Why weren't the other subjects in the intervention arms included for telomere analysis?</p><p>4) Why the focus on adversity? Are there other studies linking TL with nutrition, sanitation, infectious disease, or other exposures more relevant to this intervention?</p><p>5) Does this analysis only include children who were interviewed in both Time 1 and Time 2? If so, what percent of the total number of children do these represent? (I.e., how much overlap was there between the 66.5% in wave 1 and the 69.8% in wave 2?)</p><p>6) The Introduction suggests that TL may play a causal role in the etiology of disease (Introduction, end of first paragraph), although current evidence does not suggest that this is necessarily the case since most studies are associational. It's important to note that there are questions as to whether TL is simply associated with disease outcomes or actually a cause, particularly in recent Mendelian randomization studies, e.g., Cui et al., Atherosclerosis 2014; Hamad and Rehkopf, Experimental Gerontology 2016; Zhan et al., JAMA Neurology 2015. Perhaps soften this language and add to the discussion of study implications, i.e., we don't really know what the long-term causal implications are for shorter or longer telomeres.</p><p>7) Figure 1: Why were new children added to the treatment arm?</p><p>8) It's not clear how long the intervention operated, e.g., how long health promoters visited the compounds, whether the structural changes continued to be available throughout. I know that there is a citation to another paper that describes it in more detail, but we need a bit more detail here to understand why this intervention might influence TL.</p><p>Methodological concerns relative to measurement of telomere length:</p><p>1) More information and data should be included on how the telomere length (in bps) was calculated. 6763 bp is short for infants.</p><p>2) Has it been validated to wait so long from sample collection to measurement of TL (subsection âProceduresâ, last paragraph)? If not, this is a limitation.</p><p>3) Were there differences in the month in which the treatment and control groups were measured? If so, there are known seasonal differences in TL at leukocytes at least (Rehkopf et al., AJHB 2014). Please discuss.</p><p>4) The blood sample for telomere length (by PCR) was stated to be lithium heparin, yet heparin inhibits PCR reactions. Sometimes this can be overcome by use of heparinise. Can the authors please clarify the type of specimen used, and if it was Li-heparin how this may have impacted the key results.</p><p>5) How measuring TL in leucocytes might influence the results, if the proposed mechanism of the intervention is largely infectious or nutritional? This should be listed as a limitation also, since TL measured in different tissues might yield different results based on a given intervention's mechanisms.</p><p>Concerns related to analysis and interpretation:</p><p>1) A critical issue is that unadjusted results are presented as the primary, and it is stated that the adjusted and IPCW results are &quot;similar&quot; (Results, fourth paragraph). This is not actually the case. While the point estimates are similar, they are no longer statistically significant, for the most part, in the adjusted and IPCW models. It would be more appropriate to conclude that this study showed less strong effects of the intervention on TL, than the authors imply. It seems inappropriate to consider the unadjusted analysis as primary, since so much differential loss to follow-up occurred.</p><p>2) Table 1 does not present the results for whether baseline covariates were statistically significantly different from one another for the two groups. Were there differences in sociodemographic characteristics between the two groups at Y1 and Y2? I.e., differential loss to follow-up that might explain the differences in TL and attrition? This is presented in a table but should be discussed here.</p><p>3) Many more children withdrew from the control group. This again highlights the need to present study characteristics to examine possible differential loss to follow-up. And this should be included as a major limitation, in that unmeasured characteristics may be driving these differences and the subsequent results. It also suggests that perhaps the adjusted analyses should be the primary ones.</p><p>4) Again, it would be more appropriate to frame this as a study that found null effects except for Year 1 differences, and to discuss why there may have been no effect observed. Moreover, there is not enough discussion of the hypothesized pathways linking adversity and TL, nor on how this intervention addresses adversity as opposed to nutrition and sanitation, which are very different exposures.</p><p>5) The authors should postulate mechanisms by which telomere shortening improves growth.</p><p>6) If telomere length shortening is associated with better immune functioning and the infants had improved hygienic conditions, then it is counterintuitive when considered in context with germ theory of disease. This should be amended and discussed.</p><p>7) The authors discuss adversity, which conjures to mind poverty, psychosocial stress, etc. It is inappropriate to talk about adversity because it was not measured via socioeconomic or psychosocial risk factors, so much as nutrition and sanitation. Please clarify what &quot;adversity&quot; means in these prior studies, and how/whether that relates to this particular intervention.</p><p>8) The limitations section needs to be expanded, e.g., lack of process evaluation measures that might clarify mechanistic pathways linking intervention to disease; limited understanding of how different types of exposures might influence TL; differential loss-to-follow-up on unmeasured characteristics that can't be accounted for by IPCW; capturing TL only in a single tissue. What are the implications of the lack of geographic matching for the substudy? What are the implications for generalizability and bias of the exclusion criteria, which eliminated potentially more disadvantaged individuals and therefore may have selected on better outcomes?</p><p>9) Only including &quot;significantly related covariates&quot; is not an appropriate way to select covariates. You should include all of those that are theoretically potential confounders. I.e., covariates should be selected conceptually and not empirically. It doesn't seem necessary to include (1) just age child age and sex; just do one fully adjusted model with all relevant covariates (subsection âStatistical parametersâ, second paragraph).</p><p>10) The authors state that they conducted inverse probability weighting, but do not give these details (subsection âMissing outcomesâ).</p><p>11) For both Tables 1 and 2, it's confusing to have mean (SD) and N (%) in the same column, and the tables overall are clutters with all the &quot;%&quot; signs. Perhaps have mean (SD) for continuous outcomes and just the% for binary outcomes?</p><p>12) Table 1: Is this table for the children who had telomere outcomes measured? Please specify in the footnote.</p><p>13) Table 1: At the top left, the table says &quot;No. of compounds.&quot; Are the &quot;N =&quot; at the top of the second and third columns therefore number of compounds or number of children? If number of compounds, please present number of children also/instead. Similarly for the top of Table 2.</p><p>14) Tables 3 and 4 are very redundant. Can't you just add the IPCW column from Table 4 to Table 2? Perhaps put the CI below the point estimate so it can all fit?</p><p>15) The footnotes of Tables 3 and 4 say that covariates were pre-specified, but the text says that adjustment included significantly related covariates at p &lt; 0.2. Please clarify.</p><p>16) Table 5 would look better if girls and boys were listed side by side instead of all in the same column. And actually, presenting it stratified in this way doesn't give us the information we want, which is the point estimate and CI for the interaction term of gender x treatment group. Are the headings for the mean and N columns reversed?</p><p>17) It is not intuitive why the argument for TL measurement is strengthened as a &quot;potential target for future intervention development and evaluation.&quot; To the contrary, this suggests that the simple belief that longer TL = healthier needs to be further nuanced, and that additional studies like this one need to be done. We need a better understanding of the human physiology linking different types of socioeconomic and biomedical exposures with different types of telomere-related outcomes, since the existing literature suffers from too much confounding to understand what is actually going on. I'd say the main takeaway from this study is that we have a very limited understanding of how TL in humans actually responds to different types of interventions, and limited understanding of how TL actually influences different aspects of human health.</p><p>18) The presentation of the results in the Abstract is confusing, and doesn't parallel the presentation in the main manuscript. It would be helpful if the authors stated (1) the difference in TL between treatment and control at year 1; (2) the difference in TL between treatment and control at year 2; and (3) the difference in telomere attrition between treatment and control at year 1 and at year 2. These are the primary outcomes, as I understand them.</p><p>19) Unclear wording: does linear growth refer to telomeres or the child's height/length? (Abstract) If the latter, then this was not examined in this manuscript and should not go in the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29365.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The overarching concerns that should orient the revision are:</p><p>1) There should be significant re-framing of the Introduction (i.e., this is a nutrition/sanitation intervention but the authors primarily discuss &quot;adversity&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this helpful recommendation. We have significantly revised and re-framed the Introduction section. We also added two new paragraphs. One paragraph focuses on the mechanisms by which the water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention could potentially affect TL: âAcute or chronic infections may contribute to childhood TL attrition, and inflammation and oxidative stress may be potential mediators (Houben, Moonen, van Schooten, and Hageman, 2008). [â¦] To our knowledge, no studies have examined the impact of WSH interventions on TL.â</p><p>The other paragraph focuses on the mechanisms by which the nutritional intervention could potentially affect TL: âEarly life nutrition may affect childhood TL.

This is an issue we had anticipated from the trialâs conception and included in our pre-specified and pre-registered analysis plans for the trial (all outcomes, not just telomere outcomes). In our original submission to <italic>eLife</italic> we included results from an inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) analysis, which re-weights the analysis population to reflect the enrollment population using measured characteristics. The IPCW approach follows best practices for removing potential bias owing to missing outcome measurements in trials, according to a definitive methodologic review conducted by the National Research Council (Little et al., 2012). In this substudy, the IPCW analysis led to very similar inference as the adjusted and unadjusted analyses (original submission Table 4, revised submission Table 3), which suggests that outcomes were missing at random with respect to measurable characteristics and the missing outcomes are not a likely source of bias in the study. We made the following revisions to help emphasize the IPCW methods and results, and to help readers more clearly evaluate and interpret this sensitivity analysis in light of our primary findings:</p><p>-To address whether there were differences in enrollment characteristics between those with TL outcomes at Y1 versus Y2, we revised Table 1 to include treatment group means by year of measurement.</p><p>-As recommended by the reviewers, we combined the original Tables 3 and 4 into one table by adding the IPCW column from Table 4 to Table 3. This change enables readers to more clearly interpret the IPCW analysis beside the unadjusted and adjusted models.</p><p>-We have added more details on IPCW analysis to the Methods section: âThe inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) approach follows best practices for removing potential bias owing to missing outcome measurements in trials, according to a definitive methodologic review conducted by the National Research Council (Little et al., 2012). [â¦] TL differences between the control and intervention group were then estimated using adjusted linear regression weighted by the inverse probability of TL measurement.â</p><p>-In the Discussion section, we added this language to the limitations paragraph: âDifferential loss to follow-up in the control and intervention arms could potentially introduce bias if differential loss to follow-up was caused by unmeasured characteristics. However, our IPCW analysis showed that bias from loss to follow-up was unlikely based on a large set of measurable characteristics.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The results should be reframed as primarily null, emphasizing the more robust models rather than the unadjusted results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and have reframed the Results and Discussion accordingly.</p><p>Typically, in a clinical trial, adjusted analyses (including IPCW) are pursued for two main reasons: 1) to remove bias from chance imbalances in group characteristics despite randomization or differential loss to follow-up, and 2) to increase the precision of the effect estimate (Pocock, Assmann, Enos, and Kasten, 2002). Balancing these objectives is a classic bias-variance tradeoff in statistics, and our approach, pre-specified in our analysis plan (https://osf.io/cjjwa/), has been to focus first on the issue of bias: namely, do we see evidence for any change in effect after adjustment? Then, if we see no evidence for bias, focus on the unadjusted analysis for our inference. This emphasis follows guidelines from leading statisticians in clinical trials, for example:</p><p>âExperiments offer more reliable evidence on causation than observational studies, which is not to gainsay the contribution to knowledge from observation. Experiments should be analyzed as experiments, not as observational studies. A simple comparison of rates might be just the right tool, with little value added by âsophisticatedâ models.â</p><p>Freedman DA. Statistical models for causation â What inferential leverage do they provide? Eval Rev. 2006;30: 691â713.</p><p>âExperience shows that for most clinical trials, analyses which adjust for baseline covariates are in close agreement with the simpler unadjusted treatment comparisons. This is because (a) the randomization usually results in well balanced treatment groups, and (b) most covariates are not strongly related to the outcome.â</p><p>Pocock SJ, Assmann SE, Enos LE, Kasten LE. Subgroup analysis, covariate adjustment and baseline comparisons in clinical trial reporting: current practice and problems. Stat Med. 2002;21: 2917â2930.</p><p>As the reviewer notes below in comment #1 âConcerns related to analysis and interpretationâ, the point estimates across analyses are very similar, which we find reassuring because it is consistent with good balance from randomization and outcome measurements missing at random (with respect to measurable characteristics). As the reviewer also notes, the confidence intervals widen slightly (and thus P-values increase slightly) as we move from the unadjusted analysis to the adjusted analyses. An analysis will only gain precision if all covariates are very strongly associated with the outcome (Pocock et al. 2002). Although our pre-specified algorithm pre-screened covariates that were associated with the outcome (a necessary condition for confounding), the adjusted analyses still lost a small amount of precision â suggesting that our conservative inclusion to reduce all possible bias led to a small loss in precision in this study. Given the similarity of the point estimates across analyses (Table 3), we feel that the unadjusted results, which rely only on randomization, are the most parsimonious summary of the trial.</p><p>We summarized our rationale in the Materials and methods section of our original submission: âRandomization led to balance in observed covariates across arms, so, in accordance with our pre-specified analysis plan, we relied on the unadjusted analysis as our primary analysis for the TL outcomes.âTables 1 and 2 provide evidence that the groups with Y1 and Y2 TL outcomes were balanced across enrollment characteristics and that the group lost to follow up did not differ in enrollment characteristics from those with outcomes.</p><p>In the Results section, we addressed the reviewerâs concerns regarding the specific statement about unadjusted, adjusted, and IPCW analyses being âsimilarâ. We clarified this statement for the change in TL from Y1 to Y2 result by emphasizing which model was significant: âUnadjusted, adjusted, and inverse probability of censoring weighting analyses generated similar estimates but only the unadjusted model was significant (Table 3).âAlthough we stated that the difference between the control and intervention arms in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was borderline significant (in the Results section), we agree that this borderline significant result is overemphasized in the Discussion section. Therefore, in the Discussion section, we have reframed this study as a study that found significant results at Y1, borderline significant/null effects in the difference in the relative change in TL between Y1 and Y2 among the two groups, and null effects at Y2.</p><p>To emphasize this point, we have added the borderline significant effects in the difference in the relative change in TL between Y1 and Y2 among the two groups and the null effects at Y2 to the first paragraph of the Discussion section: âThe difference between the intervention and control arms in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was borderline significant, and at Y2, we found no difference in relative TL between the arms.â</p><p>In accordance with the guidelines for the interpretation of borderline significant results in clinical trials (Hackshaw and Kirkwood, 2011), we have softened the language of our interpretation and put forth alternative explanations.</p><p>The revised language in the Discussion emphasizes the borderline aspect of the change in TL result and enables the reader to interpret whether or not the difference is biologically meaningful and/or if the mechanisms proposed are plausible: âAfter the initial period of rapid linear growth during Y1, our borderline significant finding that telomere length increased in the intervention arm and decreased in the control arm from Y1 to Y2 seems to represent a preview of the TL trajectories that are set: we hypothesize that the intervention children will experience slower lifetime TL attrition and more physiological resistance to stress-related diseases (Juster, McEwen, and Lupien, 2010). [â¦] The smaller than expected treatment effect and the borderline p-value indicate that the trial was slightly underpowered to detect differences in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 among the intervention and control groups.â</p><p>Additionally, we added a new paragraph with an alternative interpretation if the reader considers the borderline result to be null: âAlternatively, our finding of a modest, borderline impact from Y1 to Y2 may suggest that the effect of the interventions is diminished in children over 1 year of age. [â¦] This interpretation would also be consistent with no differences in relative TL observed at Y2 between the two groups, underscoring the importance of targeting interventions early in life during the sensitive period when they are likely to have the largest impact on childhood TL.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) More detail must be added to the Materials and methods section regarding blood processing, calculation of telomere length (as absolute base pairs â which are short for newborns/infants, etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph to the Materials and methods section with these details (below).</p><p>The new paragraph in the Materials and methods section reads: âTo determine the conversion factor for the calculation of approximate base pair telomere length from T/S ratio, the above method was used to determine the T/S ratios, relative to the same reference DNA, for a set of genomic DNA samples from the ATCC authenticated human fibroblast primary cell line IMR-90 (ATCC: CCL<sup>-</sup>186, cell line authentication method: STR profiling; ATCC determined the cell line was free of mycoplasma contamination) at different population doublings, as well as with the telomerase protein subunit gene (hTERT) transfected into a lentiviral construct. [â¦] Comparison of T/S ratios versus base pairs derived from the Southern blot analysis generated the following equation for conversion from T/S ratio to base pairs: base pairs = 3274 + 2413 * (T/S) (Farzaneh-Far et al., 2010).â</p><p>We agree that the averages of 6729 bp at Year 1 and 6763 bp at Year 2 are short for newborns compared to some previous findings (Factor-Litvak et al., 2016; Frenck, Blackburn, and Shannon, 1998; Wojcicki, Heyman, et al., 2016), but these averages are similar to a recent report of newborns whose mothers experienced a high level of stress during pregnancy (Marchetto et al., 2016). It is possible that the short telomere length in our cohort is due to the overall low socioeconomic status, which is shown to be associated with shorter telomere length, although we cannot rule out other factors that may contribute to this, such as race, malnutrition, or infection status.</p><p>We have added new language to the Results section: âAlthough these averages are short for young children compared to some previous findings (Factor-Litvak et al., 2016; Frenck, Blackburn, and Shannon, 1998; Wojcicki, Heyman, et al., 2016), they are similar to a recent report of newborns whose mothers experienced a high level of stress during pregnancy (Marchetto et al., 2016); the stress associated with low socioeconomic status may have contributed to the short average TL in this study.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Discussion on potential mechanisms for the findings, including sources of bias.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion on potential mechanisms for the findings by adding a new paragraph to the Discussion section.

It would be more appropriate to conclude that this study showed less strong effects of the intervention on TL, than the authors imply. It seems inappropriate to consider the unadjusted analysis as primary, since so much differential loss to follow-up occurred.</p></disp-quote><p>[repeated from Essential revisions comment #3 response, above]Typically, in a clinical trial, adjusted analyses (including IPCW) are pursued for two main reasons: 1) to remove bias from chance imbalances in group characteristics despite randomization or differential loss to follow-up, and 2) to increase the precision of the effect estimate (Pocock et al., 2002). Balancing these objectives is a classic bias-variance tradeoff in statistics, and our approach, pre-specified in our analysis plan (https://osf.io/cjjwa/), has been to focus first on the issue of bias: namely, do we see evidence for any change in effect after adjustment? Then, if we see no evidence for bias, focus on the unadjusted analysis for our inference. This emphasis follows guidelines from leading statisticians in clinical trials, for example:</p><p>âExperiments offer more reliable evidence on causation than observational studies, which is not to gainsay the contribution to knowledge from observation. Experiments should be analyzed as experiments, not as observational studies. A simple comparison of rates might be just the right tool, with little value added by âsophisticatedâ models.â</p><p>Freedman DA. Statistical models for causation â What inferential leverage do they provide? Eval Rev. 2006;30: 691â713.</p><p>âExperience shows that for most clinical trials, analyses which adjust for baseline covariates are in close agreement with the simpler unadjusted treatment comparisons. This is because (a) the randomization usually results in well balanced treatment groups, and (b) most covariates are not strongly related to the outcome.â</p><p>Pocock SJ, Assmann SE, Enos LE, Kasten LE. Subgroup analysis, covariate adjustment and baseline comparisons in clinical trial reporting: current practice and problems. Stat Med. 2002;21: 2917â2930.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, the point estimates across analyses are very similar, which we find reassuring because it is consistent with good balance from randomization and outcome measurements missing at random (with respect to measurable characteristics). As the reviewer also notes, the confidence intervals widen slightly (and thus P-values increase slightly) as we move from the unadjusted analysis to the adjusted analyses. An analysis will only gain precision if all covariates are very strongly associated with the outcome (Pocock et al. 2002). Although our pre-specified algorithm pre-screened covariates that were associated with the outcome (a necessary condition for confounding), the adjusted analyses still lost a small amount of precision â suggesting that our conservative inclusion to reduce all possible bias led to a small loss in precision in this study. Given the similarity of the point estimates across analyses (Table 3), we feel that the unadjusted results, which rely only on randomization, are the most parsimonious summary of the trial.</p><p>We summarized our rationale in the Materials and methods section of our original submission: âRandomization led to balance in observed covariates across arms, so, in accordance with our pre-specified analysis plan, we relied on the unadjusted analysis as our primary analysis for the TL outcomes.âTables 1 and 2 provide evidence that the groups with Y1 and Y2 TL outcomes were balanced across enrollment characteristics and that the group lost to follow up did not differ in enrollment characteristics from those with outcomes.</p><p>In the Results section, we addressed the reviewerâs concerns regarding the specific statement about unadjusted, adjusted, and IPCW analyses being âsimilarâ. We clarified this statement for the change in TL from Y1 to Y2 result by emphasizing which model was significant: âUnadjusted, adjusted, and inverse probability of censoring weighting analyses generated similar estimates but only the unadjusted model was significant (Table 3).âAlthough we stated that the difference between the control and intervention arms in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was borderline significant (in the Results section), we agree that this borderline significant result is overemphasized in the Discussion section. Therefore, we have softened the language and reframed the discussion of this result in the Discussion section in accordance with guidelines for the interpretation of borderline significant results within clinical trials (Hackshaw and Kirkwood, 2011). Please see our response to comment #4 under âConcerns related to analysis and interpretationâ for the revised language in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Table 1 does not present the results for whether baseline covariates were statistically significantly different from one another for the two groups. Were there differences in sociodemographic characteristics between the two groups at Y1 and Y2? I.e., differential loss to follow-up that might explain the differences in TL and attrition? This is presented in a table but should be discussed here.</p></disp-quote><p>In a clinical trial, any imbalance in baseline characteristics despite randomization is, by definition, due to chance. The issue was best summarized by Doug Altman:</p><p>âIn a clinical trial in which treatment allocation was properly randomized, a difference of any sort between the two groups at the time of entry to the trial will necessarily be due to chance, since randomization precludes any external influences (biases) on which subjects receive which treatments [â¦] Performing a significance test to compare baseline variables is to assess the probability of something having occurred by chance when we know that it did occur by chanceâ.</p><p>Altman DG. Comparability of Randomised Groups.

Subjective assessment requires âprior knowledge of the prognostic importance of the variables being comparedâ. (Altman, 1985)</p><p>To address whether there were differences in enrollment characteristics between those with TL outcomes at Y1 versus Y2, we revised Table 1 to include treatment group means by year of measurement.</p><p>[repeated from Essential revisions comment #2 response, above] We agree with the reviewers that differential loss to follow-up could potentially be a source of bias in this trial. This is an issue we had anticipated from the trialâs conception and included in our pre-specified and pre-registered analysis plans for the trial (all outcomes, not just telomere outcomes). In our original submission to <italic>eLife</italic> we included results from an inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) analysis, which re-weights the analysis population to reflect the enrollment population using measured characteristics. The IPCW approach follows best practices for removing potential bias owing to missing outcome measurements in trials, according to a definitive methodologic review conducted by the National Research Council (Little et al., 2012). In this study, the IPCW analysis led to very similar inference as the adjusted and unadjusted analyses (original submission Table 4, revised submission Table 3), which suggests that outcomes were missing at random with respect to measurable characteristics and the missing outcomes are not a likely source of bias in the study.</p><p>In the original submission, we included Table 2 featuring the enrollment characteristics of households with TL measurement at Year 1 versus those lost to follow-up at Year 2. We have added differential loss to follow-up as a potential limitation in the Discussion section.</p><p>The new language in the Discussion section reads: âDifferential loss to follow-up in the control and intervention arms could potentially introduce bias if differential loss to follow-up was caused by unmeasured characteristics.

Moreover, there is not enough discussion of the hypothesized pathways linking adversity and TL, nor on how this intervention addresses adversity as opposed to nutrition and sanitation, which are very different exposures.</p></disp-quote><p>[repeated from Essential revisions comment #3 response, above] In the Discussion section, we have reframed this study as a study that found significant results at Y1, borderline significant/null effects in the difference in the relative change in TL between Y1 and Y2 among the two groups, and null effects at Y2.</p><p>To emphasize this point, we have added the borderline significant effects in the difference in the relative change in TL between Y1 and Y2 among the two groups and the null effects at Y2 to the first paragraph of the Discussion section: âThe difference between the intervention and control arms in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 was borderline significant, and at Y2, we found no difference in relative TL between the arms.â</p><p>In accordance with the guidelines for the interpretation of borderline significant results in clinical trials (Hackshaw and Kirkwood, 2011), we have softened the language of our interpretation and put forth alternative explanations.</p><p>The revised language in the Discussion emphasizes the borderline aspect of the change in TL result and enables the reader to interpret whether or not the difference is biologically meaningful and/or if the mechanisms proposed are plausible: âAfter the initial period of rapid linear growth during Y1, our borderline significant finding that telomere length increased in the intervention arm and decreased in the control arm from Y1 to Y2 seems to represent a preview of the TL trajectories that are set: we hypothesize that the intervention children will experience slower lifetime TL attrition and more physiological resistance to stress-related diseases (Juster et al., 2010). [â¦] The smaller than expected treatment effect and the borderline p-value indicate that the trial was slightly underpowered to detect differences in the change in relative TL from Y1 to Y2 among the intervention and control groups.â</p><p>Additionally, we added a new paragraph with an alternative interpretation if the reader considers the borderline result to be null: âAlternatively, our finding of a modest, borderline impact from Y1 to Y2 may suggest that the effect of the interventions is diminished in children over 1 year of age. [â¦] This interpretation would also be consistent with no differences in relative TL observed at Y2 between the two groups, underscoring the importance of targeting interventions early in life during the sensitive period when they are likely to have the largest impact on childhood TL.â</p><p>We have amended the Discussion section to remove the focus on adversity (as suggested by the reviewer in comment #7 under âConcerns related to analysis and interpretationâ below). Furthermore, we have expanded on our original discussion of mechanisms by including a new paragraph in the Discussion on the hypothesized pathways linking nutrition and WSH exposures and childhood TL and growth. Please see our response to comment #5 under âConcerns related to analysis and interpretationâ (below) for more details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should postulate mechanisms by which telomere shortening improves growth.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original Discussion section, we hypothesized that telomere shortening may reflect improved growth (e.g., a biomarker of growth) and did not imply that telomere shortening would necessarily be considered a cause of improved growth (if anything, our hypothesis based on the results would imply causality in the other direction: improved growth â shorter telomeres). We have included language in the Discussion to further clarify our hypothesis (please see new text below). Our study was not designed to examine the potential causal pathway between telomere shortening and improved growth. Therefore, we prefer not to postulate mechanisms for a relationship that we have not yet examined or proposed.</p><p>Instead, to address this point and comment #5 under âEssential revisionsâ we have expanded the discussion on potential mechanisms for improved TL and growth observed in the intervention arm by adding this paragraph to the Discussion section: [repeated from Essential revisions comment #5 response, above] âThe accelerated TL attrition during the first year of life in the intervention arm may also reflect better linear growth. [â¦] Forthcoming WASH Benefits studies focused on child inflammation and enteric pathogen burden will provide evidence on mechanistic pathways leading to different TL, growth, and development outcomes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) If telomere length shortening is associated with better immune functioning and the infants had improved hygienic conditions, then it is counterintuitive when considered in context with germ theory of disease. This should be amended and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not made this amendment because our interpretation is that the observed results and hypothesized relationship between hygienic conditions, immune function, and telomere length shortening are all internally consistent with the germ theory of disease. The germ theory of disease states that infectious diseases are caused by the presence of pathogenic microorganisms within the body. As discussed in the Discussion section, the children in the N+WSH intervention arm potentially experienced improved hygienic conditions, which likely limited exposure to microorganisms, as exhibited by the reductions in caregiver-reported diarrhea, soil-transmitted helminth infections, and <italic>Giardia duodenalis</italic> infections (S. P. Luby et al., A. Ercumen et al., and A. Lin et al. in review).

In high- and low-resource settings, there is a dearth of evidence on the effect of environmental exposures on TL in this age range and its implications for adult health outcomes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The limitations section needs to be expanded, e.g., lack of process evaluation measures that might clarify mechanistic pathways linking intervention to disease; limited understanding of how different types of exposures might influence TL; differential loss-to-follow-up on unmeasured characteristics that can't be accounted for by IPCW; capturing TL only in a single tissue. What are the implications of the lack of geographic matching for the substudy? What are the implications for generalizability and bias of the exclusion criteria, which eliminated potentially more disadvantaged individuals and therefore may have selected on better outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying these additional limitations. We have expanded the limitations section to discuss all of the reviewerâs suggestions except the following points: âlack of process evaluation measures that might clarify mechanistic pathways linking intervention to diseaseâ, âlimited understanding of how different types of exposures might influence TLâ, and âbias of the exclusion criteria, which eliminated potentially more disadvantaged individuals and therefore may have selected on better outcomesâ. The process evaluation measures are described in detail in the main trial publication (S. P. Luby et al. in review), and all analyses were intention-to-treat. The limited understanding of how different types of exposures might influence TL is not a limitation specific to this study, rather it is a limitation of the general TL literature. Therefore, we have included this point in the final two sentences of the Discussion section, but have not highlighted it in the limitations paragraph. The venipuncture exclusion criteria only excluded two children: one child in the control arm at Year 1 and one child in the intervention arm at Year 2. We added this information to the Materials and methods section. Since the number of children excluded is small, we have decided not to include the exclusion criteria as a limitation.</p><p>[repeated from Essential Revisions comment #5 response, above] The revised limitations paragraph reads: <italic>â</italic>This study had several limitations.

You should include all of those that are theoretically potential confounders. I.e., covariates should be selected conceptually and not empirically. It doesn't seem necessary to include (1) just age child age and sex; just do one fully adjusted model with all relevant covariates (subsection âStatistical parametersâ, second paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to comment #1 under âConcerns related to analysis and interpretationâ for our broader perspective on adjusted analyses in the context of clinical trials. In regard to this specific point, by definition a covariate can confound a relationship between an exposure (here: randomized treatment) and the outcome if it is associated with the outcome (VanderWeele and Shpitser, 2011). However, it is widely known that covariates can hurt precision in an analysis if they are not strongly associated with the outcome. Therefore, this pre-screening step is a common approach for covariate selection in trials â and epidemiologic studies more broadly â to help avoid losing too much precision in the adjusted analysis through inclusion of covariates that are unassociated with the outcome (and thus could not be confounders). As long as the approach is algorithmic and pre-specified, it is not susceptible to âcherry pickingâ. Below is an excerpt of an influential article on the analysis of clinical trials that contributed to the development of our pre-specified approach to covariate selection in this trial:</p><p>âSome have argued that prespecification of all covariates for adjustment in a single model is the best solution, leading to just one predefined covariate-adjusted analysis [10].

We need a better understanding of the human physiology linking different types of socioeconomic and biomedical exposures with different types of telomere-related outcomes, since the existing literature suffers from too much confounding to understand what is actually going on.

It would be helpful if the authors stated (1) the difference in TL between treatment and control at year 1; (2) the difference in TL between treatment and control at year 2; and (3) the difference in telomere attrition between treatment and control at year 1 and at year 2. These are the primary outcomes, as I understand them.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restructured the Abstract to parallel the results in the main manuscript by adding point 2: difference in treatment and control at Year 2. The original Abstract already included points 1 and 3.</p><p>The revised paragraph reads: âChildren in the intervention arm had significantly shorter relative TL compared with controls after 1 year of intervention (difference -163 bp, P=0.001). Between years 1 and 2, TL increased in the intervention arm (+76 bp) and decreased in the controls (-23 bp) (P=0.050). After two years, there was no difference between the arms (P=0.305).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19) Unclear wording: does linear growth refer to telomeres or the child's height/length? (Abstract) If the latter, then this was not examined in this manuscript and should not go in the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>Linear growth refers to the childâs length/height, the primary outcomes of the main trial. We have deleted this sentence from the Abstract.</p></body></sub-article></article>
