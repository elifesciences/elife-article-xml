The fungal pathobiont <italic>Candida albicans</italic> expresses a family of extracellular CFEM hemophores that capture heme from host proteins and transfer it across the cell wall to the cell membrane, to be endocytosed and utilized as heme or iron source. Here, we identified Frp1 and Frp2, two ferric reductase (FRE)-related proteins that lack an extracellular N-terminal substrate-binding domain, as being required for hemoglobin heme utilization and for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs. Frp1 and Frp2 redistribute to the plasma membrane in the presence of hemin, consistent with a direct role in heme trafficking. Expression of Frp1 with the CFEM hemophore Pga7 can promote heme utilization in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> as well, confirming the functional interaction between these proteins. Sequence and structure comparison reveals that the CFEM hemophores are related to the FRE substrate-binding domain that is missing in Frp1/2. We conclude that Frp1/2 and the CFEM hemophores form a functional complex that evolved from FREs to enable extracellular heme uptake.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hosts and disease-causing fungi are often locked into a battle over resources. The host will attempt to withhold molecules that the fungus needs to survive, while the pathogen will try to find alternative routes to obtain them.<italic> Candida albicans</italic>, for example, can go after the atoms of iron embedded in the proteins of the organism it infects. To do so it releases molecules known as hemophores, which scavenge the iron-containing heme molecule that equips oxygen-carrying proteins in the blood.</p><p>Once captured, the heme is carried across the wall that protects <italic>C. albicans</italic> from the environment and brought to the membrane of the cell. It is then taken in and trafficked inside vesicles to its destination. However, the identity of the molecular actors which help to bridge the internal and external segments of the heme journey remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that the hemophore Pga7 is involved, but this protein is attached to the outside of the cell membrane, where it cannot directly interact with the import machinery.</p><p>Roy et al. set out to discover this missing link. Examining the genomes of fungal species related to <italic>C. albicans</italic> highlighted two membrane proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, which could participate in heme uptake. Protein sequence comparison revealed that Frp1 and Frp2 were closely related to ferric reductases, a group of membrane enzymes which can chemically alter extracellular iron prior to uptake.</p><p>Deleting the genes for Frp1 and Frp2 rendered <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells incapable of taking in heme. Conversely, a fungal species which cannot normally uptake heme could efficiently internalise these complexes when artificially equipped with Frp1 and Pga7, suggesting that the two proteins work closely together. Finally, protein structure comparisons highlighted that an extracellular domain present in ferric reductases but absent in Frp1 and Frp2 is, in fact, related to Pga7 and other hemophores. This implies that the iron and heme uptake systems may share a common evolutionary origin. Overall, the work by Roy et al. reveals a new family of proteins which allow disease-causing fungi to steal iron from their hosts. This knowledge may be useful to design better anti-fungal treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>heme acquisition</kwd><kwd>phylogenetic profiling</kwd><kwd>ferric reductase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>587/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornitzer</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new class of plasma membrane proteins involved in heme-iron utilization provides a molecular link between the extracellular and intracellular parts of the fungal heme acquisition pathway, and reveals the evolutionary origin of this pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Candida albicans</italic> is a commensal microorganism of the human host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghannoum et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nash et al., 2017</xref>). It is normally found on mucosal surfaces and on the skin as part of the normal microbial flora. It is also one of the most common human fungal pathogens, causing infections that range from superficial infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sobel, 2007</xref>) to life-threatening systemic infections when the immune system is weakened or when there is damage to epithelial barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kullberg and Arendrup, 2015</xref>). <italic>Candida</italic> species, of which the most prevalent is <italic>C. albicans</italic>, are responsible for an estimated 750,000 cases of systemic candidiasis annually, with a mortality rate of around 40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bongomin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pfaller et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Like most organisms, <italic>C. albicans</italic> requires iron for its survival. Iron can be found in several oxidation states, of which the more common are Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>. The low solubility of ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) makes iron acquisition challenging in oxidizing environments. Many unicellular organisms express ferric reductases (FREs) on their surface, which can contribute to iron acquisition by reducing ferric iron to its more soluble ferrous (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) ion and/or extracting it from iron chelates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornitzer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Philpott, 2006</xref>). The <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome contains at least 15 genes encoding FRE-like proteins, including Fre1/Cfl1 and the major iron reductase Fre10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hammacott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knight et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Heme, or Fe-protoporphyrin IX, is a molecule that serves as a cellular cofactor almost universally across life. As such, it is present in many natural environments, and thus, environmental heme can be utilized as an alternative iron source by many organisms, via a large repertoire of heme acquisition systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Donegan et al., 2019</xref>). In animals, HRG-1-like heme transporters conserved from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to mammals can mediate extracellular heme import or intracellular heme transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rajagopal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reddi and Hamza, 2016</xref>) and the human membrane protein FLVCR2 functions as a heme importer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duffy et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>For microorganisms, the animal host environment poses a particular challenge for iron acquisition, as the host restricts the availability of free iron by a variety of active mechanisms as part of a defense strategy called ‘nutritional immunity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ganz, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Weinberg, 1975</xref>). In this environment, hemoglobin heme, comprising about two-thirds of the total iron, is therefore expected to be a particularly attractive iron source, and indeed it is utilized by many bacterial pathogens via several well-studied mechanisms that involve distinct extracellular hemophore families and plasma membrane ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cassat and Skaar, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contreras et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganz and Nemeth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hood and Skaar, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang and Wilks, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Fungi have also evolved different mechanisms to internalize heme, involving a membrane heme receptor in the case of <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Labbé et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mourer et al., 2015</xref>) and an endocytosis-based mechanism in the case of <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bairwa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bairwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cadieux et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>C. albicans</italic> and other <italic>Candida</italic> spp. express a distinct family of GPI-anchored and soluble extracellular hemophores containing a heme-binding CFEM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roy and Kornitzer, 2019</xref>). Pga7 and Rbt5 are GPI-anchored to the cell membrane and the cell wall, respectively, while Csa2 is secreted to the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weissman and Kornitzer, 2004</xref>). These three CFEM proteins are all able to extract heme from hemoglobin and to transfer it among themselves, consistent with a model where heme captured from hemoglobin or other host heme-binding proteins, such as serum albumin, is transferred across the cell wall to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pinsky et al., 2020</xref>). Heme binding to the CFEM domain involves a unique aspartic acid-mediated heme-iron coordination that renders the heme-binding redox-sensitive: only ferriheme (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) binds to the CFEM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Heme utilization in <italic>C. albicans</italic> requires, in addition to the CFEM hemophores, components of the endocytic pathway and the ESCRT system, and vacuolar function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Weissman et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that it involves endocytosis of the heme to the vacuole. However, GPI-anchored proteins are not known to be subject to ESCRT-mediated endocytosis, suggesting the existence of (an) additional transmembrane protein(s) involved in heme internalization. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of Frp1 and Frp2, plasma membrane proteins related to FREs, that are essential for heme uptake and utilization in <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phylogenetic profiling for identification of new heme-iron acquisition genes</title><p>Analysis of genomes from species related to <italic>C. albicans</italic> indicated that many carry CFEM proteins related to Pga7, Rbt5, and Csa2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>). We found that across fungal genomes of the Ascomycete clades most closely related to <italic>C. albicans</italic>, distinct relatives of Rbt5, Pga7, and Csa2 can be identified in almost every genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a proximity tree of Rbt5-related proteins from 14 Saccharomycetales genomes). One exception is <italic>Meyerozyma</italic> (<italic>Candida</italic>) <italic>guilliermondii</italic>, which completely lacks any coding sequence related to these CFEM proteins, unlike equally distant relatives of <italic>C. albicans</italic> such as <italic>Debaryomyces hansenii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurtzman and Suzuki, 2010</xref>). In order to identify additional proteins involved in heme uptake, we applied phylogenetic profiling or pathway co-evolution analysis. Briefly, this method is based on the assumption that, as organisms can acquire new functions and evolve new pathways by gene duplication, acquisition and modification, organisms can similarly lose functions, and their associated genes, when they are no longer required. Genes encoding a single functional pathway are thus expected to be preserved or eliminated in a correlated fashion across genomes, according to whether the function is present or absent in a given organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pellegrini et al., 1999</xref>).

However, alignment followed by phylogenetic tree building indicates that Frp1 and Frp2 cluster separately from most FRE homologs, including Fre10 and Cfl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Notably, Frp1 and Frp2 lack an N-terminal domain present in most other FREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Frp1 and Frp2 are 36% identical, and out of 13 Saccharomycetales listed in the Candida Gene Order Browser database (cgob3.ucd.ie; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fitzpatrick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maguire et al., 2013</xref>) that have Frp homologs, 12 have an Frp1 ortholog, and 10 have an Frp2 ortholog.

In this detection system, an mKATE2 red fluorescent domain linked to the GFP-cytochrome fusion serves as an internal fluorescence control. The ratio of GFP to mKATE2 fluorescence gives a measure of available cytoplasmic heme, with lower ratios indicating stronger GFP quenching due to higher cytochrome occupancy, that is, higher cytoplasmic heme concentrations. To expand the range of testable concentrations, a lower-affinity cytochrome domain mutant (M7A) can be used alongside the high-affinity original sensor (HS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hanna et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weissman et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Wild-type, <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>frp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, and <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup> frp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic>double mutant cells expressing the HS1 and M7A sensors were exposed to increasing hemin concentrations in the medium for 4 hr, and sensor fluorescence was measured. To ensure expression of the heme uptake system, the cells were grown with 1 mM ferrozine, which imposes iron limitation and activates the heme-uptake genes. The medium was buffered to pH 8.5, a condition where Frp2 was shown to be required as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (bottom panel), the low-affinity cytoplasmic sensor showed minimal occupancy in the absence of external hemin (fluorescence ratio of 10–12) and in the presence of hemin, only the wild-type cells showed a slight but significant increase in sensor occupancy. The wild-type HS1 sensor, in contrast, showed a fluorescence ratio of 2.5–3 in all strains in the absence of added hemin to the medium, indicating a partial occupancy which reflects the steady-state free heme concentration in the cytoplasm. In medium supplemented with 10 μM hemin, in wild-type cells sensor occupancy became nearly maximal, indicating an increase in cytoplasmic hemin concentration. The increase in occupancy was much less in the <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant, and lesser still in the <italic>frp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup> frp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> strains, even when exposed to 30 and 50 μM hemin in the medium.

Here, we identified <italic>FRP1</italic> and <italic>FRP2</italic> by phylogenetic profiling as genes that co-segregate with CFEM hemophore genes across fungal genomes. The function of these genes was confirmed experimentally: we showed here that <italic>FRP1</italic> is essential for heme uptake under all conditions tested, and that <italic>FRP2</italic> contributes to heme uptake under alkaline conditions. Interestingly, a predicted FRE, CnFre2/CNAG_06821, was identified in the distantly related basidiomycete fungal pathogen <italic>C. neoformans,</italic> as being required for optimal growth on hemin as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saikia et al., 2014</xref>). However, unlike Frp1/2, CnFre2 is not required for sensitivity to toxic heme analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saikia et al., 2014</xref>), and CnFre2’s N-terminal domain lacks the cysteine arrangement found in CFEM proteins and in <italic>C. albicans</italic> FRE N-terminal domains. It is thus unclear at this point whether CnFre2 and Frp1/2 share a common mechanism.</p><p><italic>FRP1</italic> and <italic>FRP2</italic> are adjacent to, and share a promoter region with, the two CFEM protein genes <italic>PGA7</italic> and <italic>CSA1</italic>, respectively. This synteny is maintained across most fungal genomes analyzed, further suggesting a common function in heme acquisition. We note however that while <italic>PGA7</italic> was shown to be the main CFEM hemophore required for heme uptake under all conditions tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuznets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>), we have been unable so far to detect any phenotype in the <italic>csa1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> deletion mutant, either alone or in combination with other CFEM gene mutants, in either regular or alkaline medium. Given the high homology of the Csa1 tandem CFEM domains to that of Rbt5 and other established hemophores, it is nonetheless likely that Csa1 does play a role in heme acquisition under conditions yet to be identified.</p><p>Regarding <italic>PGA7</italic>, beyond synteny with <italic>FRP1</italic>, the similar phenotype of the <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and the <italic>pga7<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and the effect of co-expression of <italic>FRP1</italic> and <italic>PGA7</italic> in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> indicated a close cooperation between these proteins in the heme uptake pathway. Furthermore, structure and sequence comparison between FREs, Frp1/2 and CFEM hemophores showed that while the Frp1/2 sequences align with the transmembrane and intracellular portions of the FREs, the CFEM hemophores sequences such as Pga7 are related to the N-terminal extracellular domain of the FREs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that the Frp-Pga7 complex is evolutionarily related to the main body and the N-terminal domain, respectively, of the FRE protein family. The predicted CFEM fold of the various FRE N-termini could, by analogy with the CFEM heme-binding platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>), form a binding site for the various types of substrates of these FREs around the conserved Asp/Asn.</p><p>The known role of FREs is to reduce ferric iron in order to extract it from chelates and siderophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Philpott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yun et al., 2000</xref>). The homology of Frp1/2 to FREs therefore begs the question: why would an FRE activity be required for heme uptake? A possible answer comes from the observation that the CFEM domain specifically binds Fe<sup>+3</sup>-heme (ferriheme), but not Fe<sup>+2</sup>-heme (ferroheme), thanks to its unusual Asp-mediated iron coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>). This redox sensitivity of binding appears to be essential for the CFEM hemophore function, because mutant proteins carrying a substitution of the iron-coordination Asp with His can efficiently bind ferroheme as well as ferriheme, but these Asp-to-His mutants are completely inactive in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasser et al., 2016</xref>). The homology of Frp1/2 to FREs and their role in heme acquisition therefore raise the possibility that they function as heme reductases, and that the Frp1/2 proteins reduce heme bound to the extracellular CFEM hemophores in order to release it.</p><p>If Frp1 and Frp2’s role is to release heme from Pga7 or other CFEM hemophores, what then is the protein that binds the released heme and mediates its internalization into the cell? An important clue for answering this question is the observation that Frp1 and Frp2 – but not Pga7 – mediate the uptake of metal-substituted heme analogs such as fluorescent ZnMP and the toxic metal-substituted PPIX derivatives. These metal-substituted analogs are either not at all redox-active, or much less so compared to heme, indicating that heme reduction cannot be the sole function of Frp1/2. Rather, these observations suggest that Frp1/2 function in the transport of these molecules into the cell as well. The location of Frp1/2 in the vacuole and their partial relocalization in the presence of hemin is consistent with a role of Frp1/2 as heme receptors shuttling between the plasma membrane and the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>An intriguing question is the reason for the existence of two distinct paralogs, Frp1 and Frp2, in <italic>C. albicans</italic> as well as in many fungal genomes containing FRP homologs. Whereas <italic>C. albicans</italic> Frp1 is essential for heme uptake under all the conditions we tested, Frp2 contributed to heme-iron utilization under alkaline conditions only. With regard to the roles of Frp1 and Frp2 in sensitivity to metal-substituted heme analogs, <italic>FRP1</italic> was the main determinant of sensitivity in unbuffered YPD medium (pH ~ 6.5), except for GaPPIX where <italic>FRP2</italic> played the dominant role, and <italic>FRP2</italic> also played a role in ZnPPIX and MnPPIX sensitivity. At neutral-alkaline pH, the Frp2 contribution became more important yet. While differential expression of <italic>FRP1</italic> and <italic>FRP2</italic> might be invoked to explain some of these results, it does not explain differential phenotypes with different metal-substituted heme analogs under the same conditions. Furthermore, expression of <italic>FRP2</italic> under the <italic>FRP1</italic> promoter could not complement the <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant phenotype for heme uptake, indicating that the two proteins do have distinct functions. Localization of the GFP fusions of Frp1 and Frp2 indicated a similar distribution between vacuole and cell surface, with however a higher apparent concentration of Frp2 in the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). One possibility, relating to the Frp proteins’ activity as reductases, is that, since liganded iron was reported to be more readily reduced at more acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhungana and Crumbliss, 2005</xref>), combined activity of Frp1 and Frp2 might be required to reduce Pga7-bound heme at neutral and alkaline pH. Another possibility, relating to the Frp proteins’ function as heme receptors, is that the affinity of heme for Frp1 and Frp2 differs depending on pH. Differential requirement of Frp1 and Frp2 for the toxicity of specific metal-substituted protoporphyrins could similarly reflect differential affinity of these compounds to Frp1 and Frp2. A third possibility, which takes into account that Frp2 showed a higher relative concentration in the vacuole compared to Frp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), is that Frp2 specifically plays a role, distinct from that of Frp1, in subcellular distribution of heme. Distinct roles for Frp1 and Frp2 in redistribution of imported heme between the vacuole and other compartments, and differential effects of pH on this process, might explain why Frp1 is functionally more important for heme-iron utilization even at alkaline pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) while Frp2 is more active in promoting heme influx into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, we have identified two FRE-related membrane proteins, Frp1 and Frp2, as the ‘missing link’ between the extracellular CFEM hemophore cascade and the intracellular heme endocytosis pathway to the vacuole. Our data suggest that these proteins could function both as heme reductases and as heme receptors that bring the heme from the cell surface into the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The Frp1/2 -CFEM hemophore pathway thus represent a new paradigm for heme uptake and utilization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Cells were inoculated in ﬂat-bottomed 96-well plates at OD<sub>600</sub>=0.00001, 150 µl per well. Plates were incubated at 30°C on an orbital shaker at 60 rpm and growth was measured by optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) after 2 and 3 days with an ELISA reader. Cells were resuspended with a multi-pipettor before each reading. Each culture was done in triplicate. For MPP sensitivity, cells were inoculated in ﬂat-bottomed 96-well plates in YPD+1 mM ferrozine at OD<sub>600</sub>=0.0001, 150 µl per well. Plates were incubated at 30°C on an orbital shaker at 60 rpm and growth was measured by optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) after 2 days with an ELISA reader.

Briefly, each strain to be tested was transformed with the sensor plasmids KB2636 (WT HS1), KB2669 (M7A), as well as a vector plasmid. Overnight cultures were diluted to OD <sub>600</sub> = 0.2 and grown for 4 hr in the indicated hemin concentrations. For fluorescence measurements, cells were pelleted, washed once with PBS, resuspended to OD <sub>600</sub> = 5, and 0.2 ml were placed in duplicate in a black 96-well flat-bottom plates (Nunc Fluorotrac). Fluorescence was measured with a Tecan infinite 200 Pro reader, with eGFP: ex. 480 nm (9 nm bandwidth), em. 520 nm (20 nm bandwidth), and mKATE2 ex. 588 nm (9 nm bandwidth), em. 620 nm (20 nm bandwidth). Each strain was represented by three independent cultures, and each culture was measured twice (technical duplicate), the vector-only culture reading was substracted from all other readings, and the ratio of eGFP to mKATE2 was calculated. The experiment shown was preceded by four experiments with different strain combinations and media, all showing reduced heme intake in the <italic>frp1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>frp2<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants compared to the wild-type. Statistical analysis: To test the effect of genotype and hemin concentration on the ratio, we used two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference test, which controls for multiple comparisons. For each clone we report the results of pairwise comparisons between each hemin concentration and no hemin. The analysis was performed using R.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Cells were imaged with a Zeiss Axioskop Imager epifluorescence microscope equipped with DIC optics, using a ×100 objective.

This study uses biochemical and genetic methods to identify the missing link between heme receptors and heme utilization by cells. Specifically, they provide convincing evidence that the ferric reductase-like proteins Frp1 and Frp2 have major roles in iron acquisition from heme, thus identifying a new function for these proteins. Understanding how pathogenic fungi obtain iron and identifying differences in fungal and host iron metabolism can provide valuable leads for drug discovery.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80604.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Casadevall</surname><given-names>Arturo</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Culotta</surname><given-names>Valeria C</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.25.493415">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.25.493415v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

We all agree that this would be very important issue if it could be addressed. However, we recognize that it would require a considerable amount of new work and we are not requiring it.

In Figure 1, Frp1 is clearly dominant for utilization of heme as an Fe source at both pH. In Figure 2, Frp2 is dominant for heme uptake by the sensor, although studies were only conducted at neutral pH. These apparent discrepancies are not a simple matter of pH because, in Fig, 1, Frp1 is still dominant at neutral pH.

Indeed, Frp2 appears to be more dominant in the sensor assay (heme uptake) but is less dominant in the growth assays (heme utilization). We have rewritten the description of the experiment (lines 208-210 in the revision), and added a possible explanation for the discrepancy in the Discussion (lines 440-445).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistics are needed for the graphs of Figure 4B and Figure 5B. In Figure 4B, 100 cells were counted. Was that from one experimental trial, explaining why no error bars?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding Figure 4B, preliminary experiments had consistently show cell surface relocalization of the Frp proteins in the presence of hemin or hemoglobin. In the experiment shown, this relocalization was quantitated, and a parallel experiment, identical to the one we showed except that the cells were exposed to hemin rather than to hemoglobin, showed very similar kinetics of cell surface relocalization of the signal and concomitant decrease in ER signal. However, in the course of testing the nature of the vacuolar Frp1/2-GFP signals as prompted by comment #5, we found that, while the shift of the GFP signal to the cell surface was robustly reproducible, the decrease in ER signal was not. This might be due to a different induction regime: rather than using cultures that had already been grown overnight under iron limitation, as we had in previous experiments, in the new experiments we shifted log-phase cells growing in YPD to iron-limited medium, in order to monitor induction from a low expression baseline. In any case, increase in cell surface signal is not always accompanied by decrease in the ER signal. We have thus modified the text accordingly. New panels B and C of Figure 4 show induction of Frp1 and Frp2-GFP without and with hemin, and kinetics of appearance of the signal on the cell surface, respectively. (The new experiments uniformly use hemin rather than hemoglobin, since previous experiments indicated that both compounds induce similar changes in Frp1 and Frp2 subcellular distribution).</p><p>Regarding statistics, for the graphs in Figure 4C and Figure 5B, we have now added asterisks indicating statistically significant differences from time 0’ and from vector control, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1C – the data with pga7 is impossible to see.

Fixed, thanks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The vacuolar signal of the GFP proteins looks luminal. If the authors think this is degraded Frp1 and Frp2, they should mention this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this up. We had indeed assumed that the luminal signal represented remnants of the Frp1-GFP and Frp2-GFP proteins, the GFP moiety being notoriously slower to degrade in the vacuole. However, this comment prompted us to test this notion directly by Western blotting. As can be seen in new Figure 4 —figure supplement 2, only the full-length fusion proteins are detectable by Western. This is true whether in the presence of hemin, where more of the signal is on the cell surface, or in its absence, where the vacuolar signal is more prominent, or whether upon shifting the induced cells to iron satiety, which causes degradation of the fusion proteins. This suggests that there is no accumulation of GFP degradation fragments in the cell, and that all the visible GFP signal represents full-length, potentially active protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is very clearly written and the experiments are presented in a very deliberate sequence that makes for a very clear set of studies.

We couldn’t agree more regarding the importance of the questions raised by the reviewer. These questions form a main section of our current research program. Regarding interaction between Frp1 and Pga7 – which could be transient –, we have already attempted co-i.p. of the proteins with or without crosslinking – so far without success. Proximity labeling is something we hadn’t considered, we will now. Regarding direct heme transfer from the CFEM hemophores to Frp1/2, demonstrating such a transfer is technically much more challenging than showing heme transfer between the CFEM hemophores, because Frp1/2 are not soluble proteins, and because they already contain two catalytic hemes in their transmembrane domain. Therefore, we are currently focusing on identifying the heme receptor site on Frp1, and, with collaborators, on demonstrating the predicted heme reductase activity of Frp1/2.</p></body></sub-article></article>
