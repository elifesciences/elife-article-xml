Xrn1p-dependent degradation in P-bodies is the most prevalent decay pathway, yet, P-bodies may facilitate not only decay, but also act as a storage compartment. However, which and how mRNAs are selected into different degradation pathways and what determines the fate of any given mRNA in P-bodies remain largely unknown. We devised a new method to identify both common and stress-specific mRNA subsets associated with P-bodies. mRNAs targeted for degradation to P-bodies, decayed with different kinetics. Moreover, the localization of a specific set of mRNAs to P-bodies under glucose deprivation was obligatory to prevent decay. Depending on its client mRNA, the RNA-binding protein Puf5p either promoted or inhibited decay. Furthermore, the Puf5p-dependent storage of a subset of mRNAs in P-bodies under glucose starvation may be beneficial with respect to chronological lifespan.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mRNA sorting</kwd><kwd>processing bodies</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>mRNA decay</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_141207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Congwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Spang</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008375</institution-id><institution>Universität Basel</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Congwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Spang</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG0031/2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Congwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name><name><surname>Spang</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerische Initiative in Systembiologie, SystemsX.ch</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2009/025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmich</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name><name><surname>Beerenwinkel</surname><given-names>Niko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3100308_163480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Congwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Spang</surname><given-names>Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Werner Siemens Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Congwei</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>Julie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An unbiased screen using various stresses reveals selective mRNA transport into P-bodies, in which mRNAs are either stored or decayed in a process that may promote chronological lifespan in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells are often subjected to environmental fluctuations, such as nutrient deficiency, osmotic shock and temperature change. Therefore, cells have evolved a variety of cellular mechanisms to adapt and survive under those conditions, which are generally referred to as stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mager and Ferreira, 1993</xref>). Regulation of transport, translation and stability of mRNAs are among the first acute responses contributing to the rapid adjustment of the proteome. In response to stress, protein synthesis is globally attenuated, but a subset of mRNAs, necessary to cope with the stress, is still subject to efficient translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ashe et al., 2000</xref>). Non-translating mRNAs are mostly deposited into processing bodies (P-bodies) and stress granules (SGs), which are two types of ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs), conserved from yeast to mammals. As the formation of both granules is induced under diverse stress conditions and a number of components appear to be shared, their precise role in stress response is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulkarni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mitchell et al., 2013</xref>). While P-bodies and SGs both participate in repression of translation and mRNA storage, P-bodies represent also the main site for mRNA degradation via the 5’-decapping-dependent pathway, the 5’−3’ exonuclease Xrn1p and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidson et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the decay occurring in P-bodies, a 3’−5’ exonucleolytic pathway, via the exosome, exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Parker, 1998</xref>). More recently, a co-translational RNA decay pathway has been discovered, which responds to ribosome transit rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, some of the P-body components such as the helicase Dhh1p and the exonuclease Xrn1p also act in the co-translational pathway. Moreover, other P-body components such as the decapping activator Dcp2p have been found to associate with polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). How and which mRNAs are selected into the different pathways, in particular under stress, remains elusive, partly because unbiased methods to identify RNA species are still not widely used. Here, we devised a novel method to identify RNA species in RNPs, in particular P-bodies.</p><p>The protein composition of P-bodies has been extensively studied in both yeast and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulkarni et al., 2010</xref>), yet, numerous auxiliary and transient components are still being discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a tight regulation of the RNA inventory and fate. Very little is known, however, about the regulation of mRNA fate in P-bodies. To date, the RNA inventory in P-bodies under a particular stress remains unclear, and in yeast only a handful of mRNAs have been confirmed to localize to P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai and Futcher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lavut and Raveh, 2012</xref>). Several studies have proposed P-bodies to act not only as decay compartments but also to store and later release RNAs back into the translation pool, particularly upon stress removal. This notion is primarily supported by an observed dynamic equilibrium of mRNA localization between polysomes and P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, this model has been challenged and it was proposed that Xrn1p-dependent decay might occur outside P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>), which is supported by findings that the 5’ decapping machinery is present at membrane-associated polysomes under non-stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). Still, a prevailing hypothesis in the field is that specific mRNAs preferentially accumulate in P-bodies under different stresses promoting cell adaption and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Decker and Parker, 2012</xref>). In support of this concept, the number, morphology and half-life of P-bodies vary depending on the particular stress. For example, under glucose starvation only a few, large, long-lived P-bodies are observed microscopically, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> stress produces numerous, small P-bodies that disappear within 30 to 45 min after the initial induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilchert et al., 2010</xref>). Lacking a global picture of mRNA species in P-bodies greatly hinders the study of the functional role of P-bodies in mRNA turnover and stress response.</p><p>A major obstacle in the universal identification of mRNAs present in P-bodies is that at least a portion of the transcripts are likely engaged in deadenylation or degradation, and, hence, commonly used oligo(dT) purification provides an incomplete and biased picture of mRNAs present in P-bodies. We overcame this obstacle by adapting and improving a crosslinking affinity purification protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>) to globally isolate P-body associated transcripts. We demonstrate that P-bodies contain distinct mRNA species in response to specific stresses. The sequestered transcripts underwent different fates depending on their function, for example: mRNAs involved in overcoming stress were stabilized while others were degraded. Similarly, mRNA decay kinetics differed depending on the mRNA examined. Our observations are consistent with a dual role of P-bodies in mRNA degradation and storage. Under glucose starvation, the RNA-binding protein Puf5p plays a central role in regulating the decay of a set of mRNAs and is also responsible for the localization and stability of another set. Moreover, the stabilization of at least one mRNA in a Puf5-dependent manner may contribute to chronological lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel method to isolate RNAs sequestered into P-bodies</title><p>To determine the mRNA species sequestered into P-bodies upon different stress conditions, we combined and improved a method based on in vivo chemical crosslinking and affinity purification, which we had previously used to identify regulators and protein components of P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>) with commonly used techniques to generate RNA libraries for subsequent RNA-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hafner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kishore et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We refer to this method as <italic>c</italic>hemical <italic>C</italic>ross-<italic>L</italic>inking coupled to <italic>A</italic>ffinity <italic>P</italic>urification (cCLAP). Our earlier work showed that P-bodies in yeast are in very close proximity to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that they fractionate with ER membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilchert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). To explore the mRNA content of P-bodies, either Dcp2p or Scd6p, which are part of the 5’ and the 3’UTR-associated complex of P-bodies, respectively, were chromosomally tagged with a His<sub>6</sub>-biotinylation sequence-His<sub>6</sub> tandem tag (HBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tagwerker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). P-bodies were either induced through glucose starvation or through the addition of CaCl<sub>2</sub> or NaCl. We chose CaCl<sub>2</sub> as stressor because secretory pathway mutants induce P-bodies through a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent pathway, which is mimicked by the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilchert et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, this induction pathway is different from the one employed by the cell upon glucose starvation. NaCl was selected as an alternative hyperosmotic stress to determine whether different hyperosmotic stresses would elicit the same or different responses. We chose formaldehyde as cross-linking agent because it can be directly applied to the culture medium and is easily and rapidly quenchable allowing precise cross-linking conditions without introducing any unwanted stress like through centrifugation or medium changes prior to the cross-link reaction. Yeast cells were exposed to each stressor for 10 min, cross-linked and, after lysis, P-bodies were enriched from the membrane fraction through the HBH-tag present on either Dcp2p or Scd6p. Strictly speaking we are enriching mRNAs that can be crosslinked to Dcp2p or Scd6p or their interaction partners under stress conditions. Given that we identified P-body components previously using this method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>), and that the Scd6p experiment clustered well with the ones performed with Dcp2p, makes it likely that the RNAs, we identified are present in P-bodies. We chose to stress the cells for only 10 min in order to exclude any contribution of SGs, which are not present at this time point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kilchert et al., 2010</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Neither the tagged P-body component nor the purification method used for RNA-Seq sample preparation perturbs the clustering pattern, indicating a high degree of reproducibility of our method.

Reads on stress-specific targets were distributed over the entire length without any preferential accumulation or depletion at the 5’ or 3’ UTRs as exemplified by the selected transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To ensure the specificity of the mRNAs associated with P-body components, we performed RNA-Seq experiments on the total RNA content under control as well as the different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). mRNAs that were upregulated upon any of the stresses, as determined by total RNA-Seq, were by and large not enriched in the corresponding fraction of the P-body components with less than 15% overlap between the RNAs generally upregulated in stress response and the RNAs pulled down by P-body components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, from the glucose-starvation P-body component associated mRNA pool, polysome-associated mRNAs identified under the same stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>) were eliminated. These data then allowed us to determine whether a general feature such as gene length would contribute to the likelihood to be associated with P-bodies under a particular stress. Therefore, we plotted the length of the genes associated with P-body components and of genes generally upregulated under specific stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). P-body component associated mRNAs were shorter under glucose starvation and longer under osmotic stress than the generally upregulated mRNAs under the respective stress conditions. Thus, gene length may provide a bias to whether or not its gene product is associated with P-body components under specific stress conditions.</p><p>If mRNA deposition in P-bodies was context-dependent, one would expect an enrichment of mRNAs belonging to the same pathways/processes. To test this notion, we employed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (biological process) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with the Venn diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), a number of biological processes were shared by all three stress conditions, yet many GO terms were specific to one particular stress, suggesting that association of mRNAs with P-body components is, in general, context-dependent. For example, within the glucose specific set, we found a group of processes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (herein referred to as mitochondria-related mRNAs). This group is of particular interest, as mitochondria respiration genes are generally up-regulated upon glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that a subset of mRNAs is sequestered in P-bodies in a stress-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>mRNAs localize to P-bodies in a context-dependent manner</title><p>Thus far, we have shown that mRNAs can be cross-linked to P-body components in a stress-dependent manner. To demonstrate that these mRNAs indeed localize to P-bodies, we employed fluorescence in situ hybridization coupled to immunofluorescence (FISH-IF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used Dcp2p as P-body marker for immunofluorescence. Since P-bodies exhibit a compact, dense structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Souquere et al., 2009</xref>), the traditionally employed long probes (up to 1000 nt) used in FISH are not suitable for detection of mRNA in P-bodies. However, using multiple 50–100 nt FISH probes (4–8 per transcript) allowed us to detect specific mRNAs in P-bodies, as the no probe control only exhibited background staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Regardless, we may not be able to detect all mRNA molecules in the cell and are likely underestimating the extent of localization of mRNAs within P-bodies. In addition, transcripts in yeast are often present in less than 10 copies per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zenklusen et al., 2008</xref>), which may hinder detection by this method. Moreover, most mRNAs are degraded in P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>), therefore any given mRNA may be detected in P-bodies at any given time. Finally, our FISH-IF method is based on enzymatic fluorescence development and hence does not provide single molecule resolution and is not quantitative with respect to number of RNA molecules per spot. Again, the accessibility by the probe and also by the enzyme is potentially better in the cytoplasm than in a compact assembly such as the P-body. Taken theses constraints into consideration, we set the threshold at ≥1.5 fold enrichment over control mRNAs to determine P-body association.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29815.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Validation of glucose-specific candidates by combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence (FISH-IF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of combined FISH-IF technique.

We found mRNAs that were potentially excellent candidates for being stored in P-bodies. The mitochondria-related genes were transcriptionally up-regulated following glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), while at the same time transcripts were sequestered in P-bodies. To investigate the fate of P-body associated mRNAs further, we employed the 4TU non-invasive pulse-chase RNA labeling technique followed by qRT-PCR.

To differentiate P-body specific degradation from the exosome decay pathway, we analyzed the mRNA half-life in the presence and absence of the P-body 5'−3' exonuclease Xrn1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>ACT1</italic> was used as endogenous reference gene due to its high stability during glucose starvation and because it was neither significantly associated with P-body components nor enriched in the total RNA samples under any stress condition tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). No significant reduction in mRNA levels was observed for Group II mRNAs (<italic>ATP11</italic>, <italic>ILM1</italic>, <italic>MRPL38</italic> and <italic>AIM2</italic>) for up to one hour of glucose withdrawal, suggesting that those transcripts were stabilized inside P-bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, Group II). Consistently, after a rapid initial increase, the total transcript levels remained constant over the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Group II). Conversely, the transcripts within group I (<italic>BSC1</italic>, <italic>TPI1</italic>, and <italic>RLM1</italic>) underwent Xrn1p-dependent decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, Group I). Intriguingly, the onset and the kinetic of the decay varied from mRNA to mRNA, indicating that individual intrinsic properties of the mRNAs may determine their half-lives within P-bodies. Likewise, the total mRNA levels were modulated in a similar way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata2">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>, Group I), hinting towards coordination between P-body specific decay and transcription. To ensure that the chase conditions were strong enough and to exclude any possible contribution from transcription, we repeated the pulse chase and added the maximal soluble concentration of uracil (32 mM).

Consistent with the changes in mRNA levels, Group I protein levels dropped, while the Group II protein levels remained stable or increased over the glucose starvation time course. Our results reveal distinct and separable roles of P-bodies in regulating mRNA stabilities. On one hand, P-bodies contain transcripts undergoing decay in an individually regulated time-dependent manner. On the other hand, certain mRNAs, whose protein product contributes to stress response, are protected by P-bodies. It is possible, however, that other regulatory circuits operate independent of P-bodies, in particular since mRNAs could be cycling in and out of P-bodies in a relevant and dynamic manner influencing the fate of a particular mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Puf5p contributes to both recruitment and decay of P-body mRNAs</title><p>Next, we aimed to record the transport of mRNAs into P-bodies by live-cell imaging using the well-established MS2 and U1A systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung and Takizawa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zenklusen et al., 2007</xref>). Tagging transcripts with U1A stem loops massively induced P-body formation under non-stress conditions (data not shown). Similarly, appending candidate transcripts with MS2 loops increased the co-localization of mRNA and P-body components to almost 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which is in marked contrast to the FISH-IF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This high degree of co-localization can be explained by the recent finding that highly repetitive stem-loops can lead to non-degradable 3’ mRNA fragments causing mislocalization of tagged mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garcia and Parker, 2015</xref>). Considering the strong discrepancy between the FISH and MS2 localization data in terms of extent of P-body localization, and the recently published potential aberrant localization of MS2-tagged mRNAs, we decided to use the more conservative and less error-prone FISH-IF method to identify factors required for the localization and/or fate of mRNAs in P-bodies. We explored several known protein factors, which may contribute to this process with a candidate approach using <italic>BSC1</italic> (Group I) and <italic>ATP11</italic> (Group II) probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

To address this possibility, we performed electro mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with 500 bp of the <italic>ATP11</italic> 3’UTR and Puf3p and Puf5p.

Our data so far suggest that Puf5p directly controls <italic>BSC1</italic> and <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA stability and <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA localization.</p><p>Puf5 might be required for either transport of <italic>ATP11</italic> to P-bodies or to protect <italic>ATP11</italic> from decay, or both processes.

Finally, we aimed to artificially localize Puf5p to P-bodies by fusing Puf5p to U1A binding protein tagged with GFP and <italic>PGK1-U1A-STL1</italic> RNA. Already under non-inducing conditions, some P-bodies were induced and positive for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), a phenotype, which was enhanced under glucose starvation. Under starvation about 50–60% of the U1ACP-GFP-Puf5 co-localized with Dcp2-2xmCherry. However, tethering of Puf5p to P-bodies did not affect <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata5">Figure 4—source data 5</xref>).

Perhaps not surprisingly, we did not find any significant primary sequence conservations or enrichment, of any particular motif. Next, we clustered stress-dependent P-body mRNAs based on secondary structures within the 3’UTR using NoFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Middleton and Kim, 2014</xref>). In comparison to non-candidate mRNAs, each stress-specific candidate set contained 10–20 clusters of transcripts that were differentially enriched in certain structure motifs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Interestingly, enriched motifs exhibited strong similarities (Z-score &gt;3) to known microRNA (miRNA) motifs from RFAM, in line with the observation that at least in mammalian cells and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, P-bodies were shown to contain miRNA silencing complex components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sen and Blau, 2005</xref>). One possible explanation is that general stem-loop structures may favor P-body localization under stress. To test this hypothesis, we determined the predicted number of stem loops in the 3’UTR of mRNAs enriched specifically under stress versus inert mRNAs and calculated the distance between stem loops. We observed a decrease in the distance between stem loops, suggesting clustering of the loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine whether clusters of stem loops would be sufficient to drive P-body localization, we transplanted the 3’UTR of <italic>BSC1</italic> or <italic>ATP11</italic> to a non-P-body associated transcript <italic>SEC59</italic> and a sodium specific P-body component-associated transcript <italic>YLR042C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Thus, although the 3’UTRs are essential, they are not sufficient by themselves to drive mRNA transport into P-bodies.

Here we demonstrate that the content and the fate of mRNA in P-bodies is stress-dependent, varying from decay to stabilization. We furthermore provide evidence that different mRNA classes use different mechanisms to be P-body localized. The localization and fate of these mRNAs are dependent on interactions with RNA binding proteins such as Puf5p and essential information present in the 3’UTR of the mRNA.</p><p>To enable this analysis, we first devised a method to enrich RNPs based on in vivo chemical cross-linking followed by streptavidin affinity purification. This method allows the identification and global analysis of mRNAs associated with P-body components. We previously used a similar approach to successfully discover a novel exomer-dependent cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ritz et al., 2014</xref>), novel interactors of the ArfGAP Glo3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Estrada et al., 2015</xref>) and a novel facultative P-body component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). We improved the procedure permitting the reliable enrichment and detection of mRNAs associated with membrane-localized P-body components under a variety of stress conditions. Furthermore, our method works regardless of poly(A) tail length or partial transcript degradation, and hence could be applied for the identification of many types of RNAs. Moreover, this method would also be applicable to study protein-DNA interactions.</p><p>We mostly concentrated our subsequent analysis on hits from the glucose starvation experiments but it is very likely that these findings can be generalized to other stresses. We identified three classes of mRNAs associated with P-body components at membranes. The first class consists of mRNAs that are generally deposited into P-bodies, independent of the stressor. We did not investigate their fate further in this study, but we assume that most of those transcripts would be prone to decay. The second class contains mRNAs that are stressor-dependent and decayed. It is important to note that the decay rate of mRNAs in this class is very variable and could represent an intrinsic property of the mRNA or a subset of mRNAs. Some transcripts will be decayed almost immediately after arrival in P-bodies, while others are initially excluded from degradation. The kinetics of decay also appears to vary, indicating that even within P-bodies the degradation of client RNAs is highly regulated. Finally, the third class corresponds to mRNAs that are also stress-specific, but are stabilized, rather than being degraded. It appears as if this class is enriched in transcripts whose products would be beneficial for stress survival. This hypothesis is based on the stabilization of transcripts involved in mitochondrial function under glucose starvation, a condition under which mitochondria are up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2004</xref>). A recent study also suggested stabilization of transcripts in a P-body-dependent manner under high-osmolarity stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huch and Nissan, 2017</xref>). Thus, P-bodies emerge as context-dependent regulator in stress responses. Although P-bodies have been proposed previously as sites of mRNA decay and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>), the studies on which this model was based had either been performed on very few selected transcripts or artificial transcripts with extended G-tracts driving P-body localization through imaging or genome-wide analyses, taking all the mRNAs present in the lysate into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Our approach is different in that we enrich first for P-bodies and then extract the RNA specifically from the P-body fraction. Therefore, our data provide an unprecedented wealth of information on the mRNA content and fate within P-bodies.</p><p>Since the fate of an mRNA is stressor-dependent, it is tempting to speculate that the different mRNA classes are recruited to P-bodies through different pathways. In support of this hypothesis, we identified the RNA binding protein Puf5p as a protein regulating both the localization of one transcript, as well as the degradation of another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The latter function is easily explained by the established role of Puf5p as interactor of the Ccr4/Not deadenylation complex, which shortens the poly(A)-tail independent of the subsequent route of destruction through P-bodies or exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balagopal et al., 2012</xref>). In fact, <italic>BSC1</italic> mRNA was recently identified as Puf5p target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wilinski et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of Puf5p, <italic>ATP11</italic> is no longer P-body localized and is destabilized. Hence, in this case, P-bodies protect an mRNA from degradation in a Puf5p-dependent manner. It is tempting to speculate that the P-body localized <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA is protected from interaction with Puf3p, which would be able to trigger <italic>ATP11</italic> destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miller et al., 2014</xref>). It is striking, however, that Puf5p possesses this dual role in stabilization and destruction depending on the client mRNA, as well as being involved in the localization of mRNAs to P-bodies.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29815.032</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Schematic model summarizing our findings.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-29815-fig6-v1"/></fig><p>The notion that mRNAs are decayed in P-bodies was recently challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>). Instead, it was suggested that decay might mostly happen co-translationally. We cannot exclude that a part of the RNAs is degraded co-translationally, since the decay machinery in both processes appears to be identical. In favor of mRNA decay in P-bodies, we confirmed hits from the biochemical enrichment procedure by in vivo localization studies. We found that P-body-localized mRNAs were degraded with different kinetics. Moreover, we would expect to find significantly higher sequence coverage of the 3’ region of candidate mRNAs, which we did not observe. Also, the fate -stabilization versus degradation- of <italic>BSC1</italic> in a Puf5p-dependent manner, which was not accompanied by modulating P-body localization, is in support of P-body as decay compartment. Thus, our data are consistent with mRNA degradation in P-bodies under stress conditions. In contrast, <italic>ATP11</italic> may become a co-translational degradation target in the absence of Puf5p. However co-translational mRNA decay might still be a major pathway in non-stressed cells, in which microscopically visible P-bodies are not frequently detected. At least the 5’ decay machinery, the helicase Dhh1p and the 5’exonuclease Xrn1p have been found to be associated with polysomes also in the absence of a stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sweet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our findings demonstrate that P-body associated mRNA can follow different fates, namely decay or stabilization. Whether these two functions are performed by the same or different P-bodies remains unclear. We favor the possibility, however, that both functions can be provided by the same P-body. Recent data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> sponge bodies, which are the equivalent of P-bodies in embryos, suggest that storage and decay may happen in the same compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weil et al., 2012</xref>). Likewise, there is no evidence thus far for differential protein composition of P-bodies formed under the same stress condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kulkarni et al., 2010</xref>). Although, it is possible that the transient protein components may vary from one another, we expect the major factors would be discriminative to fulfill opposing functions and mRNA selectivity.</p><p>Stabilized mRNAs may return into the translation competent pool. So far, we cannot exclude that the stabilized mRNA is cycling in and out of P-bodies dynamically and whether this is part of the stabilization process. The finding that P-body localized Puf3p triggered <italic>ATP11</italic> destruction would argue against dynamic cycling being a requirement for stabilization; future experiments are needed to clarify this point. Furthermore, whether this re-initiation would be through diffusion of the mRNA from the P-body into the cytoplasm or through another organelle, such as stress granules (SGs), remains to be established. SGs harbor stalled translation initiation complexes, whose formation can also be triggered upon a variety of stresses. Additionally, SGs frequently dock and fuse with P-bodies, and they share some common protein factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buchan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buchan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoecklin and Kedersha, 2013</xref>). As mRNAs in SGs are polyadenylated, they are not subject to immediate degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stoecklin and Kedersha, 2013</xref>). Based on those evidences, we speculate that the re-engagement of stable transcripts into translation is likely mediated via SGs.</p><p>A number of genome-wide studies detailing responses to stress have been performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Munchel et al., 2011</xref>). Most of the studies deal with global RNA synthesis and decay, but do not provide any insights into the regulated storage of mRNA. In this study, we addressed this issue and uncovered Puf5 as key molecule in the decision-making whether or not a particular mRNA must be degraded under glucose starvation. This decision-making explains Puf5p’s positive effect on chronological lifespan, as increasing Atp11p levels were sufficient to rescue the glycogen accumulation defect of <italic>∆puf5</italic> cells. How the decision making is brought about will be the focus of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">strains are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">primers are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">genetic reagent (Plasmid)</td><td valign="top">pDZ274</td><td valign="top">Addgene plasmid # 45929</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">genetic reagent (Plasmid)</td><td valign="top">pDZ415</td><td valign="top">Addgene plasmid # 45162</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-DIG-POD</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_514500">AB_514500</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/750 in PBTB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA</td><td valign="top">Covance</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2314672">AB_2314672</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/250 FISH-IF, 1/1,000 WB</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390913">AB_390913</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/250</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">goat anti-mouse-IgG-Alexa 488</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534069">AB_2534069</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/400 in PBS</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Tpi1</td><td valign="top">LSBio</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11132833">AB_11132833</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/1,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-myc</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439694">AB_439694</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/1,000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Pgk1</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221541">AB_221541</ext-link></td><td valign="top">1/1,000</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>Standard genetic techniques were employed throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sherman, 1991</xref>).

The cells were taken up in glucose-free HC-Leu medium afterwards. For the U1A system, HC-Ura-Trp medium was used. For live-cell imaging of GFP- or mCherry-tagged fusions of Dcp2p, Puf5p, Pub1p and Tif4632p, yeast cells were grown in YPD medium to mid-log phase, and resuspended in HC-complete medium lacking glucose.

Binding reactions (20 μL) contained 4,000 cpm of labeled RNA, varying concentrations of protein, 20 U RNasin Plus RNase Inhibitor (Promega) and 1 x binding buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM DTT, 0.01 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol). Reactions were incubated at RT for 30 min, and separated on a 4% non-denaturing acrylamide gel.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Roy Parker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Spang and colleagues apply chemical cross- linking in combination with affinity purification (cCLAP – chemical Cross-Linking coupled to Affinity Purification) with the goal to identify mRNAs that enrich in P-bodies in different stress conditions. The authors use cCLAP in glucose starvation, and upon CaCl2 and NaCl salt stress. They identify more than 1500 mRNAs, which can be classified into mRNAs that are found in all stress condition and mRNAs that are stress specific. A subset of the identified mRNAs is further analyzed to gain insight into how those mRNAs accumulate in P-bodies and what the consequences are of such P-body localization.</p><p>The strengths of this manuscript are that it addresses important and interesting issues as to the composition and function of RNP granules. The weakness of the work is that some of the analyses are limited in their methodology and that some results are overinterpreted. Although there is interest from the reviewers, for acceptance in <italic>eLife</italic>, it will be critical to address these weaknesses (detailed below) to allow the conclusions to be robustly supported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several aspects of the identification of P-body enriched mRNAs need to be clarified and expanded:</p><p>a) There is no clear evidence that the authors enrich for PBs, and it appears that they are really identifying mRNAs that interact with Dcp2 or Scd6 in a variation of CLIP analyses (since the RNPs are digested with T1 nuclease before they are even pelleted?), and thus they essentially analyze pelleted Dcp2 or Scd6 assemblies. This needs to be made implicit and clearly discussed since this impacts their claim that P-bodies per se are being purified. This is also important in light of the FISH analyses (see below).</p><p>b) It is unclear how enriched mRNAs are identified from the RNA-Seq data. There seems to be no comparison to the total RNA-Seq reads, and there is no control for background RNA contamination. At a minimum the methods for calling an mRNA as enriched in the RNA-Seq needs to be clarified, but the manuscript would be much stronger if the &quot;P-body&quot; associated mRNAs were compared to read density in total (ribo-) RNA-Seq as this should allow a more meaningful description of what mRNAs are enriched in the these fractions.</p><p>c) The authors show a principal component analysis as a measure or reproducibility. However, they should also include pair-wise correlations of their read densities and provide R squared values to assess the reproducibility</p><p>d) If the authors had a clear population of mRNAs shown to be enriched in P-bodies, one could perform computational analyses on these mRNAs to see i) how they share molecular features (length, translation efficiency, decay rates, overlap with Pat1, Lsm1 bound mRNAs identified by similar (but not identical) methods (Mitchell et al., 2013), etc.). This might provide new insights into the mechanisms of P-body formation and function.</p><p>2) A key experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> examining whether the identified mRNAs enrich in PBs using FISH. Again several improvements are necessary for these analyses.</p><p>a) What is the basis for using ACT1 and PGK1 as controls? How were ACT1 and PGK1 determined to not show enrichment in P-bodies from the RNA sequencing? Given the very high abundance of these mRNAs, even a low percentage of these mRNAs in P-bodies would give a high number of reads in the samples. Is this seen? This is another example wherein comparing the number of reads in the &quot;P-body&quot; prep as compared to the total RNA-Seq reads would be helpful.</p><p>b) It is important that the authors are explicit about numbers of mRNAs in P-bodies. It appears that an enriched mRNA (such as Bsc1 or ATP11) has approximately 15-12% of the mRNA molecules as overlapping with Dcp2. Thus, the mRNA is enriched over controls, but still a majority of molecules are outside of the P-body assembly. Is this correct? And if so, this needs to be clearly stated and discussed as this makes it more complicated to interpret how P-body localization affects function since at any one time, only a small% of the actual mRNA molecules are associated with P-bodies per se.</p><p>c) Whereas several of the identified mRNAs seem to localize to (-) glucose PBs (with the caveats above), no data for the salt-induced PBs are shown. Does this mean the enrichment protocol didn't work well for these stresses? To validate their protocol additional FISH experiments also for the salt stresses should be shown.</p><p>3) Examining how mRNA decay rates correlate with P-body localization is a good experiment but needs to be improved as follows.</p><p>a) There is a concern that the uracil chase is not effective and this is why some of the mRNAs increase during glucose deprivation relative to actin mRNA. If there is some residual labeling during the chase period, it is difficult to confidently assess how mRNA decay is changing for different classes of mRNAs. Can the authors provide clear data that the chase is robust?</p><p>b) The authors should be more cautious in the interpretation that P-body localization affects the stability/storage. In principle, these differences could be due to other regulatory circuits independent of P-bodies. As discussed above, one should be cautious about this point since the majority of mRNA molecules are not in P-bodies at any one time (although they could be cycling in and out in relevant and dynamic manner, which should be clearly stated).</p><p>c) It would be appropriate to cite the work of Nissan's group who has recently argued that P-bodies can protect some mRNAs during stress (Huch and Nissan, 2017).</p><p>4) The experiments showing Puf5 and the 3' UTR of ATP11 can both affect its concentration in P-bodies and its decay rate raise the possibility that P-body association of this mRNA increases its stability. However, the data could also be interpreted as ATP11 is targeted to P-bodies, and if bound by Puf5, decapping/deadenylation is slowed such that the dwell time within P-bodies is longer and hence more mRNAs at steady state are associated with P-bodies. It would strengthen the manuscript (and be appropriate for publication in a high profile venue like <italic>eLife</italic>) to resolve this issue particularly also in the light of the observation that the Puf5-independent PB-associated BSC1 mRNA is stabilized in the absence of Puf5. Whether Puf5 affects P-body targeting per se, or decapping within it, could be assessed by measuring the association of ATP11 with P-bodies in puf5∆, dcp1∆, puf5∆ dcp1∆ strains, where the affect of Puf5 on ATP11 in the puf5∆ dcp1∆ should reveal whether it affect targeting of mRNAs into P-bodies or their decay rate once there.</p><p>Also, is tethering of Puf5 (via MS2 loops or similar) sufficient for PB localization?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Context-dependent deposition and regulation of mRNAs in P-bodies&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Roy Parker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and Essential revisions:</p><p>During the first round of revision, the authors were able to address several concerns that were raised previously, which has improved the manuscript. However, there are some remaining issues that require attention.</p><p>1) The reviewers remain unconvinced that the authors specifically purify mRNAs 'enriched in P-bodies', both because of the nature of RNAse treatment before purification, and because the analysis to identify enriched mRNAs relies on comparing the mRNAs associated with Dcp2 or Scd6 without stress, to those associated with these proteins during stress. Thus, the impact is really to identify mRNAs associated with these proteins under different stresses. This is a useful contribution but this point should be clear and be reflected in the wording. For example, reviewer 1 suggests that the authors use wordings such as mRNAs &quot;associated with PB components&quot; instead of &quot;enriched in PBs&quot; throughout the text.</p><p>2) The manner by which the enriched mRNAs identified should be shown in a logical flow chart (could be in supplemental). Reviewer 2 asks for this since he is still not sure how the analysis was done and the high similarity between RNA-Seq data sets under all conditions makes him unclear about the statistics. Since all of the manuscript flows from this analysis, it needs to be clear how it was done and what statistical tests were used.</p><p>3) The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> flow chart does not match the written description in the Materials and methods. This adds to the confusion as to how the experiment was done and needs to be clarified.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29815.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Several aspects of the identification of P-body enriched mRNAs need to be clarified and expanded:</p><p>a) There is no clear evidence that the authors enrich for PBs, and it appears that they are really identifying mRNAs that interact with Dcp2 or Scd6 in a variation of CLIP analyses (since the RNPs are digested with T1 nuclease before they are even pelleted?), and thus they essentially analyze pelleted Dcp2 or Scd6 assemblies.

Our previous data indicated that most P-bodies in yeast are ER-associated (Kilchert et al., 2010, Weidner et al., 2014). Initially, we tried the crosslinking approach using just cytosol. To our surprise, we were unable to crosslink any proteinous P-body components to any appreciable extent to Dcp2p tagged with HBH. In contrast, using the P20 membrane fraction allowed the pull-down of other P-body components (Weidner et al., 2014). This does not formerly exclude the existence of non-membrane associated P-bodies as the free Dcp2p or Scd6p may simply bind much better to the resin than the same protein present in a tightly assembled RNP. Nevertheless, we showed previously that with the cross-linking affinity chromatography approach, we can pull down assemblies that contain P-body components. We agree with the reviewers that we cannot exclude the presence of other assemblies in the pulldown. Therefore, we are now more cautious and replaced ‘purified’ with ‘enriched’.</p><p>We modified the Results section and inserted the following statements:</p><p>“Strictly speaking we are enriching mRNAs that can be crosslinked to Dcp2p or Scd6p or their interaction partners under stress conditions. Given that we identified P-body components previously using this method (Weidner et al., 2014), and that the Scd6p experiment clustered well with the ones performed with Dcp2p, makes it likely that the RNAs, we identified are present in P-bodies.”</p><p>“To ensure the specificity of the mRNAs associated with P-body components, we performed RNA-Seq experiments on the total RNA content under control as well as different stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). mRNAs that were upregulated upon any of the stresses, as determined by total RNA-Seq, were generally not enriched in the corresponding P-body fraction with less than 15% overlap between the RNAs generally upregulated in stress response and the RNAs pulled down by P-body components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Moreover, from the glucose-starvation enriched mRNA pool, polysome-associated mRNAs identified under the same stress (Arribere et al., 2011) were eliminated.”</p><p>In addition, we modified the Discussion, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and the Figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> at several places to indicate that with the pull-down we detect RNAs that are associated with P-body components at membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is unclear how enriched mRNAs are identified from the RNA-Seq data.

We had four conditions in each experiment: 1 unstressed control and 3 stress conditions. mRNAs that were crosslinked to Dcp2 or Scd6 under stress but not in the unstressed control were assumed to be enriched. We identified significantly (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) upregulated mRNAs exclusive for each stress condition by testing each individual stress condition against the wild type condition and removing those mRNAs that were identified as common hits when testing the joint set of all three stress conditions against unstressed control. For glucose depletion stress, we additionally excluded genes previously shown to be significantly enriched in polysomes (Arribere et al., 2011) for the same stress.</p><p>We additionally performed total RNA-Seq of untreated, glucose-starved, NaCl<sup>-</sup> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>-stressed <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cultures (3 independent samples per condition), and identified significant (p&lt;0.05) upregulated mRNAs for each condition by following the same procedure described for P-body associated mRNAs. In all cases, we find that less than 15% of the RNAs that are enriched under any stress overlap between the total and the mRNAs, we identified by cCLAP. Thus, we are able to enrich P-body associated mRNAs with our method – or as discussed above mRNAs that can be crosslinked to Scd6, Dcp2 or their interactors under stress. We provide the principle component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), pair-wise correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplemental 1</xref>) and an excel file listing the enriched RNAs from the newly included total RNA-Seq as supplementary material. The new sequencing data were uploaded under the same GEO accession number than the P-body RNA-Seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The authors show a principal component analysis as a measure or reproducibility.

This might provide new insights into the mechanisms of P-body formation and function.</p></disp-quote><p>We searched the lists of mRNAs UV-crosslinked to Dhh1p, Sbp1p, Pat1p and Lsm1p from Mitchell et al., 2013 for the Group I and Group II candidates that we had identified. Of the three mRNAs degraded in P-bodies, only <italic>TPI1</italic> was found, which is a highly abundant mRNA. <italic>BSC1</italic> and <italic>RLM1</italic> were not present. Of the group II (stabilized mRNAs), we found <italic>ATP11, ILM1</italic> and <italic>MRPL38</italic>. Even though the sample size is limited, this finding would suggest that the decayed RNAs polyA-tail shortening occurs early on and hence such RNAs would not be captured by the oligo-dT enrichment. Our unbiased approach would still be able to pick up such RNAs. In contrast, the stabilized mRNAs, which should still contain a polyA-tail, would be detectable by both methods.</p><p>Comparing more globally our hit lists with those from Mitchell et al., 2013, we found that there was surprisingly little overlap. There are a number of reasons, why this might be the case. First of all, the stress applied in both cases was not the same. We used specifically glucose starvation, meaning we used full (YP) medium, from which glucose was omitted, and for the different salt stresses, salts were added to the given concentration. Mitchell et al., 2013 stressed their cells in PBS, depleting cells not only from the carbon source, but also the nitrogen source, amino acids, components essential for nucleotide synthesis etc and a condition that might also yield hypotonic stress. Thus, Mitchell et al. applied a more complex stress, which was perfectly suitable for their analysis to identify the sites of interaction of P-body components with client RNA. Our question was different in that we wanted to determine, which mRNAs are deposited into P-bodies under a specific stress. As such, we had to make sure that we only changed one parameter and avoided complex stresses. Second, as outlined above, oligo-dT will enrich for mRNAs still having an intact polyA-tail, which is part of the method used in the Parker lab. We opted for a more unbiased approach to allow for the detection of mRNAs that have lost most or all of their polyA-tail. Finally, the protocols differ in quite a few additional ways, most notably, the cross-linking method (UV cross-linking vs 2 min formaldehyde cross-linking, and our method not requiring any harvesting step before cross-linking as we cross-linked and quenched in the culture medium), different starting material (whole cell lysate vs membrane fractions), different proteins used for pulldowns, and depletion of ribosomes and ribosomal RNAs in our protocol. The differences in the selection of the RNA and in the protocols may also contribute to the finding that the population of the mRNAs that we identified under all three stresses to be associated with P-body components is more similar than under the individual stresses but still far from being a good overlap with the hits from the Mitchell paper (less than 20%). It is also worth to point out that the bioinformatic analyses performed are different and may also contribute to the difference in the hit-lists.</p><p>We compared the length of genes, as obtained from the gtf file, associated with P-body components versus the ones generally upregulated under a particular stress and found that mRNAs associated with P-body components are shorter under glucose starvation and longer under both hyperosmotic stress conditions, when compared to total RNA levels. These results indicate that the gene length might provide a bias towards P-body component association. This analysis has been included into the manuscript.</p><p>Since there was little overlap between the RNAs from Mitchell et al., 2013 and our dataset, which might be due to the difference in stress application and the experimental procedure, we did not discuss these discrepancies in the manuscript. The Mitchell paper provides an extremely important study about where particular P-body components bind (something we have not addressed at all, as our focus was more on the different RNA species).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A key experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> examining whether the identified mRNAs enrich in PBs using FISH.

To ensure that <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> could be used for normalization of our qRT-PCR experiments, we tested initially the stability of <italic>ACT1, PGK1</italic> and <italic>RPL37b</italic> under glucose starvation using spiked-in humanized <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase RNA for normalization <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>. <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> were then chosen because those mRNAs relatively stable, in particular when compared to <italic>RPL37b</italic>. Now, also the total RNA-Seq confirmed that <italic>PGK1</italic> and <italic>ACT1</italic> do not significantly increase under the stresses applied. Moreover, neither <italic>ACT1</italic> nor <italic>PGK1</italic> were found to be enriched in P-bodies to any significant extent, when compared to the total mRNA and thus, independently confirming the suitability of <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> for normalization of our qRT-PCRs. We do find <italic>ACT1</italic> and <italic>PGK1</italic> in the P-body associated mRNAs fractions. However, similar levels were also found in the unstressed control, most likely due to the high abundance of these mRNAs, as the reviewers already suggested. Hence, they were not enriched under any condition and thus not taken into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It is important that the authors are explicit about numbers of mRNAs in P-bodies. It appears that an enriched mRNA (such as Bsc1 or ATP11) has approximately 15-12% of the mRNA molecules as overlapping with Dcp2. Thus, the mRNA is enriched over controls, but still a majority of molecules are outside of the P-body assembly. Is this correct? And if so, this needs to be clearly stated and discussed as this makes it more complicated to interpret how P-body localization affects function since at any one time, only a small% of the actual mRNA molecules are associated with P-bodies per se.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that only a fraction of the mRNA is localized to the P-bodies. There are several possibilities to explain these findings. The most plausible one is that we perform the FISH-IF after only 10’ of stress induction. This time point was chosen because stress granules are absent, in all stresses at after 10’, facilitating the analysis. However, this comes with the caveat that probably not all mRNAs have yet been targeted to P-bodies. Under glucose starvation, P-bodies grow over time, suggesting that more mRNAs are also deposited there. Another potential caveat of our approach is that we are likely underestimating the number of mRNA molecules in P-bodies. While mRNAs in the cytoplasm are easily detected by long probes (even up to 1,000 bp), those fail to detect mRNAs in P-bodies. We use smaller probes and can detect signals in P-bodies, yet, we have no idea about the efficiency of the labelling. We did not hide the fact that only a fraction of any particular mRNA is associated with P-bodies. In fact, when setting the threshold of 1.5 to call an mRNA enriched, we discussed the points above and some additional ones (subsection “The nature of P-body sequestered RNAs is stress-dependent”, paragraph three).</p><p>We do not think that only a small fraction of mRNA might be present in P-bodies. Clearly our FISH-IF method is not a single molecule FISH method. On top of the consideration above, we use an enzymatic reaction involving tyramide for the detection of the mRNA. When we observe mRNA co-localization within P-bodies, it does not allow us to make any statement about how many mRNA molecules are present in the P-body at that particular time; this could be one, this could be ten. This was an additional reason, why we did not talk about percentage of mRNA signal overlapping with P-bodies but rather about enrichment in P-bodies. We now mention that we use a non-quantitative method to visualize the mRNA in terms of number of molecules in the P-body.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Whereas several of the identified mRNAs seem to localize to (-) glucose PBs (with the caveats above), no data for the salt-induced PBs are shown. Does this mean the enrichment protocol didn't work well for these stresses? To validate their protocol additional FISH experiments also for the salt stresses should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and include now also data on P-body-localized mRNA under CaCl<sub>2</sub> and NaCl stresses. The data are part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examining how mRNA decay rates correlate with P-body localization is a good experiment but needs to be improved as follows.</p><p>a) There is a concern that the uracil chase is not effective and this is why some of the mRNAs increase during glucose deprivation relative to actin mRNA. If there is some residual labeling during the chase period, it is difficult to confidently assess how mRNA decay is changing for different classes of mRNAs. Can the authors provide clear data that the chase is robust?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the same uracil concentration (20 mM) for the chase as has been used by other groups previously. To exclude that the uracil concentration was too low to efficiently compete out 4-Thiouracil, we sought to add the highest possible concentration of uracil, which is 32 mM due to solubility issues. Using 32 mM uracil in the chase, did not change our results on mRNA stability and decay.</p><p>In the original study, we did not want to use transcriptional inhibitors because adding them is obviously also stressful for the cell, and we would not be able to distinguish between stability/decay induced by glucose starvation or transcriptional shut off. However, we assume that using transcriptional inhibitors to provide a second, independent confirmatory line to examine RNA decay rates should be acceptable. We therefore treated cells with 1,10 phenanthroline during glucose starvation and determined decay rates. As for the 4TU experiments, Group II mRNAs were stabilized (except for <italic>ILM1</italic>, which was somewhat less stable, presumably due to the transcription block stress), while Group I mRNAs were still decayed.</p><p>Taken together, we are confident that the uracil chase is indeed efficient and robust.

Whether Puf5 affects P-body targeting per se, or decapping within it, could be assessed by measuring the association of ATP11 with P-bodies in puf5∆, dcp1∆, puf5∆ dcp1∆ strains, where the affect of Puf5 on ATP11 in the puf5∆ dcp1∆ should reveal whether it affect targeting of mRNAs into P-bodies or their decay rate once there.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the great suggestion!

As you will see below, in parallel to targeting Puf5p to P-bodies, we also made the same construct for Puf3p.

We constructed a GFP-U1A binding protein-Puf5 fusion protein and used two independent constructs with U1A loops for targeting to P-bodies. In both cases, in about 40-50% of cells expressing both constructs well, we observed Puf5p co-localization with Dcp2p-mCherry. This co-localization had no effect on the stability of <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA. It is worthwhile to note, however, that most of the GFP-U1A binding protein-Puf5 fusion protein remained in the cytoplasm and also accumulated on vacuoles, complicating the interpretation of the RNA decay data and potential FISH-IF (P-body maker and <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA). We would need to be able to detect GFP, mCherry and the mRNA simultaneously. Unfortunately, we are currently not equipped to do triple colour FISH-IF on P-body-associated mRNAs.</p><p>In parallel, we had also generated a fusion with Puf3p. Unlike Puf5p, Puf3p was targeted to the P-bodies very efficiently, indicating that our targeting-to-P-bodies approach worked in principle. In fact, targeting Puf3p to P-bodies caused the decay of <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA, confirming a role for Puf3p in <italic>ATP11</italic> stability as suggested by Miller et al., 2014.</p><p>We added the experiments to manuscript and updated our model accordingly. We now also speculate about a role Puf3p in <italic>ATP11</italic> mRNA stability.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>During the first round of revision, the authors were able to address several concerns that were raised previously, which has improved the manuscript. However, there are some remaining issues that require attention.</p><p>1) The reviewers remain unconvinced that the authors specifically purify mRNAs 'enriched in P-bodies', both because of the nature of RNAse treatment before purification, and because the analysis to identify enriched mRNAs relies on comparing the mRNAs associated with Dcp2 or Scd6 without stress, to those associated with these proteins during stress. Thus, the impact is really to identify mRNAs associated with these proteins under different stresses. This is a useful contribution but this point should be clear and be reflected in the wording. For example, reviewer 1 suggests that the authors use wordings such as mRNAs &quot;associated with PB components&quot; instead of &quot;enriched in PBs&quot; throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested by the reviewers, we do not state in the manuscript that we purify mRNA enriched in P-bodies with our cCLAP method, only mRNA that is associated with P-body components.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manner by which the enriched mRNAs identified should be shown in a logical flow chart (could be in supplemental). Reviewer 2 asks for this since he is still not sure how the analysis was done and the high similarity between RNA-Seq data sets under all conditions makes him unclear about the statistics. Since all of the manuscript flows from this analysis, it needs to be clear how it was done and what statistical tests were used.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide the logical flow chart/pipeline as requested by reviewer 2, reflecting the description in Material and Methods in the hope that is clarifies any misunderstanding. This chart is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>Just for the record, we respectfully disagree that all of the manuscript flows from this analysis because we independently confirmed our hits by FISH-IF. In addition, independent of the wealth of information and resource the RNAseq data provide, the description of the fates of Group I and Group II mRNAs in P-bodies, the involvement of Puf5 in this fate determination, and the importance of ATP11 mRNA levels for chronological lifespan extension could stand on their own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> flow chart does not match the written description in the Materials and methods. This adds to the confusion as to how the experiment was done and needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to indicate the RNase treatments and corrected the centrifugal force applied to the samples. We hope that this clarifies the experimental outline.</p></body></sub-article></article>
