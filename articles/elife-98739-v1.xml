However, current gold standard polysomnography (PSG) has limited spatial resolution to track brain activity. Additionally, previous fMRI studies were too short to capture full sleep stages and their cycling. To study whole-brain dynamics and transitions across whole-night sleep, we used an unsupervised learning approach, the Hidden Markov model (HMM), on two-night, 16 hr fMRI recordings of 12 non-sleep-deprived participants who reached all PSG-based sleep stages. This method identified 21 recurring brain states and their transition probabilities, beyond PSG-defined sleep stages. The HMM trained on one night accurately predicted the other, demonstrating unprecedented reproducibility. We also found functionally relevant subdivisions within rapid eye movement (REM) and within non-REM 2 stages. This study provides new insights into brain dynamics and transitions during sleep, aiding our understanding of sleep disorders that impact sleep transitions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unsupervised learning</kwd><kwd>sleep transitions</kwd><kwd>EEG-fMRI</kwd><kwd>Hidden Markov Model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Research Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Fan Nils</given-names></name><name><surname>Picchioni</surname><given-names>Dante</given-names></name><name><surname>de Zwart</surname><given-names>Jacco A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Yicun</given-names></name><name><surname>van Gelderen</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Duyn</surname><given-names>Jeff H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole-night fMRI-based sleep classification uncovers distinct substates within N2 and REM sleep stages, along with a transition structure between them.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Given the significant number of people experiencing sleep issues in modern society, there is a growing need for a better understanding of human sleep and its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">The Lancet, 2022</xref>). Sleep is characterized by relative stationary states, each believed to serve specific functions. To characterize these states, human sleep research has historically classified sleep into a set of stages using PSG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968</xref>), which combines electroencephalography (EEG) measures of brain activity with several physiological measures. These sleep stages include the progressively deeper sleep stages of N1, N2, and N3 non-rapid eye movement (NREM), as well as REM. Stages are characterized by different patterns of cortical excitability, as a result of varying levels of modulatory neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones, 2020</xref>). Across a full night of sleep, these stages cyclically alternate, with REM sleep typically occurring 90 min after falling asleep and becoming longer as the night progresses. This cycling is thought to be related to homeostasis and memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Strauss et al., 2022</xref>). Neuroimaging studies using techniques such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and functional MRI (fMRI) have identified unique activity patterns for each PSG stage, contributing to our understanding of sleep’s functional role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Braun et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damaraju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Picchioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rué-Queralt et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tagliazucchi and Laufs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tagliazucchi and van Someren, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While these PSG-guided neuroimaging studies provided new information about sleep function, our understanding of brain dynamics is limited by the low temporal resolution of PSG-based sleep scoring rules (i.e. 30 s epochs), low spatial resolution (i.e. limited EEG channels on the scalp), and the subjective visual inspection rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Himanen and Hasan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lambert and Peter-Derex, 2023</xref>). Alternative to PSG-based sleep staging, applying an unsupervised learning method, the HMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>), to sleep fMRI data can objectively model the time series of sleep and infer sleep brain states that recur at different points during sleep. A recent study demonstrated promising results in capturing NREM sleep transitions by applying HMM to relatively short bouts of sleep (&lt;1 hr) fMRI data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>). However, because the REM stage typically occurs 90 min after falling asleep and lasts progressively longer over time, capturing brain dynamics associated with sleep cycling requires whole-night data.</p><p>In addition, given that studies on sleep stage transitions have shown promising results in diagnoses of various sleep disorders, including narcolepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christensen et al., 2015</xref>), chronic fatigue syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kishi et al., 2011</xref>), and insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2017</xref>), it is of great interest to establish an objective and reliable measurement of brain states transitions within and between PSG sleep stages. To achieve this goal, we applied HMM to a unique and extensive dataset of EEG-fMRI concurrent recordings acquired over 8 hr of sleep each night for two consecutive nights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>). This analysis revealed 21 unique brain states, surpassing the number of PSG-defined sleep stages. For potential application in clinical settings, we tested whether our HMM model trained using night 2 data can predict night 1 data. As it turned out, the identified brain states were highly consistent between night 1 and night 2. Furthermore, analyzing the transition probabilities between HMM states revealed a significant subdivision within N2 and within REM sleep stages. This data-driven, PSG-blind analysis of fMRI data provides reproducible brain states and their transition probabilities, potentially serving as a biomarker of sleep transitions in both normal and clinical settings.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HMM brain states</title><p>To study brain activity representative of the entire Wake-NREM-REM-Wake sleep cycle, we analyzed data from concurrent whole-brain EEG-fMRI measurements on healthy, non-sleep-deprived participants (n=12, age 24±3.5, eight female) over two successive, entire nights of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>). This data was acquired for an independent project that included eight randomly timed acoustical arousals to gauge sleep depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>). PSG-based sleep staging was conducted by a sleep technologist, utilizing data from EEG, EMG, ECG, and EOG, following the criteria outlined by the AASM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Following data preprocessing (see Methods section for details), the fMRI time courses from voxels were spatially averaged within each of the 300 regions of interest (ROIs). These ROIs encompassed cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar areas from the Seitzman 300-ROI atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seitzman et al., 2020</xref>). To ensure consistency and comparability, the ROI time courses were demeaned and variance-normalized for each participant and then concatenated along the temporal dimension. Of note, all 12 participants exhibited at least one complete sleep cycle, encompassing all four sleep stages (N1-3 and REM), during both night 1 and night 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>). This uniquely comprehensive dataset provided a robust foundation for our analyses.</p><p>The HMM estimated from the night 2 data encompassed a collection of whole-brain states. Each of these states was characterized as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, incorporating two key components: (i) a mean activation distribution, signifying the average activity levels within each ROI when a state was active, and (ii) a functional connectivity (FC) matrix, representing the temporal co-variations among ROIs while in that state.</p><p>Furthermore, the HMM featured a transition probability matrix that detailed the likelihood of transitioning between every pair of states. Each state was accompanied by a state time course, delineating the specific time points (defined by the fMRI temporal resolution of 3 s) when the state was active. Notably, the HMM was constructed with 21 distinct states and was devoid of any prior knowledge regarding PSG staging during its estimation. For a comprehensive visual representation of the analytical process, please refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (see the Methods section for a detailed explanation). Also, there is no HMM state that was participant-specific. That is, all 21 HMM states can be found in each participant’s fMRI time course.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Whole-brain activity dynamic identified from functional MRI (fMRI) sleep recording using a Hidden Markov Model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Participants slept inside a scanner from ~23:00 to ~07:00 for two consecutive nights, with concurrent EEG-fMRI recording.

Thirteen of the 21 brain states were most frequently associated with N2 sleep stages. HMM states 8 and 10 predominantly occurred during N3 sleep, while HMM states 6 and 19 were prevalent during REM sleep. HMM state 4 corresponded to the undefined sleep stage, and HMM states 13, 16, and 20 were primarily observed during Wake. Intriguingly, none of the HMM states were predominantly linked to N1 sleep. However, HMM state 11 was active for a comparable duration during both the N1 and N2 sleep stages. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>, we plotted the time courses of two fMRI runs. A high similarity was observed between the HMM state time courses and sleep stage time courses, with the HMM time courses providing more detailed information.</p><p>The temporal characterization of these brain states enabled us to investigate the subtle details of brain dynamics within the traditional PSG-based sleep stages. The average duration, referred to as ‘Lifetime,’ of the HMM states varied from 8.7 to 36 s. Specifically, the mean Lifetime in states associated with N2 stages tended to be shorter compared to those linked to N3, REM, and Wake (with exceptions of state 13), as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Sleep states as modules of HMM state transitions</title><p>The use of a data-driven approach empowered us to explore the temporal dynamics of HMM states, and enabled us to investigate whether the fMRI-driven HMM states reveal novel dimensions of the Wake-NREM-REM-Wake sleep cycle that are hidden from traditional PSG analyses. We examined the transition probabilities among HMM states, identifying modules of HMM states that exhibited more frequent transitions between each other than to other states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vidaurre et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The transition probabilities of HMM brain states were organized into a 21×21 transition matrix. To explore the potential clustering of states with prevalent mutual transitions, a modularity analysis was performed on this matrix based solely on transition probabilities (see Methods section for details). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, this analysis identified five distinct transition modules, encompassing N3-, REM-, Wake-, and two different N2- modules. Importantly, this modularity analysis was conducted independently of PSG-based sleep stages. Interestingly, it revealed a natural clustering of states associated with the same sleep stages. For instance, two HMM states, 6 and 19, both linked to REM sleep, were grouped within the same module.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Results of the modular analysis are based solely on transition probability between Hidden Markov model (HMM) states.</title><p>Each row represents the transition probability of the current HMM state (y-axis) to other states (x-axis).

State 11 was found to be linked to both N1 and N2 sleep stages, while the other three states (13, 16, and 20) were associated with the Wake stages. Further investigation revealed that state 13 typically occurred later in the night and later within an MRI run (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>), suggesting it represents post-sleep wakefulness, whereas states 16 and 20 were pre-sleep wakefulness. State 13 also showed higher PPG variation, respiratory variation, and heart rates than states 16 and 20 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>).

The identified HMM states showed excellent reproducibility to night 1 data in a semi-supervised manner, a feat not previously demonstrated. Moreover, through modular analysis focused solely on transition probabilities, a duality within REM-related and N2-related HMM states was found. These findings offer unique new information about brain sleep states and their transitions that extend beyond previous PSG-based research, as well as fMRI research without whole-night recordings.</p><p>Our work addressed well-known shortcomings of PSG-based sleep staging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeysuriya and Robinson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decat et al., 2022</xref>) by integrating insights from whole-brain fMRI recordings. First and foremost, while traditional PSG-based sleep staging is based on 30 s epochs, HMM analysis allows for a state-specific duration as short as the fMRI temporal resolution (here 3 s). On average, the duration of HMM states is 12 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting a more detailed characterization of brain states compared to PSG-based sleep stage analysis. Second, in terms of spatial resolution, the functional atlas used in our study encompassed 300 ROIs, offering a more detailed view of activation patterns across the entire brain, including subcortical and cerebellar regions that are ignored in PSG-based sleep staging. Third, our approach is mostly automated and objective, eliminating concerns related to inter-rater reliability issues and human error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lambert and Peter-Derex, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rosenberg and Van Hout, 2013</xref>). Lastly, identifying transitions between sleep stages can pose challenges when relying solely on PSG data. In contrast, the HMM is explicitly designed to model these transitions between states, providing a better understanding of the dynamic shifts that occur throughout the sleep cycle, especially when the sleep stages transition is not linear from Wake to NREM to REM in the second half of night.</p><p>Previous research suggests that the analysis of sleep data at a finer temporal resolution than PSG-based sleep staging may be valuable. For example, distinct and recurring states of waking brain activity may be as brief as 100ms during wake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koenig et al., 2005</xref>). In mice, rapid (seconds-scale) fluctuations in brain-wide neuronal spiking activity have been reported during states of low alertness, attributed to fluctuation in adrenergic and cholinergic neuromodulation from basal forebrain and locus coeruleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kjaerby et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Osorio-Forero et al., 2023</xref>). Capturing second-scale changes of brain states with the analysis approach employed in the current study may, therefore, allow a more comprehensive investigation of the functional roles of sleep and shed light on the mechanisms by which these roles are accomplished.</p><p>The modular analysis, which solely relied on transition probabilities between states, uncovered a significant discovery. This analysis clustered HMM states into modules closely associated with PSG-defined sleep stages. This suggests that transition probabilities contain essential information about sleep states and PSG-based sleep stages. For instance, a module predominantly linked to the N3 stage consisted of two N3-related states and one undefined state. Importantly, all three states also exhibited the highest slow-wave density among all states (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Within the Wake module, there were four HMM states, each representing pre-sleep wake (states 16 and 20), post-sleep wake (state 13), and N1-2 (state 11). The absence of a dedicated module/state representing the N1 stage is unsurprising, considering that N1 does not distinctly manifest as a well-defined sleep stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carskadon and Dement, 2011</xref>) and it has the lowest inter-rater reliability (0.24 vs 0.76 overall) among all the PSG-defined sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Two modules were associated with the N2 stage. One of these termed the ‘Deep-N2 module,’ exhibited a low likelihood of transitioning to REM and Wake while showing a slightly higher probability of transitioning to N3-related states when compared to the other module, referred to as the ‘Light-N2 module.’ This finding aligns with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decat et al., 2022</xref>), which separated the N2 stage into a quiet type (before the transition into the N3 stages, which resembles the Deep-N2 module in the current study) and an active type (preceding the transition to REM, related to the Light-N2 module).</p><p>The two REM-related states (6 and 19) within the REM module were notably different in several aspects. First, state 19 displayed a higher propensity for transitioning to the Wake module in contrast to state 6. Second, state 6 tended to occur towards the end of sleep and also late within the fMRI run (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Third, in general, state 6 has a higher/stronger connections compared to state 19 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These differences suggest an alignment of the HMM REM states along the previously defined microstates of REM, i.e., ‘phasic’ and ‘tonic’ episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simor et al., 2020</xref>). Tonic REM is thought to be an intermediate state between wakefulness and phasic REM and is associated with a higher environmental awareness. Phasic REM occurs more often at the end of the night and is associated with a higher level of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simor et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, HMM state 19 might represent tonic REM given the high transition probability to Wake-related HMM states, while HMM state 6 might be related to phasic REM with higher FC and occurring later in the night.</p><p>In terms of both BOLD activation and FC patterns, a notable divergence between N3-related states and Wake-related states is observed in the interaction between DMN and its ACNs (SAL/CON/FPN, etc.). It is plausible that the degree of correlation or anticorrelation between DMN and its ACNs is a pivotal factor influencing the transitions from wakefulness to light sleep and, subsequently, to deep sleep. The SAL is considered crucial for cognitive control, as it handles the perception and response to homeostatic demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Menon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peters et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Seeley, 2019</xref>). It further acts as a mediator for dynamic interactions among other prominent large-scale brain networks engaged in externally focused attention (FPN) and internally directed self-referential cognitive processes (DMN). It is plausible that during sleep, the mediating function of the SAL is temporarily suspended to allow for its restoration. Recent findings have indicated that disruptions in SAL connections were observed following one night of sleep deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2015</xref>) or in individuals with insomnia disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>There are a few limitations worth mentioning. First, we made an arbitrary selection of 13 principal components for PCA, accounting for 40.7% of the total variance. While this percentage of explained variance may seem low, it was a necessary step to stabilize the fitting of the HMM in the current study. Notably, the trained HMM demonstrated generalization to night 1 data, validating the chosen principal components as they encompass sufficient information about the fMRI signals. Second, while our study involved a relatively small number of participants (12), it included a large amount of fMRI data (~16 hr scan) per participant. Although the HMM trained on data from 12 participants was robust, the generalizability of the current results to different populations—such as healthy aging individuals and clinical populations—needs to be demonstrated in future studies, particularly with larger sample sizes and more diverse populations. Third, we chose to not include EEG features in our data-driven model. However, the current method is not limited to fMRI data and can be applied to EEG data. Given that previous data-driven studies based on EEG data have suggested that there might be more than five traditional sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koch et al., 2014</xref>), as well as subdivisions within these traditional sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Decat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Simor et al., 2020</xref>), future studies may apply data-driven models on both fMRI and EEG data. Fourth, while we selected 21 HMM brain sleep states based on model evaluation parameters in the current study, the exact number of sleep states is not fixed and likely depends on various sample- and methods-related factors, such as sample size and model setups.</p><p>There are some key differences in data acquisition and analysis that make it challenging to directly compare HMM states between the current study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref> collected only 1-hr-long sleep data from 18 participants, whereas our current study includes 8-hr-long sleep data from 12 participants for two consecutive nights. As discussed in the introduction, full sleep cycling cannot be obtained from 1 hr long sleep due to the lack of REM stage and incomplete sleep cycles. Second, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, the four wake-NREM stages had roughly the same duration. In contrast, in our current study (night 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the N2 stage comprises 43% of total sleep, which aligns with the natural N2 composition of nocturnal sleep stages. This discrepancy might explain the different number of N2-related states found in the two studies, with 3 out of 19 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stevner et al., 2019</xref> versus 13 out of 21 in our current study.</p><p>To summarize, we demonstrated how a data-driven analysis of an extensive sleep fMRI dataset can reproducibly characterize the full pattern of arousal state changes that recur during a whole night’s sleep. The findings underscore the advantages of the whole-night fMRI data, over the traditional PSG sleep staging and previous fMRI sleep studies, in achieving a fine-grained characterization of brain sleep states and their transitions. The successful generalization of our approach trained on night 2 to night 1 data shows its robustness, reliability, and objectivity across multiple nights. Our exploration of transitions between HMM states unveiled modules closely linked to distinct sleep stages, revealing a duality within N2-related modules that further dissects N2 stages into ‘light’ and ‘deep’ N2 modules. We identified a duality with REM-related HMM states, which resembles the 'phasic' versus 'tonic' REM. Additionally, we separated pre-sleep from post-sleep Wake states. Analysis of brain activation and FC patterns of HMM states indicated that the connections between DMN and ACNs, especially SAL, may play a critical role in the transition from wake to light sleep and subsequently to deep sleep. Collectively, this enriched comprehension of brain dynamics during nocturnal sleep holds the potential for identifying promising biomarkers associated with sleep disorders that significantly impact sleep-stage transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data acquisition and processing</title><p>All the data used in this study followed approved human subjects research protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (USA, Protocol Number 16 N-0031), and informed consent was obtained from the participants.

The data was acquired at a temporal resolution of 3 s, employing a 90° flip angle and an echo time of 36 ms. Data acquisition utilized a multi-slice echoplanar imaging approach in an interleaved manner.

These physiological parameters were collected using a Biopac acquisition system with TSD200-MRI and TSD221-MRI transducers, combined with an MP 150 digitizer sampling at 1 kHz, sourced from Biopac in Goleta, CA, USA. To ensure accurate synchronization, data collection for EEG was timed using the 10 MHz clock from the MR instrument.

Throughout each night, the fMRI experiments were intermittently disrupted by either acoustically stimulated or spontaneous awakenings. As a consequence, a series of experimental runs was generated, with durations ranging from 5 min to 3 hr.

Previous analysis of the same data indicated that motion during extended sleep scans is comparable to the motion observed in shorter resting-state scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Moehlman et al., 2019</xref>). We also found that motion is lower during deep sleep compared to wake, see <bold>Results</bold>. The EEG signal underwent correction for MRI gradient and cardio-ballistic artifacts and was subsequently down-sampled to a rate of 250 Hz using the Analyzer software (Brain Vision, Morrisville, USA).

To prepare the data for analysis, we first standardized the participant-specific sets of 300 ROI timecourses (scaled to a mean of 0, and a standard deviation of 1), which were then concatenated across all participants. This standardization was performed separately for each night. This resulted in a data matrix with dimensions of 300 × (12 ×~5500) for each night, with approximately 5500 repetition time (TR), excluding breaks between runs and censored TR, accounting for 8 hr of scan time based on a 3 s TR.</p><p>The HMM inference process sought to find a sequence of recurring discrete states, each characterized by a distinct statistical arrangement of data. We employed a Gaussian HMM using the Matlab toolbox HMM-MAR v1.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR">https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/HMM-MAR</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">OHBA-analysis, 2024</xref>), where each state was modeled as a multivariate normal distribution encompassing both first-order statistics (mean activity) and second-order statistics (covariance matrix). These state parameters were determined collectively at the group level, while the state timecourses were individually defined for each subject. As a result, the HMM identified periods of quasi-stationary activity, during which the 300 ROI timecourses displayed specific configurations of mean activity and FC.</p><p>Given the high spatial dimensionality of fMRI data, we employed principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of parameters in the decomposition process as a common practice.

The MATLAB function manova1 was employed to compute Wilk’s Λ, which provides insights into how effectively the K HMM state timecourses can be categorized according to sleep scoring (the lower the better), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>. There is a local minimum at K=21.</p><p>Taken together, we chose the model order K=21 as the number of HMM states. It should be noted that free energy is weighted most among those five model evaluation statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis and visualization of HMM transitions</title><p>The transition probability matrix, a fundamental element explicitly modeled by HMM, exhibited a discernible structure characterized by subnetworks of HMM states that displayed more frequent transitions among themselves than to states external to their respective subnetworks. Essentially, this transition matrix could be viewed as a directed graph marked by a modular organization. This characteristic was effectively demonstrated by applying the transition matrix (depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) to a modularity analysis. This modular analysis was performed using MATLAB functions sourced from the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/Home">https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/Home</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>), which relies on Newman’s spectral community detection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leicht and Newman, 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Visualizing mean fMRI activation maps and FC patterns of HMM states</title><p>The mean distributions and covariance matrices specific to each state were subsequently projected back onto the MNI space utilizing the mixing matrix derived from the PCA. We generated mean fMRI activation maps and FC patterns for every HMM state relative to the baseline averaged over all HMM states. For FC patterns, within- or between-network connectivities were calculated as the average Fisher-transformed functional connectivity between each pair of ROIs within or between networks. For visualization purposes, we grouped 300 ROIs into 14 networks based on the Seitzman Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seitzman et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, we assigned subcortical and cerebellar regions to the additional four Networks: Posterior hippocampus (pHIP, anterior hippocampus is included in MTL network), basal ganglia (BG), Thalamus (THAL), and Cerebellum (CB). Hence, a total of 18 networks were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Visualizing state timecourse of HMM states and its associations with PSG stages, PPG amplitude, and respiratory signals</title><p>Two example runs have been shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>. These two examples showed how the HMM state timecourse (top panel) contained fine-grained information compared to the traditional PSG-based sleep stages (second panel) and also associated with PPG (third panel) and respiratory signals (last panel).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All the data used in this study followed approved human subjects research protocols approved by the National Institutes of Health Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board (USA, Protocol Number 16-N-0031), and informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98739-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005127/versions/1.0.2">https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds005127/versions/1.0.2</ext-link>.

In other words, participants have lower head motion during sleep than during Wakefulness. We added this information to the Supplemental Results, copied below.</p><p>We performed standardized motion correction during preprocessing using AFNI regardless of the duration of the scans. We did not include motion parameters in the HMM model. Time frames with Excessive head motion (any of 6 head motion parameters exceeding 0.3 mm or degree) was censored.

It would be very helpful to the sleep field to see how EEG spectra of, say, different N2-related HMM states compare. Similarly, it is presently unclear whether anything noticeable happens within the EEG time course at the moment of an HMM class switch (particularly when the PSG stage remains stable). While the authors did look at slow wave density and various physiological signals in different HMM states, a characterization of the EEG itself in terms of spectral features is missing. Such analyses might have shown that fMRI-based brain states map onto familiar EEG substates, or reveal novel EEG changes that have so far gone unnoticed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this great suggestion. We performed EEG spectral analysis on each HMM state. Results were added to Suppementary Results and Supplementary Figure 10 and 11 (Copied below). Specifically, we confirmed that N3-related states had highest Delta power and that the Deep-N2 module showed different spectral profiles compared to Light-N2 module. Unfortuantely, we could not perform EEG analysis at the moment of an HMM class switch, given that there are too many different type of HMM switches (21*20/2).</p><p>In Supplemental Results: “We conducted spectral analysis for each TR and calculated the average power spectrum for each common EEG brainwave—Delta (0.5-4 Hz), Theta (4-8 Hz), Alpha (8-13 Hz), Beta (13-30 Hz), and Gamma (30-100 Hz)—across the 21 HMM states. See Supplementary Figure 10 and 11 for night 2 and night 1 data, respectively. As expected, we found that N3-related states 8 and 10 had highest Delta power in both nights. In addition, the Deep-N2 module had higher power in Theta and Alpha bands compared to the Light-N2 module.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear how the presently identified HMM brain states relate to the previously identified NREM and wake states by Stevner et al. (2019), who used a roughly similar approach. This is important, as similar brain states across studies would suggest reproducibility, whereas large discrepancies could indicate a large dependence on particular methods and/or the sample (also see later point regarding generalizability).</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question. There are some similarities and differences between the current study and Stevner et al. (2019). We discussed this in the Supplementary Discussion. Copied below.</p><p>In the Supplementary Discussion: “Both studies demonstrated that HMM states can be effectively divided into meaningful modules solely based on transition probabilities. Furthermore, both studies indicated that pre-sleep wakefulness differs from post-sleep wakefulness.</p><p>However, despite the similar approaches used, key differences in data acquisition and analysis make it challenging to directly compare HMM states between these two studies. Firstly, Stevner et al. (2019) collected only 1-hour-long sleep data from 18 participants, whereas our current study includes 8-hour-long sleep data from 12 participants for two consecutive nights. As discussed in the main text, full sleep cycling cannot be obtained from 1-hour long sleep due to the lack of REM stage and incomplete sleep cycles. Secondly, in Stevner et al. (2019) (Figure 4e), the four wake-NREM stages had roughly the same duration. In contrast, in our current study (Night 2, Figure 2A), the N2 stage comprises 43% of total sleep, which aligns with the natural N2 composition of nocturnal sleep stages. This discrepancy might explain the different number of N2-related states found in the two studies, with 3 out of 19 in Stevner et al. (2019) versus 13 out of 21 in our current study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More justice could be done to previous EEG-based efforts moving beyond conventional AASM-defined sleep/wake states. Various EEG studies performed data-driven clustering of brain states, typically indicating more than 5 traditional brain states (e.g., Koch et al. 2014, Christensen et al. 2019, Decat. et al 2022). Beyond that, countless subdivisions of classical sleep stages have been proposed (e.g., phasic/tonic REM, N2 with/without spindles, N3 with global/local slow waves, cyclic alternating patterns, and many more). While these aren't incorporated into standard sleep stage classification, the current manuscript could be misinterpreted to suggest that improved/data-driven classifications cannot be achieved from EEG, which is incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that previous EEG-based efforts should be mentioned. We now added this in the manuscript. Copied below.</p><p>In the Discussion section, “Third, we chose to not include EEG features in our data-driven model. However, the current method is not limited to fMRI data and can be applied to EEG data. Given that previous data-driven studies based on EEG data have suggested that there might be more than five traditional sleep stages <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?7LUXwL">(Christensen et al., 2019; Decat et al., 2022; Koch et al., 2014)</ext-link>, as well as subdivisions within these traditional sleep stages <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?vJNrPS">(Brandenberger et al., 2005; Decat et al., 2022; Simor et al., 2020)</ext-link>, future studies may apply data-driven models on both fMRI and EEG data. ”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More discussion of the limitations of the current sample and generalizability would be helpful. A sample of N=12 is no doubt impressive for two nights of concurrent whole-night EEG-fMRI. Still, any data-driven approach can only capture the brain states that are present in the sample, and 12 individuals are unlikely to express all brain states present in the population of young healthy individuals. Add to that all the potentially different or altered brain states that come with healthy ageing, other demographic variables, and numerous clinical disorders. How do the authors expect their results to change with larger samples and/or varying these factors? Perhaps most importantly, I think it's important to mention that the particular number of identified brain states (here 21, and e.g. 19 in Stevner) is not set in stone and will likely vary as a function of many sample- and methods-related factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the great suggestions. We now included these points when discussing limitations in the Discussion section. We think that a HMM model with larger sample size might produce more fine-grained results, but this remains to be investigated when a more extensive dataset becomes available.</p><p>In the Discussion section, “Secondly, while our study involved a relatively small number of participants (12), it included a large amount of fMRI data (~16 hours scan) per participant. Although the HMM trained on data from 12 participants was robust, the generalizability of the current results to different populations—such as healthy aging individuals and clinical populations—needs to be demonstrated in future studies, particularly with larger sample sizes and more diverse populations.”</p><p>“Fourth, while we selected 21 HMM brain sleep states based on model evaluation parameters in the current study, the exact number of sleep states is not fixed and likely depends on various sample- and methods-related factors, such as sample size and model setups.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
