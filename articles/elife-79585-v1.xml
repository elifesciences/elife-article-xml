The meniscus is an important component of the knee joint with essential roles in the load-bearing, shock absorption, nutrition, and lubrication of the knee joint articular cartilage and is very susceptible to injury and has a limited reparative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rai and McNulty, 2017</xref>). The meniscus degeneration is a slow-developing disease of middle-aged or older people. Horizontal cleavage of the meniscus usually happens in the disease, and the lesion can be identified through knee MRI. Patients typically have no clear history of acute knee injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beaufils et al., 2017</xref>). Meniscal degeneration is one important risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA) and joint dysfunction, causing huge social and economic burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Englund et al., 2012</xref>). It has been found through clinical observations that nearly half of patients with meniscal degeneration will eventually develop OA over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lohmander et al., 2007</xref>). Studies have shown that inflammatory responses and biomineralization affect the meniscus cellular microenvironment and contribute to disease occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldring and Goldring, 2016</xref>). However, the changes in the cell microenvironment in degenerated meniscus remain largely unclear. An adequate understanding of the changes in the degenerative meniscus is critical for preventing meniscal injury in young and middle-aged patients and for relieving symptoms in elderly patients with knee OA.</p><p>The meniscus can be anatomically divided into the inner region (the white–white zone) and the outer region (the red–red zone). Some researchers also use the ‘red–white’ zone to denote the in-between transition region. The inner and outer menisci differ in neurovascular distribution, structural composition, and recovery ability from injury. There are blood vessels and nerves in the outer area, while few blood vessels and nerves are observed in the inner part. The meniscal extracellular matrix (ECM) is the physical foundation of menisci’s biological roles, and alterations in the ECM may lead to meniscus degeneration and dysfunction. Collagens and proteoglycan (PG) are ECM’s two most important components. The outer meniscus is dominated by type I collagen, while the inner meniscus is dominated by type II collagen. The inner part of the meniscus has a relatively higher percentage of PGs compared with the outer. Aging and mechanical injuries may lead to meniscus degeneration. Different anatomical regions have varied recovery capabilities: the degeneration in the outer meniscus is more likely to heal, while the degeneration in the inner part tends to be irreversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Makris et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Danzig et al., 1983</xref>). The cellular and molecular basis behind anatomical regions remains to be explored. It is unclear what cell type contributes to the inner and outer variations and what cell types mediate the degeneration.</p><p>Building a detailed meniscal cell landscape is essential to understanding meniscus characteristics. Early profiling of meniscal cell heterogeneities dates back to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ghadially et al., 1983</xref>. They studied injured and uninjured human menisci with the electron microscope and stated that chondrocytes, a few fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and intermediate state cells between chondrocytes and fibroblast existed in menisci. Scotti et al. also discussed that the cells in the superficial zone were fusiform, while cells laid deeper were polygonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scotti et al., 2013</xref>). These classifications were mainly based on the shape and the surrounding matrix content. The recent development of single-cell omics has facilitated researchers’ understanding of various cell types across multiple cartilage tissues, including knee joint cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref>), intervertebral disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gan et al., 2021</xref>), meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), etc. These researches initiated a rudiment of the chondrocyte cell types and states, covering parts of the heterogeneous cell subpopulations in the meniscus. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref> sketched the outline of the meniscal cell populations following the cell type definition convention of a knee articular cartilage study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref>). They reported cartilage progenitor cells (CPC), regulatory chondrocytes (RegC), prehypertrophic chondrocytes (PreHTC), hypertrophic chondrocytes (HTC), fibrochondrocytes (FC), fibrochondrocytes progenitors (FCP), proliferating fibrochondrocytes (ProFC), degenerated progenitor (DegP), endothelial cells, and other immune cells in the meniscus, and showed links between meniscus progenitors and the progression of meniscal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We aimed to build a refined atlas complementary to the existing data by systematically revealing cell heterogeneities in inner and outer meniscal zones under different health states. We created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of 45,744 cells from 12 healthy/degenerated meniscus samples of 8 patients and provided an online cell browser at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meni.singlecell.info:3000/">http://meni.singlecell.info:3000/</ext-link> to support flexible explorations of the data. We performed multiple rounds of cell-level quality control steps to remove and adjust noisy data such as empty droplets, doublets, dissociation-affected cells, and ambient RNA-polluted cells. Among the current single-cell sequencing studies involving articular cartilage and meniscus, we have a larger number of sequencing samples and cells. Our dataset is the first single-cell sequencing study data characterizing menisci’s inner/outer zonation differences. We built a hierarchical cell type classification framework and identified five chondrocyte subtypes and two pericyte-like cell subtypes. Functional enrichment analyses suggested these subtypes may have specialized ECM construction and remodeling duties. We profiled various immune cell types and observed damage-induced inflammatory responses in degenerated samples. Taken together, we inferred a hypothetical model of ECM disassembly, inflammation, and angiogenesis in the meniscal tissues. The model may also fit degenerative situations in other cartilage tissues, such as articular cartilage and intervertebral disc, because they contain similar cell types and ECM contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017b</xref>). Our discoveries may suggest new clues for treating various types of joint degeneration in the human body.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Human meniscus cell sample preparation</title><p>Four degenerative meniscus specimens were obtained from patients with severe OA who underwent total knee arthroplasty, and four normal meniscus specimens were obtained from patients with bone tumors or severe trauma who underwent amputation. The meniscus tissues were removed from the patient’s knee joints and divided into the inner (white–white zone) and outer (red–red zone) areas. The degeneration group is comprised of patients A, B, C, and D; and the normal group is comprised of patients E, F, G, and H. Patients A, B, E, and F contributed paired inner–outer samples. Patients C and H contributed unpaired inner samples, and patients D and G contributed unpaired outer samples because the other pairs had obtained in the surgery had poor sample states. Detailed designs of experiments can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>After carefully dividing the meniscus tissue into the inner and outer parts, the menisci were cut into small pieces. We used 0.25% Trypsin (Gibco 25200072) to digest the pieces for 0.5 hr under 37℃. Next, we used 2 mg/ml collagenase IV to dissociate the pieces for 4–6 hr under 37℃ and finally obtained dissociated cells. The dissociated cells were resuspended at a concentration of 250–1200 cells/μl and with viability between 67–87% for microfluidics (Chromium Single-Cell Controller, 10× Genomics). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, cells were loaded into the chip and run using the Chromium Single Cell 3′ Reagent Kit v2 (10× Genomics). In brief, Gel beads with GemCode barcodes and primers and individual cells were encapsulated in oil droplets. Next, within each oil droplet, mRNA were released from lysed cells, barcoded, reverse transcribed to cDNA, and sequenced. Sequencing-ready single-cell transcriptome libraries were mapped to the human reference genome GRCh38-3.0.0 and quantified by CellRanger 3.1.0.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Multiplex immunofluorescence (OPAL) staining</title><p>Human meniscus normal and degenerated samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. We sliced the embedded paraffin samples in series, and each slice was 4 µm thick. Firstly, water-bath heating was used for antigen retrieval. Then various cell marker primary antibodies were incubated with the paraffin slide of meniscus tissue to conduct the continuous staining with the Opal Polaris Multiple-Color Manual IHC Kit (NEL861001KT). We used different primary antibodies to simultaneously label Ch.1 (SERPINA1), Ch.2 (MMP14), Ch.4 (CYP1B1), and PCL (ACTA2) on the same tissue slide. The automated staining system (BOND-RX, Leica Microsystems, Vista, CA) was used to perform the chromogen-based multiplex immunohistochemistry labeling. SERPINA1 (ab207303), MMP14 (ab51074), CYP1B1 (ab33586), and ACTA2 (ab5694) were all purchased from Abcam and diluted at a concentration of 1:100. The Opal Polaris dyes were used to pair with these antibodies containing fluorophores for tyramide signal amplification to enhance sensitivity. The sequence of labeling for detecting each marker was optimized: CYP1B1 (Opal 570), MMP14 (Opal 620), SERPINA1 (Opal 690), ACTA2 (Opal 780), and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). Including an autofluorescence section, the staining process is the same as above, but no primary antibody is added. Multiplex analysis was operated to analyze the results of simultaneously stained tissue slides. In addition, common immunofluorescence staining was performed using CDON (ab227056), CD31 (ab9498), and CD45 (ab40763) labeled Ch.3, endothelial cells, and immune cells. All experiments have three biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-cell data quality control steps</title><p>We adjusted the ambient RNA expression with SoupX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Young and Behjati, 2020</xref>) v1.2.1 and generated read counts free of background noises for all downstream analyses. We used scanpy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>) and Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>) to conduct the basic filtering out outliers cells with high n_genes metrics (the number of observed genes per cell), high n_counts metrics (the number of UMI per cell), and high percent_mito metrics (the mitochondrial gene fraction). Next, we assigned draft cell type identities to the cells using SingleR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2019</xref>). Note that the SingleR-generated cell type labels were only used to perform quality control analysis to avoid removing biologically meaningful cells with poor data qualities. We calculated doublet scores using DoubletFinder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McGinnis et al., 2019</xref>) removed the cells with high doublet scores and outlier clusters with high doublet scores. We observed that DoubletFinder tends to identify small clusters as doublets incorrectly, so we assert these small populations as singlets if they had well-defined identities given by SingleR or appear clear biological functions such as cell cycles. To remove the confounding factor introduced by the dissociation-induced gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denisenko et al., 2020</xref>), we decided to remove the heavily affected cells by the dissociation steps. We calculated dissociation scores using methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van den Brink et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>Raw single-cell RNA-seq datasets contain numerous low-quality droplets. Hence, we should ensure the majority of the data items we analyzed correspond to viable cells. It is known that one simple quality control filtering on the aforementioned metrics (n_genes, n_counts, percent_mt) can't remove all of them. We then conducted comprehensive quality control steps that can be summarized as (1) top-down refinements and (2) divide and conquer. First, we divide cells into several rough populations with distinct biological identities, for example, chondrocytes, immune cells, endothelial cells, etc. We zoomed into these populations one by one and performed subclustering within them. The within-population subclustering often works like a centrifuge – the low-quality cells mixed in the large rough population usually form tiny outlier groups when subclustering is performed on a single population. When a tiny group is mainly comprised of cells with high doublet scores, cells with high mitochondrial gene fractions, cells with high dissociation scores, we consider removing it. After manually inspecting and dropping these tiny outlier groups, we finally get much cleaner datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Single-cell data clustering steps</title><p>To eliminate the genetic background variations and technical noises of the single-cell RNA-seq data, we used Harmony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>) to perform integrative clustering across different samples. Major clusters corresponded to chondral cells, ACTA2<sup>+</sup> cells, endothelial cells, and immune cells were identified across samples and validated with cluster correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To understand large cell populations with higher resolutions, we subset the chondral and <italic>ACTA2</italic><sup>+</sup> majors clusters, performed reclustering on harmony-derived embeddings, and obtained multiple fine clusters. To alleviate the scRNA-seq data noise and promote data consistency across samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hua and Zhang, 2019</xref>), we partitioned original cell data points into homogenous meta-cells with MetaCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baran et al., 2019</xref>). We then used HGC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zou et al., 2021</xref>) to build hierarchical relationships based on the meta-cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Differentially expressed genes analysis</title><p>Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by the ‘FindMarkers’ function and the ‘FindAllMarkers’ function provided by the Seurat package.

The health group (degeneration/normal) markers were calculated in an overall comparison way and a per-cluster comparison way.

The workflow includes three substeps: identifying coexpression modules, trimming modules with prior knowledge, and calculating activating scores.</p><p>The workflow builds coexpression modules by choosing TFs that predict target gene expression well. First, the algorithm builds gradient boosting machine models predicting each target gene’s expression from TF expressions and keeps the models’ feature weights as a measure of TF–target regulatory scores. Second, the algorithm creates modules by adding/filtering weighted links between TFs and their targets. To reduce the stochasticity of the results, the algorithm independently uses six weight filtering rules to build modules. The six rules are: (1) keep TF–target pairs with weights &gt; the 75% percentile of the weights; (2) keep TF–target pairs with weights &gt; the 90% percentile of the weights; (3) for each TF, keep the top 50 TF–target pairs with the highest weights; (4) for each target, keep top 5 TF–target pairs with highest weights; (5) for each target, keep top 10 TF–target pairs with highest weights; (6) for each target, keep top 50 TF–target pairs with highest weights. After this step, many TF–target modules are created. The algorithm only keeps TF–target links that have positive regulation relationships (the Pearson correlation of TF and target expressions &gt;0.03) and drops modules with &lt;20 genes inside (TF itself included). Finally, we get a list of primary coexpression modules, each containing a TF and its positively regulated targets.</p><p>The module trimming process combines the regulatory motif information with the coexpression analyses. Given the coexpression-derived modules, we then keep target genes that are overlapped with TF’s regulatory motif region. We adopt the 10 kb up-/downstream regions of a target gene’s TSS as the gene’s distal enhancer occurrence region and the 500 bp upstream/100 bp downstream region as the gene’s proximal promoter occurrence region. After trimming, more reliable sets of modules are generated.</p><p>Finally, we quantified and binarized the activation levels of the TF–target modules with AUCell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aibar et al., 2017</xref>) and visualized them with ComplexHeatmap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gu et al., 2016</xref>) and cytoscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cell crosstalk analysis</title><p>Given the averaged normalized expression value of a ligand gene in a sender cluster <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , and that of a receptor gene in receiver cluster <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> , we defined the crosstalk between cluster <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and cluster <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> via the ligand–receptor pair L–R is their product <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> .

This cluster’s percentage decreased in the degeneration group. The gene set activation analysis indicated that this population of cells had anti-angiogenesis effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

Hence, it is hard to judge whether Ch.5 is a high-stemness chondrocyte progenitor cluster or a dividing differentiated cell cluster based on these highly expressed markers. We may assume that the cells, though in a proliferation state, retained some transcripts before mitosis, and we may infer their origins or fates via the reference mapping analysis. We re-assigned Ch.5 cell identities using cells in Ch.1–Ch.4 clusters as a reference with SingleR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2019</xref>) and found 98.63% Ch.5 cells were mapped to Ch.2 and the rest were mapped to Ch.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7F</xref>). This identity mapping suggested the proliferative Ch.5 could be the origin of the Ch.2 cells increased in the degenerated group.</p><p>We did not directly adopt the chondrocyte terminology used in other studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ji et al., 2019</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sun et al., 2020</xref>, but instead used Ch.1–Ch.5 to represent the subclusters because our data spans chondrocytes of higher quantity and greater heterogeneity.

The enrichment analysis interpreting the potential functions of these DEGs is available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B, C</xref>. We believe the overall expression differences are mainly contributed by the cell type compositional changes because these genes are identified as markers of the chondrocyte subpopulations. For example, the expressions of Ch.2 marker genes <italic>COL1A1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>, <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>COL6A1</italic>, and <italic>SPARC</italic> are higher in the degenerated group; and Ch.3 markers <italic>AMTN</italic> and <italic>CILP</italic> also have higher expressions in the degenerated group; whereas PCL cell markers <italic>ACTA2</italic>, <italic>TAGLN</italic>, <italic>BCAM</italic>, and <italic>MCAM</italic> are highly expressed in the normal group. All these expression differences are consistent with our compositional observations that Ch.2 and Ch.3 increased in degeneration and Ch.1 and PCL decreased in degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6A</xref>). Besides overall differences, we also calculated the DEGs in each cluster between the degenerated and normal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6B</xref>) and found more subtle expressional shifts in the degeneration states. Considering all factors above, it appears that the overall expressional changes after degeneration could be explained by the increase of Ch.2 and Ch.3 as well as the decrease of PCL cells.</p><p>To explore each subcluster’s biofunction in degeneration, we performed GSVA analyses of each population in two conditions. We first analyzed the GSVA scores of ECM-related gene ontology terms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and found Ch.2 could have high ECM disassembly scores while Ch.3 could negatively regulate the disassembly regardless of the degeneration states. They could play essential roles in the anabolic/catabolic balance. Ch.2 and Ch.3 also got high scores in leukocyte chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), and chondrocyte hypertrophy-associated terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>); while in contrast, Ch.1 had relatively lower scores on these terms. This is consistent with the fact that Ch.1 cells dominate the normal meniscus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), and leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis mainly happen in the degenerated meniscus. Ch.5 got high scores on the cell-cycle-related terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). PCL cells got higher pro-angiogenesis scores in degenerated samples than in normal samples. The GSVA analyses indicated the increased or decreased subclusters in degenerated samples had pro- or anti-degeneration functions and further supported that the compositional changes of subclusters primarily contributed to the degeneration process.</p><p>It is acknowledged that the inner and outer zones have varied recovery abilities, ECM compositions, cellular compositions, and mechanical characteristics. But it is still unknown which zone is the primary contributor to joint inflammation in OA. We analyzed the zonation-dependent cellular state shift and computationally evaluated inflammation response scores in two regions. From the cell density plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7A, B</xref>, we found that the inner zone chondrocytes shift from the Ch.1 positions to the Ch.3 positions, while the outer zone chondrocytes shift to Ch.2 and Ch.4 positions. Both zones have cell state shifts after degeneration. We compared the cell densities instead of directly comparing the subpopulation percentages. Since the molecular profiles of subclusters vary on a continuum and the clustering boundaries could be vague, directly comparing the percentages with paired/unpaired statistical tests could miss the state shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7C, D</xref>). Compared to Ch.3, the Ch.2 cells have higher scores on the responses to inflammation cytokines TNF and IL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We also evaluated the GSVA scores of three inflammation gene sets on the chondrocytes and found the outer-degenerated groups consistently got significantly higher inflammation scores than the outer-normal group. In contrast, the inner zone cells did not have this trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7E</xref>).

These endothelial cells comprise the microvascular and capillary vessels. A tiny cluster of lymphatic endothelial cells was also observed, which may come from the lymphatic vessels in the meniscus.

These molecules contributed to the blood vessel’s stability in the normal group.</p><p>With all major classes of meniscal cells being identified, we inferred the cell–cell interactions (CCIs) based on the ligand and receptor expressions and compared the interaction intensities between the normal/degenerated samples. The results suggested that CCI intensities generally increased in the degeneration group, especially for the endothelial cells and immune cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). These enhanced CCIs are also consistent with the angiogenesis and leukocyte recruitment phenomena in the degeneration group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref> shows some instances of the significant CCIs originating from the sender cell type to the receiver cell type. For example, in the degenerated meniscus, we observed that a chemokine gene <italic>CXCL8</italic> was upregulated by macrophages/monocytes, neutrophils, DCs; and its receptor gene <italic>SDC2</italic> was expressed in chondrocytes and the pericyte-like cells. We also observed significant <italic>CALM1/2-INSR</italic> CCIs occurred in the degeneration in which angiogenesis happened – many cell types upregulated <italic>CALM1/2</italic>, and endothelial cells upregulated the insulin receptor gene <italic>INSR</italic>.

We did not examine these computational inferences with experiments.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>A schematic diagram of the microenvironment changes between the normal and the degenerated meniscus.</title><p>The left side visualizes the homeostasis meniscus, where Ch.1 is the dominant chondrocyte population. In this situation, the extracellular matrix (ECM) decomposition and synthesis reach a dynamic equilibrium, and the aberrant proliferation of blood vessels is inhibited. The right side visualizes the degenerated meniscus, where the orchestrated microenvironment balance is broken. The pericyte-like cells detach from the blood vessels and lower the stability of the blood vessels. The endothelial cells grew and formed new blood vessels in the degenerated area. The vascular permeability increased and allowed more immune cells to infiltrate the degenerated tissue. Ch.2 and Ch.3 increased in quantity and produced more matrix disassembly enzymes, damaging the ECM, releasing angiogenesis factors, and recruiting more immune cells. The immune cells, such as macrophage/monocytes, DCs, and T cells, also have chemotaxis functions. There are also cycling chondrocytes and nerve tissue cells in the meniscus.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79585-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Based on the above observations, we inferred that the immune cells and endothelial cells could be important regulators for chondrocytes and ECMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It has been known that the degenerated ECM released damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that initiated inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martel-Pelletier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2017a</xref>). According to our inference, immune cells could sense the DAMP signals, migrate to the inflammatory meniscus and produce cytokines and chemokines. The inflammation could in turn enhance ECM catabolic enzymes like <italic>MMP</italic>/<italic>ADAM</italic>/<italic>ADAMTS</italic>, stimulate blood vessel proliferation, and further promote immune infiltration in the meniscal tissue. These factors work in a manner like a ‘positive feedback loop’. In common conditions, the DAMP-induced inflammation will reverse when the DAMP molecules are cleared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zindel and Kubes, 2020</xref>). However, if the above factors work in the positive feedback loop in some perturbed conditions, they can mutually promote each other and drive the microenvironment away from homeostasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent single-cell studies have shown the importance of meniscal progenitors in tissue engineering and given a rough picture of the meniscal cell types. However, the existing data were still insufficient to reveal degeneration participants in the microenvironment. In this work, we investigated meniscal chondrocytes, developed a hierarchical classification system, and classified the cells into five major populations (Ch.1–Ch.5). We identified endothelial cells enriched in both outer meniscal parts and inner parts, which are typically conceived as avascular ‘white–white zone’. We inferred that these unanticipated cells were the degeneration product because newly generated vascular endothelial cells usually occur in cartilage as OA progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldring and Goldring, 2016</xref>). Surrounding the microvessels are the pericyte-like cells possessing muscle contraction features. We also observed Schwann cells, which typically wrap around the neurons, indicating there are nerve tissues in the human meniscus. For the immune cells, we observed monocytes/macrophages, DCs, T cells, neutrophils, mast cells, and some cycling immune cells.</p><p>The meniscal microenvironment changes significantly from the homeostasis when the degeneration progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In normal meniscal tissues, the synthesis and disassembly of the matrix molecules were balanced in the orchestrated ECM metabolism. We inferred that the dominant Ch.1 population was essential to the balance maintenance because they expressed TIMP family molecules that inhibited the ECM decomposers (MMP/ADAM/ADAMTS). The PCL population that adhered to the surface of endothelial cells maintained vasculature stability. The high-level expressions of atypical chemokine receptors like <italic>ACKR1</italic> neutralized the chemokines and attenuated the angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xu et al., 2007</xref>). The patrolling immune cells mainly pass by the tissue in the blood vessel without residing or being attracted.</p><p>However, the balanced microenvironment was altered significantly in the degenerated meniscal tissues. The expression of ECM decomposers (MMP/ADAM/ADAMTS family molecules) from chondral subpopulations Ch.2 and Ch.3 might surpass the inhibition forces (TIMP) and decompose the ECM by breaking large PG molecules into fragments. We believe the blood vessels have two sides in the homeostasis of the meniscus. On the one hand, the blood vessels can help to restore acute injuries to health; on the other hand, the proliferated blood vessels can build pathways for the immune cells so that they can infiltrate the meniscal matrix and cause inflammation. We observed multiple synergistic factors promoting angiogenesis and increased endothelial percentages in the degenerated samples. While the pericyte stabilizes the blood vessel in health, the detachment and decrease of the pericyte may lead to pathological states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Figueiredo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diéguez-Hurtado et al., 2019</xref>). On the vascular wall, the endothelial cells could downregulate ACKR1 expressions, respond to the pro-angiogenesis factors like VEGFA, FGF, IGF1, TGFβ produced by the Ch.2, Ch.3 Ch.4, grew new branches, increased the vascular permeability. Changing the chondrocyte subtype ratios and limiting blood vessel proliferation may delay or reverse the meniscus degeneration.</p><p>In addition to these findings from the analyses of the meniscal single-cell sequencing data, we have also made an interactive website to store and let readers to browse the processed data. Readers can directly access the website through the link <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://meni.singlecell.info:3000/">http://meni.singlecell.info:3000/</ext-link>, and perform online analyses of the results, comparison of differential genes between two special clusters, or data downloading.</p><p>In the design of this study, we only partitioned samples into two health states: normal and degenerated. If we distinguish the disease severity of the meniscus samples, we could establish more fine-grained links between the molecular profiles and the disease. Another limitation of this study is that females make up the majority of our donors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), since OA is more common in middle-aged and older females. The cellular profiles observed in this study may better represent the female population. We observed a small number of nerve tissue cells, which also hindered detailed analysis of them. Our functional coordination of chondrocyte subtypes was confined to the meniscus environment, even though there were signs that chondrocytes across different cartilage tissues were not distinct and had many common features. We hope a future molecular coordination framework could integrate chondrocytes across multiple cartilage tissues, different health states, anatomical regions, and differentiation stages, guiding the precise taxonomy of chondrocytes when more single-cell cartilage studies are released.</p><p>In conclusion, we systematically profiled the cellular diversities in the inner and outer meniscus and reported the microenvironmental alterations in the healthy and degenerated states. Our study is an informative complement to the existing meniscal single-cell sequencing data and provides an important reference for the study of meniscal degeneration. The study suggested that we should pay attention to the blood vessel’s functional duality in acute and chronic inflammation. Preserving the pericyte-like cells wrapping around the vessels might be a potential strategy to alleviate chronic degeneration. Systematically coordinating of angiogenesis, inflammation response, ECM catabolism, and preventing their mutual reinforcement could be a strategy for delaying or reversing meniscus degeneration. The meniscus is an important and representative fibrocartilage in the human body. We speculated that the cellular and molecular mechanisms observed in this study on meniscal degeneration, such as angiogenesis and inflammation, could also apply to intervertebral discs and articular cartilage degeneration. It could shed new light on the diagnosis and treatment of other degeneration-associated musculoskeletal diseases like low back pain and joint pain.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Software, Visualization, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The experiments were approved by Ethics Committee on Biomedical Research, West China Hospital of Sichuan University with an identifier of No. 2020-921.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chia-Lung Wu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There are many definitive statements about inferred results. The authors jump to too many mechanistic conclusions only based cell profiling. For example, &quot;The functional analysis identified subtypes that contributed to the angiogenesis/anti-angiogenesis process, and subtypes that contributed to the ECM construction/disassembly process.&quot; The result is not the issue, but rather the way it is worded. The authors have not directly tested that these subtypes contributed to the ECM construction, rather this work can only suggest that this subtype of cells contributed to ECM construction by the genes observed to be expressed. This is a very descriptive paper and the authors must consistently and carefully revise this paper to reflect that it is being published as resource paper, not a research paper with definitive conclusions. Many claims in the paper are not backed up by data.</p><p>2. Page 5, This is a resource paper. Therefore, the authors must tone down the statements for Sun et al.' study. Indeed. The current work may still be co-founded by limited sample size. Eight patients is still a small sample size compared to a true clinical study or even other scRNA-seq studies such as in the field of rheumatoid arthritis. It is suggested that the authors emphasize the strengths of their data (i.e., inner and outer zone) sequencing and mention this present study is actually a complementary work to Sun et al.'s work.</p><p>3. Another example is &quot;2.7. Endothelial cells, immune cells and chondrocytes form a positive feedback loop of degeneration&quot; Given the data available this was not tested. A feedback loop might be inferable, but it was not proven.</p><p>4. The same issues apply to the cell-cell interaction analysis. These results are inferred from gene expression, but active interaction with a measured response from that reaction was not actively examined. In total, the authors need to carefully reword this paper to avoid implying experiments that just were not done.</p><p>5. Please note that the figures and supplemental figures are not introduced/explained in order in the current format. This makes the manuscript very challenging to read as the readers need to come back and forth to find the figures that the authors are discussing by flipping through several pages. Please consider reordering the figures or making a better flow of the manuscript.</p><p>6. The major novelty and strength of this work is that the samples were collected and sequenced from inner and outer zone of the human meniscus, respectively. As the authors indicated that different zonal areas of a meniscus have varied recovery capabilities in response to injury. However, it remains unknown whether inner or outer zone of a meniscus is the primary contributor for joint inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). I believe that the authors should take advantage of their current datasets and provide insights into this unanswered question. For example, if chondrocyte 2 (Ch2) and PRG4-enriched Ch3 chondrocyte populations are main population observed in degenerated meniscus as the authors stated, in what zones of a meniscus of these cells were detected? And it might provide further impact in the field if the authors could elaborate on the possible mechanisms leading to the increased Ch2 and Ch3 in the degenerated meniscus (i.e., are Ch2 and Ch3 induced into proliferating status or other chondrocyte population differentiate into Ch2/Ch3 due to inflammation?)</p><p>7. In the current analysis, 4 major seq data were integrated together: inner and outer zone seq data as well as normal and degenerated meniscus seq data. This integration was also mostly used for interpretation. Although this approach helped identify conserved subset populations (in particular chondrocytes) across inner and outer zone, it may also overlook rare or small populations that exist only in a given zonal area. It appeared that in Figure 1C-G were the integration from normal and diseased tissues for inner and outer zone seq data, respectively. Have the authors re-clustered ACTA2+ cells in the inner and outer part separately and see if they can identify DegP markers and possible topological connection between FCP and DegP?

The authors attempted to compare their cell population with the ones identified by Sun et al. (Supplemental figure S9-S11). The figure resolution is too low, particular for Supplemental figure S9C. Furthermore, using hierarchical clustering and heatmaps with complete transcriptome of each cell population from both studies should be a better way to perform a comprehensive comparison rather than only rely on a few markers. Such a comparison is essential to link two studies together.</p><p>10. In the introduction, the authors mentioned &quot;The cellular and molecular changes during meniscal degeneration we observed may also be the mechanism of a variety of other cartilage degenerations.&quot; sine meniscus composes mainly fibrochondrocytes while articular cartilage is a hyaline cartilage.

There are many definitive statements about inferred results. The authors jump to too many mechanistic conclusions only based cell profiling. For example, &quot;The functional analysis identified subtypes that contributed to the angiogenesis/anti-angiogenesis process, and subtypes that contributed to the ECM construction/disassembly process.&quot; The result is not the issue, but rather the way it is worded. The authors have not directly tested that these subtypes contributed to the ECM construction, rather this work can only suggest that this subtype of cells contributed to ECM construction by the genes observed to be expressed. This is a very descriptive paper and the authors must consistently and carefully revise this paper to reflect that it is being published as resource paper, not a research paper with definitive conclusions. Many claims in the paper are not backed up by data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments and suggestions.

Page 5, This is a resource paper. Therefore, the authors must tone down the statements for Sun et al.' study. Indeed. The current work may still be co-founded by limited sample size. Eight patients is still a small sample size compared to a true clinical study or even other scRNA-seq studies such as in the field of rheumatoid arthritis. It is suggested that the authors emphasize the strengths of their data (i.e., inner and outer zone) sequencing and mention this present study is actually a complementary work to Sun et al.'s work.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions.

The major novelty and strength of this work is that the samples were collected and sequenced from inner and outer zone of the human meniscus, respectively. As the authors indicated that different zonal areas of a meniscus have varied recovery capabilities in response to injury. However, it remains unknown whether inner or outer zone of a meniscus is the primary contributor for joint inflammation in osteoarthritis (OA). I believe that the authors should take advantage of their current datasets and provide insights into this unanswered question. For example, if chondrocyte 2 (Ch2) and PRG4-enriched Ch3 chondrocyte populations are main population observed in degenerated meniscus as the authors stated, in what zones of a meniscus of these cells were detected? And it might provide further impact in the field if the authors could elaborate on the possible mechanisms leading to the increased Ch2 and Ch3 in the degenerated meniscus (i.e., are Ch2 and Ch3 induced into proliferating status or other chondrocyte population differentiate into Ch2/Ch3 due to inflammation?)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your great questions. We are also curious to these inner/outer difference questions. We performed some new experiments and inferred outer menisci could contributed more to the joint inflammation in osteoarthritis. We also found that the proliferative population Ch.5 could mainly differentiate into Ch.2 according to our mapping analysis.</p><p>We added texts discussing the zonation differences and primary contributor of inflammation at the end of section 2.5, and added texts discussing Ch.5 might give rise to Ch.2 in section 2.4 Ch.5 descriptions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

It's true that over-integration often overlooks rare or small populations. We have now re-clustered the ACTA2+ cells and the chondrocytes in the inner/outer part separately as well as in the normal/degeneration states separately. We did find rare populations after re-clustering of the subset but the rare populations could be doublets arisen from technical noise rather than true biological signal. We did not find significant DegP marker expressions either.</p><p>We performed a series of integration experiments to check the over-integration issues and to find the identities of the new clusters. Since integration strength issues is out of the scope of our paper and numerous new figures were generated, we did not include these figures into our supplementary materials. We have put the figures at FigShare 10.6084/m9.figshare.21432552 (https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Single-cell_analysis_reveals_cell_heterogeneity_and_microenvironment_alterations_in_human_meniscal_degeneration/21432552) so that you can check the details if necessary.</p><p>We also changed the Figure legends of Figure 1C-F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Such a comparison is essential to link two studies together.</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. The original supplemental figure S9-S11 contains many scatter plots, each of which contains ~45k data points. Hence the file volumes of the vector graphs were so large that we had to rasterized and squeezed them to fulfill the uploading system requirements. We have now switched to a better way to present expressional values on these dense overlaying points – kernel density estimation plots of the expressions provided by R package Nebulosa (Alquicira-Hernandez and Powell, <italic>Bioinformatics</italic>, 2021, doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab003">10.1093/bioinformatics/btab003</ext-link>). The new plots present smoothed expressions that can better characterize the distribution of the values without point-crowding flaws. We updated the feature plots in the original Supplemental Figure S9 and placed them in the new &quot;Figure 2 —figure supplement 4&quot;, then updated the original S10, S11 plots and placed them in the new &quot;Figure 3 —figure supplement 2&quot;.</p><p>As for the comparisons between our data and the public data, we have now performed a comprehensive integration provided by Seurat algorithm (Stuart, Butler, Hoffman, et al. <italic>Cell</italic>, 2019. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2019.05.031).

The rows in the heatmap are top differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in each group. These DEGs captured the major source of transcriptional variations well and reveals the distinct boundaries of clusters. We did not show all the DEGs (and they have been listed in Supplementary File 2 now) for two reasons: (1) Some DEGs have very high or specific expressions in a group or have been reported in earlier literatures; (2) The space of the figure did not allow for all rows annotated with gene symbols.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13.
