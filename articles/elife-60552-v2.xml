(GIRK) channels are regulated by G proteins and PIP<sub>2</sub>. Here, using cryo-EM single particle analysis we describe the equilibrium ensemble of structures of neuronal GIRK2 as a function of the C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. We find that PIP<sub>2</sub> shifts the equilibrium between two distinguishable structures of neuronal GIRK (GIRK2), extended and docked, towards the docked form. In the docked form the cytoplasmic domain, to which G<sub>βγ</sub> binds, becomes accessible to the cytoplasmic membrane surface where G<sub>βγ</sub> resides. Furthermore, PIP<sub>2</sub> binding reshapes the G<sub>βγ</sub> binding surface on the cytoplasmic domain, preparing it to receive G<sub>βγ</sub>. We find that cardiac GIRK (GIRK1/4) can also exist in both extended and docked conformations. These findings lead us to conclude that PIP<sub>2</sub> influences GIRK channels in a structurally similar manner to Kir2.2 channels. In Kir2.2 channels, the PIP<sub>2</sub>-induced conformational changes open the pore. In GIRK channels, they prepare the channel for activation by G<sub>βγ</sub>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PIP2</kwd><kwd>cryoEM</kwd><kwd>Kir channels</kwd><kwd>GIRK</kwd><kwd>G protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The structural role of PIP2 in opening the G-protein-gated K<sup>+</sup> channel is revealed.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (Kir) channels were originally named for their rectifying current-voltage relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hagiwara et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hagiwara and Takahashi, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hodgkin and Horowicz, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Noble, 1965</xref>). Today, this class of ion channels is defined by characteristic structural features encoded by the Kir family of related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>). All Kir channels are tetramers of identical or related subunits that encode a K<sup>+</sup> selectivity filter-containing transmembrane pore (TMD for transmembrane domain) and a cytoplasmic domain (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). The TMD and CTD are covalently linked by a tether, called here the TMD-CTD linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, Kir channels underlie many physiological processes, including neuronal electrical activity, electrolyte homeostasis in the kidney, insulin secretion, and heart rate control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To fulfill their many biological roles, different eukaryotic Kir channels respond to unique ligands. However, as far as we know, they all respond to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hibino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hilgemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stanfield et al., 2002</xref>). In fact, the two features all eukaryotic Kir channels have in common are K<sup>+</sup> selectivity and responsiveness to PIP<sub>2</sub>. A specific mechanism for PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation of Kir2.2 has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>). As depicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> the CTD is disengaged from the TMD, resulting in an ‘extended’ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>). Upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding, the TMD-CTD loop forms a helix and the CTD engages the TMD to form a ‘docked’ conformation in which the channel opens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GIRK2 adopts an extended conformation in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Conformational changes upon PIP<sub>2</sub> binding in the Kir2.2 channel viewed from side with the extracellular side above (Left: the extended conformation without PIP<sub>2</sub>, PDB: 3JYC.

Crystal structures of GIRK2 in the absence and presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (and in the presence of G<sub>βγ</sub>) did not show a change in the relationship between the CTD and TMD as was seen in Kir2.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). In this manuscript, we study the structural effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> on neuronal GIRK2 and cardiac GIRK1/4 using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and correlate these effects with known properties of PIP<sub>2</sub> activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GIRK2 adopts an extended conformation in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub></title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> shows the structure of the mouse GIRK2 channel in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (CryoEM<sup>Apo</sup>) at a resolution of 3.9 Å by cryo-EM single particle analysis. The corresponding cryo-EM map is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>. In the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> it is clear that GIRK2 can adopt a conformation in which the CTD is disengaged from the TMD and the TMD-CTD linker has to be extended to account for the separation between the TMD and CTD. Thus, in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub>, the global conformation of GIRK2 appears much like the Kir2.2 channel in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (i.e. both channels adopt an extended conformation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Using X-ray crystallography, we had determined a structure of GIRK2 in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (Crystal<sup>Apo</sup>) that did not adopt this extended conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). Detailed differences in the structures of CryoEM<sup>Apo</sup> and Crystal<sup>Apo</sup> are shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). The crystal lattice offers a possible explanation for conformational differences between CryoEM<sup>Apo</sup> and Crystal<sup>Apo</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Symmetry-related tetramers in the crystal contact each other through ~500 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area on the CTD (PISA server) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>), as shown in the inset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>. Because in the extended conformation the CTD and TMD are free to move with respect to each other without hindrance, these two structured regions may have been pushed together when the crystal was formed. Single particle cryo-EM, without the potential interference of lattice contacts, might provide a structure that more accurately portrays a GIRK2 channel in the cell membrane.</p><p>GIRK2 and Kir2.2 are structurally similar channels, but differ functionally in an important aspect. PIP<sub>2</sub> is necessary and sufficient to open Kir2.2, but must operate in conjunction with G<sub>βγ</sub> to open GIRK2. This important distinction notwithstanding, the difference between Crystal<sup>Apo</sup> and CryoEM<sup>Apo</sup> conformations leads us to ask which conformation better reflects reality in the membrane? To pursue this question further, we used cryo-EM single particle analysis to study the dependence of the GIRK2 conformation as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>GIRK2 conformation as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration</title><p>GIRK2 channels were vitrified in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (soluble C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>) concentrations ranging from 0 mM to 1.0 mM.

Images from all concentrations were merged into a single 'titration dataset' and 3D refinement was carried out in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Particles were then classified (five classes requested) without refinement of angles or translations. Four classes (1-4) were similar to each other and showed a disengaged CTD (i.e. extended conformation) with an unresolved TMD-CTD linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Class 5 showed an engaged CTD (i.e. CTD-docked conformation) and a visible TMD-CTD linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the fraction of channels contributing to the docked class at each PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration remained fairly constant for the five independent runs, indicating that the classification algorithm yields a reproducible outcome. In addition, of all the channels classified as docked, more than 80% were classified as such four or five times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data indicate that the population of channels in the docked conformation is positively correlated with the concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> shows that the fraction of docked channels increased from approximately 0.08 to 0.30 when PIP<sub>2</sub> is increased from 0 mM to 1.0 mM. We previously showed that the activity of GIRK2 channels in membranes increases as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration with an activation constant ~15 μM (and Hill coefficient ~3.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The large difference in PIP<sub>2</sub> activity between these studies likely originates in the difference between the detergent micelle and the lipid membrane environment. PIP<sub>2</sub> partitions into membranes (differently than into detergent micelles) and therefore the local concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub> are unknown.</p><p>It is also notable that a fraction (~0.08) of docked channels exists in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In functional studies in membranes we found that the open fraction of GIRK2 channels in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (but in the presence of G<sub>βγ</sub>) is probably less than 0.01 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Again, there is an uncertainty that precludes direct comparison of these numbers: we do not know what fraction of docked channels are open. In other words, docking may be a necessary but not necessarily a sufficient condition to open the pore.</p><p>We found previously that the presence of 32 mM Na<sup>+</sup> substantially increases the open probability of GIRK2 at all concentrations of PIP<sub>2</sub> examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The experiments behind <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> were carried out in the absence of added Na<sup>+</sup>.

The βL-βM loop does not make direct contact with the PIP<sub>2</sub> binding site but apparently is allosterically coupled to it. The possible importance of the βL-βM loop conformational change is implied through superposition of CryoEM<sup>Apo</sup> CTD and CryoEM<sup>PIP2</sup> CTD with the CTD from the crystal structure of GIRK2 in complex with G<sub>βγ</sub> (Crystal<sup>GIRK-Gβγ</sup>). The βL-βM loop is located on the surface to which G<sub>βγ</sub> binds. In CryoEM<sup>PIP2</sup>, the βL-βM loop adopts the position observed in the G<sub>βγ</sub> complex. Thus, it would appear that PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to GIRK2 pre-configures the G<sub>βγ</sub> binding surface on the CTD into a receptive conformation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main conclusion of this study is that GIRK channels – GIRK2 as well as GIRK1/4 – can adopt extended and docked conformations. With GIRK2 we show that the docked conformation is favored in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>. We think that crystal contacts in the previous Crystal<sup>Apo</sup> structure pushed the CTD and TMD into close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). It seems likely that PIP<sub>2</sub> in GIRK channels, as previously proposed for Kir2.2 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tao et al., 2009</xref>), mediates the docking of the CTD onto the TMD. Electrostatic interactions between the anionic headgroup of PIP<sub>2</sub> and cationic amino acid sidechains on the channel serve to tether the CTD to the TMD. Many of these electrostatic interactions are conserved in GIRK and Kir2.2. A secondary conformational change occurs on the side of the CTD corresponding to the G<sub>βγ</sub> binding surface. This change configures the surface ready to bind G<sub>βγ</sub>.</p><p>These effects of PIP<sub>2</sub> on GIRK2 are summarized in a cartoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). By tethering the CTD to the TMD, PIP<sub>2</sub> brings the CTD close to the membrane surface where it can be reached by G<sub>βγ</sub>, which is held at the membrane surface by its covalent attachment to a lipid tail. Coincidentally, the binding surface for G<sub>βγ</sub> on the CTD adopts a permissive conformation, allowing G<sub>βγ</sub> to bind. This proposed mechanism is consistent with the demonstration that G<sub>βγ</sub> is unable to open GIRK2 in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>): without PIP<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>βγ</sub> is unable to access its binding site on GIRK2.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>PIP<sub>2</sub> serves as an allosteric regulator to permit G<sub>βγ</sub> binding.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) A cartoon depiction of PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation of GIRK channels.

GIRK channels have two gates along their ion conduction pore: an inner helix gate in the TMD and a G-loop gate at the apex of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jiang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nishida et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pegan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). In the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub>, the inner helix gate of GIRK2 is most tightly constricted at position Phe192 in the inner helix, which lines the pore on the intracellular side of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> binding and docking of the CTD onto the TMD is associated with a modest change in the conformation of the inner helix, a repositioning of the sidechain of Phe192, and widening of the pore. The G-loop gate actually constricts when the CTD docks onto the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and E</xref>). Thus, it would appear that when four PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules bind to GIRK2, the inner helix gate opens, or begins to open, but the pore remains closed owing to a constricted G-loop gate. This interpretation is consistent with functional data showing that PIP<sub>2</sub> is unable to open GIRK2 in the absence of G<sub>βγ</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) because the G-loop gate remains closed.</p><p>In summary, it appears that PIP<sub>2</sub> in GIRK channels enables G<sub>βγ</sub>-mediated opening by bringing the CTD near the intracellular membrane surface and rendering the G<sub>βγ</sub> binding surface permissive for attachment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

The contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were estimated using Gctf-1.0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zhang, 2016</xref>).

Particles were picked with the Laplacian-of-Gaussian auto-picking implemented in RELION-3 without templates. 502,731 auto-picked particles were extracted into 384 × 384 pixel images. The particle images were binned 1.5 times and subjected to Ab-initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC-2.9.0, specifying four output classes. The best class, including 216,085 particles were selected for homogeneous refinement with C4 symmetry, which yielded a map at 5.6 Å resolution. The particles were transferred back to RELION-3 using the pyem package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/asarnow/pyem">https://github.com/asarnow/pyem</ext-link>), re-extracted into 320 × 320 pixel images, binned 1.5 times and further refined with C4 symmetry after Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement, generating an improved map at 4.3 Å resolution. Focused refinement was performed on the CTD region, followed by the focused 3D classification on the TMD region without image alignment similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee and MacKinnon, 2018</xref>), revealing significant heterogeneity at the TMD region. Finally, 112,571 particles with fine features of TMD were selected and subjected to Non-uniform refinement and local refinement in CryoSPARC-2.9.0, which yielded the final map at 3.9 Å resolution.</p><p>For the structural titration of the GIRK2 channel, roughly 90–95% of micrographs from each PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration dataset were selected for further processing. Different views from 2D averages of the apo GIRK2 dataset were selected as templates for particle picking using Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/">https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/Gautomatch/</ext-link>).

Non-protein particles were removed, resulting in 99,381, 109,462, 105,388, 123,649, 99,619 and 105,708 particle images for the 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.875 and 1 mM PIP<sub>2</sub> datasets, respectively. After manual inspection, all these particles were combined (a total of 643,657) and transferred back to RELION-3. The particles were re-extracted into 320 × 320 pixel images, binned 1.5 times and subjected to 3D refinement in RELION-3 with the density map of apo GIRK2 as reference (low-pass filtered to 60 Å). Subsequently, the angular and translational parameters determined using 3D auto-refine were fixed throughout 25 cycles of 3D classification, specifying five classes in RELION-3 with the map generated by 3D auto-refine low-pass filtered to 60 Å serving as the initial model. Manual inspection identified one class with characteristics of the docked class and contributions of all six datasets to this 3D class were determined using identifiers uniquely associated with each particle during particle extraction. To ensure the reproducibility of the 3D classification algorithm, the 643,657 particles were subjected to five independent runs of 3D auto-refine and 3D classification.</p><p>For structure determination of GIRK2 with PIP<sub>2</sub> bound, the 155,128 particles corresponding to the docked class in the structural titration dataset was refined applying C4 symmetry using the Non-uniform refinement algorithm in CryoSPARC-2.9., resulting in a map at 4.6 Å resolution. The refined particles were then transferred back to RELION, followed by CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, which improved the map to 4.0 Å. Particles were then re-extracted into 400 × 400 pixel images and subjected to multiple runs of CTF refinement in RELION-3.1 as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheres, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zivanov et al., 2020</xref>).

Different views of 2D averages from the apo GIRK2 dataset were selected as templates and Gautomatch was used for particle picking. The auto-picked 554,081 particles were extracted into 256 × 256 pixel images, binned two times and subjected to Ab-initio reconstruction in CryoSPARC-2.9.0, specifying four output classes. The best of the four classes, including 221,633 particles, were selected for homogeneous refinement applying C2 symmetry, which yielded a map at 7.7 Å resolution. The particles were transferred back to RELION-3 using the pyem package with angular and translational parameters and re-extracted into 256 × 256 pixel images. 3D classification was performed requesting five classes without image alignment, using the refined map from CryoSPARC low-pass filtered to 60 Å as the initial model. Two out of five classes showed typical features of docked and extended conformations, accounting for 22% (48,757) and 26% (57,644) of the particles, respectively. These two classes were processed separately using the same approach. Specifically, per-particle Defocus-U and Defocus-V values were first determined in the local-fitting mode of Gctf-1.0.6. 3D refinement with C2 symmetry yielded the final map of the extended class at 7.9 Å. For the docked class, local CTF estimation yielded a map at 6.1 Å resolution and subsequent Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement with C2 symmetry further improved the map to 4.6 Å resolution.</p><p>We chose C2 symmetry in the analysis of GIRK1/4 images based on the empirical observation that it yielded a better map than refinement without symmetry. The resolution of the GIRK1/4 data precluded distinction between the GIRK1 and GIRK4 subunits; however, the improved refinement by application of C2 symmetry implies that these subunits might alternate in their positions around the pore’s central axis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Model building and refinement</title><p>For the apo GIRK2 structure (extended conformation), models of the CTD and TMD region from the crystal structure of GIRK2 channel monomer without PIP<sub>2</sub> (PDB: 3SYO) were placed into the density using UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Merritt Maduke as the Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bruce P Bean (Reviewer #1); Sudha Chakrapani (Reviewer #2); Ryan E Hibbs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This short paper presents cryo-EM data focused on structural elucidation of GIRK activation by PIP<sub>2</sub>. GIRK channels are unique among inward rectifiers in that they require the binding of both PIP<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> proteins for activation, potentially affecting two gates, the inner gate at helix bundle and the G loop gate, respectively. The Mackinnon group previously determined structures of GIRK2 (in the absence and presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>) and a GIRK2-G<sub>βγ</sub> complex by X-ray crystallography. While providing high-resolution structural insights into the architecture and G-protein activation, these structures did not reveal conformational changes that may underlie PIP<sub>2</sub> regulation. Particularly, the transmembrane domain (TMD) and cytoplasmic domain (CTD) were tightly juxtaposed even in the absence PIP<sub>2</sub>. In addition, both the G-loop gate and the inner helix gate remained closed in the PIP<sub>2</sub>-bound structure. These results raised questions because PIP<sub>2</sub> binding to GIRK2 did not result in the kind of conformational change observed in another inward rectifying K<sup>+</sup> channel, Kir2.2.</p><p>Here, the authors report structures of neuronal GIRK2 in the apo and PIP2 bounds forms determined by cryo-EM. C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> was titrated into GIRK2 samples, which enabled determination of cryo-EM structures of GIRK2 in docked (CTD and TMD tightly juxtaposed) and extended conformations. The docked conformation is progressively populated with increasing concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub>. The authors also report broadly similar findings for cardiac GIRK1/4 heteromeric channels.</p><p>Overall, the study is clearly written and logical and resolves a mystery for GIRK2- now we know it can adopt an extended conformation in the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>. Further, the study demonstrates conservation in mechanism across several Kir members, as the docked vs. undocked conformational changes are similar to those observed with Kir2.2. Finally, the authors present a model whereby this PIP<sub>2</sub>-mediated docking allows binding of G<sub>βγ</sub> to the channels. The data and model therefore explain why both PIP<sub>2</sub> and G<sub>βγ</sub> are necessary for the opening of GIRK channels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The GIRK2 extended-conformation map quality is poor in some important regions. This map contains ~no reliable density for a slab between the CTD and TMD, however linkers and loops are modeled here. For example, 314-319 do not fit the map and 197-201 are built into very noisy density. Some regions of this map are quite good, and many are very noisy, consistent with Figure 1—figure supplement 1D showing a drop in FSC to ~0.5 at around 7A resolution. The Materials and methods describe this model being built through docking of earlier structures for the two halves followed by refinement (sounds fine). We ask that the authors clarify regions in which ambiguity is present in the Materials and methods section (or in the main text if they prefer), and describe the basis for modeling of the linkers (314-319 and 197-201) in particular. Please take a look also at 186-196. The helix appears to unwind in a couple of places (and the map is a bit ambiguous), and the important gate-keeping residue Phe 192 is modeled such that it pushes the backbone out of density. Maybe this is correct- it is unclear in the absence of more information.</p><p>2) Why were the GIRK1/4 data processed in C2? Is the subunit arrangement defined (understood) such that C2 is appropriate? Were C4 and C1 refinements or classifications attempted? Is pseudosymmetry is a concern? Are there classes with partial PIP<sub>2</sub> occupancy?</p><p>3) The Materials and methods section doesn't describe how GIRK1/4 particle alignment was done. What structural features differ between 1 and 4 that aid alignment?</p><p>4) There are no functional assays shown in the manuscript, particularly to corroborate the shift in equilibrium population for the concentration range seen in cryo-EM. The authors may want to comment on why the docked conformation only constitutes ~30% of the total particles even at 1 mM PIP<sub>2</sub>. Are there other lipids such as cholesterol required?</p><p>5) Subsection “GIRK2 conformation as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration”: How was the range of [C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>] chosen, and can the results of the titration be related to physiological experiments?</p><p>6) An interesting result is that even with no added PIP<sub>2</sub>, about 8% of the GIRK channels are in the docked conformation. If the authors have any thoughts about this it would probably be of interest to readers. Does this mean that there is a chance that some small fraction of channels could be bound by G<sub>βγ</sub> even in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub>? Or is there any chance that there is endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> in the expression system that can be retained during protein purification?</p><p>7) The figures for the conformational changes could be better with more detailed labeling (Figures 4 and 5).</p><p>8) What is the contour levels for the densities in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2?</p><p>9) Crystal packing is suggested to be responsible for the absence of obtaining an extended conformation previously. Is the preparation for the cryo-EM structural analysis being in detergent of any concern to the authors? The similarities to what has been seen with Kir2.2 provide some confidence.</p><p>10) The GIRK2 docked map and model look fine; PIP<sub>2</sub> tails are not well resolved, which is worth mentioning perhaps in the Materials and methods.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60552.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The GIRK2 extended-conformation map quality is poor in some important regions.

Or is there any chance that there is endogenous PIP<sub>2</sub> in the expression system that can be retained during protein purification?</p></disp-quote><p>We now address this point in a new paragraph in the Materials and methods subsection “Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The figures for the conformational changes could be better with more detailed labeling (Figures 4 and 5).</p></disp-quote><p>We very much like these figures as they are.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) What is the contour levels for the densities in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 4—figure supplement 2?</p></disp-quote><p>The contour levels are now stated in the corresponding figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Crystal packing is suggested to be responsible for the absence of obtaining an extended conformation previously.
