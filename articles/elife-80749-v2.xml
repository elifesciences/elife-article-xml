Yet, how melanopsin phototransduction within M1-M6 ipRGC subtypes impacts cellular signaling to drive diverse behaviors is still largely unresolved. The identity of the phototransduction channels in each subtype is key to understanding this central question but has remained controversial. In this study, we resolve two opposing models of M4 phototransduction, demonstrating that hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are dispensable for this process and providing support for a pathway involving melanopsin-dependent potassium channel closure and canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel opening. Surprisingly, we find that HCN channels are likewise dispensable for M2 phototransduction, contradicting the current model. We instead show that M2 phototransduction requires TRPC channels in conjunction with T-type voltage-gated calcium channels, identifying a novel melanopsin phototransduction target. Collectively, this work resolves key discrepancies in our understanding of ipRGC phototransduction pathways in multiple subtypes and adds to mounting evidence that ipRGC subtypes employ diverse phototransduction cascades to fine-tune cellular responses for downstream behaviors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Melanopsin</kwd><kwd>transduction</kwd><kwd>ipRGC</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>TRP channel</kwd><kwd>ganglion cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31EY030360</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sonoda</surname><given-names>Takuma</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2EY027983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Tiffany M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY030565</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Tiffany M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32EY025202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bhoi</surname><given-names>Jacob D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z01-ES-101684</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Birnbaumer</surname><given-names>Lutz</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Heart Lung &amp; Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL007909</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contreras</surname><given-names>Ely</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Melanopsin phototransduction targets distinct complements of transduction channels across intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell subtypes and does not require hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Light is a pervasive and important regulator of physiology and behavior across timescales that range from milliseconds to days. While rod and cone photoreceptors are primarily responsible for rapid, spatially discrete light signals, melanopsin phototransduction within the M1-M6 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) subtypes spatially and temporally integrates environmental light signals to impact diverse behaviors over significantly longer timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hattar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emanuel and Do, 2015</xref>). M1 ipRGCs project to non-image-forming brain regions to influence subconscious non-image-forming functions such as circadian photoentrainment, the pupillary light reflex, learning, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hattar et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mrosovsky and Hattar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Panda et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altimus et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lupi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Göz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gooley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LeGates et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fernandez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rupp et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sondereker et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda and Schmidt, 2021</xref>). M2-M6 ipRGCs primarily innervate brain areas involved in conscious visual perception and are necessary for proper contrast sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estevez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stabio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quattrochi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aranda and Schmidt, 2021</xref>). Despite diverse behavioral functions, one common feature across ipRGC subtypes is that melanopsin (Opn4) phototransduction is required for intrinsic light sensitivity. Indeed, melanopsin null mutant animals show deficits in both image-forming and non-image-forming behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>), highlighting the important role melanopsin plays across diverse cell types and behaviors. Though all ipRGC subtypes require melanopsin phototransduction for intrinsic photosensitivity, the melanopsin-mediated response of each subtype differs in size, sensitivity, and kinetics and will differentially shape the visual information relayed to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ecker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estevez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stabio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Quattrochi et al., 2019</xref>). Yet, the mechanistic underpinnings of these key differences and how they impact visual signals relayed by ipRGC subtypes to drive diverse downstream behaviors are not well understood.</p><p>Melanopsin shares greater sequence homology with invertebrate rhodopsins than vertebrate opsins, which led to an early expectation that melanopsin phototransduction in all ipRGC subtypes would work through an identical, invertebrate-like signaling pathway involving activation of a Gq/PLC-based cascade that opens canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels such as TRPC 3, 6, or 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Provencio et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Provencio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koyanagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartwick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koyanagi and Terakita, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2011</xref>). However, though M1 ipRGCs use this predicted Gq/PLC-based cascade to open only TRPC6/7 channels, phototransduction in non-M1 ipRGCs has been reported to rely less exclusively on TRPC channels and to also target additional channel types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartwick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). In M2 cells, for example, melanopsin phototransduction is reported to open both TRPC channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). In M4 cells, researchers have reached conflicting conclusions about the identity of the melanopsin transduction channel(s). Our previous findings in M4 cells point to closure of potassium leak channels by melanopsin phototransduction and a minor contribution from TRPC3/6/7 channel opening, while a concurrent study concluded that melanopsin phototransduction leads to opening of HCN channels in M4 cells with no contribution from TRPC3/6/7 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Contreras et al., 2021</xref>). Potassium channel closure versus HCN channel opening would lead to distinct, largely opposing impacts on M4 cell physiology and signaling, and thus a major goal of this study was to resolve the role of HCN and TRPC channels in M4 phototransduction, as well as to reassess their role in M2 phototransduction.</p><p>In this study, we show that HCN channels are not the M4 phototransduction channel and confirm a minor role for TRPC3/6/7 channels in bright light. Unexpectedly, we also find that HCN channels are dispensable for M2 phototransduction and identify T-type voltage-gated calcium channels as a novel, and critical, component of M2 phototransduction. Unlike M2 cells, M1 cells do not require T-type voltage-gated calcium channels for phototransduction, highlighting an important difference between the TRPC-dependent phototransduction cascades of M1 versus M2 ipRGCs. Thus, M1, M2, and M4 phototransduction cascades each signal through distinct combinations of phototransduction channels. Collectively, our findings resolve important discrepancies in our understanding of ipRGC phototransduction and add to the growing body of evidence for diverse melanopsin signaling cascades across ipRGC subtypes that tune cellular function to drive diverse downstream behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TRPC3/6/7 channels contribute to M4 phototransduction</title><p>Two models for M4 phototransduction have been proposed. Our previous work suggests that melanopsin in M4 ipRGCs leads to potassium channel closure with a minor contribution of TRPC3/6/7 channel opening in bright light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>), while a separate study published concurrently proposed that HCN channels are opened by the melanopsin phototransduction pathway with no contribution from TRPC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). To begin to resolve these discrepancies, we first recorded the M4 photocurrent under conditions that matched those used in Jiang et al. as closely as possible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’). We stimulated M4 cells with brief, full-field, 50 ms flashes of high photopic (6.08 × 10<sup>15</sup> photons · cm<sup>–2</sup> · s<sup>–1</sup>) 480 nm light, the highest possible intensity for our LED light source. We identified large somata of putative M4 cells under infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) and filled each recorded cell with Neurobiotin. We then confirmed the identity of each M4 cell post-recording using multiple, established criteria including morphology (verified ON stratification, large somata, highly branched dendritic arbors), physiology (ON-sustained responses to increments in light), and immunolabeling for SMI-32 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Schmidt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sonoda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We recorded the M4 melanopsin photocurrent in a cocktail of synaptic blockers (see ‘Materials and methods’) at –66 mV following exposure to a brief, 50 ms full-field flash. Control M4 cells consistently exhibited an inward photocurrent that was composed of both a relatively fast, transient component followed by a slower, larger inward current that persisted for more than 30 s after termination of the 50 ms light pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). This small, transient component was previously noted in a subset of M2 cells but has not been observed in M4 cells in photopic light, potentially due to the previous use of lower intensity photopic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>) or the use of bright, epifluorescent illumination to localize M4 cells that were subsequently recorded in high photopic light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>;

We found a significant decrease in the amplitude of the Early, transient, component in TRPC3/6/7 KO M4 cells, suggesting that this component is largely driven by TRPC3/6/7 channels.

HCN channels are a class of nonspecific cation channels opened primarily by membrane hyperpolarization whose activation voltage shifts in the presence of cyclic nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). One compelling piece of evidence in support of melanopsin phototransduction opening HCN channels was a reduction of the M4 photocurrent following application of 50 μM ZD7288, an HCN antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore first tested whether 50 μM ZD7288 blocked both the M4 photocurrent and HCN-mediated tail current using similar recording conditions to Jiang et al., combined with rigorous post hoc subtype identification of M4 cells. Because the incubation period for ZD7288 was not reported by Jiang et al., we first tested whether a period of 5–8 min incubation with ZD7288 was sufficient to abolish the HCN current in M4 ipRGCs. To do this, we recorded HCN tail currents from M4 ipRGCs first in the absence and then in the presence of 50 μM ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>).

After confirming tail current blockade by 5–8 min of 50 μM ZD7288, we then measured the photocurrent of these same M4 cells where HCN channels are fully blocked. If HCN channels are the sole target of melanopsin phototransduction in M4 cells, then this full blockade of HCN channels with 5–8 min of 50 μM ZD7288 should eliminate the melanopsin-dependent M4 photocurrent. However, we observed no reduction in the M4 photocurrent in 50 μM ZD7288 despite elimination of the HCN tail current under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>).

If melanopsin phototransduction opens HCN channels by shifting their voltage dependence, then in constant light at –66 mV (the starting potential in our HCN protocol) some proportion of HCN channels would already be open because we measure robust photocurrents at –66 mV (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). It then follows that a hyperpolarizing step from –66 mV to –120 mV would evoke a smaller HCN current and tail current in light because there would be fewer HCN channels left to open compared to darkness when a larger pool of HCN channels are available to open with that same hyperpolarizing step. To test this, we compared the amplitude of the M4 HCN current and tail current in darkness and after 90 s of bright, background light (480 nm light at 6.08 × 10<sup>15</sup> photons · cm<sup>–2</sup> · s<sup>–1</sup>). This background light evoked a steady inward current as evidenced by the increased holding current required at –66 mV in light versus dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref> and see ‘Materials and methods’). We found no change in either the M4 HCN current or tail current amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), indicating that light does not modulate the HCN current, further arguing against HCN involvement in M4 phototransduction.</p><p>The permeation properties of the M4 transduction channel(s) should be reflected in the photocurrent I–V relationship. Therefore, as a third test of HCN involvement in M4 phototransduction, we compared the reversal potential of the M4 HCN tail current versus that of the M4 photocurrent. We previously showed that the photocurrent I–V relationship of Control and TRPC3/6/7 KO M4 cells has a negative slope, reverses at the equilibrium potential for potassium channels (–90 mV), and drives an increase in input resistance and cellular excitability, indicating that potassium channels are the primary target of M4 phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). However, the I–V relationship of the HCN tail current has not previously been reported for M4 ipRGCs. The reversal of the HCN tail current fit to a linear regression is used to estimate a reversal potential of HCN channels in other cell types and is usually between –25 mV and –50 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>). If melanopsin phototransduction does open HCN channels in M4 cells, then we would expect the extrapolated reversal potential of the HCN tail current to match the reported reversal potential of the M4 photocurrent. To test this, we measured the reversal potential of the M4 HCN tail current and compared it to that of the M4 photocurrent reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). To do this, we used a voltage-clamp protocol designed to open HCN channels and recorded the HCN tail current across multiple test potentials in the absence and then presence of 5–8 min of 50 μM ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then calculated the HCN tail current amplitude by subtracting the tail current amplitude in ZD7288 from those generated in control solution at each test potential and plotted the ZD7288-sensitive current and used a linear fit to extrapolate the reversal potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Unlike the I–V relationship of the M4 photocurrent reversal at –90 mV, the linear fit of the M4 HCN tail current shows an extrapolated reversal at –26 mV. Though consistent with the properties of HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biel et al., 2009</xref>), the extrapolated M4 HCN tail current I–V reversal is distinct from the reversal of the M4 photocurrent (M4 photocurrent replotted in Figure 3B from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>, see also Figures 7D and S6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>).

We therefore sought to reconcile our experimental outcome with those previously described. ZD7288 has been reported to have off-target effects on other ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felix et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Do and Bean, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sánchez-Alonso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). If the reported prior blockade of the M4 photocurrent by 50 μM ZD7288 was due to off-target effects, then longer incubation with 50 μM ZD7288 could result in off-target effects that mimic the previously observed reduction in the M4 photocurrent (ZD7288 incubation time was not reported in the prior study) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). To test this, we treated M4 ipRGCs with 50 μM ZD7288 for 20 min. Importantly, this longer application period caused no further reduction in the HCN tail currents compared to cells incubated for 5–8 min, indicating that the shorter 5–8 incubation time is sufficient for full HCN blockade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>). Despite identical HCN channel blockade, this longer 20 min incubation with 50 μM ZD7288 now essentially abolished the M4 photocurrent and increased M4 cell input resistance compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>). These results are consistent with potential nonspecific blockade of potassium channels by ZD7288 and provide a methodological explanation for previous conclusions of HCN involvement in M4 phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Do and Bean, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, our results argue against a role for HCN channels in M4 phototransduction and provide support for our previous conclusions that melanopsin phototransduction results in closure of potassium channels with a minor contribution of TRPC3/6/7 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HCN channels are not required for M2 phototransduction</title><p>Previous work has reported that HCN and TRPC6/7 channels each contribute significantly to M2 phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Considering the evidence against HCN involvement in M4 phototransduction, we next revisited the role of HCN channels in M2 phototransduction. We first sought to replicate previous findings that the HCN antagonist ZD7288 partially reduces the M2 photocurrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). To do this, we performed whole-cell recordings of M2 ipRGCs identified under brief epifluorescent illumination in retinas of Opn4-GFP mice where only M1, M2, and M3 ipRGCs are labeled with EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>). All cells were filled with Neurobiotin and identified as M2 ipRGCs post-recording using established criteria including ON stratification (M2 ipRGCs are the only ON type of ipRGC labeled in Opn4-GFP mice), large dendritic arbors, and lack of SMI-32 immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Schmidt, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lucas and Schmidt, 2019</xref>; see 'Materials and methods'). Notably, HCN tail currents of control M2 ipRGCs showed smaller, more variable HCN tail current amplitudes compared to those measured in M4 cells, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). We then measured HCN tail currents in M2 cells before and after 5–8 min incubation with 50 μM ZD7288 and found that the HCN currents and tail currents were completely abolished under these conditions, identifying an effective concentration and incubation period of ZD7288 for full HCN channel blockade in M2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We next evaluated the role of HCN channels in M2 phototransduction. If HCN channels are involved in M2 phototransduction, then complete blockade of HCN channels via application of 50 μM ZD7288 for 5–8 min should significantly reduce the M2 melanopsin photocurrent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). To test this, we recorded the M2 photocurrent evoked by brief, full-field, 50 ms flashes of high photopic (6.08 × 10<sup>15</sup> photons · cm<sup>–2</sup> · s<sup>–1</sup>) 480 nm light in the presence or absence of 5–8 min of 50 μM ZD7288 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). M2 photocurrents in control cells consistently showed a transient peak in the Early phase of the response and then a smaller, slow component that persisted for more than 30 s following light offset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). As with M4 cells, HCN channel blockade with an effective concentration and incubation period of ZD7288 did not reduce the M2 photocurrent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), suggesting that HCN channels are not a target of melanopsin phototransduction in M2 cells. As a second test of HCN involvement in M2 phototransduction, we tested whether light altered the HCN current or tail current amplitude of M2 ipRGCs when stepped from –66 mV to –120 mV. Again, like M4 cells, we found no change in the amplitude of the M2 HCN tail current recorded in background light compared to darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), despite a steady, light-evoked inward current at the starting holding potential of –66 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). This indicates that the M2 HCN current is not modulated by light. This further supports the conclusion that HCN channels, though expressed in M2 cells, are not a target of M2 melanopsin phototransduction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are not required for M2 phototransduction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) M2 intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell (ipRGC) filled with Neurobiotin (Nb, magenta) in a Control retina and immunolabeled for the M4 marker SMI-32 (green).

However, we observed that the I–V relationship of M1 and M2 ipRGCs differed in shape and reversal potential, with M1 cells having a more linear I–V relationship that reverses at 0 mV compared to a more complex I–V relationship that reverses +19 mV for M2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartwick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). This observation suggests that while both M1 and M2 cells require TRPC channels for melanopsin phototransduction, another type of channel may be interacting with TRPC channels in M2 ipRGCs to shift the reversal of the I–V relationship. Calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) would shift the reversal potential of the photocurrent I–V to more positive voltages. Interestingly, VGCCs, like TRPC channels, can be modulated by Gq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomquist et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scott et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niemeyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertaso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hildebrand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>).

To test this, we recorded the photocurrent of M2 ipRGCs in control solution and in the presence of a cocktail of VGCC antagonists (see 'Materials and methods'; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and C</xref>).

To test this, we recorded the M2 photocurrent under blockade of T-type VGCCs with the specific T-type antagonist TTA-P2 (10 µM). We found that T-type blockade nearly eliminates the M2 photocurrent without reducing the HCN tail current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>).

While melanopsin phototransduction in M1 ipRGCs opens TRPC 3/6/7 channels, in M2 ipRGCs melanopsin phototransduction requires both TRPC and T-type VGCCs, and in M4 ipRGCs melanopsin phototransduction closes leak potassium channels. These subtypes vary in their roles in behavior, their intrinsic properties, and their integration of light information from intrinsic and retinal pathways. These varying mechanisms likely optimize each subtype for their role in behavior. For example, in M4 ipRGCs, closure of potassium channels increases the excitability of M4 cells, enhancing cellular (and likely behavioral) contrast sensitivity while M1 ipRGCs perform simpler luminance-detecting functions to impact behaviors that integrate luminance information across long timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hattar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ruby et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lucas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Güler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emanuel and Do, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>).

Though both subtypes express HCN channels, the melanopsin photocurrent in each subtype is insensitive to HCN blockade, has a distinct I–V relationship to that of HCN channels, and is not modulated by light. In our previous work, we plotted the I–V relationship of M4 ipRGCs across three experimental paradigms using (1) whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to 10 s light stimuli, (2) whole-cell patch-clamp recordings to 100 ms light stimuli, or (3) nucleated patch recordings to 10 s light stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). In all cases, the I–V relationship of the melanopsin photocurrent in WT and TRPC3/6/7 KO M4 cells had a negative slope that reversed at the potassium equilibrium potential, consistent with decreasing conductance (channel closure) through potassium channel closure via melanopsin phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the reversal of this I–V relationship could be shifted to a newly calculated potassium equilibrium potential when the external potassium concentration was altered, further supporting a role for potassium channels in M4 phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous work found evidence for a minor contribution of TRPC channels in photopic light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>), which we replicate in our findings here at even higher illumination. In this study, we show that the reversal potential of the M4 melanopsin photocurrent at –90 mV is distinct from that of the M4 HCN tail current at –26 mV. Additionally, we report that the HCN antagonist ZD7288 fails to block the M4 photocurrent at a concentration and incubation period (5–8 min at 50 μM) that fully eliminates the HCN tail current. Additionally, light does not alter the amplitude of the M4 HCN current. Importantly, we were able to replicate previous findings that ZD7288 blocks the M4 photocurrent, but only after a long, 20 min incubation time. This longer incubation time did not further reduce HCN current but did increase the M4 cell input resistance, suggesting that the M4 photocurrent blockade following longer incubations was due to off-target effects of ZD7288, which have been reported previously in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Do and Bean, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felix et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sánchez-Alonso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, while M4 ipRGCs clearly <italic>express</italic> HCN channels, we find no evidence that HCN channels are in fact <italic>gated</italic> by melanopsin phototransduction. Our findings in TRPC3/6/7 KO M4 cells also confirm that TRPC3/6/7 channels play a minor role in M4 phototransduction in bright light, which we had shown previously in lower photopic light levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>), arguing against a previous report that there is no effect on M4 photocurrent amplitude in TRPC knockout M4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Because much of the early transient component of the photocurrent, which depends heavily on TRPC channels, was not detected in previous work (potentially due to bleaching following epifluorescent localization), it is possible that this contribution of TRPC channels to M4 phototransduction was simply missed under highly light adapted conditions recording conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>HCN channels had also been reported to play a role in M2 phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>), and in light of our findings in M4 cells, we next examined the role of HCN channels in M2 phototransduction. Similar to our findings in M4 ipRGCs, 5–8 min incubation period with ZD7288 effectively blocked M2 HCN channels but failed to reduce the M2 photocurrent in either Control or TRPC3/6/7 KO cells. Likewise, the HCN tail current showed a calculated reversal potential at a voltage distinct from the M2 photocurrent and was unaffected by light. Each of these findings argues against HCN involvement in M2 phototransduction. Only with the longer, 20 min incubation period with ZD7288 were we able to replicate the previously reported ~50% reduction in M2 ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). As with M4 cells, this blockade occurred despite no additional reduction in the HCN current, supporting the conclusion that this additional photocurrent blockade was due to off-target effects on non-HCN channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Do and Bean, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felix et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sánchez-Alonso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, ZD7288 has also been shown to block T-type calcium channels via off-target blockade, providing further support for this interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sánchez-Alonso et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). It is important to note that we could not achieve light levels as high as those used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>, leaving open the possibility that HCN channels play a role at very high light levels. However, this possibility seems unlikely because the high photopic light levels used in this study are saturating and generate maximum photocurrents, yet we are unable to detect any contribution from HCN channels for either M2 or M4 phototransduction. Collectively, our work suggests that HCN channels are not involved in propagating melanopsin light information to downstream processing centers in the brain.</p><p>Our reevaluation of melanopsin signaling in M2 ipRGCs prompted us to look at the role of TRPC channels in M2 phototransduction. Previous studies have noted that knockout of TRPC 6 or multiple TRPC3/6/7 subunits, as well as pharmacological inhibition of TRPC channels, causes 50% or greater reduction in the M2 photocurrent, suggesting that TRPC channels are a major transduction channel in M2 ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perez-Leighton et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). In line with previous work, we found that genetic elimination of TRPC subunits 3, 6, and 7, caused an ~75% reduction in their maximum photocurrent, suggesting that TRPC channels are a major melanopsin phototransduction channel in M2 cells.</p><p>Intriguingly, we observed that though both M1 and M2 ipRGCs require TRPC channels for the majority (M2) or entirety (M1) of their photocurrent, the I–V curves of M1 and M2 cells differed substantially, prompting us to probe whether additional unidentified transduction channels may be involved in one or both of these phototransduction pathways. We found that blockade of T-type VGCCs with either mibefradil or TTA-P2 resulted in an ~75% reduction in M2 photocurrent but had no effect on the M1 photocurrent, suggesting that T-type VGCCs are necessary for M2, but not M1, phototransduction. Importantly, this lack of blockade in M1 ipRGCs argues against any nonspecific effects of any VGCC blockers on TRPC channels. One possible mechanism for T-type VGCC activation is through modulation of channel excitability by Gq, the heterotrimeric G-protein activated in the melanopsin phototransduction cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have shown that both TRPC channels and VGCCs can be modulated by Gq signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloomquist et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Scott et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niemeyer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertaso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Panda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Qiu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warren et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hildebrand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xue et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Keum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sonoda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, it has recently been shown that cAMP, which likewise modulates T-type VGCC function through shifting its voltage-dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>), may act downstream of Gq in M4 melanopsin phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). If cAMP is activated by Gq in M2 cells, this is another potential mechanism for T-type VGCC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Louiset et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Of note, the similar degree of M2 photocurrent reduction by the T-type antagonists mibefradil and TTA-P2 to that seen in TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 cells, combined with lack of TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 cell photocurrent reduction in mibefradil, suggests that TRPC channels and T-type VGCCs act through a common phototransduction pathway. It is, however, noteworthy that a small transient component remained in control M2 cells under T-type blockade that was not present in TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>), suggesting that some current through TRPC channels may remain under T-type channel blockade in Control M2 cells. This would suggest that T-type VGCCs may be downstream of TRPC channels. In other systems and cell types, TRPC channels have been shown to form complexes with and/or modulate the function of both L-type and T-type VGCCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soboloff et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Onohara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Perissinotti et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, T-type VGCCs open in response to small membrane depolarizations and have been shown to generate a sustained inward current at hyperpolarized voltages of in the range of –70 to –40 mV in other cell types due to incomplete inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijlenga et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the small TRPC3/6/7-mediated photocurrent in M2 ipRGCs depolarizes the membrane sufficiently to open T-type VGCCs and could generate a sustained M2 photocurrent at physiological voltages. This would align with the small transient current remaining under T-type blockade that is absent in TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 cells, but further testing is necessary to confirm this. Additionally, following strong depolarizations, T-type VGCCs are ideally situated to promote the high-frequency firing observed in M2 ipRGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goetz et al., 2022</xref>) due to the fast activation and inactivation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Perez-Reyes, 2003</xref>). The mechanisms through which T-type VGCCs and TRPC3/6/7 channels interact with each other and other components of the melanopsin cascade remain a key question for future studies.</p><p>Our work adds to a growing literature describing the interaction between T-type calcium channels and TRPC channels, and supports divergent, TRPC-dependent phototransduction mechanisms in M1 and M2 ipRGCs. Additionally, this work resolves a key discrepancy in our understanding of M4 phototransduction and supports an emerging framework for melanopsin signaling that suggests that melanopsin phototransduction is tuned to optimize how ipRGC subtypes signal to influence their associated light-driven behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Contact for reagent and resource sharing</title><p>Requests for reagents and resources should be directed to the lead contact, Tiffany Schmidt (tiffany.schmidt@northwestern.edu).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Northwestern University.</p><p>Both male and female mice were used with a mixed B6/129 background.

Only a single cell was recorded per retina piece to ensure that the cell was not light adapted. We measured the maximum amplitude as well as the amplitude at three timepoints selected to represent different phases of the light response (highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) of the photocurrent. The cells were smoothed using a 100 ms sliding average. The baseline current was quantified as the mean current in the first 3 s of the recording protocol. Maximum amplitude was calculated as the maximum current value of the smoothed trace that had the greatest change from baseline during the recording period. The Early, Intermediate, and Late timepoints represent the average change from baseline within the following timeframes after light onset: Early (141.7–440.4 ms), Intermediate (2857.7–6598.2 ms), and Late (9062.3–14062.3 ms). Values were reported as the absolute value of the current (pA), for each component.</p><p>The light-evoked I–V relationship for M2 cells was generated by recording the intrinsic melanopsin response for Control and TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 cells in response to a 50 ms light pulse. Cells were voltage clamped at potentials from –106 mV to +34 mV. Cells were allowed to stabilize at a given holding potentials for 1–3 min prior to light onset. Only a single cell was recorded per preparation to ensure dark adaptation state was as uniform as possible across cells/preparations. We plotted the I–V relationships for Maximum, Early, Intermediate, and Late amplitudes. The reversal potential was identified as where the I–V curve intersected the X-axis (i.e. I = 0).</p><p>For experiments measuring the HCN-mediated tail current, channel activation was evoked by hyperpolarizing the cell from –66 mV to –120 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>). Tail current amplitudes were defined as the maximum change from baseline upon return to –66 mV (after the voltage step to –120 mV) and were plotted as the absolute value of the current. Hyperpolarizing the membrane to –120 mV evoked an instantaneous current followed by the slowly activating inward current. The HCN inward current was defined as the time-dependent component at the end of the 4 s hyperpolarizing step. The HCN inward current amplitude was measured from the beginning of the slowly activating inward current (following the instantaneous current) to the end of the 4 s hyperpolarization step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>For experiments assessing blockade of HCN channels, cells were exposed to 50 μM ZD7288 and then subjected again to the same protocol. Blockade of HCN channels in ipRGCs was observed when the tail current amplitude was abolished (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biel et al., 2009</xref>). Blockade of HCN channels, defined loss of tail currents, occurred between 5 and 8 min (5–8 min) of exposure to 50 μM ZD7288 for each individual cell. For experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 4B</xref>, the HCN tail current was first measured (defined as control), and then the same cell was exposed to 50 μM ZD7288 for 5–8 min to block HCN channels. However, for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B and 4D</xref>, the photocurrent measurements were obtained from different cells: control and cells exposed to 50 μM ZD7288 for 5–8 min. The photocurrent was measured in different cells to avoid melanopsin photobleaching. To measure the I–V relationship of HCN channels in M2 and M4 ipRGCs (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Yang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Hook and Berson, 2010</xref>), cells were hyperpolarizing –66 mV to –120 mV to activate the majority of HCN channels. Cells were then depolarized to various test potentials from –106 mV to –66 mV. This protocol was repeated in the same cells following 5–8 min application of 50 μM ZD7288 to ensure blockade of HCN channels. The ZD7288 sensitive tail current was derived by subtracting 5–8 min ZD7288 recordings from Control. Tail current amplitudes were measured at each test potential. The tail current amplitudes during deactivation were plotted against each test potential to construct the I–V relationship. A linear fit was used to extrapolate the reversal potential of HCN tail currents.</p><p>For experiments assessing light modulation of HCN channels, the tail current was first measured in the dark. The same cell was then exposed to light for 90 s, which allowed the inward photocurrent to stabilize. We then measured the baseline current, HCN current, and HCN tail current as described above in dark versus light. As expected, all cells in background light exhibited a steady-state inward photocurrent at –66 mV.</p><p>For experiments assessing the effects due to prolonged application of 50 μM ZD7288, cells were exposed to 20 min of ZD7288 in whole-cell patch-clamp configuration and recordings were performed following this period. Recordings for Control cells were performed 20 min after whole cell was achieved to account for effects due to long recording time. Because of the long recording times and to avoid multiple light stimulations of the same cell, which would affect photocurrent amplitude, recordings with and without ZD7288 were performed in separate cells.</p><p>Input resistance was calculated as the slope of a linear fit of the steady-state voltage deflection evoked by a series of hyperpolarizing current injections from –300 pA to 0 pA and depolarizing current injections from 0 pA to 200 pA.</p><p>Before recording calcium currents, cells were voltage clamped at –70 mV and depolarized to –40 mV to block any transient channels. Cells were then stepped from –40 mV to voltages from –60 mV to +30 mV in 10 mV intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Randall and Tsien, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dhein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Graphing and statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 9 software (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).

HCN seems an unlikely candidate as these channels would be mostly closed during the steady light-evoked depolarizations (to ~-50 mVs), and only start to activate when the ipRGCs are hyperpolarized below ~-60 mV.

However, the current result needs to be interpreted with caution, as the somatic depolarization used to activate HCN may only recruit channels at proximal dendrites, while light may activate HCN on the distal dendrites, deeper in the retina, which may take a longer time to block.</p><p>2) Current-voltage analysis: Distinct IV relationships for M4 photocurrents and HCN tail currents are used as an independent assay to argue against the idea that melanopsin gates HCN (Figure 3) but this is problematic for several reasons:</p><p>– IVs for HCN and light-evoked responses are expected to be different.

The patch-clamp data overall seem convincing although I can't comment on this in more detail because patch-clamp recordings are not my specific area of expertise. However, while I do find the data supporting the authors' claim that ipRGCs do not signal via HCN channels which contradicts data shown by Jing et al., 2018, before invalidating the previous study I wonder whether these claims are somewhat conditions-specific. I appreciate the fact that the authors here use more physiological light levels to stimulate melanopsin, however replicating the same light stimulus (~2.5 log brighter light and a longer step 200ms) as in Jing et al., and ideally include light intensity levels in between to assess the potential involvement of HCN channels (as authors propose using ZD7288 for 5-8min incubation time) would greatly strengthen the manuscript and support the authors' claims. Also, I would suggest expanding the discussion to include authors' views on the relevance of this different phototransduction in ipRGCs subtypes and how it may impact their roles in specific visual and non-visual responses would.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80749.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comparisons of current magnitudes need to be carried out after normalization to membrane capacitance to account for different cell sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and agree that any differences in capacitance between genotypes could skew interpretation of differences in current magnitudes. Both capacitance and photocurrent magnitude are subtype defining features of M1, M2, and M4 ipRGCs, and are consistent within each subtype and also differ predictably between subtypes (Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009; Ecker et al., 2010; Aranda and Schmidt, 2021). To ensure that differences in current magnitude across genotype were not due to changes in capacitance, we compared capacitance of WT versus TRPC3/6/7 KO M2 or M4 cells and found no differences. Thus, differences in capacitance do not account for differences in current magnitude across conditions, mitigating this concern. We likewise see no differences in input resistance across genotypes. These data are now included as Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 for M4 ipRGCs and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1 for M2 ipRGCs.</p><p>We have chosen to retain presentation of absolute current magnitude for light responses because the value of current magnitude is a subtype-defining feature of each ipRGC subtype, and reporting values in this format will be most informative and useful for the field when interpreting these values in the context of existing literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Since these cells are extensively coupled via gap junctions in a network, and have complex geometries with multiple processes, having a sense of adequate space-clamp is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>Space clamp is of course an issue with all large cells with complex geometries, and will similarly impact this study and all past studies using voltage clamp in ipRGCs (Ecker et al., 2010; Estevez et al., 2012; Jiang et al., 2018; Sonoda et al., 2018; Schmidt and Kofuji, 2009, 2010, 2011; Wong et al., 2005). In our case, we would expect space clamp be similar for a given ipRGC subtype across genotypes or pharmacological conditions, which would still allow us to interpret changes in photocurrent magnitude under different conditions. This idea is supported by the fact that neither input resistance nor capacitance of M2 or M4 ipRGCs change between the WT and TRPC3/6/7 KO genotypes (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 5 —figure supplement 1).</p><p>Regarding space clamp, it is also worth noting that our previous work on M4 cells, which have the largest and most complex ipRGC geometries and couple to surrounding cells, showed that the M4 photocurrent reverses right at the calculated potassium equilibrium potential (Ek) and shifts precisely as predicted when we alter external potassium concentration (Sonoda et al., 2018, Figure 7D). Additionally, the reversal of the whole cell I-V relationship precisely matches that of the M4 nucleated patch photocurrent reversal, where space clamp is not an issue (Sonoda et al., 2018, Figure 7E). This suggests that any space clamp issues are unlikely to be altering the observed reversal potential of our I-V curves. Moreover, our I-V reversals are inconsistent with currents that arise from a coupled network.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Demonstrating the functional expression, via voltage-clamp, of T-type calcium channels in M2 cells, and assessing off-target effects Mibefradil would be important steps to solidify the results, which otherwise appear preliminary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have added multiple experiments to add further evidence for this interpretation.</p><p>1. Functional Expression: We now provide functional and anatomical evidence of T-type VGCC expression in M2 cells. Depolarizing voltage steps elicit inward currents in M2 cells that are reduced with the selective T-type VGCC antagonist TTA-P2, indicating that M2 ipRGCs express functional Ttype VGCCs. M1 ipRGCs, in contrast, do not exhibit similar TTA-P2 sensitive currents (Figure 9A and Figure 9 —figure supplement 2). As a second test for T-type VGCC expression, we also performed immunohistochemical labeling of retinal sections in which ipRGCs are transduced with an AAV containing a fluorescent reporter. We observed co-labeling of ON-stratifying ipRGCs with Cav3.1, 3.2, and 3.3. We include these data in Figure 9 —figure supplement 1 along with a plot of mRNA expression of these Cacna1g/h/I (corresponding to Cav 3.1/3.2/3.3) in ipRGC subtypes from a previously published single-cell RNAseq dataset (Tran et al., 2019). Collectively, these results support T-type VGCC expression in M2 ipRGCs.</p><p>2. Off Target Effects: In the first submission, we showed that the T-type antagonist Mibefradil significantly reduced the M2 photocurrent. As an additional test of the contribution of T-type VGCCs to the M2 photocurrent, we recorded the M2 photocurrent in the presence of the more selective Ttype antagonist TTA-P2 (Dreyfus et., 2010; Choe et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2018). In agreement with our findings using Mibefradil, we find that TTA-P2 nearly eliminates the M2 photocurrent. This blockade with a second, more specific T-type antagonist indicates that our findings with Mibefradil are due to blockade of T-type VGCCs and further support our initial conclusions. Importantly, M1 photocurrents were unaffected by application of TTA-P2 alone and were also unaffected by application of a cocktail of VGCC blockers containing Mibefradil, arguing against non-specific effects of these antagonists on TRPC channels (Figures 8,9). T-type blockade also had no effect on the magnitude of the HCN tail current (Figure 9 —figure supplement 3).</p><p>We include these new results as main figures in the paper and have re-ordered this section of the paper for clarity and flow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is essential to provide a good explanation for how ion channels responsible for the photo responses could be responsible for sustained, long-lasting light-evoked depolarizations.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and have added in the discussion of a potential mechanism through which T-type VGCCs could mediate the sustained current observed in M2s in Lines 440-453.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Another major problem is related to the dialysis of the cellular content associated with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, which is expected to modify intracellular signaling pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that perforated patch has the advantage of preventing dialysis of intracellular components. However, a major goal of this work is to reconcile discrepancies in models from the Jiang and Sonoda studies, which both used whole-cell patch clamp recordings (Sonoda et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018).

These points are largely addressed in Essential revisions point 3 above. Briefly, we now include data from a second, more specific, T-type antagonist, TTA-P2, which nearly eliminates the M2 photocurrent but does not affect the M1 photocurrent (Figure 9), mirroring our results using Mibefradil (now shown in Figure 10). Figure 9 —figure supplement 1 now plots mRNA expression of Cacna1g/h/i (i.e. Cav 3.1/3.2/3.3) across ipRGC subtypes and shows immunohistochemical labeling for these subunits in retinal sections where ipRGCs are labeled with a fluorescent reporter and Figure 9 —figure supplement 2 shows functional evidence of T-type VGCCs in M2 cells. All of our results from these newly added experiments support expression of functional T-type VGCCs in M2 cells and a key role for these channels in M2 phototransduction, further strengthening our initial conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>The authors need to do a better job of explaining how HCN could mediate the melanopsin response. HCN seems an unlikely candidate as these channels would be mostly closed during the steady light-evoked depolarizations (to ~-50 mVs), and only start to activate when the ipRGCs are hyperpolarized below ~-60 mV. Thus, to me, it is not surprising that HCN doesn't play a role in mediating melanopsin responses.</p><p>While I feel it is important to directly demonstrate the negative result (in light of previous reports), I feel the results do not always support the major claims.</p><p>1) Off-target effects: The finding that ZD blocks HCN and intrinsic light responses over different time courses raises serious doubts as to whether previous pharmacological results were compromised due to off-target effects of ZD. However, the current result needs to be interpreted with caution, as the somatic depolarization used to activate HCN may only recruit channels at proximal dendrites, while light may activate HCN on the distal dendrites, deeper in the retina, which may take a longer time to block.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. If penetration issues were to blame, we would expect to see at least partial reduction of the M2 and M4 photocurrents in 5-8 minutes of ZD7288. However, despite blockade of all detectable HCN current evoked by somatic hyperpolarization under these conditions, the photocurrent of M2 and M4 cells was completely unchanged. Additionally, the dendrites of both M4 and M2 ipRGCs stratify extremely close to RGC cell bodies, in sublamina 5 of the IPL. We would therefore expect similar drug penetration for the dendrites versus soma.</p><p>The major goal of the 20 minute versus 5-8 minute incubation of ZD7288 was to demonstrate that we are able to fully replicate previous results and provide a plausible explanation for their initial interpretation that HCN channels play a role in M2 and M4 phototransduction. On the other hand, T-type VGCC antagonists have no effect on M2 HCN tail current amplitude but nearly eliminates the in M2 photocurrent.</p><p>Importantly, we are not making these interpretations in isolation, but are considering them alongside multiple, converging lines of evidence against HCN involvement in M4 phototransduction including (1) the I-V slope and reversal potential of the M4 photocurrent at Ek (in whole cell and nucleated patch configurations and using multiple durations of light stimulation, See Sonoda et al. 2018 Figures 7C-D, Figure 7E-F, and Figure S6) (2) increased input resistance and excitability of M4 cells in light (See Figure 8 from Sonoda et al. 2018) and (3) blockade of the M4 photocurrent with a 2-pore potassium channel antagonist (Figure S7 from Sonoda et al., 2018), all of which are consistent with closure of potassium channels as the M4 transduction channel. For M2 cells, in addition to the results using ZD7288, we find that (1) the M2 photocurrent reverses at +19 mV, which is distinct from the extrapolated reversal of the M2 HCN tail current at -32 mV and (2) the M2 photocurrent is reduced by ~75% by application of the Ttype VGCC antagonist TTA-P2, application of the T-type VGCC antagonist Mibefradil, application of a cocktail of VGCC blockers, and by genetic knockout of TRPC3/6/7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Current-voltage analysis: Distinct IV relationships for M4 photocurrents and HCN tail currents are used as an independent assay to argue against the idea that melanopsin gates HCN (Figure 3) but this is problematic for several reasons:</p><p>– IVs for HCN and light-evoked responses are expected to be different. If melanopsin did modulate HCN, currents at more negative holding potentials would be expected to be smaller compared to more depolarized potentials (see Figure 4B Jiang et al., 2018).

We address each below.</p><p>Regarding HCN tail current I-V: We have made our language more precise around our intent to compare the reversal potential and permeation properties of M2 and M4 HCN channels versus photocurrent, and have removed discussion of the slope and magnitude of the tail current versus photocurrent. If melanopsin phototransduction opens HCN channels, the reversal potential of the photocurrents and extrapolated reversal potential of the HCN tail currents should align for each cell type because the reversal potential is a reflection of the permeation properties of a given channel(s). This was the main purpose of our including this analysis of the extrapolated reversal (as performed in Van Hook and Berson, 2010). In fact, the HCN tail current reversal potential does not align with that of the photocurrent either M4 or M2 ipRGCs, and we have edited figures and wording throughout the paper to focus on this point. Importantly, HCN currents would not, in practice, reverse at all, and the photocurrents of both M2 and M4 ipRGCs do in fact reverse. Importantly, these differences in reversal potential are considered alongside other pieces of supporting evidence. For example: (1) The M4 photocurrent is not blocked by ZD7288 (2) The photocurrent in TRPC3/6/7 KO M4 cells (where HCN would be the only contributor if it were the transduction channel) continues to show increasing inward current at positive potentials well beyond where HCN channels would be expected to conduct inward current and (3) The M4 photocurrent reverses at the calculated Ek, and has a detectable outward current below -90mV, which are both inconsistent with HCN conductance.</p><p>Regarding point 3 about reversal of M4 photocurrent at -100 mV: This data point was inadvertently left out when we replotted the original data from Sonoda et al., 2018, and we now include it in the graph. We apologize for the omission.</p><p>Regarding the shape of the M2 photocurrent I-V relationship compared to that of T-type VGCCs: Our evidence in M2 cells clearly demonstrate that the photocurrent is a mixed conductance, and so we would not expect the shape of the I-V relationship to match one type of channel. Importantly, we now provide functional evidence in Figure 9 —figure supplement 1 and 2 that M2 cells functionally express T-type VGCCs and have added additional pharmacological evidence in support of T-type VGCCs as an M2 phototransduction channel.</p><p>Regarding coupling: We have previously shown that the reversal potential of the M4 photocurrent in whole cell conditions falls at the calculated Ek and is identical to the reversal potential of the M4 photocurrent in a nucleated patch configuration where there is no coupling and the membrane can be most adequately voltage clamped (Sonoda et al., 2018, Figure 7). This argues against coupling or space clamp having a major impact on our M4 cell I-V results or interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Light modulation of HCN: HCN tail currents before and after 90 sec light exposure are similar (Figure 2 S1). However, HCN tails should be measured a few seconds after the onset of the light stimulus, when photo-currents are maximum.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. If there is a persistent photocurrent after 90 seconds of background light exposure, then it will be possible to assess whether that current is indeed through HCN channels. The ipRGC light response can persist for minutes to hours in all ipRGCs (Berson et al., 2002; Hattar et al., 2002; Wong et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2012; Emanuel and Do 2015). Indeed, we see that the amplitude of the holding current for M2 and M4 ipRGCs in these experiments at our baseline holding potential of -66 mV is more negative in all cells following 90 seconds of light exposure, indicating that the transduction channels in M4 and M2 ipRGCs are conducting inward current during this period of light exposure. We now include a quantification of this as new panels in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1.</p><p>We chose to make these measurements after the light response had reached a steady state because it would be difficult to ensure we are consistently capturing the maximum of the photocurrent for individual cells and to then apply the relatively long HCN voltage clamp protocol in that timeframe in a consistent way. This would lead to unpredictable variability and make it difficult to interpret our results. Given the difficulty of standardizing for when this expected maximum would occur, and because the photocurrent is highly dynamic in the initial stages (Figure 1 and 4), it would be difficult to compare and interpret differences in magnitude if the voltage protocol were applied earlier in the light response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Involvement of T-types: Like HCN, T-type CaVs inactivate at depolarized potentials making it difficult to envision how they could contribute to the long-lasting photoresponses. This section is interesting but needs to be better developed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point, and we thank the reviewer for requesting that we expand upon it. We have added in the discussion of a potential mechanism through which T-type VGCCs could mediate the sustained current observed in M2s in Lines 440-453.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an important work that adds to our understanding of ipRGCs phototransduction from a very reputable group in the field.

Our equipment is not able to produce a light stimulus that is brighter than that used in this study.
