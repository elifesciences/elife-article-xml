The Pacific oyster, <italic>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</italic>, is the most farmed bivalve mollusk in the world and is becoming a model species for invertebrate biology. Despite the extensive research on hemocytes, the immune cells of bivalves, their characterization remains elusive. Here, we were able to extensively characterize the diverse hemocytes and identified at least seven functionally distinct cell types and three hematopoietic lineages. A combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, quantitative cytology, cell sorting, functional assays, and pseudo-time analyses was used to deliver a comprehensive view of the distinct hemocyte types. This integrative analysis enabled us to reconcile molecular and cellular data and identify distinct cell types performing specialized immune functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. This study emphasized the need for more in depth studies of cellular immunity in mollusks and non-model invertebrates and set the ground for further comparative immunology studies at the cellular level.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Pacific oysters are vital to the ecosystem. They are also a popular seafood and are increasingly used in life science research as a model to represent animals without a backbone (known as invertebrates). However, these oysters are prone to deadly infections caused by bacteria and viruses.</p><p>Like humans, oysters and other invertebrates need an immune system to fight infections. Immune cells called hemocytes – which travel through the oyster’s body in a blood-like fluid called hemolymph – help eliminate bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing microbes by absorbing them, releasing toxic molecules, and producing natural antibiotics called antimicrobial peptides. However, it is still unclear how many types of hemocytes Pacific oysters have or what each type does.</p><p>De La Forest Divonne et al. used single-cell RNA sequencing and other cell biology techniques to study the genetic activity and anatomy of immune cells in the Pacific oyster. The experiments confirmed that the oysters have at least seven distinct types of hemocytes, each with a specialized immune role, for example, some eat microbes while others produce antimicrobial peptides. The team also mapped how immature hemocytes develop into mature hemocytes with these specialist roles.</p><p>This work provides the first detailed atlas of oyster immune cells and reveals how their immune system is organized and operates. A deeper understanding of oyster immune cells may guide the development of new strategies to reduce disease outbreaks in farmed or wild oysters. Before these benefits can be realized, future studies must test how each type of hemocyte responds to actual infections and explore whether targeted treatments or breeding programs can enhance the immune systems of farmed oysters.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Magallana gigas</kwd><kwd>Crassostrea gigas</kwd><kwd>hemocyte</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>innate

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Mollusca</italic> is the second largest invertebrate phylum, after Arthropoda, and the largest marine phylum, comprising approximately 23% of all known marine organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bar-On et al., 2018</xref>). Among them, bivalves exhibit a high diversity and a rich evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bayne, 2017</xref>). The Pacific oyster <italic>Crassostrea (Magallana) gigas</italic> (<italic>C. gigas</italic> - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thunberg, 1793</xref>) (NCBI:txid29159) is a sessile filter-feeding bivalve that thrives in a variety of stressful environments ranging from intertidal to deep-sea conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). It is a key species for the aquaculture industry worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">FAO, 2023</xref>). Several infectious diseases affect <italic>C. gigas</italic> at different life stages, which impacts its production. Given the significant socio-economic value of this species, there has been an increased focus on understanding and mitigating these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pernet et al., 2016</xref>). The causes of these mortalities can involve a variety of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites that can be responsible for the mortality events affecting <italic>C. gigas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfjorden et al., 2015</xref>). One of the most extensively researched infectious diseases is POMS (Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome), a polymicrobial disease responsible for mass mortalities of juvenile oysters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Lorgeril et al., 2018</xref>). The disease is triggered by the OsHV-1 μVar herpesvirus, which alters the immune defenses of oysters, allowing the colonization of opportunistic bacteria, including <italic>Vibrio</italic>, that cause hemocyte lysis and bacteremia, ultimately leading to animal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Lorgeril et al., 2018</xref>). Other bacterial pathogens have also been identified as a contributing factor in mass mortalities of adult Pacific oysters in several countries. The most notable is <italic>Vibrio aestuarianus</italic> which affects adult oysters in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Coyle et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mesnil et al., 2023</xref>). To date, the majority of oyster pathogens or opportunistic pathogens that have been characterized in detail have been found to subvert hemocyte defenses for their own benefit. These include the OsHV-1 μVar herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Oyanedel et al., 2023</xref>) and virulent <italic>Vibrio</italic> strains of the species <italic>Vibrio crassostreae</italic> and <italic>Vibrio tasmaniensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubio et al., 2019</xref>), <italic>Vibrio aestuarianus</italic> and <italic>Vibrio harveyi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Labreuche et al., 2010</xref>), highlighting the critical role of hemocytes in oyster immunity. The development of immune-based prophylactic treatments, such as immune-priming and immune-shaping, represents a promising avenue for enhancing the natural defenses of oysters against pathogens and increasing their survival rate. Nevertheless, the advancement of such therapies is still constrained by a dearth of knowledge regarding the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lafont et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fallet et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The study of hemocytes has a long history, dating back to the 1970s (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de la Ballina et al., 2022</xref>). Hemocytes are cellular effectors of the immune system. They engage in phagocytosis to engulf and destroy potential pathogens, neutralizing parasites by encapsulation, or preventing pathogen dissemination by cell aggregation and the release of extracellular DNA traps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bachère et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, they engage in the humoral response by releasing cytokines, antimicrobial peptides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which enable them to combat pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Escoubas et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to their role in oyster immunity, hemocytes have been implicated in numerous physiological processes, including shell repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mount et al., 2004</xref>), wound healing, nutrient transport, and environmental contaminant removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer, 1988</xref>). Despite this acquired knowledge, hemocytes remain an under-characterized population of circulating immune cells. The lack of a unified classification and of molecular and functional genetic tools hinders our understanding of lineage ontogeny and functional specialization. Several studies have proposed different classifications of hemocytes in the <italic>Ostreidae</italic> family, with 3–4 hemocyte types reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de la Ballina et al., 2022</xref>). These classifications are primarily based on either microscopic or flow cytometry analyses. In <italic>C. gigas</italic>, three primary hemocyte cell types have been classically identified: blast, hyalinocyte, and granulocyte cells. Blast-like cells are considered as undifferentiated hemocyte types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donaghy et al., 2010</xref>), hyalinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de la Ballina et al., 2020</xref>) seem to be more involved in wound repair, and granulocytes, more implicated in immune surveillance. The latter are considered as the main immunocompetent hemocyte types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). While the immune response of <italic>C. gigas</italic> has been extensively studied using classical transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2024</xref>) at the whole animal, tissue, or circulating hemocyte levels, these approaches have failed to consider the diversity of hemocyte cell types and lineages that underpin these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nguyen et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is still imperative to accurately describe the diversity of these cells, understand their ontogeny, and delineate cell lineages to comprehend their specific roles. The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has enabled the monitoring of global gene expression at the single-cell level with thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. This provides a unique opportunity to overcome these limitations and deepen our understanding of hemocyte diversity and function in bivalves. Recently scRNA-seq was used to provide a first molecular description of a hemocyte population in the oyster <italic>Crassostrea hongkongensis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Meng et al., 2022</xref>). However, in the absence of morphological and/or functional characterization studies, the authors could not deduce the hemocyte cell types to be matched to the transcriptomic profiles generated by scRNA-seq.</p><p>While numerous transcriptomic analyses have been conducted on <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes, none have adopted a single-cell approach. In this study, we present an integrative analysis of the diversity of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes at the single-cell level. To this end, we combined scRNA-seq from a pathogen-free adult oyster combined with cytological, cell fractionation, and functional assays. This approach allowed us to create a comprehensive transcriptomic, cytological and functional atlas of hemocyte cell types. Our scRNA-seq analyses identified seven distinct transcriptomic populations and functional annotation revealed distinct populations with specific functions, including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, energetic metabolism, enhanced transcription, translation, and cell division. Quantitative cytology enabled the identification of seven morphologically distinct hemocyte cell types, which allowed us to reconcile molecular and cytological data. Density gradients were used to separate hemocyte cell types and qPCR or functional assay analyses were performed to validate cell type-specific markers. By employing this integrated approach, we could identify one type of hyalinocyte, two types of blasts, and four types of granular cells. Furthermore, we identified cell types that perform antimicrobial functions through phagocytosis, ROS production, copper accumulation, and expression of antimicrobial peptides. Finally, trajectory analysis of scRNA-seq data combined with functional analysis revealed distinct differentiation pathways that may control hemocyte ontology and differentiation processes. Based on these findings, we propose a more comprehensive and up-to-date classification of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes, with a more accurate description of the different cell types, their potential ontology, and a precise description of their sub-functionalization.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals seven distinct transcriptomic clusters of circulating immune cells in oysters</title><p>Oysters are known to exhibit a high degree of individual genetic polymorphism, including Copy Number Variation (CNV) and Presence Absence Variation (PAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rosa et al., 2015</xref>).

Of the 127,959,215 reads, 97% showed a valid barcode and 89.2% were successfully mapped to the genome with a saturation of 75.6%. A total of 2937 cells were profiled, yielding a median of 1578 genes and 4412 unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) per cell among the 23,841 total genes detected, with a sequencing saturation of 75.6% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Secondary bioinformatic data processing was conducted using the Seurat R package (version 4.3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Satija et al., 2015</xref>). The dataset was filtered to remove data corresponding to empty droplets or cell doublets. Cells with a gene number between 750 and 4000 and less than 5% mitochondrial genes were retained. After quality control processing, 120 cells corresponding to empty droplets and cell doublets were removed, and 2817 cells were processed for data normalization. Finally, we performed linear dimensional reduction and clustering on the 3000 most variable genes from 2817 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dimension reduction and clustering led to identifying seven transcriptomic clusters, within which hemocytes were distributed. These seven different clusters represented 27.6, 23.1, 17.8, 16.9, 7, 4.6, and 3% of the total cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For each transcriptomic cluster, the heatmap displays the top 10 positively enriched marker genes identified by Seurat’s differential expression analysis, highlighting cluster-specific overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Average Log2FC values and percentage of expression in each cluster relative to all other clusters were calculated for the ten most differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Clear transcriptomic cell clusters were detected as well as specific gene markers for each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Only the transcriptomic signature of cluster 4 was less contrasting than that of the other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis of <italic>C.</italic><italic>gigas</italic> circulating hemocytes reveals seven transcriptomic cell clusters.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the scRNA-seq 10 X Genomics Chromium microfluidic technology and bioinformatics processing workflow used.

Cluster 1 demonstrated enrichment in viral processing and endocytosis. Additionally, it demonstrated enrichment in pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathways. Clusters 1 and 3 exhibited a distinctive enrichment in carbohydrate metabolism and endocytosis. In particular, cluster 3 exhibited enriched transcripts associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and TCA cycle activities. Cluster 4 was enriched in protein synthesis, including transcription (spliceosome, ribosome, nucleocytoplasmic transport, and mRNA surveillance pathway) folding, sorting, and degradation of protein pathways. Clusters 2, 5, and 6 exhibited a shared signature of enrichment in ribosome-related genes. Cluster 2 demonstrated a specific enrichment in motor protein-coding genes responsible for cell motility and xenobiotic metabolism. Remarkably, clusters 1, 3, 4, and 5 exhibited enriched oxidative phosphorylation transcripts, whereas the transcripts of cluster 7 were enriched in vesicular trafficking and endo-lysosomal pathways (endocytosis, endosome, phagosome, lysosome, auto, and mitophagy).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peñaloza et al., 2021</xref>), provided GO annotations for 18,750 out of 30,724 genes (61%). In order to improve upon these baseline annotations, we used the <italic>C. gigas</italic> genome (Genbank reference GCA_902806645.1) and the associated gff3 annotation file from the Roslin Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peñaloza et al., 2021</xref>). Using the Orson pipeline (see Materials and methods), these files were used to extract and process the longest CDSs for GO-term annotation, and we then re-annotated each predicted protein by sequence homology, assigning putative functions and improving downstream GO-term analyses. Of the 30,724 extracted CDSs, 22,462 were annotated (GO-terms and sequence description), yielding an annotation percentage of 73.1%.

The scRNA-seq-based analysis identified seven distinct transcriptomic profiles for each cell cluster, thereby shedding light on greater heterogeneity and functional diversity of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes than previously described. Cluster 1, comprising 27.6% of cells, is characterized by GO-terms related to myosin complex, lamellipodium, membrane, and actin cytoskeleton remodeling, as well as phosphotransferase activity. This is evidenced by an enrichment in actin nucleation, phosphorus metabolic process and signal transduction BP, actin filament binding and phosphotransferase activity MF and lamellipodium, and actin-based cell projection CC. Cluster 2, comprising 23.1% of cells, has an increased translation activity, as indicated by enrichment in BP, MF, and CC terms related to rRNA binding, cytoplasmic translation, maturation of LSU-rRNA, and ribosomes, respectively. Cluster 3, representing 17.8% of cells, shows enrichment in cellular oxidation and actin nucleation, as evidenced by an enrichment in BP and MF related to oxidoreductase activities acting on metal ions, electron transfer and cellular oxidation, and CC related to cytochromes, oxidoreductase complex, and mitochondrial protein-containing complexes. Cluster 4, representing 16.9% of cells, has transcriptomic signatures reminiscent of spliceosome assembly, RNA maturation, and macromolecules biosynthesis (BP related to biosynthetic process, macromolecules biosynthesis process, and spliceosome assembly, MF related to RNA and ssRNA binding and translation initiation, and CC related to ribosomes, and ribonucleoprotein complexes). Cluster 5, comprising 7% of cells, demonstrates enrichment in structural molecule activity, hydrolase regulation, and ubiquitin-like protein transferase activity, as evidenced by its BP, MF, and CC related to ribosome and midbody localization. Cluster 6, comprising 4.6% of cells, is characterized by a specific nucleosome organization, translation, and biosynthetic processes, with related BP, MF, and CC tied to nucleolus, ribosomes, ribonucleoprotein complex, and rRNA binding. Cluster 7, representing a mere 3% of cells, is characterized by multivesicular body sorting, vacuolar transport, vacuole organization, and positive regulation of proteolysis, with related BP, MF, and CC of the ESCRT machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Seven morphologically distinct immune cell types are identified by quantitative cytology and transcriptomic markers</title><p>Cytological studies were conducted using MCDH staining to better characterize the diversity of circulating hemocytes in <italic>C. gigas</italic>.

Luminol luminescence peaked 25 min after exposure of hemocytes (isolated from total hemolymph) to zymosan, indicating a robust oxidative burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The production of ROS was dependent on a NADPH oxidase, as it was completely inhibited by the NADPH oxidase-specific inhibitor apocynin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To ascertain which hemocyte types were involved in ROS production we tested Percoll density-sorted hemocytes for oxidative burst activity. Fractions 2 and 3 displayed higher oxidative burst activity than the other fractions. The burst intensity of fraction 3 was twice that of total hemocytes, and fraction 2 also exhibited significantly increased burst activity. In contrast, fraction 4 showed a significant decrease in oxidative burst, and no activity was observed for fractions 1, 6, and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These results indicate that NADPH-dependent oxidative burst activity is carried out by fractions enriched in macrophage-like (ML) cells and blast-like cells (ABL and BBL).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that granular cells can produce ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, we found that small granule cells collected in fraction 7 could not produce ROS through an oxidative burst. To identify which type of hemocyte from blast-like cells and macrophage-like cells produces ROS within a few minutes after exposure to zymosan, ROS production was investigated using NitroBlueTetrazolium (NBT) reduction to stain hemocytes directly. Correlative microscopic analysis using MCDH staining can then be conducted after the NBT reduction reaction. Macrophage-like cells were strongly and significantly stained by NBT reduction (33.2 %) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref><bold>, panels a &amp; d</bold>). In contrast, some small granule cells were lightly stained by NBT reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Blast-like cells, big granule cells, vesicular cells, and hyalinocytes were never NBT stained, confirming that these cell types were not involved in ROS production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Taken together, these observations demonstrate that small granule cells and macrophage-like cells are the two professional phagocytes among hemocytes. However, only macrophage-like cells are capable of oxidative burst upon exposure to zymosan. In light of these new functional data, we further analyzed the expression level of NADPH-oxidase-related enzymes in the scRNA-seq dataset. The cells in cluster 1 predominantly expressed two NADPH oxidase isoforms (gene numbers G34908 and G23852) compared to other clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Furthermore, this cluster expresses macrophage-related genes, including the macrophage-expressed gene 1 protein (G30226) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), along with maturation factors for dual oxidase, an enzyme involved in peroxide formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), supporting its designation as macrophage-like based on functional characteristics. Collectively, these data indicated that cells of transcriptomic cluster 1 corresponded to macrophage-like cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Small granule cells and big granule cells accumulate intracellular copper</title><p>The effects of copper on oyster hemocytes have been studied extensively due to its abundance in polluted marine environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischer, 1988</xref>).

This prompted us to investigate which hemocyte types are involved in copper metabolism. To this end, total hemocytes were isolated from naive oysters and stained with rhodanine to reveal copper storage in cells, and a total of 1562 cells were examined across three independent experiments. Rhodanine staining revealed that 33%+/-2% of small granule cells and 30%+/-10% of big granule cells exhibited a specific reddish/brown staining indicative of a high concentration of copper in their granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results provide functional evidence that small granule cells (SGCs) are specialized in metal homeostasis in addition to phagocytosis, as suggested by the scRNA-seq data identifying cluster 3. Specifically, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed an upregulation of copper transport-related genes, including G4790 (a copper transporter) with a 2.7 log2FC and a pct ratio of 42, reinforcing the role of SGCs in copper homeostasis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Antimicrobial peptides are expressed by agranular cells, blasts, and hyalinocytes</title><p>Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have long been studied for their role in the invertebrate humoral immune response.

The aim was to ascertain whether different hemocyte cell types expressed distinct AMPs. However, due to the limited sequencing depth, the scRNA-seq analysis was not sensitive enough to reveal AMP expression. This limitation was addressed by investigating AMP expression through RT-qPCR on Percoll density-fractionated hemocytes.

Differentiation pathway 1 leads to hyalinocytes (H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This transition is characterized by the downregulation of 11 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), two of which are transcription factors (G31522 and G7003). The hyalinocyte cluster was also characterized by the overexpression of genes involved in cell contractility (G11418, G22824, G153, and G718). Differentiation pathway 2 leads to cells of cluster 5 and is characterized by the upregulation of about 26 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), one gene related to metalloendopeptidase activity (G15477) was downregulated, a GTPase IMAP gene (G29323) and three transcription factors were upregulated (G7003, G11013, and G4646) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Differentiation pathway 3 leads to cells of cluster 6 and is characterized by the upregulation of 22 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Three fibrinogen-related protein genes (G20176, G20226, and G20227) and a GATA-binding factor (G31054) were up-regulated whereas a metalloendopeptidase gene (G15477) was downregulated. The severin gene displayed a transient increased expression (G28864) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The pathways between clusters 4, 5, and 6 found by Monocle3 analysis were pseudo-temporally short and few specific markers were identified, suggesting that they were transcriptionally close. Differentiation pathway 4 leads to vesicular cells (VC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) where a large number of genes were activated to give rise to these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Four genes were specifically downexpressed in VC (G15477, G25512, G2213, and G29172). Interestingly, 6 genes encoding potential transcription factors were upregulated in this lineage (G30997, G10637, G1067, G13555, G2123, and G27827). Differentiation pathway 5 leads to macrophage-like cells (ML), and is characterized by the underexpression of 41 genes and the overexpression of 20 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Among the 41 genes, six are putative transcription factors (G2123, G10637, G13555, G27827, G1067, and G11196) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Finally, we can outline a lineage ending in small granule cells (SGC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). This pathway involved cluster 4 (immature cells), VC, ML, and SGC and was characterized by the downregulation of 27 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>), including five potential transcription factors (G10637, G13555, G27827, G1067, and G2123). SGC showed a distinct transcriptomic signature with 61 overexpressed genes, including three transcription factors (G1708, G21091, and G30622). Based on these findings, we postulate that immature cluster 4 cells possess pluripotent potential and can give rise to four terminally differentiated cell types: cluster 5 and 6 cells, hyalinocytes and small granule cells, and two other transient hemocyte cell types: vesicular cells and macrophage-like cells.

Given the established role of transcription factors as master regulators of cell differentiation and their utility in delineating cell lineages, we investigated the combinatorial expression patterns of transcription factors among the different transcriptomic cell clusters. Based on GO-terms annotation, 28 different sequences corresponding to transcription factors were isolated from the scRNA-seq dataset. The transcription factor function was confirmed by manual annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref> shows the average expression profiles of these factors in the different clusters. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref> illustrates their expression levels in single cells.

We also identified transcription factors that were specifically expressed in the different transcriptomic clusters: CgSPDEF, CgSOCS3, CgFOS, and CgTFEB were specific for vesicular cells, CgSOX8, CgXBOX, and CgELF3 were specific for small granule cells, CgCR3L1 and CgTAL1 for hyalinocytes, and CgJUN, CgKLF5, CgKLF6, and CgCREM for macrophage-like cells. Eight additional transcription factors were specifically identified in cluster 6 (CgGATA3, CgPU.1, and CgELF2), cluster 5 (CgELF2, CgELK3, and CgIRF1) and cluster 4 (CgTAL1 and CgFOS1). These data potentially define four distinct hematopoietic lineages originating from one type of immature blast cells and give rise to hyalinocytes, SGC (via VC and ML), or two distinct differentiated blast-like cells. We also identified a combination of transcription factors specific to lineages and cell types that are potential master regulators of cell fate during hematopoiesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings of our study represent a significant advancement in our understanding of the functional diversity and lineages of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hemocytes. Single-cell RNA-seq and cytology were combined to identify seven distinct hemocyte transcriptomic cell clusters and an equivalent number of morphotypes. These include four granular cell types (big granule cells, macrophage-like cells, small granule cells, and vesicular cells), two distinct blast-like cells (basophilic and acidophilic blast-like cells), and one agranular epithelial-like cell type (hyalinocytes). A significant challenge was to identify correlations between transcriptomic and cytological data to fully define each cytological cell type. This challenge was overcome by combining multiple approaches, including isopycnic Percoll density gradient fractionation combined with the analysis of transcriptomic markers expression, and functional assays including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, copper accumulation, AMP expression, and finally pseudotime analysis of gene expression. These results confirmed the historical classification of the 3 main cell groups: blasts, hyalinocytes, and granular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de la Ballina et al., 2022</xref>) and deepened our understanding of the functional specificities of poorly characterized cell types. In particular, we identified distinct transcriptional and functional subtypes among blasts and granular cells with complementary immune specialization and lineage relationships between cells.</p><p>One significant outcome of the present study is the identification of cell types involved in antimicrobial activities, including phagocytosis, intracellular copper accumulation, an oxidative burst, and antimicrobial peptide production. These cell types have been extensively studied for their role in antibacterial and antiparasitic defenses, as they are found in the large majority of invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Escoubas et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, there has been considerable debate surrounding the cell types specialized for these critical immune functions in bivalves, particularly oysters. Moreover, the involvement of the different hemocyte subpopulations in immune functions is not yet fully understood.</p><p>Our findings reveal that the macrophage-like (ML) cells and small granule cells (SGC) are the sole hemocyte cell types that function as professional phagocytes, as demonstrated against Zymosan or <italic>Vibrio</italic>. These two distinct cell types could be distinguished functionally. First, two distinct transcriptomic clusters were identified for each cell type (Cluster 1 for ML/BGC and Cluster 3 for SGC). Second, only ML induced a measurable oxidative burst. Third, only SGC accumulated intracellular copper in specific granules. Interestingly, our scRNA-seq analysis indicates that SGC (cluster 3) expresses the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) gene G3876, annotated as a Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein with a Log2 fold change (Log2FC) of 0.77 linking them to scavenger receptor-mediated pathogen recognition and clearance. This aligns with findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2019</xref>, who demonstrated significant expansion and dynamic regulation of SRCR genes in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The pseudotime trajectory linking macrophage-like (ML) and SGC cells suggests a potential developmental relationship within the granular cell lineage; however, this hypothesis requires further validation. The notion that ML could serve as a precursor for SGC may seem counterintuitive. However, this is not an isolated phenomenon among invertebrate hemocytes. For instance, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hultmark and Andó, 2022</xref>), some populations of professional phagocytes, the sessile plasmatocytes, give rise to crystal cells or lamellocytes that are morphologically and functionally distinct from plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, the existence of multiple professional phagocytes in the oyster is reminiscent of vertebrate macrophages, polynuclear neutrophils, and dendritic cells, which possess distinct functional specializations, including efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boada-Romero et al., 2020</xref>), oxidative burst, NETosis, or antigen presentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dale et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The characterization of professional phagocytes in oysters is of particular importance for a deeper understanding of oyster-<italic>Vibrio</italic> interactions during pathogenesis. Some of the most extensively studied oyster pathogens, including strains of <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> and <italic>V. aestuarianus francensis,</italic> harbor virulence traits that enable them to disrupt the phagocytic activity of hemocytes during pathogenesis. For instance, <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> behaves as a facultative intracellular pathogen with phagocytosis-dependent cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubio et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, both <italic>V. tasmaniensis</italic> and <italic>V. aestuarianus</italic> display resistance to copper toxicity through CopA and CusA/B transporters. This trait is essential for the survival and virulence of these pathogens in oysters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mesnil et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vanhove et al., 2016</xref>). Since SGCs have been demonstrated to be professional phagocytes with copper-rich granules, the cellular interactions between SGCs and these vibrios are likely to be critical during the antibacterial host response and pathogenesis. ML are phagocytes that possess a very potent NADPH-oxidase-dependent oxidative burst. The oxidative burst is a rapid and potent antimicrobial response observed in professional phagocytes, such as polynuclear neutrophils in mammals. It is worth noting that NADPH-dependent ETosis has been observed in <italic>C. gigas</italic> in a manner analogous to that observed in human neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poirier et al., 2014</xref>). This cell death is characterized by the projection of DNA extracellular traps that capture and kill some pathogens like <italic>Vibrio</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poirier et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that ML may also be involved in ETosis.</p><p>The specialized functions of the two other types of granular cells, the BGCs and the VCs, remain unclear. Despite the difficulty in identifying a specific scRNAseq transcriptomic cluster for BGCs, the level of expression of laccase 24 was found to be higher in a particular subcluster among ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>), and pseudo-time analysis highlighted the same subcluster as an alternative differentiation state among ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The enrichment of transcripts involved in oxido-reduction pathways, particularly laccase 24, aligns with their potential role in melanization and response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaroogian and Yevich, 1993</xref>). While melanin-like deposits have been observed in some cases of infestation by the parasites <italic>Martelia</italic> or B<italic>onamia</italic> in the Sydney rock oyster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allam and Raftos, 2015</xref>), this mechanism is not as robust as that described in arthropods, which perform melanization through a prophenoloxidase activation cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nakhleh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amparyup et al., 2013</xref>). In many marine invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaroogian and Yevich, 1993</xref>), a type of hemocyte known as Brown Cells could be related to the BGCs described here. When observed without any staining (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), their big granules with a yellow to dark brown content appear to align with the historical description of brown cells that often infiltrate tissues (like gills) in animals exposed to polluted waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zaroogian and Yevich, 1993</xref>). It has, therefore, been theorized that these cells are involved in detoxification processes. Our pseudotime analysis indicates that they likely originate from ML, with limited phagocytosis activity and a specialized role in melanization and potentially heavy metal detoxification, as evidenced by rhodanine staining showing copper accumulation in some of their granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Further studies are recommended to clarify the role of BGCs, particularly in the context of parasitic infestation or exposure to toxic stresses. Lastly, VC are granular cells that remain to be functionally characterized. Their transcriptomic profile suggests strong intracellular vesicular trafficking and autophagy activity. However, our functional assays did not reveal any particular immune-related function. Their clear granules appear auto-fluorescent when illuminated with UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) but the biochemical nature of the content of these granules remains to be characterized. As they also appear as cell intermediates along the granular cell differentiation pathway in pseudotime analysis, they could represent functionally immature precursors of the other three granular cell types, much like promyelocytes which possess specific azurophilic granules but are functionally immature precursors during granulocyte differentiation in humans. However, the enrichment of autophagy-related transcripts in VC calls for further investigation into a potential role in antiviral immunity, as autophagy has been suggested to play a role in the response to OsHV-1 virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Picot et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Hyalinocytes are a homogenous cell type, with only one morphotype matching one transcriptomic cluster. It can be deduced from pseudotime analysis that they originate from a specific and very different differentiation pathway than the granular cells. According to the literature, hyalinocytes are involved in the early stages of inflammation and can infiltrate wounds and interact with foreign particles. In the flat oyster <italic>Ostrea edulis</italic>, they contribute to shell production and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de la Ballina et al., 2022</xref>). In the Sydney rock oyster, they play a role in cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aladaileh et al., 2007</xref>), while in <italic>C. virginica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rifkin et al., 1969</xref>) they contribute to encapsulation, reminiscent of lamellocytes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Our results suggest an important role of AMP expression in the immune response. Indeed, <italic>Cg-</italic>BigDefs, which participate in the control of oyster microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De San Nicolas et al., 2022</xref>), were found to be expressed in both hyalinocytes and blast-like cells. Moreover, hyalinocytes from the oyster <italic>O. edulis</italic> have been shown to express the AMP Myticin C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de la Ballina et al., 2021</xref>), which lends further support to this immune function. Among the AMPs, we also found that Cg-BPI and <italic>Cg-</italic>Defh, are more expressed in BBL, ABL than in other cell types. These results are somewhat unexpected, given the prevailing assumption that AMPs are stored in granules of granular cells, rather than agranular cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bachère et al., 2015</xref>). These results highlight the necessity to reassess the role of specific agranular cell types in the active production of humoral immune effectors. Nevertheless, further staining approaches would be necessary to confirm these transcriptomic results. Our findings suggest that hyalinocytes and/or the blast-like cells may be a cellular target of the OsHV-1 virus, the causal agent of POMS, which dampens the expression of certain AMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Lorgeril et al., 2018</xref>), thereby inducing bacterial dysbiosis. It is still unclear whether this is due to a decreased expression of AMPs and/or inhibition of immature blast cell differentiation involved in the renewal of agranular cell types.</p><p>It should be noted that the complexity of blast-like cells could not be fully elucidated in this study, as three clusters and only two morphotypes were identified. Cell fractionation using Percoll gradient failed to yield pure blast-enriched fractions (ABL and BBL), preventing precise functional characterization. The enrichment in transcripts of the transcription synthesis degradation continuum aligns with the definition of undifferentiated blast-type cells and with the basophilic staining obtained in MCDH for BBL cells, as immature blast cells are characterized by a basophilic cytoplasmic staining in humans. However, our results show that certain blast populations can produce AMPs, suggesting that these cells may also play a role in the production of humoral effectors. Ultimately, it remains unclear whether these circulating immature cells are indeed the stem cells from which all hemocytes originate.</p><p>In the animal kingdom, the innate immune system relies on specialized cells derived from pluripotent precursors through hematopoiesis. Transcription factors in particular have been found to exhibit a high degree of conservation throughout the animal kingdom, from invertebrates to vertebrates. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional differentiation of bivalves are only partially available or understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pila et al., 2016</xref>). Recent research has indicated the potential existence of hemocyte progenitors, also known as blast-like cells in several bivalve species. These include clams, mussels, scallops, marine mussels, freshwater mussels, oysters, pearl oysters, and wing shells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pila et al., 2016</xref>). However, various models for hematopoiesis in bivalves have been proposed and extensively debated without a clear consensus or definitive proof. Single-cell RNA sequencing and pseudotime analysis have enabled us to propose a refined model of hematopoiesis at an unprecedented level of detail. In this model, the different types of hemocytes are likely produced through four differentiation pathways that originate from a common progenitor. One pathway results in the formation of agranular hyalinocytes, while another independent pathway gives rise to the granular cells, including VC, ML, BGC, and SGC. Furthermore, two additional differentiation pathways have been identified that may lead to terminally differentiated blast-like cells. The differentiation of mature hemocytes involves the establishment of lineage-specific gene expression profiles, which rely on transcription factors to modulate the expression of their target genes. Our study identified a combination of transcription factors that are differentially expressed during <italic>C. gigas</italic> hematopoiesis and are specific to differentiation stages and cell lineages, including many well-known hematopoietic transcription factors such as GATA, PU-1, TAL1, and SOX factors, which are positioned in this model of <italic>C. gigas</italic> hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Bruijn and Dzierzak, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scott et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bergiers et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Nevertheless, we did not detect any canonical stem or progenitor cell populations in our dataset, underscoring the need for future investigations - potentially involving immunological challenges and lineage-tracing assays - to clarify whether proliferative cells circulate in the hemolymph or instead reside primarily in tissue compartments.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed hemocyte ontology in <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> based on the transcriptomic, cytological, and functional results obtained.</title><p>Cells are colored according to the same color code as the transcriptomic clusters.

Our study emphasizes functional specialization in <italic>C. gigas</italic>, focusing on phagocytosis, oxidative stress responses, and vesicular trafficking, likely reflecting differences in transcriptomic and functional characterization methodologies. Moreover, the identification of conserved transcription factors such as Tal1, Sox, Runx, and GATA in both datasets underscores the evolutionary conservation of hematopoiesis pathways across metazoans. While direct comparisons between scRNA-seq datasets are hindered by differing annotation frameworks, parallels can still be drawn with studies in other invertebrates. For example, shrimp and crayfish scRNAseq datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xin and Zhang, 2023</xref>) describe hemocytes with immune-activated states and integrin-related markers, respectively, while <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>) exhibits clusters with high ribosomal activity and transcription factors such as bHLH and myc. These findings highlight both the shared molecular foundations and species-specific differences that define hemocyte diversity and specialization.</p><p>This study significantly advances our understanding of bivalve immunity, especially in comparison to arthropods. By introducing a standardized reference hemocytogram for oysters using MCDH staining, defining cell type-specific markers and key transcription factors likely involved in cell fate determination, as well as clarifying the functions of different hemocytes, we have paved the way for future in-depth studies. Moreover, the identified clusters represent functionally and transcriptionally distinct cell populations under the conditions studied, yet they may reflect dynamic states rather than fixed subtypes, thereby acknowledging the potential for hemocyte populations to transition between states in response to environmental or physiological changes—even under homeostatic conditions. This will facilitate further studies of the oyster’s immune response to various biotic and abiotic stress at the cellular level. Improved comprehension of antiviral and antibacterial responses in bivalves, along with an enhanced understanding of immune priming and immune memory at the cellular level in bivalves, will benefit health and population management practices for sustainable aquaculture production. These findings will also contribute to the broader field of evolutionary immunology by enabling comparative studies and elucidating the diversification of immune cells and immunity-related genes in a protostome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Magallana gigas</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ISA oysters</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ifremer Standardized Oysters - La tremblade - France</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">GPS coordinates: 45.7981624714465,–1.150171788447683</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Magallana gigas</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild Type oysters</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Local producer located in the Thau Lagoon</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">GPS coordinates: 43.44265228308842, 3.6359883059292057</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain (<italic>Vibrio Tasmaniensis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bacteria LMG20012</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">From the laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">LMG20012</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 X Genomics Single Cell 3' Reagent Kits v2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10 X genomics</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#CG00052</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Copper Stain Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SkyTek, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#CSK2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNeasy kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Qiagen, the Netherlands</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#74104</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Superscript IV kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#18090050</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Percoll</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cytiva, Sweden</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#17089101</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Luminol</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Merck, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#123072–5 G</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Zymosan</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Merck, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#Z4250</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NitroBlueTetrazolium</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Merck, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#N5514</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MCDH (Micro Chromatic Detection for Hematology)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cellavision, Sweden</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#313590, #313570, #313560 and #313600</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Automatic functional annotation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/orson">https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/orson</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Orson<break/>Nextflow script</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">STAR v2.7.10 ScRNA-seq aligner</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR">https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR</ext-link>;

Zymosan was added at a 4:1 MOI and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min on a rocking shaker. Then, 50 µL of each sample was plated onto glass coverslips and observed under a transmitted light microscope LEICA DMR with a 40 x magnification objective (Leica AG, Germany) to count NBT-positive cells.

Seven different hemolymph samples were used for cytological analysis. Oysters were provided by our local supplier and approximately 300 hemocytes were counted per sample. Seven independent experiments were performed for Percoll density gradient separation. A Tukey test was used to evaluate the statistical difference between the proportions of hemocyte types. The phagocytic capacity of hemocytes was tested in three independent experiments and statistical differences were evaluated using the Tukey test for both the phagocytic capacity between hemocyte types and the number of particles per phagocyte. Finally, oxidative burst capacity was tested 3 times on Percoll-separated hemocytes. The Tukey test was also used to assess statistical differences between conditions.

Three categories of hemocytes were described previously in this species (i.e. blast, hyalinocyte and granulocytes). Based on scRNAseq data, the authors identified 7 hemocyte clusters presenting distinct transcriptional signatures. Using Kegg pathway enrichment and RBGOA, the authors determined the main molecular features of the clusters. In parallel, using cytologic markers, the authors classified 7 populations of hemocytes (i.e. ML, H, BBL, ABL, SGC, BGC, and VC) presenting distinct sizes, nucleus sizes, acidophilic/basophilic, presence of pseudopods, cytoplasm/nucleus ratio and presence of granules. Then, the authors compared the phenotypic features with potential transcriptional signatures seen in the scRNAseq. The hemocytes were separated in a density gradient to enrich for specific subpopulations. The cell composition of each cell fraction was determined using cytologic markers and the cell fractions were analysed by quantitative PCR targeting major cluster markers (two per cluster). With this approach, the authors could assign cluster 7 to VC, cluster 2 to H, and cluster 3 to SGC. The other clusters did not show a clear association with this experimental approach. Using phagocytic assays, ROS, and copper monitoring, the authors showed that ML and SGC are phagocytic, ML produces ROS, and SGC and BGC accumulate copper. Then with the density gradient/qPCR approach, the authors identified the populations expressing anti-microbial peptides (ABL, BBL, and H). At last, the authors used Monocle to predict differentiation trajectories for each subgroup of hemocytes using cluster 4 as the progenitor subpopulation.</p><p>The manuscript provides a comprehensive characterisation of the diversity of circulating immune cells found in Pacific oysters.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The combination of scRNAseq, cytologic markers and gradient based hemocyte sorting offers an integrative view of the immune cell diversity.</p><p>Hemocytes represent a very plastic cell population that has key roles in homeostatic and challenged conditions. Grasping the molecular features of these cells at the single-cell level will help understand their biology.</p><p>This type of study may help elucidate the diversification of immune cells in comparative studies and evolutionary immunology.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>Several figures show inconsistency leading to erroneous conclusions and some conclusions are poorly supported.

It may notably explain why the term phagosome is enriched in cluster 7, while experimental data indicate that cluster 7 is not phagocytic. In addition, the authors mentioned in the 1st response to reviewer that they would include DotPlot to illustrate the specificity of the genes corresponding to the main GO terms. This should notably include the ribosomal genes found enriched in cluster 4, which constitute the basis used by the authors to call cluster 4 the progenitor cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding our chosen log2FC threshold (0.25) for GO term enrichment. To assess the robustness of our approach, we tested more stringent thresholds (e.g., 0.5) and verified that our overall interpretations remain consistent. However, we acknowledge that certain GO terms, such as phagosome, may appear in clusters that are not primarily phagocytic. This is likely due to the fact that genes involved in vesicle trafficking, endo-lysosomal compartments and intracellular degradation processes overlap with those classically associated with phagocytosis.</p><p>Therefore, the KEGG-based enrichment of phagosome in cluster 7 does not necessarily imply active phagocytosis but could instead reflect these alternative vesicular processes. As we show, cluster 7 correspond to vesicular cells, and as seen in cytology we named these cells after their very high content of vesicular structures. As functional annotation based solely on transcriptomic data can sometimes lead to overinterpretations, we emphasize the importance of biological validation, which we have partially addressed through functional assays in this study.</p><p>Regarding the specificity of ribosomal gene expression in cluster 4, we analyzed the distribution of ribosomal genes expressed across all clusters, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1-J. This analysis demonstrates that cluster 4 is specifically enriched in ribosome-related genes, reinforcing its characterization as a transcriptionally active population. Given that ribosomal gene expression is a key feature often associated with proliferative or metabolically active cells, these findings support our initial interpretation that cluster 4 may represent an undifferentiated or progenitor-like population.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s suggestion to include a DotPlot to further illustrate the specificity of these genes in cluster 4. However, we believe that Supplementary Figure S1-J already effectively demonstrates this enrichment by presenting the percentage of ribosomal genes per cluster. A DotPlot representation would primarily convey the same information in a different format, but without providing additional insight into the specificity of ribosomal gene expression within cluster 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The lineage analysis is highly speculative and based on weak evidences. Initiating the hemocyte lineage to C4 is based on rRNA expression levels. C6 would constitute a better candidate, notably with the expression of PU-1, ELF2 and GATA3 that regulate progenitors differentiation in mammals (doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00228, doi:10.1128/microbiolspec.mchd-0024-2, doi: 10.1098/rsob.180152) while C4 do not display any specific transcription factors (Figure 7I). In addition, the representation and interpretation of the transcriptome dynamics in the different lineages are erroneous. There are major inconsistencies between the data shown in the heatmaps Fig7C-H, Fig S10 and the dotplot in Fig7I. For example, Gata3 (G31054) and CgTFEB (G30997) illustrate the inconsistency. Fig S10C show GATA3 going down from cluster 4 to cluster 6 while Fig 7I show an increase level of expression in 6 compared to 4. CgTFEB (G30997) decrease from C4 to VC in Fig 7F while it increases according to Fig 7I. At last, Figure 7D: the umap show transition from C4 to C5 while the heatmap mention C4 to C6 I believe there is a mix up with Figure 7E.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize for the inconsistencies noted between the different panels of Figure 7. These discrepancies resulted from using an incorrect matrix dataset during the initial representation. To address this issue, we have fully reprocessed the data and now provide a corrected and improved depiction of gene expression dynamics along the pseudotime trajectory. We are grateful to the reviewer for having help us to correct theses mistakes.</p><p>In the revised version, we offer a comprehensive and consistent representation of expression level variations for key genes identified by the Monocle3 algorithm. Supplementary Figure S10 now presents the average expression variation of these significant genes as a function of pseudotime. Based on this dataset, we carefully selected representative genes to construct panels C to H of Figure 7, ensuring coherence across all figures. These updated panels show both average expression levels and the percentage of expressing cells along the pseudotime trajectory, providing a clearer interpretation of transcriptomic dynamics.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s helpful feedback regarding our lineage analysis and the suggestion that cluster 6 might be a more appropriate progenitor based on the expression of mammalian-like transcription factors such as PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3. Below, we clarify our rationale for choosing cluster 4 as the root of the pseudotime and discuss the functional implications of the identified transcription factors.</p><p>We can hypothesize that clusters 4, 5, or 6 could each potentially represent early progenitor-like states, as these three clusters are transcriptionally close (Lines 539-541). These clusters have not yet been conclusively identified in terms of classical hemocyte morphology, and they appear to arise from ABL- or BBL-type cells. Our decision to root the pseudotime at cluster 4 was motivated by its strong expression of core transcription and translation genes, suggesting a particular stage of translation activity that was not observed for cluster 5 or cluster 6. Cluster 5 and 6 may correspond to a similar population of cells, most probably Blast-Like cells at different stages of cell cycle or differentiation engagement.</p><p>Although cluster 6 expresses PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3, which are known regulators of haematopoietic progenitor differentiation in vertebrates, it is essential to highlight that structural homology does not necessarily imply functional equivalence. Moreover, the expression of PU-1, ELF2, and GATA3 does not strictly characterize a population as “undifferentiated” or progenitor-like. Studies such as those by Buenrostro et al. (Cell, 2018) have demonstrated that these transcription factors can remain active in or reemerge during more lineage-committed stages. For instance, PU-1 is essential for myeloid and B-cell differentiation, GATA3 is involved in T-lymphocyte lineage commitment (though transiently expressed in early progenitors), and ELF2 participates in lineage-specific pathways. Thus, their presence does not imply a primitive state but rather highlights their broader functional roles in guiding and refining lineage decisions. Functional annotation of these transcription factors in invertebrate systems remains speculative, particularly as morphological or molecular markers specific to these early hemocyte lineages are not yet fully established. Further functional assays (e.g., knockdown/overexpression or lineage tracing using cells (ABL and BBL) from clusters 4, 5 and 6) will be necessary to determine which hemocyte population harbor progenitor properties and differentiation potential.</p><p>To further address the reviewer’s concern, we performed complementary pseudotime analyses by initiating Monocle 3 trajectories from clusters 4, 5, and 6 individually, as well as collectively (4/5/6). These analyses (see attached figure) confirm that the overall differentiation topology remains unchanged regardless of the selected root, consistently revealing two main pathways: one leading to hyalinocytes and the other to the granular lineage (ML, SGC, and VC). This consistency strongly suggests that clusters 4, 5, and 6 represent related pools of progenitor-like cells. Therefore, choosing cluster 4 based on its transcription/translation readiness does not alter the inferred branching architecture of hemocyte differentiation.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestions, which have helped us improve our manuscript and clarify our rationale.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Representation of the trajectories obtained from Monocle3 analysis using different pseudotime origins, showing that changing the rooting did not alter the overall differentiation topology.</title><p>(A) Pathways identified with cluster 4, (B) cluster 5, (C) cluster 6, and (D) cluster 4/5/6 origins.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-102622-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Concerning the AMP expression analysis in Figure 6: the qPCR data show that Cg-BPI and Cg-Defh are expressed broadly in all fractions including 6 and 7, which is in conflict with the statement Line 473 indicating that SGC (fractions 6 and 7) is not expressing AMP. In addition, this analysis should be combined with the expression profile of all AMP in the scRNAseq data (list available in 10.1016/j.fsi.2015.02.040).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting this point. We acknowledge that the qPCR data show expression of Cg-BPI and Cg-Defh across all fractions, including fractions 6 and 7 corresponding to SGC. However, our conclusion that SGCs do not express antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) was based on a correlation analysis rather than direct detection of AMPs in granular cells. Specifically, the qPCR experiments were designed to measure AMP expression levels in fractionated hemocyte populations relative to a control sample of whole hemolymph. We then performed a correlation analysis between AMP expression levels and the proportion of each hemocyte type in the fractions. This approach allowed us to infer a lower expression of AMP in granular cells, as reflected in the heatmap presented in Figure 6.</p><p>Regarding the suggestion to integrate AMP expression profiles from scRNA-seq data, we wrote that the limited sequencing depth of our scRNA-seq analysis was insufficient to accurately detect AMP expression Ligne 472-473 → “However, due to the limited sequencing depth, the scRNA-seq analysis was not sensitive enough to reveal AMP expression.”. Additionally, many of the known AMPs of <italic>Crassostrea gigas</italic> are not annotated in the genome, further complicating their identification within the scRNA-seq dataset. As a result, we were unable to perform the requested integration of AMP expression profiles from scRNA-seq data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The transcription factor expression analysis is descriptive and the interpretation too partial. These data should be compared with other systems. Most transcription factors show functional conservation, notably in the inflammatory pathways, which can provide valuable information to understand the function of the clusters 5 and 6 for which limited data are available.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to compare the identified transcription factors with other systems. However, since we did not perform a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the transcription factors identified in our dataset, we refrain from making assumptions about their functional conservation across species. Our analysis aims to provide a descriptive overview of transcription factor expression patterns in hemocyte clusters, which serves as a foundation for future functional studies. While transcription factor profiles may provide insights into the potential roles of clusters 5 and 6, assigning precise functions based solely on bioinformatic predictions remains speculative. Further experimental validation, including functional assays and evolutionary analyses, would be necessary to confirm the roles of these transcription factors, which is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>Line 212-213: the text should be reformulated.

Moreover, singlecell RNA sequencing captures only about 15–20% of each cell’s mRNA, so we inherently lose a significant portion of the transcriptome, further limiting our ability to pinpoint all relevant phagocytic receptor genes. Adding more figures to cover every candidate receptor would risk overloading this paper, thus we focus on the most prominent examples. A promising approach for more exhaustive analysis would involve efficiently isolating granulocytes (e.g., via Percoll gradient) and performing targeted RNA-seq on this cell population to thoroughly explore genes involved in phagocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 640-644: the authors mentioned that ML may be able to perform ETosis based on the oxidative burst.</p><p>This hypothesis requires further evidences.

We present ML-mediated ETosis only as a speculative possibility based on oxidative burst capacity as it was shown in different pieces of work that ETosis is inhibited by NADPH inhibitors (Poirier et al. 2014). Nevertheless, the expression of histones in the macrophage-like cluster (cluster 1) reinforces this possibility, as histone modifications play a key role in chromatin decondensation during ETosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Figure 1: In Figure 1B, the cell clusters are named 1 to 7, whereas in Figure 1C they are displayed as clusters 0 to 6.
