Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing enhances well-being and cognition; however, such accounts are potentially biased by the placebo effect. This study used a ‘self-blinding’ citizen science initiative, where participants were given online instructions on how to incorporate placebo control into their microdosing routine without clinical supervision. The study was completed by 191 participants, making it the largest placebo-controlled trial on psychedelics to-date. All psychological outcomes improved significantly from baseline to after the 4 weeks long dose period for the microdose group; however, the placebo group also improved and no significant between-groups differences were observed. Acute (emotional state, drug intensity, mood, energy, and creativity) and post-acute (anxiety) scales showed small, but significant microdose vs. placebo differences; however, these results can be explained by participants breaking blind. The findings suggest that anecdotal benefits of microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Psychedelic psychotherapy, therapy enhanced with psychedelic drugs such as LSD or psilocybin (the active ingredient of ‘magic mushrooms’), has been suggested to improve psychological well-being. For this reason, trials on psychedelic therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction and other conditions are ongoing. Recently, ‘microdosing’ – a way of administering psychedelics that involves taking about 10% of a recreational dose two or three times per week – has gained popularity. Unlike taking large doses of psychedelics, microdosing does not induce hallucinations, but anecdotal reports suggest that it yields similar benefits as psychedelic therapy.</p><p>A key feature of modern medicine are ‘placebo control’ studies that compare two groups of patients: one that takes a drug and another that takes inactive pills, known as placebos. Crucially, neither group knows whether they are taking drug or placebo. This control ensures that observed effects are due to the drug itself and not to unrelated psychological causes. For example, in trials of mood medicines, participants often expect to feel happier, which in itself improves their mood even when taking a placebo. This is known as the placebo effect.</p><p>Restrictive drug policies make placebo-controlled studies on psychedelics difficult and expensive, in particular for microdosing, which involves taking psychedelics over a longer time period. To overcome this problem, Szigeti et al. developed a new citizen-science approach, where microdosers implemented their own placebo control based on online instructions. The advantages are the low cost and the ability to recruit participants globally. The experiment was completed by 191 microdosers, making it the largest placebo-controlled study on psychedelics to-date, for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent clinical study.</p><p>The trial examined whether psychedelic microdosing can improve cognitive function and psychological well-being. The team found that microdosing significantly increased a number of psychological measures, such as well-being and life satisfaction. However, participants taking placebo also improved: there were no significant differences between the two groups. The findings confirmed positive anecdotes about microdosing improving people’s moods, but at the same time show that taking empty capsules, knowing they might be microdoses, have the same benefits. This result suggests that the observed benefits are not caused by the microdose, but rather by psychological expectations.</p><p>The study’s innovative ‘do-it-yourself’ approach to placebo control may serve as a template for future citizen science studies on other popular phenomena where positive expectations and social factors could play a role, such as cannabidiol (CBD) oils, nootropics and nutrition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>psychedelics</kwd><kwd>placebo</kwd><kwd>microdosing</kwd><kwd>self-blinding</kwd><kwd>expectations</kwd><kwd>citizen science</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anecdotally reported benefits of psychedelics microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is renewed interest in the medical application of psychedelic drugs, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin. Contemporary research is predominantly focusing on ‘psychedelics assisted psychotherapy’, where a few (one to three) large doses of psychedelics are used as adjunct to psychotherapy. Using this paradigm, psychedelics have shown promise in the treatment of conditions such as depression, end-of-life-anxiety, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carhart-Harris and Goodwin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nutt et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently, ‘microdosing’ has emerged as an alternative paradigm of psychedelic use. Due to its underground origin, microdosing does not have a universally agreed upon definition, and inconsistencies exist in substance, dose, frequency, and duration of use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuypers et al., 2019</xref>). However, microdosing can be broadly defined as the frequent use (one to three times per week) of low doses of psychedelics (10–20% of a typical ‘full’ dose, e.g. 10–15 μg LSD or 0.1–0.3 g of dried psilocybin containing mushrooms).</p><p>Anecdotal evidence suggests that microdosing may improve well-being, creativity, and cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fadiman and Krob, 2017</xref>), and recent uncontrolled, observational studies have provided some empirical support for these claims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polito and Stevenson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prochazkova et al., 2018</xref>). While encouraging, these studies are vulnerable to experimental biases, including confirmation-bias and placebo effects, in particular, because microdosers are a self-selected sample with optimistic expectations about psychedelics and microdosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polito and Stevenson, 2019</xref>). This positivity bias, combined with the low dose and the subjective evaluation of effects, pave the way for a strong placebo response.</p><p>A few recent double-blind, controlled studies have been conducted on microdosing. All studies used LSD and focused on the acute effects of a single microdose in a small number of healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yanakieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bershad et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bershad et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Family et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutten et al., 2020b</xref>). Studies have found large variability in LSD blood concentration after microdosing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Family et al., 2020</xref>), along with increased BDNF blood levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutten et al., 2020a</xref>). No robust evidence was found to support the positive anecdotal claims about microdosing, but some dose-related self-rated subjective effects were detected (e.g. self-ratings of ‘<italic>feel drug</italic>’, ‘<italic>feel high</italic>’, and ‘<italic>like drug</italic>’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yanakieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bershad et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hutten et al., 2020b</xref>), along with concomitant changes in brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bershad et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Two key issues need to be considered when assessing the scientific credibility of microdosing: the lack of placebo control in uncontrolled studies and the small sample size in controlled studies. Uncontrolled, observational studies affirm the anecdotal reports, but by design, these studies cannot provide evidence for beyond placebo benefits. Lab-based, controlled studies have small samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yanakieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bershad et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bershad et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Family et al., 2020</xref>) due to restrictive drug policies that render randomized controlled trials prohibitively expensive, and hence may be statistically underpowered.</p><p>In the present study we conceived of a novel citizen-science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Silvertown, 2009</xref>) initiative as a solution to this problem, exploiting modern technology and the popularity of microdosing. The key component is a self-blinding setup procedure that enabled self-experimenters, who microdose on their own initiative using their own psychedelic, to implement placebo control and randomization without clinical supervision. To investigate potential changes over the study period, participants were directed to online self-report surveys and cognitive tasks at various timepoints. The strength of this design is that it allowed us to obtain a large sample size while implementing placebo control at minimal logistic and economic costs. The primary objective of the study was to test whether psychedelics microdosing produces superior outcomes compared to placebo on psychological state and cognitive function. We hypothesized that improvements from baseline will be positively correlated with the number of microdoses taken during the dose period and that acute/post-acute outcomes will be better under/after taking a microdose.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design</title><p>This study had a naturalistic design involving elements of experimental control (self-blinding), prospective data collection and online citizen-science. From baseline to the final endpoint, the study was 10 weeks long (weeks 0–9), including a core 4-week microdosing period. Primary endpoint was at week 5 and there was an optional follow-up at week 9. The self-blinding procedure randomly assigned individuals to three groups, where the groups are defined by the number of weeks taking placebos/microdoses during the dose period.

The drawing is constrained such that only the three combinations of PL/MD weeks are possible, as shown in <bold>C</bold>, each with a probability of 1/3.

Additionally, the QR code from the envelope had to be scanned, which shared a numeric code with our informatics infrastructure. The decryption key (i.e. how capsule types are encoded by the numbers) was not shared with participants, so the numeric code allowed only us to deduce which type of capsule was taken when.</p><p>In summary, the two key elements of self-blinding are to hide the active components inside opaque capsules while preparing identical looking placebos (1) and to position non human-readable QR codes along the capsules prior to randomization (2). With the QR codes in place, it is possible for the experimenter to recover knowledge of capsule types after randomization without revealing that information to participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Microdose preparation</title><p>Participants were allowed to use any psychedelic substance to microdose with. The microdose dose, which is the amount of substance to use as a microdose, was not defined for participants, rather they were instructed to use a microdose dose that they would use outside the study. The rationale for this direction was threefold. First, given that participants typically would source their substance from the black market, the precise microdose dose could not have been known even if instructions requested it. Second, based on community feedback, most experienced microdosers have a preferred dose that they would not have liked to change to participate in the study. Lastly, this study was not a clinical trial and therefore from a regulatory perspective not allowing for control over and/or directing about drug doses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Recruitment and inclusion criteria</title><p>Psychedelics users were recruited through advertisement on relevant online and offline forums. Individuals could sign up through the study’s website, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://selfblinding-microdose.org/">https://selfblinding-microdose.org/</ext-link>, where they could find information about the study, including the study manual and explainer videos, the participant information’s sheet, and procedure for declaring informed consent. Once informed consent was given, individuals were able to sign up by providing their email address and planned start date. The inclusion criteria were: &gt;18 years of age, good understanding of English, intention to microdose with psychedelics, previous experience with psychedelics (either micro- or macrodosing), no use of psychedelic drugs from a week before the start until the completion of the post-regime timepoint (other than the study’s microdoses), and willingness to follow the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Data collection</title><p>All the questionnaires were implemented online using the SurveyGizmo platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/">https://www.surveygizmo.com/</ext-link>). For the online assessment of cognitive performance, the Cambridge Brain Sciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/">https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/</ext-link>) service was used. At each timepoint, links to each test were sent in a dedicated email via the Psychedelics Survey (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.psychedelicsurvey.com/">https://www.psychedelicsurvey.com/</ext-link>) service. These links had a personal ID embedded, so each test completion could be matched to individuals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Blind breaking and collection of guess data</title><p>Participants were asked to guess which type of capsule they had taken that day during the dose period (for days when capsule was taken). This guess was a forced binary choice between <italic>microdose</italic> and <italic>placebo</italic> options. At the end of the post-acute test sessions, participants were asked separately to guess whether the current week was a microdose or a placebo week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In the discussion of our results, the term ‘break blind’ indicates that the participant guessed the capsule correctly for the day (acute outcomes) or week (post-acute outcomes). No guess was collected about perceived group allocation at the end of study, because information about group structure was not shared with participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Group differences in demographics, recreational drug use, and baseline scores of the accumulative outcomes were assessed with ANOVA and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables.</p><p>Accumulative outcomes were analyzed with mixed-effect repeated measurement models, using the SAS PROC MIXED method with compound symmetry covariance structure. Models were constructed with change from baseline as the dependent variable, <italic>group</italic>, <italic>time</italic> and <italic>group*time</italic> interaction as factors, and individuals as experimental unit. Models were adjusted for all significant baseline covariates (the following variables were tested as potential covariates: age, sex, education, baseline score, dose, total dose, short suggestibility scale score, expectation score, number of past psychiatric diagnosis, number of current psychiatric medications, number of lifetime macrodose experiences, and number of lifetime months microdosing). To accommodate dose as a potential covariate, psilocybin mushroom mass was converted to an estimated equivalent LSD dose (0.1 g of dried mushroom ~4.6 µg LSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaplan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbonaro et al., 2016</xref>). The following planned comparisons were made: within-group comparisons of change over time from baseline to the primary endpoint at week 5 and from baseline to the final follow-up at week 9. Additionally, between-group comparisons were made (PL vs. HH and PL vs. MD) at week 5 and week 9.</p><p>To analyze acute and post-acute outcomes, mixed linear models were constructed. Models included score as dependent variable, <italic>subject ID</italic> as a random-effect, and <italic>condition</italic> as fixed-effect, where <italic>condition</italic> was a binary categorical variable (PL/MD). For acute outcomes, <italic>condition</italic> was PL/MD when the score was obtained under the influence of a placebo/microdose capsule, while for post-acute outcomes <italic>condition</italic> was PL/MD when the score was obtained at the end of placebo/microdose week. Planned comparisons were made between scores obtained under PL and MD conditions. Each participant contributed four scores to these models, corresponding to the four acute/post-acute assessment timepoints during the dose period. All acute/post-acute models were adjusted for all significant baseline covariates (same variables were tested for significance as in the case for the accumulative outcomes, except baseline score and total dose consumed).</p><p>To better understand how <italic>guess</italic> influenced scores, a second set of models were constructed with the addition of <italic>guess</italic> (binary categorical variable, PL/MD) and <italic>guess*condition</italic> factors. Using these guess adjusted models, planned comparisons were made between PL and MD conditions. Finally, the two binary variables (<italic>condition</italic> and <italic>guess</italic>) divided the data into 2*2 = 4 strata, post-hoc comparisons were made between the following strata (<italic>condition/guess</italic>): PL/PL vs. MD/PL, PL/MD vs. MD/MD, PL/PL vs. PL/MD and MD/PL vs. MD/MD. This selection was made such that <italic>condition</italic> changes while <italic>guess</italic> remains fixed in the first two comparisons, and <italic>guess</italic> changes while <italic>condition</italic> remains fixed in the last two comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study only engaged people who planned to microdose through their own initiative with their own psychedelic substance, but who consented to incorporate placebo control to make their self-experimentation compatible with our study.

The high sensitivity exhibited by participants (0.46 vs. the random guesser’s 0.25) suggests that the higher than random break blind rate is mostly due to superior ability to identify microdoses, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref> for details.</p><p>Break blind rate was positively associated with reported microdose dose (<italic>F</italic>(1, 237)=7.4, p&lt;0.01**), meaning that the higher the dose was, the more likely participants guessed their daily condition correctly.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first one to use a self-blinding methodology, the first placebo-controlled investigation of the accumulative effects of repeated microdosing, and the largest placebo-controlled psychedelic study to-date.</p><p>When looking at changes over time from baseline to week 5 (accumulative outcomes) in the microdose group alone, results confirmed the psychological benefits reported by anecdotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fadiman and Krob, 2017</xref>) and observational, uncontrolled studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Polito and Stevenson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prochazkova et al., 2018</xref>): significant improvements were observed in the domains of well-being, mindfulness, life satisfaction, and paranoia. However, when looking at the between-group comparisons of the same outcomes, no significant differences were found between the placebo and microdose groups. On the cognitive tests, which are less subjective than the self-reported psychological outcomes, the microdose group did not even improve from baseline to week 5 and the between-groups comparisons were not significant either. Thus, our study validates the positive anecdotal reports about the psychological benefits of microdosing (significant improvements from baseline in a broad range of psychological measures); however, our results also suggest that these improvements are not due to the pharmacological action of microdosing, but are rather explained by the placebo effect (lack of significant between-groups differences).</p><p>Similar conclusions can be drawn from the examination of the acute and post-acute outcomes as well. In our initial analysis without incorporation of the guess component, we detected significant effects on post-acute <italic>anxiety</italic> (STAIT), acute <italic>emotional state</italic> (PANAS), and <italic>mood</italic>, <italic>energy</italic>, <italic>creativity</italic>, and <italic>drug intensity</italic> (visual analogue scale items). Effect sizes were small on all scales (Cohen’s d &lt; 0.3 except <italic>drug intensity</italic>); thus, the clinical and practical value of these effects is debatable. Furthermore, when the guess component was added to the models, the already small differences disappeared on all scales, except for acute <italic>drug intensity</italic>. It can be argued that the addition of the guess variable to the models may undermine the statistical significance of the condition effect due to collinearity between condition and guess. To overcome this potential issue, we conducted the stratification analysis where only one of these variables is changing, while the other remains fixed. No significant differences were observed between placebo and microdose conditions when the guess was fixed (<italic>condition/guess</italic>; PL/PL vs. MD/PL and PL/MD vs. MD/MD comparisons), except for <italic>drug intensity</italic> (MD&gt;PL). Conversely, when condition was fixed (PL/PL vs. PL/MD and MD/PL vs. MD/MD comparisons), scores obtained under placebo and microdose guesses were significantly different in 21 out of the 22 comparisons, always favoring the microdose guess, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>. Importantly, neither CPS nor any cognitive subtask, the non-self-rated outcomes where beliefs and subjective feelings are likely to be less influential, were significantly different under either guess or drug conditions. In summary, these results strongly suggest that the actual content of capsules did not determine differences between the conditions, but <italic>beliefs</italic> about their content did.</p><p>An important observation was that participants guessed their capsules correctly in 72% of the cases. This break blind rate was higher than random (random: 63% vs. participants: 72%), but not as high as reported in antidepressant studies (around 80%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kirsch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rabkin et al., 1986</xref>). It is known from a variety of clinical studies that higher break blind rate is associated with larger between-conditions effect-sizes (where placebo is the control condition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baethge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berna et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Laferton et al., 2018</xref>). This relationship is explained by non-specific treatment factors such as expectation of a benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bausell, 2009</xref>) and investigator alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatoor and Kurpnick, 2001</xref>). The influence of such factors is likely to be large for the present study, because of highly positive expectations and favorable attitudes toward psychedelics, see attitude analysis in the Appendix. These factors together suggest that the observed ‘significant’ acute and post-acute effects may be an artifact of the combination of break blinds and expected benefits. The acute and post-acute results observed could be understood as the difference between the expected benefits when a microdose is perceived (i.e. guessed by participants) versus the absence of expected benefits when placebo is perceived. This difference in expectations could be mistaken for a ‘real’ drug effect in any study where blinding integrity is not considered during analysis. If this explanation is correct, one prediction for future microdose studies with a similarly pro-psychedelics sample is that they may observe larger effects when break blind rate is higher, or conversely, smaller effects when break blind rate is lower.</p><p>What factors account for the blind breaking? <italic>Drug intensity</italic> was the only outcome that remained significant even after adjusting for guess (3.4 ± 2.0; p&lt;0.001***). This observation suggests that <italic>drug intensity</italic> is a small, but true drug effect. This increased drug intensity mostly manifested as body and perceptual sensations, see <italic>Blind breaking cues</italic> in Appendix 1 for details. This finding suggests that in most cases blind breaking induced clinically irrelevant side effects, rather than deduced from improvements of outcome variables. We note that according to our data the threshold LSD dose where participants guess better than random is 12 µg, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which is in line with the 13 µg threshold dose estimated by a recent dose controlled study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bershad et al., 2019a</xref>).</p><p>It is worth noting that the current study was designed to protect blinding integrity by including placebos for the microdose group as well, administering the microdose capsules on different days of the week and by including the half-half group. The 3-arm design can be seen as a strength in this regard, adding ambiguity and thus strengthening blinding. Illustrative of the integrity of the blind, we received several emails from participants in the PL group who were in disbelief after opening their unused envelopes containing unused capsules after the conclusion of the study:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>“I counted the number of cut blotters I had in the left overs: they are 8...so you must be right... Which is incredible […] Some days during the test were really, really focused and colours more vivid. This sensation was really new to me&quot;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&quot;I have just checked the remaining envelopes and it appears that I was indeed taking placebos throughout the trial. I'm quite astonished […] It seems I was able to generate a powerful 'altered consciousness' experience based only the expectation around the possibility of a microdose&quot;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&quot;An empty pill with strong belief/intentions makes nearly everything. You put spirituality into an empty pill here...wow!&quot;</p></list-item></list><sec id="s4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>It is our view that the present part-controlled, part-observational design yields data superior to conventional observational data (inclusion of placebo control), but inferior to controlled clinical trial data (incomplete control over recruitment, screening, assessment, drug administration, etc.). This study does, however, have greater ecological validity than would a fully controlled lab study.</p><p>A key limitation of the present study is the lack of verification of the nature, purity, and dosage of the psychedelic substance used for microdosing. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms were used by 23% of the sample, 14% used legal LSD analogues (such as 1P-LSD), whereas 62% sourced their substance from the black market, mostly LSD (61%). According to the Energy Control's drug checking service (Barcelona), LSD blotter adulteration rates were low during the period when our study was running: in both 2018 and 2019 blotters sold as LSD contained LSD only in 90% (n = 735) of tested samples [personal communication with M. Ventrua from EC, June 2020]. The exact quantity of active ingredient within a given microdose cannot be known with certainty; however, the positive relationship between dose and blind breaking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and that the threshold dose for psychoactivity was consistent with a recent controlled study (12 µg vs 13 µg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bershad et al., 2019a</xref>) provide some reassurance. Nonetheless, our results should be not understood as clinical evidence, rather they are representative of ‘real life microdosing’.</p><p>We could not confirm whether participants followed accurately the self-blinding procedure. Three individuals reported following an invalid sequence of weeks, but these individuals did their setups together, all committing the same mistake (1.3% error rate). Furthermore, we had no way of confirming whether the capsules were taken as instructed during the dose period. Instructions emphasized not to complete assessments planned on dosing days in case the dose schedule could not be followed for any reason, but we could not confirm whether participants adhered to this rule.</p><p>Our stratification analysis does not allow for a strict determination of a causal relationship between guess and outcome, because guess was recorded <italic>after</italic> completion of assessments, guess was last question during test sessions. After closing the study, a survey was conducted among participants, where 86% (n = 166) responded that &quot;I was thinking about whether I took a microdose or placebo even before I was asked to guess&quot; (opposed to &quot;I was not thinking about whether I took a microdose or placebo, except when I was asked to guess&quot;), making a causal interpretation more likely. We note that the order we chose is consistent with previous work in psychiatric studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baethge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rabkin et al., 1986</xref>); had the guesses been requested prior to the assessments, it could have primed responses. Also, we cannot rule out that performance during the assessments influenced the guess. However, the lack of any feedback from the assessments mitigates this risk. Most participants reported to break blind due to body and perceptual sensations, rather than improved outcomes, see <italic>Blind breaking cues</italic> in the Appendix for details.</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that a study in a clinical population would yield more promising results. In the present healthy sample, where well-being scores are high at baseline, there is less scope for potential improvements, which could have prevented the observation of placebo-microdose differences. Most study participants reported not to have any history of mental health problems; only 7% reported having a current psychiatric diagnosis, and 33% reported to have had a psychiatric diagnosis in the past (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We conducted two post-hoc analysis for two selective pseudo-depression subsamples: participants with the lowest 25% baseline well-being scores and those with the highest 25% baseline neuroticism scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ryff and Keyes, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wood and Joseph, 2010</xref>). Results in these subsamples were entirely consistent with those from the complete sample: there were no significant differences between conditions for any of the accumulative outcomes (adjusted treatment difference ±95% CI of PL vs MD at week 5 for the lowest 25% baseline well-being subsample: well-being (RPWB) −1.6 ± 13.6 (p=0.81), mindfulness (CAMS) 0.3 ± 3.3 (p=0.85), paranoia (GPTS) −5.1 ± 6.8 (p=0.14), life satisfaction (SWL) 0.3 ± 4.5 (p=0.87), cognition (CPS) 0.1 ± 0.55 (p=0.71); same measures for the highest 25% baseline neuroticism subsample: well-being (RPWB) 4.8 ± 14.3 (p=0.50), mindfulness (CAMS) 1.3 ± 3.7 (p=0.49), paranoia (GPTS) −3.1 ± 8 (p=0.43), life satisfaction (SWL) −1.4 ± 4.6 (p=0.53), cognition (CPS) 0.04 ± 0.67 (p=0.90)). Thus, although not designed as a clinical study, data from this opportunistic naturalistic study do not provide support for clinical effects of microdosing.</p><p>Although this was the largest placebo-controlled psychedelic research study published to-date, we note that one could argue that the study was still underpowered to detect a true effect based on the fact that the MD group did improve more than the PL group on all scales (from baseline to week 5), but just not to a statistically significant extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). On the well-being scale (RPWB), the adjusted PL vs. MD group difference was 2.5 ± 5.6 points. To illustrate this difference in practice, this scale consists of 42 statements that participants rate on a 6-point Likert scale (<italic>Strongly disagree - Strongly agree</italic>), thus, the full range of scores is thus 0–252, so the 2.5 point mean difference is 1% of the total scale. This difference is equivalent to scoring one item, for <italic>example ‘I like most aspects of my personality’</italic>, <italic>Strongly agree</italic> instead of <italic>Slightly agree</italic> or <italic>Slightly disagree</italic>, while responding the same to the remaining 41 items. Based on our data, we calculated that the sample size (90% power and alpha of 0.05) required to observe a true between-group difference would be: 1508 for <italic>well-being</italic> (RPWB), 1638 for <italic>mindfulness</italic> (CAMS), 4918 for <italic>life satisfaction</italic> (SWL), 1392 for <italic>paranoia</italic> (GPTS), and 366 for <italic>cognitive performance</italic> (CPS). These differences therefore are not clinically meaningful or sufficient to justify the cost of intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Future directions</title><p>The successful execution of this initiative here may inspire similar initiatives throughout the world in a broad range of scientific and medical contexts. Controlling for placebo effects is important for trending phenomena, such as cannabidiol (CBD) oils, nootropics, and nutrition, where social-pressure, expectancy, positive-test strategies, and confirmation bias can lead to false-positive findings. Self-blinding citizen-science initiatives could be employed in these areas as a cost-efficient screening tool prior to conducting expensive clinical studies.</p><p>An important feature of the self-blinding methodology is the low cost; we estimate that the current study’s costs were about 0.5–1% of an equivalent clinical study. Since the research team is not providing the study drug/placebo and on-site staffing is not required, expenses are similar to a conventional observational study, yet still with incorporation of randomization and placebo control.</p><p>Important lessons can be taken from the current study for the design of future microdosing trials. The combination of the lack of detected efficacy in this study and an association between self-reported doses and ability to break blind (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that selecting dosage is fraught with difficulties: if a low microdose is chosen, efficacy is unlikely if we extrapolate current results, whereas a high microdose could jeopardize the blinding. Randomization to microdose versus an active placebo conditions (e.g. niacin, which has been employed in macrodosing studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ross et al., 2016</xref>) and careful assessment of blinding could, in principle, alleviate some of these concerns.</p><p>The present study also has implications for full/‘macrodose’ psychedelic studies, where blinding is impossible due to the intense nature of the experience. It can be hypothesized that the intense hallucinations are essential for therapeutic outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Griffiths et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roseman et al., 2017</xref>), questioning the suitability of placebo-controlled trials in this context. The fact that one may be unable to fully extricate belief, or ‘context’ more broadly, from the direct (e.g. pharmacological) action of a given intervention, raises interesting philosophical and ethical question with implications for drug development and regulation. One might also hypothesize that the action of microdosing and psychedelics relies on prior and continuously updating <italic>belief</italic> combining (perhaps synergistically) with a direct drug effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carhart-Harris et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). Such a positive interaction could, in theory, be tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carhart-Harris et al., 2018</xref>), and if endorsed, this could be interpreted as implying that <italic>belief</italic> is an active component of the psychedelic treatment model, rather than a problematic confound.</p><p>In summary, here we created a novel, cost-effective, self-blinding, citizen-science methodology that enabled us to conduct the largest placebo-controlled study on psychedelics to-date and the first placebo-controlled examination of repeated psychedelic microdosing. Our findings confirm the anecdotal benefits of microdosing (improvements in a broad range of psychological measures); however, the results also suggest that the improvements are not due to the pharmacological action of microdosing, but are rather explained by the placebo effect (lack of significant between-groups effect).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the Beckley foundation for providing funds for the study.

The Cambridge Bran Sciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/">https://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/</ext-link>) platform was used to collect cognitive performance data.

The order is determined by the random shuffling during setup. Similarly, for the HH group, the MD weeks during dose regime could be any two of the MD weeks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for the four variations of the MD week). Furthermore, the sequence of MD and PL weeks has two variations, either MD-PL-MD-PL or PL-MD-PL-MD. During analysis no distinction was made between these variants.</p><p>Variants of the setup were provided if psilocybin containing mushrooms or liquid was used. In the case of mushrooms (grinded powder), placebo capsules had to be filled with equal weight of non-psychoactive mushrooms, chaga (<italic>Inonotus obliquus</italic>) was recommended, otherwise the capsules could be distinguished based on their weight. For liquids, plastic vials had to be used to hold the substance and the placebo vials had to be filled with the same volume of liquid without the psychedelic component.</p><p>Participants received an automated report after the completion of the long-term follow-up timepoint if all timepoints were completed. The report indicated what they have taken when, together with their CPSs (but not psychometric scores). As the report was sent after the completion of the last timepoint, its content did not affect any outcome measures.</p><p>Participants were offered the option to construct their own dosing schedule with minimal restrictions, where the restrictions ensured the appropriate conditions for the acute and post-acute timepoints. Twelve participants choose this option. Seven of them maintained two microdoses/week (on MD weeks) and only moved the days of microdoses. Data from these individuals was included in the final analysis. The remaining five participants either had three (3) or a single (2) microdose during microdose weeks. To simplify the analysis, data from these five individuals was excluded.</p><p>The time of completion was checked for every response and the data was discarded if the test was not completed in the appropriate time window. For the accumulative outcomes, tests had to be completed anytime during the week, while acute and post-acute tests had to be completed on the corresponding day. If a participant did not complete either the post-regime or the 4 weeks follow-up timepoints, an automated reminder was sent. If the test was completed within 48 hr, then the data was still considered valid.</p><p>Participants were instructed not to complete tests if the dose schedule was not followed. Participants were allowed to withdraw from the study at any point. Their data was deleted if they explicitly asked for it, otherwise, the data was still included in the analyses.</p><p>After scanning the QR codes, three participants had an invalid dose schedule (3PL weeks and a single MD week), likely due to errors during the setup. These three participants knew each other in real life and prepared the setup together, committing all the same mistake.

This section provides a summary of the procedure for the readers, while further details can be found in the schematic description. The text of this subsection reads as follows:</p><p>“A high-level overview of self-blinding is provided here, for a detailed illustration see Figure 2. […] With the QR codes in place, it is possible for the experimenter to recover knowledge of capsule types after randomization without revealing that information to participants.”</p><p>Furthermore, we have also added a “Microdose preparation” subsection to the Materials and methods, detailing the directions given to participants. The new section reads:</p><p>“Participants were allowed to use any psychedelic substance to microdose with. The microdose dose, i.e. the amount of substance to use as a microdose, was not defined for participants, rather they were instructed to use a microdose dose that they would use outside the study. […] Lastly, this study was not a clinical trial and therefore from a regulatory perspective not allowing for control over and/or directing about drug doses.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o Please clarify that participants who broke blind did not have their data included, or please clarify why. Also please report the frequency of how many participants broke blind.</p></disp-quote><p>Data when participants breaking blind are included in all analysis, in agreement with conventional psychiatric trials that also include such data. We note that blinding is rarely assessed in clinical studies [Baethge, 2013], so examples are limited, nonetheless see [Chen, 2011] or [Rabkin, 1986] for antidepressant studies with guess data. In neither case break blind datapoints are removed from the main analysis, similarly to our study.</p><p>As for the break blind rate, we first note that we asked participants to guess their treatment daily (for every day of the dose period). Hence, we can only talk about the % of days when participants break blind (rather than the % of participants) – the same participant could break blind on some days, while not on others. We have updated the subsections “Blind breaking and collection of guess data” (Materials and methods) and “Blinding integrity” (Results) to avoid possible misunderstandings. In particular, now the “Blind breaking and collection of guess data” subsection contains the following sentence:</p><p>“In the discussion of our results, the term “break blind” indicates that the participant guessed the capsule correctly for the day (acute outcomes) or week (post-acute outcomes).”</p><p>Participants broke blind on 72% of their daily assessments, as it is already reported with details in the “Blinding integrity” subsection in the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Data availability.</p><p>In theory, data is publicly available on their website, but we encountered difficulties accessing it. Please correct this error or address whether it become available upon acceptance of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We checked and the data together with the documentation is publicly available in the data/ folder of the repository we shared. To avoid any misunderstandings, we updated the Transparent reporting document and now a new link is provided, which directly points to the data folder (rather than the repository itself). Furthermore, we removed code that is not relevant to reproducing the results, hoping to make it easier to navigate the codebase. Please let us know if the issue persists.</p></body></sub-article></article>
