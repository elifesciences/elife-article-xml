gene regulator in gram-negative bacteria. Through its capacity to sense temperature and other environmental factors, H-NS allows pathogens like Salmonella to adapt their gene expression to their presence inside or outside warm-blooded hosts. To investigate how this sensing mechanism may have evolved to fit different bacterial lifestyles, we compared H-NS orthologs from bacteria that infect humans, plants, and insects, and from bacteria that live on a deep-sea hypothermal vent. The combination of biophysical characterization, high-resolution proton-less nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and molecular simulations revealed, at an atomistic level, how the same general mechanism was adapted to specific habitats and lifestyles. In particular, we demonstrate how environment-sensing characteristics arise from specifically positioned intra- or intermolecular electrostatic interactions. Our integrative approach clarified the exact modus operandi for H-NS-mediated environmental sensing and suggested that this sensing mechanism resulted from the exaptation of an ancestral protein feature.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>salmonella typhimurium</kwd><kwd>erwinia amylovora</kwd><kwd>buchnera aphidicola</kwd><kwd>idiomarina loiheinsis</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>environment-sensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004052</institution-id><institution>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCC/1/1976-25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arold</surname><given-names>Stefan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM129431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004052</institution-id><institution>King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCC/1/1976-21</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arold</surname><given-names>Stefan T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAREER CHE-1945394</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Xiaochuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combining in silico and experimental approaches to identify and understand the residue changes in the H-NS protein that allowed bacteria to adapt environment-sensing to different habitats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The histone-like nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein is a central controller of the gene regulatory networks in enterobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Williams and Rimsky, 1997</xref>). H-NS inhibits gene transcription by coating and/or condensing DNA; an environment-sensing mechanism allows H-NS to liberate these DNA regions for gene expression in response to physicochemical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fang and Rimsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Winardhi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2012</xref>). H-NS preferentially binds to AT-rich sequences, which enables its dual role in (1) the organization of the bacterial chromosome and (2) the silencing of horizontally acquired foreign DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Navarre et al., 2007</xref>). The latter mechanism allows bacteria to assimilate foreign DNAs, which, however, are only expressed as a last resort in case of acute threats or stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Navarre et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, H-NS plays a crucial role in the adaptation, survivability, and antibiotic resistance of bacteria. Given the growing threat of multidrug resistance, H-NS has attracted increasing research interest, with a particular focus on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of adaptive evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Will et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Higashi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>H-NS possesses two dimerization domains (site1, residues 1–44; site2, resides 52–82; the numbering of <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> is adopted throughout the text) and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (DNAbd, residues 93–137) that is connected through a flexible region (linker, residues 83–92) to site2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shindo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). The combination of site1 ‘head-to-head’ dimers with site2 ‘tail-to-tail’ dimers allows H-NS to multimerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These H-NS multimers form a superhelix that recapitulates the structure of plectonemic DNA, offering a mechanism for a stable concerted DNA coating by H-NS that results in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arold et al., 2010</xref>).

Site2 unfolds at human body temperature, allowing the linker-DNAbd region to associate with site1 to adapt an autoinhibited conformation incapable of binding to DNA. Salinity and pH can also influence the stability of site2 dimers and hence may also affect gene repression by H-NS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shahul Hameed et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Valk et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the sensitivity of H-NS to temperature and other physiochemical changes allows human pathogens such as <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and enterohaemorrhagic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to sense when they enter a homothermic host and adapt their gene expression profiles accordingly.</p><p>To date, studies to elucidate environment-sensing of H-NS were almost exclusively conducted with proteins from two model systems, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Navarre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>E. coli</italic> (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">van der Valk et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Oshima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">White-Ziegler and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kahramanoglou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ueda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kotlajich et al., 2015</xref>), both of which infect humans. Yet, H-NS orthologs are also present in enterobacteria that do not have warm-blooded hosts, raising the question of what biological role H-NS plays in these species. Answering this question requires to determine the structural basis for environment-sensing in H-NS orthologs with drastically different lifestyles. However, the multidomain composition of H-NS hamper conventional structural analysis. Therefore, we combined large-scale molecular simulations and spectroscopic approaches to elucidate how environment-sensing by H-NS may have adapted in different species. This multidisciplinary approach yielded an atomic-level understanding of how H-NS orthologs evolved specific residue substitutions to adapt environment-sensing to their bacterial habitats, and may open new avenues for strategies to combat antibiotic resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the adaptation of environment-sensing by H-NS, we searched for representatives of H-NS–containing bacteria that have diverse lifestyles. Accordingly, we selected four H-NS orthologs from ~3000 hr-NS-like sequences available in the Uniprot database: (1) H-NS<sub>ST</sub> from <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. This bacterium is a pathogen of mammals and uses temperature-sensing to adapt to a presence inside the warm-blooded host. (2) H-NS<sub>EA</sub> from <italic>Erwinia amylovora</italic>, which is a plant pathogen that infects apples and pears. Hence, temperature is not a reliable differentiator between free-living and host-based states. (3) H-NS<sub>BA</sub> from <italic>Buchnera aphidicola</italic>. This bacterium is an obligate endosymbiont of aphids and has no free-living forms. (4) H-NS<sub>IL</sub> from <italic>Idiomarina loihiensis</italic>, which is a free-living bacterium from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent producing large heat gradients. H-NS<sub>EA</sub> and H-NS<sub>BA</sub> share more than 60% sequence identity with H-NS<sub>ST</sub>, whereas H-NS<sub>IL</sub> is only 40% identical to H-NS<sub>ST</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The site1 dimer is markedly more stable than the site2 dimer in the H-NS orthologs</title><p>H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site1 and site2 form homodimers to enable H-NS multimerization in a head-to-head/tail-to-tail fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arold et al., 2010</xref>). In concert with the DNA interaction of the individual domains, this homo-oligomerization is required for tight DNA binding and hence gene repression. In our previous study, we showed that only H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site2 dimers unfold and dissociate within a biologically relevant temperature range, whereas site1 dimers remain unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shahul Hameed et al., 2019</xref>). The higher stability of the site1 dimer of H-NS<sub>ST</sub> is explained by a substantially larger contact surface between the two monomers (ca. 3300 Å<sup>2</sup> compared to ca. 850 Å<sup>2</sup> for site1 and site2, respectively, according to PDBePISA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>]).</p><p>To investigate whether this mechanism is conserved in other H-NS orthologs, we built homology models for H-NS<sub>EA</sub>, H-NS<sub>BA</sub>, and H-NS<sub>IL</sub> using the crystal structure of the H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site1–site2 fragment as a template (PDB ID: 3NR7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arold et al., 2010</xref>). Next, we constructed a tetrameric model as a minimal representation that conserves all features of the H-NS multimer. This tetramer contained two full-length H-NS monomers (residues 1–137, with templates PDB IDs: 3NR7 and 2L93) and two partial monomers, truncated before site2 (residues 1–52) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To probe differences in environmental responses of the orthologs, we first used conventional all-atom MD. We simulated all four tetramers (~100,000 atoms in each system; see Materials and methods) for 200 ns at three different conditions (0.15 M NaCl, 293 K; 0.50 M NaCl, 293 K/20°C; or 0.15 M NaCl, 313 K/40 °C) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>The tetramer simulations at 0.15 M NaCl and 20°C produced a lower residue fluctuation level in site1 (local root-mean-square fluctuation [RMSF] 0.4–1.9 Å) than in site2 (local RMSF 0.5–4.4 Å) for all four orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). The higher stability of the site1 dimer is explained by the generally higher number of nonpolar contacts than in the site2 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These contacts involved conserved hydrophobic amino acid residues, notably L5 (or I5) and L8 of α1, L14 of α2, and L23, L26, V36, and V37 (or I37) of α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Although α3 bending occurred in all orthologs, it only significantly affected the site2 dimer of H-NS<sub>ST</sub> by separating R54 from E74’ or D71’, suggesting that this mechanism contributed to the salt and temperature sensitivity of H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site2, whereas it was not strong enough to significantly affect site2 stability in other orthologs.</p><p>Another example was given by H-NS<sub>EA</sub>, where an alternative R54-D71’ salt bridge formed whenever the R54-E74’ contact was broken at 40°C. This alternative R54-D71’ salt bridge stabilized the H-NS<sub>EA</sub> site2 dimer at the higher temperature, suggesting that this compensatory mechanism resulted in a decreased sensitivity to temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). H-NS<sub>IL</sub> provided a final example for a specific response.

This effect suggested that H-NS<sub>IL</sub> had a reduced sensitivity to salinity, while remaining sensitive to temperature.</p><p>To complement the dynamics of H-NS orthologs from our conventional MD simulations, we used extensive simulations with umbrella sampling (US) to quantitate the overall site2 stability. We calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) for site2 dimer dissociation (residues 50–82, ~46,000 atoms) of the four H-NS orthologs for three different conditions (low salinity/low temperature, high salinity, or high temperature). The site2 monomers were not constrained and remained structurally flexible during the dissociation process. To ensure convergence in the PMFs, we employed long windows (54 ns) in simulations totaling 52 µs (details provided in the SI; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for resulting histograms and PMFs along the dissociation coordinate). According to the free-energy difference between the dimerization and dissociation states (∆G = G<sub>dimer</sub> − G<sub>dissociation</sub>), we estimated the energetic impact from increased salinity and temperature as follows: ∆∆G = ∆G<sub>high salinity or temperature</sub>− ∆G<sub>293K, 0.15M NaCl</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Notably, high salinity (0.50 M NaCl) or temperature (40°C) decreased the stability of the H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site2 dimer by 2.2 kcal/mol. H-NS<sub>BA</sub> displayed a similar sensitivity to temperature but a lower sensitivity to salinity, which destabilized the dimer by 1.5 kcal/mol. Interestingly, our data indicated that H-NS<sub>EA</sub> was only sensitive to salinity, whereas raising the temperature had little impact on the stability of the H-NS<sub>EA</sub> site2 dimer. Conversely, H-NS<sub>IL</sub> only responded to temperature, whereas the increased salinity did not affect the stability of its site2 dimer (∆G ~ 0 kcal/mol). Collectively, our conventional MD simulations and PMF calculations suggested how, on the atomic level, changes in the site2 sequence may alter the sensitivity of the H-NS orthologs to different environmental changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The autoinhibited H-NS conformation is maintained through dynamic electrostatic interactions</title><p>In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shahul Hameed et al., 2019</xref>), we had shown that melting and dissociation of site2 dimers allow H-NS<sub>ST</sub> to adapt a closed conformation in which the linker-DNAbd fragment interacts with a negatively charged region on site1 α3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and that this autoinhibitory interaction is incompatible with DNA interactions.

However, we noted important differences in the orthologs’ response characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>): (1) Of the four orthologs, H-NS<sub>ST</sub> responded most strongly to salinity and temperature, consistent with the broken R54-E74’ salt bridge and large site2 RMSF in our high-salinity or high-temperature simulations. (2) H-NS<sub>EA</sub> was less temperature sensitive and showed weaker multimerization than the other orthologs. Indeed, our simulations suggested that H-NS<sub>EA</sub> site2 can rearrange the inter-dimer salt bridge and form either R54-E74’ or R54-D71’ to maintain site2 stability at higher temperatures. (3) H-NS<sub>BA</sub> had the highest tendency to multimerize among all the orthologs tested, which might partly be explained by the absence of the autoinhibitory conformation. Compared to H-NS<sub>ST</sub>, our PMF calculations showed a slightly higher sensitivity to temperature and a slightly reduced sensitivity to salinity. Although these tendencies were apparent in our DLS data, these data were also affected by the fact that H-NS<sub>BA</sub> required more than 150 mM NaCl to stay in solution, but H-NS<sub>BA</sub> nonetheless aggregated at 30°C. (4) H-NS<sub>IL</sub> showed a decreased sensitivity to salinity compared to H-NS<sub>ST</sub>, as suggested by our computational analysis (i.e. the lack of the site2 K57-D68’ salt bridge, the lack of salt-promoted free-energy changes, and the attenuated electrostatic site1 surface).</p><p>To corroborate these conclusions, we designed several site2 mutants and tested their effect on protein multimerization using fluorescence anisotropy. To eliminate the influence of the autoinhibitory site1:Ct interaction, we used H-NS constructs that lacked the Ct (H-NS 1–83). The normalized fluorescence polarization (NFP) of H-NS<sub>ST</sub> declined between 20°C and ~40°C to a value of 0.2, indicating that the average particle size decreased with temperature, as observed in DLS. And as in DLS, increases in salt lowered the NFP, and hence, the propensity of the particles to form site2-linked multimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The H-NS<sub>ST</sub> R54M mutant, disrupting the ‘housekeeping’ salt bridges R54-E74’ and R54-D71’, displayed an NFP of 0.2 at all temperatures and salt concentrations. Thus, this mutant supported the key roles of the R54-mediated salt bridges in H-NS multimerization and environment-sensing. To experimentally assess the role of the K57-D68’ salt bridge in conveying salt sensitivity, we introduced the D68A ‘IL-like’ mutation in H-NS<sub>ST</sub>, and the A68D ‘ST-like’ mutation in H-NS<sub>IL</sub>. These mutations abrogated salt sensitivity in H-NS<sub>ST</sub> and introduced salt sensitivity in H-NS<sub>IL</sub>, as predicted by our computational analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our experimental observations revealed significant differences in response to physicochemical parameters, which were in agreement with our predictions based on the molecular features of the H-NS orthologs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Environment-sensing through the pleiotropic gene regulator H-NS helps <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> to adapt when it is present inside its host mammal. In a previous study, we had shown that an increase in temperature, and to some extent salinity, dissociates the second dimerization element (site2). Melting of site2 produces two effects: first, it impedes synergistic DNA binding of H-NS multimers, and second, it allows H-NS to adopt an autoinhibitory conformation where DNA binding residues on the C-terminal linker-DNAbd fragment (herein abbreviated as the Ct) associate with the N-terminal site1 dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shahul Hameed et al., 2019</xref>). In our current study, we confirmed that site2 is the element that senses changes in physicochemical parameters, and we uncovered additional aspects of this process. In particular, proton-less NMR fully revealed the position and dynamics of the Ct residues involved in the autoinhibitory association with site1. We also showed that the formation of a β-turn in the linker residues 89–91 is associated with the autoinhibited conformation. The Ct residues critical for autoinhibition cannot reach site1 without site2 dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>), confirming that the closed autoinhibited conformation is mutually exclusive with H-NS multimerization. Our NMR analysis also demonstrated that this autoinhibition is achieved at a low entropic cost, maintaining a high flexibility with respect to the exact distribution of the interacting charges on both site1 and the linker-DNAbd fragment. On the one hand, avoiding the entropic penalty helps the autoinhibitory interaction to prevail against the competing DNA association. (Of note, the covalent link between site1 and the Ct will enhance their local concentration and hence their apparent affinity compared to our measurement based on separate domains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.) On the other hand, the fuzziness of the charge–charge interactions facilitates preserving the capacity for autoinhibition during bacterial evolution and adaptation.</p><p>Based on our refined molecular understanding of <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> H-NS, we then investigated environment-sensing of H-NS orthologs from bacteria that infect plants, bacteria that are endosymbionts of insects, and bacteria that are presumably free-living in or close to a hydrothermal vent. Across all four orthologs, we observed a conceptually similar response to temperature and salt, both overall and on an atomic level, where salt bridges play key roles. This similarity suggests that environment-sensing in H-NS evolved by co-opting an ancestral feature, namely the relative instability of the simple site2 helix-turn-helix dimerization motif. However, marked idiosyncrasies in the response of H-NS orthologs suggest that this ancestral feature was then adapted to fit the current habitat and lifestyle. Thus, our analysis suggests that environment-sensing by H-NS originated from an exaptation followed by adaptation. Our combined computational and experimental structural analysis allowed us to relate the observed in vitro features of this adaptation to events on a residual level: in particular, the salt bridge disposition and stability of site2, and the strength of the autoinhibition governed mostly by the electrostatics of site1 helix α3.</p><p>Although other factors inside bacteria can modify the in vitro behavior of the isolated protein, it is interesting to consider these idiosyncrasies with respect to the bacteria’s habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>):</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Summary of the most notable adaptations in environment-sensing observed for the histone-like nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) orthologs.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57467-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>H-NS<sub>ST</sub> had the highest sensitivity to temperature and salt, in agreement with the critical role of H-NS<sub>ST</sub> in helping Salmonella adapt its gene expression profile depending on if it is inside or outside a warm-blooded mammal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In comparison, we found that the response to temperature was markedly attenuated in H-NS<sub>EA</sub>. <italic>E. amylovora</italic> is the causing agent of fire blight, a contagious disease that mostly affects apples and pears (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vrancken et al., 2013</xref>).

H-NS<sub>BA</sub> site2 interactions were stronger than those of other orthologs, and the features promoting the autoinhibitory form were compromised. Hence, H-NS<sub>BA</sub> may provide a stronger and more robust repression of the genes that it controls.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;.

(If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports a study that combines simulation, NMR and biophysical experiments to determine the molecular basis of environment sensing of the histone-like nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein from enterobacteria, which regulate DNA availability for transcription in response to environmental cues including temperature and salinity. The study compared four orthologs from human, plants, insects and deep-sea hypothermal vent and concluded that the differential strength of the electrostatic interactions at the so-called site 1 of H-NS in its oligomerization may explain the different temperature and salinity-dependence of these orthologs. The authors argue that this provide a molecule mechanism for the adaptive evolution of the H-NS proteins.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The reviewers raised concerns that some of the key conclusions do not have direct experimental support, while the simulation observations are highly qualitative. The conclusion regarding the role of electrostatic interactions in the evolutionary adaption needs substantiation. Point mutations at Site 1 should be tried to validate this conclusion. Alchemical free-energy calculation (FEP) on mutations at selected residues at Site 1 should be considered.</p><p>2) There is not enough direct evidence to attribute the difference in site1 and Ct binding to &quot;dynamic electrostatic interactions&quot;. At minimum, a salt dependence study should be done. Ideally, one should perform site-specific mutagenesis experiments to test some of the specific contacts discussed in detail from MD trajectories.</p><p>3) Regarding the interpretation of how site2 sequences alter sensing sensitivity. The discussion is speculative and rely solely on the presence and absence of various salt bridges during MD. Again, such detailed predictions need to be substantiated by experimental data, such as mutagenesis data.</p><p>4) Has the evolution relied on one or two specific mutations to introduce certain behavior, or relied on some more extensive combination of mutations. The authors should perform more extensive sequence comparison covering more bacteria H-NS proteins in more species.</p><p>5) A key point is the presence of a b-turn in the structure around R90 that inverts the direction of the backbone and allows the formation of differential salt bridges. The authors used heteronuclear-detected NMR pulse sequences to assign the protein resonances and the determine the structural propensity of the protein. Protonless NMR spectroscopy was necessary as the amide resonances broadened beyond detection. How did the author decide the most significant chemical shift changes? Did they use the standard deviation from the average? Is it really the case that the NMR unequivocally determined the short type VIII β-turn in residues 89-92, or that's just one possible conformation consistent with the data. The authors needs to present more details of their analysis and carefully calibrate their claim with respect to this finding. What is the binding affinity between CTst and site 1? what are the concentrations used in NMR? How do we rule out nonspecific effects of CS changes? Figure 4 legend does not have a description of panel C. What coordinates did the authors use to render the residues involved in the b-turn? What type of b-turn is represented? Figure 4 Panels B and C do not seem to match.</p><p>6) The PMF calculation provides a nice and self-consistent picture of the temperature and salt dependence of site2 dimerization. However, site2 is persumably unstable in monomer form based on the authors previous study (and the current one), but how is unfolding accounted for in PMF calculations. Has restraints to the folded structure been applied in the PMF calculation? In any case this potential needs to be discussed in the revision.</p><p>7) The claims regarding exaptation and therapeutics from the Abstract are not even discussed or illustrated.</p><p>8) DLS experiments appear somewhat low in information content. The interpretation of the DLS measurements may be complicated by the interplay of multimerization and intramolecular compaction. This needs to be discussed and calibrated. Mutatgenesis combined with DLS can help. Alternative approaches like analytical ultracentrifugation or non-equilibrium measurements such as SEC would increase the confidence in the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57467.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The reviewers raised concerns that some of the key conclusions do not have direct experimental support, while the simulation observations are highly qualitative.

Alchemical free-energy calculation (FEP) on mutations at selected residues at Site 1 should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we have performed SEC-MALS and DSLS experiments to corroborate our computational predictions that the N-terminal site1 of all four orthologs are stable dimers in the temperature range relevant for environment sensing (i.e. up to ~37 degC; reported in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Thus, we now further substantiate that the sensing mechanism is located on site2 for the orthologs.</p><p>Next, we used site1 point mutations to further support our observations on the evolutionary regulation of the autoinhibitory interaction between the C-terminal region (Ct) and the N-terminal site1. As we explain more in detail in our response to comment 2), these results substantiate the role of electrostatic interactions and of the β-turn in modulating the site1/Ct autoinhibition. The establishment of the N/C cross-reactivity (Figure 5—figure supplement 1) and the use of the autoinhibition-incapable site1-site2 construct for additional experiments (see below and Figure 6) allow us now to separate these two events. These additional data are now included in the manuscript (Figures 6, Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and associated text).</p><p>As suggested, we have carried out more computational analyses to strengthen our observation that site1 is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. We selected all residues on site1 involved in intramolecular interactions (L5, L8, I11, R12, L14, L23, L26, E28, L30, L33, V36, and E39). Each residue was replaced in silico by Ala, Lys, Arg, Glu, Asp, Gln, or Asn, resulting in a total of 81 mutants on site1 to be considered. We then utilized two mutant stability prediction tools, namely Maestro (BMC Bioinformatics 2015, <italic>16</italic>, 116) and PremPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPS/">https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPS/</ext-link>). The mutants that produced a significant destabilizing ΔΔG change of |ΔΔG|&gt;1.0 kcal/mol in both programs were substitutions of hydrophobic residues (see Supplementary file 1D). These mutations that were most destabilizing were: L5A, L5D, L8A, L8K, L8D, L8N, L23A, and L26A. These empirical predictions allow us to focus on several mutants for more reliable free energy calculations, which were carried out with GROMACS. There is an overall agreement between the calculated ΔΔG, but there are some noticeable differences (see Supplementary file 1E). We concluded that while this type of calculation provides a general support to our conclusion about site1 stabilisation through hydrophobic interactions, these conclusions are qualitative, not quantitative. We have added these data and the following sentence to the revised manuscript: “Our in silico mutant stability prediction analysis corroborated qualitatively the importance of hydrophobic residues for stabilising the site1 dimer, in particular of L5, L8, L23 and L26 (Supplementary file 1D and 1E).”</p><p>Concerning site2, we have introduced site-specific mutations to experimentally assess the importance of the “housekeeping” salt bridges R54-E74’ and R54-D71’ and the role of the K57-D68’ salt bridge in conveying salt sensitivity. Using fluorescence anisotropy (as an orthogonal method to DLS) we could demonstrate that these experiments confirm our computational predictions. Of note, these experiments were carried out using the site1-site2 construct (residues 1-83) to avoid potential convolution with a variation of the strength of the autoinhibition. These results are given in more detail in our response to comment 3) and the data are now shown in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is not enough direct evidence to attribute the difference in site1 and Ct binding to &quot;dynamic electrostatic interactions&quot;. At minimum, a salt dependence study should be done. Ideally, one should perform site-specific mutagenesis experiments to test some of the specific contacts discussed in detail from MD trajectories.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that we have already reported the salt dependence study for H-NS<sub>ST</sub> in our previous work [NAR 2019 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gky1299)], where we showed that increasing buffer salt concentration decreases the interaction between the H-NS<sub>ST</sub> site1 and Ct. We therefore focused on the site-specific mutagenesis experiments, as suggested by the reviewer. We experimentally assessed our prediction that the electrostatic surface of site1 helix3 sustains the autoinhibitory conformation through charge-pairing with the Ct. We now show that the <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> (<italic>ST</italic>) double site1 mutant E34K/E42K (which makes the electrostatic surface of site1 more like the one of <italic>B. aphidicola</italic> [<italic>BA</italic>], see Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D) dramatically lowers the N/Ct affinity (as seen in H-NS<sub>BA</sub> site1/Ct interactions), confirming the importance of electrostatics (reported in the extended section “Autoinhibition varies among H-NS orthologs” and data are shown in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We also tested the cross-reactivity of the Ct domains from all three orthologues with the site1 from H-NS<sub>ST</sub>. As predicted, we observe that the interaction between the site1 from H-NS<sub>ST</sub> with the Ct from <italic>E. amylovora</italic> (<italic>EA</italic>) or <italic>I. loihiensis</italic> (<italic>IL</italic>) is similar in strength, supporting that the differences in the site1 are the driving forces for the differential binding of site1/Ct in H-NS<sub>ST</sub>, H-NS<sub>EA</sub> and H-NS<sub>IL</sub>. However, the Ct of H-NS<sub>BA</sub> only shows a very weak interaction with the <italic>ST</italic> site1. While preserving the charge profile of the other Cts (as needed to preserve the overlapping DNA binding surface), H-NS<sub>BA</sub> specifically has a β-turn–breaking proline in the position where a β-turn was observed forming in the site1/Ct interaction in H-NS<sub>ST</sub>. This result with the H-NS<sub>BA</sub> Ct highlights the role of the β-turn in the site1/Ct association, supporting our NMR analysis (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Collectively, these experiments confirm our computational predictions and also support the importance of the Ct betaturn, in agreement with our (now extended) NMR analysis. These experiments are now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1 and discussed in the associated section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regarding the interpretation of how site2 sequences alter sensing sensitivity. The discussion is speculative and rely solely on the presence and absence of various salt bridges during MD. Again, such detailed predictions need to be substantiated by experimental data, such as mutagenesis data.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we have designed a series of site2 mutants, where we have specifically targeted the electrostatic interactions identified computationally. Thus, we have introduced site-specific mutations to experimentally assess the importance of the “housekeeping” salt bridges R54-E74’ and R54-D71’ and the role of the K57-D68’ salt bridge in conveying salt sensitivity. Using fluorescence anisotropy (as an orthogonal method to DLS) on H-NS site1-site2 (without the Ct), we could demonstrate that the R54M substitution leads to the loss of site2-linked multimerization and hence environment sensing. We could also show that introduction of the <italic>IL</italic>-like D68A mutation in H-NS<sub>ST</sub> leads to loss of salt sensitivity, whereas the introduction of the <italic>ST</italic>-like A68D mutation in H-NS<sub>IL</sub> introduces salt sensitivity. These experiments confirmed our computational predictions and are now shown in (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Has the evolution relied on one or two specific mutations to introduce certain behavior, or relied on some more extensive combination of mutations. The authors should perform more extensive sequence comparison covering more bacteria H-NS proteins in more species.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Unfortunately, we might not have enough data to propose an answer. In our work, we wanted wanted to investigate how the H-NS environment sensing mechanism has been adapted to non-mammalian hosts or a free-living lifestyle. Therefore, we searched for bona fide candidate H-NS by BLAST. However, our sequence and 3D modelling analysis identified only H-NS<sub>BA</sub>, H-NS<sub>EA</sub>, and H-NS<sub>IL</sub> as high-confidence H-NS proteins of bacteria with non-mammalian hosts. All other bacteria for which high-confidence H-NS genes are available appear to target mammals as well. Hence, a more extensive sequence annotation would need to be performed once enough high confidence H-NS from bacteria with diverse lifestyles are available. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, we show a preliminary multiple sequence alignment of our available H-NS orthologs and some representative H-NS sequences from H-NS infecting mammals. The boxed positions are those observed to have key roles in environmental sensing through ionic bonds (or absence thereof). As preliminary conclusions, we can state that many orthologues have this site2 well conserved and should function in the same manner as <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>. H-NS<sub>EA</sub> achieves its much-lowered multimerization with only a couple of targeted mutations. H-NS<sub>BA</sub> has a rather derived sequence, reflecting its adaptation to symbiosis. However, the influenza sequence also shows that relatively derived sequences act in mammals. However, experimental investigations would be needed to understand how this orthologue’s sequence affects its environmental response.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57467-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) A key point is the presence of a b-turn in the structure around R90 that inverts the direction of the backbone and allows the formation of differential salt bridges. The authors used heteronuclear-detected NMR pulse sequences to assign the protein resonances and the determine the structural propensity of the protein. Protonless NMR spectroscopy was necessary as the amide resonances broadened beyond detection. How did the author decide the most significant chemical shift changes? Did they use the standard deviation from the average?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. Actually, we used an even more conservative approach: We calculated the combined chemical shift perturbation (CSP) of backbone <sup>13</sup>C atoms, i.e. CSP = sqrt(Δσ<sub>Cα</sub><sup>2</sup> + Δσ<sub>CO</sub><sup>2</sup>), and selected the residues that are above the median+1.5*IQR as the cut off (1.5*IQR is corresponding to ~2.7*st.dev.).

The authors needs to present more details of their analysis and carefully calibrate their claim with respect to this finding.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we fully agree. The identification of the turn comes from the assigned <sup>13</sup>C chemical shifts. The confidence coefficient provided by MICS algorithm based on chemical shifts was 0.69 for type VIII of β turn, with no clear indication of any other stable motifs, only the random coil. This model where the β-turn is the dominant conformation with a minor random coil contribution is in agreement with the RCI-<italic>S</italic><sup>2</sup> order parameter at 0.75-0.77 levels for R<sup>90</sup>-A<sup>91</sup>. Additionally, our analysis of the cross-reactivity between the <italic>ST</italic> site1 and the Ct of the three orthologs further supported the importance of a β-turn at this position (see our response to comment 1 above). Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewers’ suggestion, and we have extended the information given and calibrated the relevant statements according to the reviewers’ suggestion. for example:</p><p>“Upon addition of site1, the local dynamics decreased, particularly within the stretch of four amino acids K89-R90A91-A92 (RCI-S2 &gt; 0.6) that predominantly form the type VIII β-turn according to MICS. Nonetheless, the overall RCIS2 of the linker remained low, although experimental conditions resulted in &gt;99% of ligand saturation of the labeled CtST, demonstrating that the association with site1 did not substantially restrict the linker’s movements (Figure 4D). “ and “The center of this linker region, residues 89–92, rigidified upon binding and predominantly formed a β-turn conformation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the binding affinity between CTst and site 1?</p></disp-quote><p>The K<sub>d</sub> is 4 µM, as shown in Figure 5B, and in agreement with our previous report in NAR 2019 (doi: 10.1093/nar/gky1299).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the concentrations used in NMR?</p></disp-quote><p>The sample with [<sup>13</sup>C,<sup>15</sup>N] H-NS<sub>84–137</sub> and unlabeled H-NS<sub>1–57</sub> had the following concentrations of 150 μm and 1.5 mM, respectively.

However, site2 is persumably unstable in monomer form based on the authors previous study (and the current one), but how is unfolding accounted for in PMF calculations. Has restraints to the folded structure been applied in the PMF calculation? In any case this potential needs to be discussed in the revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that unfolding of originally folded protein may lead to inconsistency in PMF calculation.</p><p>Moreover, originally unfolded regions may become folded during the simulation, and thus influence the PMF as well. In our case, site2 consists of α-helices and has an above-average RMSF in our MD simulations and dissociates in vitro upon heating to ~40 °C. To minimize the influence of the secondary structure on the PMF calculation, we restrained the structure through increasing the force constant k (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, <italic>15</italic>, 4). We did not observe unfolding of the secondary structure when <italic>k</italic> is 12 kcal/(mol Å2) in the Umbrella Sampling. To quantitatively show the conformational change of the secondary structure during the simulation, we measured the helicity percentage at the beginning and at the end of each window. We noticed that for all windows the helicity percentage is approximately 85% (87.5% for the initial models; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> and Figure 3—figure supplement 2). This analysis confirmed that the secondary structure of site2 remained stable during PMF calculation. These observations suggest that the naturally unfolding of site2 under physiological condition takes longer than the timescales in our simulations</p><p>To clarify our points, we have revised our manuscript so that the section 1.2 Simulation setup now also contains the following statement: “In the steered MD simulation, one chain was pulled away along in the direction of increasing the COM distance with a force constant of k = 12 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup> Å<sup>-2</sup>, until the COM distance reached 25 Å.” and “The helicity percentage of initial and final structures was measured for each window.

In our initially submitted version, we had already a paragraph in the Conclusion section discussing the exaptation as a possible origin. To increase the clarity, we have now partially reworded this part to read: “Across all four orthologs, we observed a conceptually similar response to temperature and salt, both overall and on an atomic level, where salt bridges play key roles. This similarity suggests that environment-sensing in H-NS evolved by co-opting an ancestral feature, namely the relative instability of the simple site2 helix-turn-helix dimerization motif. However, marked idiosyncrasies in the response of H-NS orthologs suggest that this ancestral feature was then adapted to fit the current habitat and lifestyle. Thus, our analysis suggests that environment sensing by H-NS originated from an exaptation followed by adaptation. ”</p><p>We think that a better knowledge of the molecular basis for H-NS multimerization and autoinhibition constitutes an important input for conceiving new therapeutics (e.g., for drugs disrupting or stabilising site2 multimerisation). However, we also agree that this statement would deserve a longer discussion. Since drug design is not a major point of our manuscript, we have decided to delete this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) DLS experiments appear somewhat low in information content. The interpretation of the DLS measurements may be complicated by the interplay of multimerization and intramolecular compaction. This needs to be discussed and calibrated. Mutatgenesis combined with DLS can help. Alternative approaches like analytical ultracentrifugation or non-equilibrium measurements such as SEC would increase the confidence in the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we have produced more site1 and site2 mutants and have performed more measurements to confirm the site1 stability and to separate effects on autoinhibition from effects on site2 multimerisation (already outlined in our replies to comments 1-3). Additionally, we have used fluorescence anisotropy as an orthogonal method to DLS, and we have performed SEC-MALS measurements.</p></body></sub-article></article>
