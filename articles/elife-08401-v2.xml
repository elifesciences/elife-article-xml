Many mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins promote tumorigenesis through the gain-of-function (GOF) mechanism. Mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF. Its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we found that BAG2, a protein of Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors. Mechanistically, BAG2 binds to mutp53 and translocates to the nucleus to inhibit the MDM2-mutp53 interaction, and MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53. Thus, BAG2 promotes mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These findings revealed a novel and important mechanism for mutp53 accumulation and GOF in tumors, and also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis through promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08401.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08401.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08401.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer can develop if cells in the body acquire mutations that enable them to grow rapidly to form a mass called a tumor. The gene that encodes a protein called p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human tumors. Most of these mutations result in the production of mutant p53 proteins that are similar in size to the normal protein, but do not work in the same way.</p><p>The normal p53 protein is known as a ‘tumor suppressor’ because it promotes the repair of damaged genetic material and stops the cell from dividing while this repair is underway. Also, it can instruct a cell to die if the damage is too great to repair. However, many of the mutant p53 proteins stop performing these roles and gain new activities that promote tumor growth instead. These activities often rely on the mutant p53 proteins accumulating to very high levels, but it is not clear why this happens.</p><p>Here, Yue, Zhao et al. used biochemical techniques to search for other proteins that can bind to mutant p53 proteins. The experiments reveal that a protein called BAG2 binds to mutant p53 and promotes its accumulation in cancer cells, which increases the activity of mutant p53 in driving tumor growth. Loss of BAG2 leads to a reduction in the level of mutant p53 in cells and inhibits the activity of mutant p53.</p><p>Using a public database of genetic data from human tumors, Yue, Zhao et al. found that human tumor cells often contain higher levels of BAG2 than normal cells. Furthermore, patients with tumors that had high levels of BAG2—and therefore accumulated mutant p53 proteins—were less likely to have positive outcomes after medical treatment.</p><p>Yue, Zhao et al.'s findings suggest that increased production of BAG2 in many tumors may be responsible for the accumulation of mutant p53 proteins that drive tumor growth. A future goal is to develop a new treatment strategy that targets BAG2 in tumors to prevent the accumulation of mutant p53 proteins and therefore block the growth of tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08401.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08401.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mutant p53</kwd><kwd>BAG2</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA160558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Wenwei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01CA143204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Zhaohui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of BAG2—a novel mutant p53 binding protein—in tumors inhibits MDM2-mediated mutant p53 degradation, which leads to the accumulation of mutant p53 protein and promotes tumorigenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levine and Oren, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). Trp53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors; it is mutated in over 50% of all tumors. Majority of Trp53 mutations are missense mutations that are localized in the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD), including several mutational hotspots in tumors (e.g., R175, R248, and R273) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harris and Hollstein, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muller and Vousden, 2014</xref>). Many tumor-associated mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins not only lose the tumor suppressive function of wild-type p53 (wtp53), but also gain new oncogenic activities independently of wtp53, which is defined as mutp53 gain-of-function (GOF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muller and Vousden, 2014</xref>). So far, many mutp53 GOFs have been identified, including promoting tumor growth, metastasis, chemoresistance and metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olive et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blandino et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Freed-Pastor et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Under the non-stressed condition, wtp53 protein levels are kept low in normal cells and tissues mainly through the proteasomal degradation mediated by E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2, the most critical negative regulator for wtp53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks and Gu, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hu et al., 2012</xref>). At the same time, as a direct transcriptional target of p53, MDM2 is up-regulated by p53 under both non-stressed and stressed conditions. Thus, p53 and MDM2 forms a negative feedback loop to tightly regulate p53 protein levels in cells. However, mutp53 proteins often become stable and accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis and contributes greatly to tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oren and Rotter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Freed-Pastor and Prives, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller and Vousden, 2013</xref>). It had long been thought that the inability of MDM2 to degrade mutp53 was the main cause for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. However, recent studies from mice with knock-in of R172H or R270H mutp53 (equivalent to human R175H and R273H mutp53, respectively) challenged this concept. Mutp53 protein is kept at low levels in normal tissues but accumulates to very high levels in tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olive et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, loss of MDM2 in mutp53 knock-in mice leads to mutp53 protein accumulation in normal tissues, which in turn promotes tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Terzian et al., 2008</xref>). Recent studies including ours also showed that MDM2 retains the ability to degrade mutp53 in in vitro cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lukashchuk and Vousden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). These results strongly suggest that while MDM2 maintains mutp53 protein levels low in normal tissues, the disruption of MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation in tumors could be a main cause for the frequently observed mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. Currently, the mechanism underlying the disruption of MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation in tumors is poorly understood. Destabilizing mutp53 to inhibit mutp53 GOF is being actively tested as a novel and promising strategy for cancer therapy. Understanding the underlying mechanism for mutp53 accumulation is critical for the development of novel targets and strategies for cancer therapy.</p><p>In this study, to investigate the mechanism underlying mutp53 accumulation in tumors, we screened for proteins interacting with mutp53 using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays in tumors from R172H mutp53 knock-in mice, and identified BAG2 as a novel mutp53 binding protein that plays a critical role in promoting mutp53 accumulation in tumors. BAG2 belongs to the Bcl-2 associated athanogene (BAG) family, which is characterized by the BAG domain. As a group of multifunctional proteins, BAG proteins interact with a variety of proteins and take part in diverse cellular processes, including cell division, cell death and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takayama and Reed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kabbage and Dickman, 2008</xref>). Currently, the role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis and its underlying mechanism are poorly understood. We found that mutp53 binds to BAG2 and promotes the nuclear translocation of BAG2. The BAG2-mutp53 interaction in the nucleus inhibits the ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53 mediated by MDM2, and thereby promotes mutp53 accumulation and mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. Knockdown of BAG2 greatly decreases mutp53 protein levels in tumors and compromises mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in various types of human tumors. BAG2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in cancer patients and mutp53 accumulation in tumors. These results revealed a novel and critical mechanism for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors, and strongly suggest that BAG2 is a potential target for therapy in tumors carrying mutp53. Our results also uncovered an important role of BAG2 in tumorigenesis and revealed that promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF is a novel mechanism for BAG2 in tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BAG2 is a novel mutp53-interacting protein in Trp53<sup><italic>R172H/R172H</italic></sup> mouse tumors and human cells</title><p>R172H mutp53 knock-in (Trp53<sup><italic>R172H/R172H</italic></sup>) mice mainly develop lymphomas in the spleen and thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olive et al., 2004</xref>).

BAG2 was identified as a potential mutp53 binding protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The BAG2-mutp53 interaction in Trp53<sup><italic>R172H/R172H</italic></sup> tumors was confirmed by co-IP followed by Western blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

To investigate whether BAG2 specifically interacts with mutp53 in human cells, human p53-null lung cancer H1299 cells were transfected with human BAG2-HA expression vectors together with human wtp53 or mutp53 (R175H) expression vectors. Co-IP assays employing either anti-p53 or anti-HA antibodies showed that BAG2 preferentially bound to mutp53 compared with wtp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition to R175H, the strong BAG2-mutp53 interaction was observed in H1299 cells with ectopic expression of different mutp53 proteins, including R248W and R273H, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The interaction between the endogenous BAG2 and mutp53 proteins was also observed in several human cancer cell lines, including human colorectal cancer HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/−</sup>, HT-29 and SW480 cell lines which contain a single copy of Trp53 gene with R248W and R273H mutation, respectively, human breast cancer SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468 cell lines which contain a single copy of Trp53 gene with R175H and R273H mutation, respectively, and human hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cell lines which contain a single copy of Trp53 gene with Y220C mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

BAG2 contains a BAG domain (amino acids 91–211) at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dai et al., 2005</xref>). The fragments containing the BAG domain interacted with mutp53 while the N-terminus of BAG2 protein lacking the BAG domain did not interact with mutp53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, the binding of mutp53 to the BAG2 fragment which lacks the N-terminus is much weaker compared with the full length (FL) BAG2 protein.

Here, we investigated whether BAG2 promotes mutp53 protein accumulation through the inhibition of mutp53 protein ubiquitination and degradation. Since endogenous BAG2 expression levels are relatively higher in Saos2 and HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/−</sup> cells compared with H1299 cells as determined at the RNA and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), experiments with knockdown of endogenous BAG2 were performed by using Saos2 and HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/−</sup> cells, and experiments with ectopic BAG2 expression were performed by using H1299 cells. We found that blocking proteasomal degradation by the proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely abolished the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels in HCT116 p53<sup>R248W/−</sup>, Saos2-R175H, Saos2-R248W and Saos2-R273H cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Ectopic expression of MDM2 clearly down-regulated mutp53 R175H in H1299 cells co-transfected with vectors expressing mutp53 R175H and MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lukashchuk and Vousden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, co-expression of BAG2 largely reduced the degradation of mutp53 protein mediated by MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Consistently, knockdown of endogenous MDM2 clearly increased mutp53 protein levels in Saoa2-R175H cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Notably, the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels was greatly reduced in cells with MDM2 knockdown, indicating that the effect of BAG2 knockdown on mutp53 protein levels is largely mediated by MDM2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). MDM2 directly binds to mutp53 to negatively regulate mutp53. Co-expression of BAG2 clearly decreased the interaction of MDM2 with mutp53 in H1299 cells, which could be an important mechanism by which BAG2 inhibits MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>To investigate whether BAG2 regulates mutp53 protein through inhibiting mutp53 ubiquitination, in vivo ubiquitination assays were employed.

Knockdown of endogenous BAG2 by siRNA increased ubiquitination of mutp53 in Saos2-R175H cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Indeed, in H1299 cells with ectopic expression of BAG2 alone, BAG2 proteins were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm as determined by immunofluorescence (IF) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, we found that mutp53 promoted BAG2 nuclear translocation; ectopic expression of mutp53 (R175H, R248W and R273H), which is mainly localized in the nucleus, clearly increased the translocation of BAG2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in cells transfected with vectors expressing BAG2 together with mutp53. Furthermore, BAG2 was largely co-localized with mutp53 in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, ectopic expression of wtp53, which is also mainly localized in the nucleus, did not have an obvious effect on BAG2 nuclear translocation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The effect of mutp53 on BAG2 nuclear translocation was also confirmed by Western blot assays using whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts isolated from H1299 cells transfected with BAG2 vectors alone or together with mutp53 vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both mutp53 and MDM2 proteins contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) and are mainly localized in the nucleus, where MDM2 binds to and ubiquitinates mutp53 protein. The translocation of BAG2 to the nucleus where it interacts with mutp53 may play an important role in blocking MDM2 to bind to and degrade mutp53. To test this possibility, we constructed the vector expressing the NLS mutant of mutp53 R175H (mutp53<sup>NLS</sup>) by mutating Lys305, Arg306, Lys319, Lys320 and Lys321 to Ala as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Keefe et al., 2003</xref>). Unlike mutp53 proteins which were mainly localized in the nucleus, mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> proteins were mainly localized in the cytoplasm as shown by IF staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). While mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> readily interacted with BAG2 as determined by co-IP assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), mutp53<sup>NLS</sup> could not promote the nuclear translocation of BAG2.

While wtp53 proteins are kept at low levels in normal tissues under normal conditions, mutp53 proteins often accumulate to high levels in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Terzian et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oren and Rotter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muller and Vousden, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, the mechanism for mutp53 accumulation in tumors is poorly understood. Results from mouse genetic experiments with knockout of MDM2 in mutp53 mice and cell-based in vitro experiments suggest that MDM2 maintains mutp53 protein levels low in normal tissues, whereas some changes occurred in tumors disrupt MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation, thereby leading to mutp53 accumulation. Recent studies have reported that HSP90 can bind to mutp53 and reduce mutp53 degradation mediated by MDM2. Knockdown of HSP90 by siRNA or blocking HDAC6-HSP90 axis by SAHA induced destabilization of mutp53 and inhibited its GOF in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Li et al., 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2011b</xref>). Our recent study showed that tumor-derived MDM2 short isoforms inhibited full-length MDM2-mediated mutp53 degradation, which promoted mutp53 accumulation and enhanced GOF in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we searched for the changes that occurred in tumors to disrupt MDM2-meidated mutp53 degradation by screening for mutp53 binding protein in tumors from mutp53 knock-in mice. Results from this study identified that BAG2 is a novel mutp53 binding protein that promotes mutp53 protein accumulation, which revealed a novel mechanism for mutp53 accumulation in tumor cells.</p><p>BAG2 belongs to the BAG family, which is characterized by the BAG domain. The BAG domain is a conserved region located at the C-terminus of the BAG-family proteins that binds to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and has general nucleotide exchange activities towards Hsc70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Takayama and Reed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kabbage and Dickman, 2008</xref>). Therefore, proteins containing the BAG domain often functions as a co-chaperone protein. Aside from the formation of the BAG-Hsc70 interaction, BAG proteins functionally interact with many proteins to regulate cellular functions. The expression of BAG2 has been detected in many tissues. Recently, it was reported that BAG2 interacts with and stabilizes PINK1 and ataxin3-80Q, proteins involved in neurological diseases, through inhibiting their ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Che et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2014</xref>). BAG2 can also deliver Tau to the proteasome for protein degradation independently of ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carrettiero et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we found that BAG2 preferentially binds to mutp53 at the DBD domain. BAG2 can interact with many different mutp53, including several tumor-associated mutational hotspots. This BAG2-mutp53 interaction is conserved in both human tumor cells and mouse tissues. It is unclear how BAG2 can discriminate between the DBD of a diverse range of mutp53 proteins and wtp53. BAG2 is a co-chaperone protein. It is possible that conformational changes of mutp53 proteins lead to its association with chaperone and co-chaperone proteins. It remains unclear whether BAG2 interacts with mutp53 directly or interacts with mutp53 through other protein, such as Hsc70, which will be of interest to investigate in future studies.</p><p>The role of BAG2 in tumor is poorly understood. In this study, we found that mutp53 interacted with BAG2 and promoted the translocation of BAG2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where BAG2 inhibited the binding of MDM2 to mutp53 and the ubiquitination and degradation of mutp53 protein mediated by MDM2. It is unclear how the BAG2-mutp53 interaction interferes with the MDM2-mutp53 interaction since MDM2 binds to the N-terminus of mutp53 whereas BAG2 binds to the DBD of mutp53. Future studies are needed to further understand its mechanism. Results from this study showed that BAG2 promoted mutp53 protein accumulation in tumor cells, which in turn promoted mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Knockdown of endogenous BAG2 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, metastasis and chemoresistance of tumor cells in a largely mutp53-dependent manner in cultured cells and/or in mice. These results strongly suggest that targeting BAG2 could be developed as a novel strategy to destabilize mutp53 and inhibit its GOF in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Importantly, analysis of several database from Oncomine showed that BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in many types of cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Overexpression of BAG2 is significantly associated with poor prognosis in different types of cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>). Furthermore, our results showed that BAG2 overexpression in colorectal tumors is significantly associated with mutp53 protein accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). These results strongly suggest that BAG2 plays an important role in tumorigenesis and promoting mutp53 accumulation and GOF is a novel mechanism for BAG2 in tumorigenesis. It is unclear why not all tumors with BAG2 overexpression showed the accumulation of mutp53 protein. It is possible that additional mechanisms are involved in the regulation of mutp53 protein levels and/or the BAG2-mutp53 interaction. It will be interesting to examine whether BAG2 displays weak or no interaction with mutp53 protein in this subgroup of tumor samples in future studies. It is also worth noting that while normal tissues from Trp53<sup><italic>R172H/R172H</italic></sup> mice express a lot of BAG2, there is a limited amount of interacted BAG2-mutp53 protein complex and no clear accumulation of mutp53 proteins in the normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that some tumor-specific events might contribute to the effect of BAG2 on mutp53 accumulation.</p><p>Data from cBioportal showed amplification of the <italic>BAG2</italic> gene in many types of human tumors, suggesting that gene amplification is an important mechanism for BAG2 overexpression in human tumors. Considering that less than 10% of tumors had the amplification of BAG2 in majority of tumor types, it is possible that additional mechanisms contribute to BAG2 overexpression in tumors, which needs further investigation in future studies.</p><p>Taken together, results from this study demonstrate that BAG2 interacts with mutp53 to prevent its degradation by MDM2, leading to mutp53 accumulation in tumor cells and enhanced mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis. Knockdown of BAG2 greatly reduces mutp53 protein levels in tumor cells and greatly compromises mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis, including tumor growth, metastasis and chemoresistance. Considering that BAG2 is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells, our findings revealed a new and important mechanism for mutp53 protein accumulation in tumors. Trp53 is the most frequently-mutated gene in tumors. Mutp53 protein is frequently accumulated in tumors, which is critical for mutp53 GOF in tumor development. Therefore, mutp53 has become an extremely attractive target for tumor therapy. Our findings that BAG2 promotes mutp53 protein accumulation and mutp53 GOF in tumorigenesis strongly suggest that BAG2 could be a potential target for cancer therapy in tumors containing mutp53.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, mouse strains, constructs and cell treatments</title><p>Human lung cancer H1299, osteosarcoma Saos2, breast cancer SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-468, colorectal cancer HT29, SW480 and hepatocellular carcinoma Huh-7 cell lines were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA).

Why, for example, do some tumors have increased BAG but no accumulation of mutant p53.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Yue and colleagues make effort to solve the conundrum in the p53 field about what controls the levels of mutant p53 in tumor cells. Previously, it was believed that because mutant p53 does not transactivate its ubiquitin ligase MDM2, the level of mutant p53 in cells is very high. However, two groups created mutant p53 knock-in mice, and failed to see high levels of mutant p53 in tissues from these mice, only in tumors, thus dispelling this hypothesis. Yue and colleagues solve this issue, and this is a very significant finding, not just for the p53 field, but for the field of cancer, as mutant p53 is known to contribute to tumor aggressiveness in many ways.</p><p>The authors perform mass spec of mutant-p53 interacting proteins in normal and tumor cells and (in addition to reporting the entire list of mutant p53 binding proteins, which is important) they show that BAG2 is a major binder. They prove the interaction occurs for endogenous mutant p53 and BAG2, they map the interaction domains to the DNA binding domain of p53 and the BAG domain of BAG2. Importantly, they show that BAG2 is translocated to the nucleus by mutant, but not wtp53, and that silencing BAG2 destabilizes mutant p53 by removing the ability of BAG2 to inhibit interaction between mutant p53 and MDM2. In an elegant series of experiments, the authors show that silencing BAG2 inhibits the “gain of function” activity of mutant p53 (resistance to 5FU, migration and metastasis), and further they show that silencing BAG2 inhibits the development of tumors with mutant p53, but not null for p53. The authors go on to show that elevated BAG2 is a marker of poor prognosis in several tumor types, and that BAG2 mRNA levels are associated with mutant p53 staining.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well-controlled, well-written and highly significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors identify a series of proteins from tumors in mice that bind p53<sup>R172H</sup> and characterize BAG2. They characterize the domains of each protein that interact and show that BAG2 prevents mutant p53 interactions with MDM2. BAG2 knockdown experiments showed decreased migration in tissue culture and decreased metastasis in nude mice. The last figure shows correlations in human cancers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper and the data presented are exceptionally clear and convincing. I don't have any criticisms of the work as it stands. My questions are more around the mechanism. Why has BAG2 evolved to specifically bind mutant p53 and how can it discriminate between the DNA binding domains of a diverse range of mutant p53 s compared to wild type? How does BAG2 interfere with MDM2 binding? I don't think the authors can answer all of these questions but they might pose them and speculate.</p><p>Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows that in the normal tissue of mutant p53 expressing mice, there seems to be no effect of BAG2 on mp53 stabilization, despite lots of BAG2 expression. It might be useful to explore this a bit more – is the BAG2 not bound to p53 here? Why not? There must be some tumor-specific event that allows BAG2 to stabilize p53, but this is independent of BAG2 expression levels (in this case I'm not sure what the relevance of overexpression of BAG2 in tumors really is). Maybe this could be explored in normal and transformed versions of the same cell line?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08401.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Despite overall positive reviews on your paper, there were two issues that were raised during consultation between the reviewers and the member of the board that is handling this paper.</italic></p><p><italic>First, with the exception of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 1</italic></xref> <italic>where the authors do a co-IP in SK-BR-3 cells, all other experiments in human cells are in either H1299 and Saos2 p53 null cells or HCT116 cells each of which came from tumors that did not have mutant p53.

We agree with the reviewers that additional data obtained from more cancer cell lines with endogenous mutp53 can provide important information about the generality of BAG2-mutp53 interaction. We have employed human colorectal cancer cell lines HT-29 (mutp53 R273H), SW480 (mutp53 R273H), human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 (mutp53 R273H) and human hepatocellular cancer cell line Huh-7 (mutp53 Y220C) to examine the interaction between the endogenous BAG2 and mutp53 proteins by co-IP assays. In the revised manuscript, we have presented new data showing that the BAG2-mutp53 interaction was observed in all these cell lines. These data in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref> strongly suggest the generality of BAG2-mutp53 interaction in human tumor cells.</p><p><italic>Second, the authors should examine normal tissues (or cells therefrom) expressing mutant p53 where there is a lot of BAG2 but no stabilization of p53 to see if in this setting BAG2 binds to mutant p53.

The reviewers raised a very good point that while normal thymus tissues from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> mice express a lot of BAG2, there is no apparent effect of BAG2 on mutp53 accumulation in normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (see detailed response to Reviewer 3). The reviewers provided a very good suggestion to carefully analyze the BAG2-mutp53 interaction in normal tissues from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> expressing mice. We re-analyzed the raw data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. We observed lower levels of mutp53 protein and weak interaction between BAG2 and mutp53 in normal thymus tissues from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> expressing mice after longer exposure. We have presented the film with longer exposure time in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. In addition, we examined the interaction between BAG2 and mutp53 in normal kidney and spleen tissues in addition to thymus tissues collected from mutp53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> expressing mice. In all these tissues, we observed weak interaction between BAG2 and mutp53. These data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, which suggest that some additional tumor-specific changes might contribute to the effect of BAG2 on mutp53 accumulation. We have added the following to the Discussion: “It is also worth noting that while normal tissues from p53<sup>R172H/R172H</sup> mice express a lot of BAG2, there is a limited amount of interacted BAG2-mutp53 protein complex and no clear accumulation of mutp53 proteins in the normal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that some tumor-specific events might contribute to the effect of BAG2 on mutp53 accumulation.”</p><p><italic>Minor points:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors are encouraged to test whether BAG2 binds to p53 directly in an</italic> in vitro <italic>binding assay, or to state clearly in the Discussion that whether BAG2 binds to p53 directly, or is brought by Hsc70, is not yet clear.</italic></p><p>Thanks for this very good suggestion. It is unclear whether BAG2 binds to mutp53 directly or indirectly.

We further discussed our findings in the Discussion. In particular, we stated that not all tumors with BAG2 overexpression showed the accumulation of mutp53 protein: “It is unclear why not all tumors with BAG2 overexpression showed the accumulation of mutp53 protein […].

While currently we don’t have final answers for these questions, we added following to the Discussion: “In this study, we found that BAG2 preferentially binds to mutp53 at the DBD domain […].

Future studies are needed to further understand its mechanism.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
