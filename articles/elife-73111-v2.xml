These cells undergo developmental and maturational changes involving VDJ recombination, somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, altogether shaping their immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) repertoire. Here, we sequenced the IgH repertoire of naïve, marginal zone, switched and plasma cells from 10 healthy adults along with matched unsorted and <italic>in silico</italic> separated CD19<sup>+</sup> bulk B cells. Using advanced bioinformatic analysis and machine learning, we show that sorted B cell subpopulations are characterised by distinct repertoire characteristics on both the individual sequence and the repertoire level. Sorted subpopulations shared similar repertoire characteristics with their corresponding <italic>in silico</italic> separated subsets. Furthermore, certain IgH repertoire characteristics correlated with the position of the constant region on the IgH locus. Overall, this study provides unprecedented insight over mechanisms of B cell repertoire control in peripherally circulating B cell subpopulations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>repertoire</kwd><kwd>immunoglobulin</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>prediction</kwd><kwd>diagnostics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_161147</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trück</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PZ00P3_183777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trück</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005688</institution-id><institution>Gottfried und Julia Bangerter-Rhyner-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trück</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012654</institution-id><institution>Olga Mayenfisch Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trück</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Palatin-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trück</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011224/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovaltsuk</surname><given-names>Aleksandr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UCB Pharma Ltd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovaltsuk</surname><given-names>Aleksandr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Industrial Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovaltsuk</surname><given-names>Aleksandr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>IgH repertoires of physically sorted and bioinformatically selected B cell subpopulations overlap and are characterised by distinct repertoire characteristics, while certain repertoire features correlate with the position of the constant region on the IgH locus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>B cell development starts in the bone marrow where immature B cells must assemble and express on their surface a functional but non-self-reactive B cell antigen receptor (BCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefranc and Lefranc, 2001</xref>). The generation of the heavy and light chain of the BCR is mediated by the random and imprecise process of V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tonegawa, 1983</xref>). Further development of B cells occurs in the periphery in response to stimulation with the process of somatic hypermutation (SHM) through which point mutations are introduced in the genes coding for the V(D)J part of the immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) and light chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jolly et al., 1996</xref>). Subsequently, B cells with a mutated BCR providing increased antigen affinity are selected and show increased survival and proliferation capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zheng et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, class switch recombination (CSR) modifies the IgH constant region, resulting in the generation of B cells with nine different immunoglobulin isotypes or isotype subclasses, namely IgD, IgM, IgG1-4, IgA1/2 and IgE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stavnezer et al., 2008</xref>). This process involves the replacement of the proximal heavy chain constant gene by a more distal gene. Class switching is an essential mechanism during humoral immune responses as the constant region of an antibody determines its effector function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vidarsson et al., 2014</xref>). Both direct switching and sequential switching upon a second round of antigen exposure have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horns et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cameron et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 1994</xref>).</p><p>Through developmental mechanisms and further differentiation in the periphery, several phenotypically distinct circulating B cell subpopulations are generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allman and Pillai, 2008</xref>). They include naïve, marginal zone (MZ), switched memory B cells and plasma cells (PC), which are mainly characterised by their differential expression of surface markers and by playing distinct roles in the adaptive immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leandro, 2013</xref> ) High-throughput sequencing of the IgH repertoire (AIRR-seq) has made it possible to improve our understanding of the different components of the adaptive immune system in health and disease, and following vaccine challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mandric et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghraichy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindau and Robins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Georgiou et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies using both high- and low-throughput sequencing techniques have already reported important differences between B cell subpopulations affecting their IgH repertoire composition, VDJ gene usage, mutations and clonality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mroczek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Recent AIRR-seq workflows allow coverage of a sufficient part of the IgH constant region in addition to the VDJ region, making it possible to assign antibody classes and subclasses on an individual sequence level. It is common practice to use unsorted bulk B cells from peripheral blood as a starting material and use the constant region information combined with the degree of SHM to group transcripts <italic>in silico</italic> into different B cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glanville et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghraichy et al., 2020</xref>). Using isotype-resolved IgH sequencing of bulk B cells, isotype subclasses have been found to show differences in their repertoire characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitaura et al., 2017</xref>). However, it remains unknown how the IgH repertoire of bioinformatically separated transcripts originating from bulk-sequenced B cells compares to the repertoire of their corresponding circulating B cell subpopulations. It is also unknown how IgH sequences with the same constant region originating from different cell types compare.</p><p>Here, we used an established AIRR-seq workflow that captures the diversity of the variable IgH genes together with the isotype subclass usage to study in detail the repertoire of CD19<sup>+</sup> bulk B cells as well as flow cytometry sorted naïve, MZ, switched and PCs from 10 healthy adults. We applied statistical methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), k-means clustering, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and machine learning algorithms to combine several repertoire metrics and characterise the different B cell subpopulations. We show that transcripts from physically sorted B cell subpopulations share similar characteristics with their corresponding subsets in the bulk that were grouped <italic>in silico</italic> using isotype subclass information and number of mutations. We further demonstrate that sequences with the same isotype subclass originating from different cell types are closely related, suggesting the presence of isotype-specific rather than cell-type-specific signatures in the IgH repertoire. We finally correlate these signatures to the isotype subclass positioning on the locus and find that downstream subclasses exhibit enhanced signs of maturity, overall providing new insights into the selection and the peripheral differentiation of distinct B cell subpopulations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Physically sorted B cell subpopulations and their corresponding subsets in the bulk share similar repertoire characteristics</title><p>We compared IgH repertoire characteristics between the following B cell subpopulations: B<sub>naive</sub>, B<sub>MZ</sub>, B<sub>PC_MD</sub>, B<sub>PC_AG</sub> and B<sub>switched</sub> and their corresponding subsets that we obtained <italic>in silico</italic> from B<sub>bulk</sub>: B<sub>bulk_naïve</sub>, B<sub>bulk_MD</sub> and B<sub>bulk_switched</sub>.

To test whether this clustering pattern was driven by VJ gene usage, complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 physiochemical properties or the general repertoire metrics, we analysed these variables separately. Using V family and J gene usage, there was a clear separation between naïve and memory cells mostly driven by differences in V1/3 and J4/6 usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, no separation between B<sub>MZ</sub>/B<sub>PC_MD</sub>/ B<sub>bulk_MD</sub> and B<sub>switched</sub>/B<sub>PC_AG</sub>/B<sub>bulk_switched</sub> was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The CDR3 physiochemical properties alone created similar clusters as when combined together with the other metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This separation was mostly driven by a lower basic and a higher aromatic content in addition to a higher gravy index and a lower polarity in B<sub>naive</sub>/B<sub>bulk_naïve</sub> compared to memory subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This allowed for an in-depth understanding of the mechanisms underlying B cell responses. We report differences in V family and J gene usage, CDR3 physiochemical properties and global repertoire characteristics that similarly distinguish between naïve, IgM/IgD memory and class-switched subsets both at the repertoire and at the sequence level. Furthermore, we show alterations in the repertoire characteristics at the isotype subclass level unrelated to cell type that correlate with the position of the constant gene on the IgH locus. This study provides powerful insight on biological mechanisms underlying the B cell response as well as novel understanding of AIRR-seq methodologies to be taken into account in future studies.</p><p>Earlier studies have revealed differences in gene usage and repertoire properties between different sorted B cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mroczek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briney et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larimore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, some differences in repertoire characteristics across isotype subclasses have been determined by using bulk B cells as starting material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitaura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Jong et al., 2017</xref>). However, studies combining IgH sequencing from both bulk and sorted B cell subpopulations have been sparse. Here, we sought to compare IgH repertoire properties between transcripts sorted <italic>in silico</italic> from bulk B cells and physically sorted B cell subpopulations. In addition, using isotype-resolved sequencing, we aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the IgH repertoire of transcripts with the same constant region originating from different cell types and correlate the differences in repertoire with position on the IgH locus. The type of material obtained, the sequencing depth and the experimental and computational methods used here constitute by far the most thorough and comprehensive analysis of repertoire differences between B cell subsets and isotype subclasses and thereby provide unique insights into the underlying mechanisms, leading to the formation of different B cell subpopulations.</p><p>Previous work involving human naïve and antigen-experienced B cell repertoires havs shown naïve B cells to have shorter junctions and higher usage of IGHJ6 and IGHV3, and lower usage of IGHJ4 and IGHV1 compared with IgM memory and switched B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briney et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larimore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DeWitt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2020</xref>). Differences in gene usage and CDR3 properties between IgM memory and switched B cells have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). IgM memory and switched B cells have been found to use more negatively charged residues and to have less hydrophobic junctions compared with naïve B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mroczek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we focused on a more detailed examination of the repertoires by combining multiple characteristics using dimensionality reduction methods. Results of a previous study revealed that combining only a few repertoire characteristics is sufficient to discriminate between B cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galson et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, an LDA combining V gene family proportions has been found to successfully distinguish between IgM and IgG repertoires (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Friedensohn et al., 2018</xref>). We extend these findings by showing that using V family and J gene usage, CDR3 physiochemical properties or global repertoire characteristics similarly allow to separate between naïve and memory subpopulations. This suggests that distinct B cell subpopulations derive from different developmental mechanisms and are subject to selective processes that lead to similar variable gene identity. The importance of the CDR3 and its location at the centre of the antigen-binding site makes the observed differences in physiochemical properties and junction length interesting. These findings may suggest that different B cells subpopulations stimulated by diverse antigens have distinct junction compositions and properties. Further work to investigate CDR3-specific residue content and prediction of CDR3 protein structures could be enriching for antibody specificity and antigen recognition in different B cell subpopulations.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that same B cell subpopulations from different donors are more similar in their repertoire characteristics than different B cell subpopulations within an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briney et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rubelt et al., 2016</xref>). This has led to the understanding that differences between naïve and memory cells are conserved across unrelated individuals. Our findings are in agreement with these observations, and we extend on those by showing that the main defining factor in repertoire similarity is the constant region type, namely the isotype subclass, and that differences between subclasses are conserved across both cell type and individual. This finding suggests the existence of an isotype-based mechanism for repertoire control that is constant across cell types and individuals.</p><p>In addition to the comparative analysis of the different peripheral B cell subsets, our study represents, to our knowledge, the first comparison of bulk B cell sequencing with sorted B cell subpopulations. We showed that sequencing unsorted B cells from peripheral blood and combining the constant region information with the degree of SHM to bioinformatically group transcripts yields accurate results comparable to physical sorting, especially when analysing global repertoire characteristics. We acknowledge that this might be limiting in tasks sensitive to potential biases from different RNA levels per cell such as identifying antigen-specific sequences from PCs.</p><p>Recent IgH repertoire studies have moved towards using machine learning and artificial intelligence in contrast to traditional statistical approaches for goals including vaccine design, immunodiagnostics and antibody discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greiff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostmeyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konishi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shemesh et al., 2021</xref>). Previous work has focused on representing repertoires as sequence or subsequence-based features, that is, overlapping amino acid k-mers and their Atchley biophysiochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greiff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ostmeyer et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we report a simple pairwise classifier that successfully predicts the cell type of a sequence based on only the commonly used sequence attributes such as number of mutations and junction length. Random forest and decision tree classifiers outperformed the logistic regression algorithm suggesting a non-linear separation between cell types. A common concern when applying machine learning is the possibility of over-fitting. To prevent this, we trained the algorithm on 80% of the data and tested its performance on the remaining unseen 20%. We also subsampled every pair of classes to equal number of sequences in order to balance the dataset. The model presented here is applied only within an individual and is thereby confined by repertoire signals that might be individual-specific. More work improving the generalisability of the model across individuals would be revolutionising in terms of its potential practical applications. Unsurprisingly, the number of mutations was the most important feature in distinguishing between most cell types. These results, along with previous work, are promising and suggest that increasing the predictive potential of machine learning methods could help in finding sequence characteristics that distinguish between groups, such as disease state and healthy.</p><p>Studies indicate that both direct and sequential CSR to IgM-distal isotype subclasses can occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wesemann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Looney et al., 2016</xref>). Several studies have provided evidence for sequential CSR. IgM was found to commonly switch to proximal subclasses (IgG1, IgA1 and IgG2), but direct switches from IgM to more downstream subclasses (IgG4, IgE or IgA2) were rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horns et al., 2016</xref>). It has also been reported that a deficiency in IgG3, the most IgM-proximal subclass, frequently results in a decrease in other IgG subclasses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyts et al., 2006</xref>). Although it is challenging to determine whether sequential CSR occurs during a primary response, by re-entry into the germinal centre or during a secondary response to the same antigen, we and others have shown that IgM-distal subclasses accumulate with age, likely due to secondary encounter with antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghraichy et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">IJspeert et al., 2016</xref>). Studies comparing the mean mutation number between isotype subclasses have shown contradicting results. In one study, mutations varied in relation to the constant region position on the IgH locus, with the closest to IgM (IgG3) having the lowest mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2014</xref>), while in another study, no such difference was observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitaura et al., 2017</xref>). We did not find a difference in number of mutations among IgG subclasses. Our findings rather suggest that mutation is more efficient in more downstream subclasses as we found that these exhibit higher R/S ratios and selection pressure in the CDR, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Jong et al., 2017</xref>). Generally, class-switched IgM-distal subclasses showed signs of maturity (shorter junctions, lower IGHV4-34 usage) while transcripts from class-switched IgM proximal subclasses were more similar to those of naïve B cells. These results suggest that sequential CSR subjects B cells to selective forces, leading to more mature variable gene properties without necessarily accumulating more mutations.</p><p>In summary, in this study we took an extensive look at the IgH repertoire of different flow cytometry sorted as well as bioinformatically grouped cell types and isotype subclasses of healthy individuals. Using advanced bioinformatic tools, statistical analysis and machine learning, this analysis provides deep insight into the different mechanisms of B cell development and boosts our understanding of the B cell system components in health. The data and methods presented here provide a foundation for future work investigating the immune repertoire of patients with altered immune status and hold promise for the application of AIRR-seq along with machine learning techniques in clinical and diagnostic settings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"> Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"> Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"> Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"> Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"> Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human CD19-PE (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 363003; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2564125">AB_2564125</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (5 μl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human CD27-FITC (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 302806; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_314298">AB_314298</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (5 μl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human CD38-APC/Fire 750 (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 356626; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2616713">AB_2616713</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (5 μl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human IgD-APC (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 348222; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2561595">AB_2561595</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (5 μl per test)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-human IgM-Pacific Blue (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BioLegend</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# 314513; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_10574306">AB_10574306</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FACS (5 μl per test)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sample collection and cell sorting</title><p>This was a descriptive study, hence no formal sample size calculation was performed.

issues to uncover IgH repertoires in different isotype-specific groups and shed significant lights on a better understanding of adaptive immune systems.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Different B cell subpopulations show distinct patterns in their IgH repertoire metrics&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Wanli Liu (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the reviewer 2 has voiced, by fairly referring previous literatures, authors should mention what is the unique outcome from this study, compared with our previous knowledge; indeed, differences in IgH repertoire among different B cell subsets has been already demonstrated by many previous studies. In addition, authors should mention biological implications from this study in a way easily understood by the biologists.</p><p>2) Age dependence is important. Thus, analysis of the correlation and proportion of mean mutation concerning the age of enrolled people should be done.</p><p>3) The authors demonstrated that IgH of different Ig classes and IgG subclasses show distinct repertoire depending on the distance from Cmu. This finding is novel. However, IgH repertoire of marginal zone B cells and plasma cells producing IgM/IgD supports this conclusion only in some parameters such as number of somatic mutations but not other parameters such as junction length. Moreover, proportion of unique junctions is more influenced by plasma cell differentiation than Ig classes. Therefore, the conclusion of this part needs to be revised.</p><p>4) The minimal sampling proportion required to perform the study is of crucial importance.

In the current study, the authors solved the connection that transcripts from mechanically sorted B cell subgroups have identical qualities to their bulk counterpart's subsets, which were clustered <italic>in silico</italic> using isotype subclass knowledge and the multitude of mutations. The authors further showed that different cell types corresponding to the same isotype subclass have similar sequences, implying that the IgH repertoire contains isotype-specific rather than cell-type-specific characteristics. Most impressively, the authors link these signatures to isotype subclass location on the locus and discover that downstream subclasses have more mature signals. Overall, this is a very impressive and innovative approach for studying the process and adds another layer of information into understanding the mechanisms underlying B-cell responses and uncover critical relevance of AIRR-seq approaches that will be used in future research.</p><p>Author's contribution and structure of the proposed study: The prescribed findings would be a timely update to fulfill the gaps of previously missed issues to uncover IgH repertoires in different isotype-specific groups and shed significant light on a better understanding of adaptive immune responses. The Candidate has achieved the proposed issues precisely. The findings are presented clearly and concisely, with adequate explanation and interpretation. The results support the theme logically, and the methods have been implemented in a balanced way to achieve the results. The discussion provides a critical elaboration of the results obtained. These studies in the future may provide detailed insights for adaptive immune researchers struggling to develop therapeutic drugs to treat several autoimmune and BCRs structural interlinked diseases. However, including autoimmune disease patients could further help researchers get detailed insights to extract the precise conclusion.</p><p>Strengths and weaknesses of the study: This study provides detailed insights into healthy individuals' IgH repertoire characteristics. Previous investigations have concentrated mainly on showing repertoires as a sequence or subsequence-based features. However, these investigations provided a brief pairwise predictor that effectively predicts a sequence's cell type based on the most often utilized sequence parameters, such as the number of mutations and junction length. On the other hand, these studies provide investigations within individuals. However, the feasibility of the model should be enhanced across the individuals. Moreover, interrogating the importance of IgH repertoire characteristics in B cells subsets during diseased conditions or concerning specific age should be paid explicit attention in the future through applying these sound approaches.</p><p>Before the publication, the following few points should be well considered:</p><p>1 – The authors use ten healthy individuals as readout; however, how V and J repertoire characteristics behave in people of different ages are missing. Secondly, the mean mutation parameter has been interestingly discussed in these studies with isotype-specific subclasses suggesting that, mutation most commonly is seen in downstream subclasses. As per my opinion, it would be interesting to analyze the correlation and proportion of mean mutation concerning the age of enrolled people. The authors can beautifully select people of different ages to analyze the results.</p><p>2 – Few terminologies such as PCA, LDA, CDR3 are used at high frequency; I suggest elaborating their abbreviation in the introduction section for better clarity.</p><p>3 – At the end of the Discussion part, a concluding sentence should be incorporated, illustrating how these algorithmic tools, together with machine learning techniques, can advance our understanding of immunology and address unmet clinical needs related to infectious diseases, immune dysregulation.</p><p>4 – The minimal sampling proportion required to perform the study is of crucial importance. In the material and method section, references should be incorporated, suggesting how the sampling size of 10 healthy individuals has been selected.</p><p>These studies comprehensively provided a model to check IgH repertoire within individuals, specifically in healthy individuals, possibly confined by individual-specific repertoire signals. However, it would be fascinating to incorporate diseased individuals in the study to elaborate on the system's feasibility. I would suggest adding few lines in the discussion part as a dimension of future work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this paper, the authors analyzed IgH repertoire of various B cell subsets from human donors such as naïve, marginal zone and switched B cells and plasma cells producing IgM or IgD and those producing IgA or IgG using bioinformatic analysis and machine learning.

The authors demonstrated that marginal zone B cells and plasma cells producing IgM or IgD show similar IgH repertoire whereas IgH repertoire in switched B cells is similar to that of plasma cells producing IgG or IgA but distinct from the other subsets.

However, IgH repertoire of marginal zone B cells and plasma cells producing IgM/IgD supports this conclusion only in some parameters such as number of somatic mutations but not other parameters such as junction length. Moreover, proportion of unique junctions is more influenced by plasma cell differentiation than Ig classes. Therefore, the conclusion of this part needs to be revised.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73111.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) As the reviewer 2 has voiced, by fairly referring previous literatures, authors should mention what is the unique outcome from this study, compared with our previous knowledge; indeed, differences in IgH repertoire among different B cell subsets has been already demonstrated by many previous studies. In addition, authors should mention biological implications from this study in a way easily understood by the biologists.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following paragraph to our discussion clearly stating our research questions and novelty in contrast with previous work:</p><p>“Earlier studies have revealed differences in gene usage and repertoire properties between different sorted B cell subpopulations. In addition, some differences in repertoire characteristics across isotype subclasses have been determined by using bulk B cells as starting material. However, studies combining IgH sequencing from both bulk and sorted B cell subpopulations have been sparse. Here, we sought to compare IgH repertoire properties between transcripts sorted <italic>in silico</italic> from bulk B cells and physically sorted B cell subpopulations. In addition, using isotype-resolved sequencing, we aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the IgH repertoire of transcripts with the same constant region originating from different cell types and correlate the differences in repertoire with position on the IgH locus. The type of material obtained, the sequencing depth, and the experimental and computational methods used here constitute by far the most thorough and comprehensive analysis of repertoire differences between B cell subsets and isotype subclasses and thereby provide unique insights into the underlying mechanisms leading to formation of different B cell subpopulations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Age dependence is important.

We and others have previously looked at the effect of age on the IgH repertoire characteristics in detail (Ghraichy, 2020; IJspeert, 2016). These studies have shown that maturation of the B cell compartment with age is primarily observed as an increase in the number of mutations, with most changes occurring in the first decade of life. Changes continue to be made thereafter, but at a much lower rate. Using the data in the present manuscript, additional correlation analysis was conducted for all repertoire characteristics that have been shown to be age dependent in a previous analysis using the same sequencing and analysis protocol (Ghraichy, 2020). This analysis revealed a positive correlation between the number of mutations and age, and between R/S ratio in CDR and age but only in IgG2 transcripts. No age-dependent correlation was observed for any other subsets. However, because of the number of individuals included and their age range, we decided not to include this analysis as we thought it did not add any important value to previous findings. Because our proposed results are based on an intraindividual and cross-subgroup analysis, we believe that our results are valid in general, despite isolated age dependence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors demonstrated that IgH of different Ig classes and IgG subclasses show distinct repertoire depending on the distance from Cmu.
