In yeast, retromer and Snx4 coat complexes are recruited to the endosomal surface, where they recognize cargos. They sort cargo and deform the membrane into recycling tubules that bud from the endosome and target to the Golgi. Here, we reveal that the SNX-BAR protein, Mvp1, mediates an endosomal recycling pathway that is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane and sorts cargos containing a specific sorting motif into a membrane tubule. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission and release of the recycling tubule. Similarly, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, which has been also implicated in Alzheimer’s disease, mediates formation of an endosomal recycling tubule. Thus, we present evidence for a novel endosomal retrieval pathway that is conserved from yeast to humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retromer</kwd><kwd>SNX8</kwd><kwd>dynamin</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>BAR domain</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007231</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant CU3704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emr</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PX-BAR Mvp1 and dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive retromer-independent endosomal recycling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recycling sorting components (eg, receptors, SNAREs, transporters, etc) in the endo-lysosome system are essential for the normal assembly and function of the lysosome. The best-characterized recycling cargo is yeast Vps10. Vps10, the first member of the sortilin receptor family, is a transmembrane (TM) protein receptor that sorts carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) into vesicles at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marcusson et al., 1994</xref>). After CPY-containing vesicles are transported to the endosome, the endosome matures and fuses with the vacuole, delivering soluble CPY to the vacuole lumen. Unlike CPY, which is released from the Vps10 receptor in the endosome, Vps10 is not delivered to the vacuole. It is recycled from the endosome back to the Golgi by retromer, making Vps10 available for additional rounds of CPY sorting. Retromer is an evolutionarily conserved protein coat complex composed of five proteins: Vps5, Vps17, Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seaman et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2019</xref>). It deforms the endosomal membrane to form cargo-containing recycling tubules/vesicles. In humans, the loss of retromer function alters the cellular localization of hundreds of TM proteins.

Interestingly, two single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the SNX8 (the human homolog of MVP1) gene locus are associated with late-onset AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenthal et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2019</xref> report that the SNX8 expression level is significantly lower in AD patients and APP/PS1 AD mouse brain. Overexpression of SNX8 suppresses the accumulation of fragments of amyloid precursor protein (Aβ). Additionally, patients lacking SNX8 were shown to have heart development defects, intellectual disability, learning and language delay, and severe behavioral problems related to the hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vanzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rendu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mastromoro et al., 2020</xref>). Although SNX8 has been linked to several diseases, its molecular function is still poorly characterized. Here, we show that Mvp1 recycles membrane proteins in a retromer- and Snx4-independent manner in yeast. We also demonstrate that SNX8 mediates formation of endosomal recycling tubules in humans. Thus, we propose Mvp1 mediates a conserved endosomal recycling pathway that is mechanistically distinct from the retromer and Snx4 pathways. This study reveals that yeast has three major SNX-BAR endosomal recycling pathways: retromer, Snx4, and Mvp1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The endosomal localization of Vps55 requires Mvp1</title><p>To characterize the function of Mvp1 and test the hypothesis that Mvp1 is involved in membrane protein recycling, we tested the requirement of Mvp1 function for endosomal TM cargo proteins.

Since the BAR domain’s membrane remodeling activity requires homo- or hetero-dimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frost et al., 2009</xref>), we tested which SNX-BAR protein makes a dimer with Mvp1. We expressed FLAG-tagged SNX-BAR proteins in yeast and examined their binding with Mvp1-GFP. Mvp1-GFP coimmunoprecipitated with Mvp1-FLAG, but not with other SNX-BAR proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), suggesting that Mvp1 forms a homodimer but not heterodimers. Based on the recent cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Mvp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sun et al., 2020</xref>), we mutated conserved residues located on the dimer interface predicted to disrupt dimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The combination mutant I346E/Q468E/W496E had a defect in dimer formation and failed to rescue the mislocalization of Vps55-GFP in <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E and G</xref>). We confirmed that I346E/Q468E/W496E mutants still localize on the endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These results suggest that the membrane deformation activity of Mvp1 is required for the endosomal localization of Vps55.</p><p>To characterize how Mvp1 recycles Vps55, we performed live-cell imaging of Vps55-mNeonGreen with an endosomal Rab GTPase mCherry-Vps21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horazdovsky et al., 1994</xref>).

We generated a series of Vps55-GFP mutants in which three or four consecutive amino acids of the cytoplasmic region were replaced with alanine residues and examined their localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Since 2–4 A and 5–8 A mutants failed to express, we were not able to analyze residues 2–8 of Vps55. Of the tested mutants, 60–63 A and 64–67 A mutants exhibited a severe defect in Vps55 recycling. In contrast, 68–71 A, 72–75 A, 133–136 A, and 137–140 A did not show a striking defect. Next, we mutated single residues to alanine in the 60–67 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of the mutants tested, Y61A, T63A, F66A, and M67A stabilized Vps55-GFP on the vacuole membrane. K60A and D65A mutants also showed a defect, but it could be due to the higher expression of Vps55-GFP. Then, we generated Y61A/T63A, F66A/M67A, and Y61A/T63A/F66A/M67A mutants. While Y61A/T63A and F66A/M67A mutants showed a partial defect in Vps55-GFP recycling, the Y61A/T63A/F66A/M67A mutant exhibited a severe defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). To test whether the 61-YHTSDFM-67 region is required for binding with Mvp1, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Mvp1-GFP was coprecipitated with the wild-type (WT) Vps55-FLAG, whereas the binding of the Y61A/T63A/F66A/M67A mutant was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Since the Y61A/T63A/F66A/M67A mutant localized on the vacuole membrane, we also examined the Mvp1-Vps55 interaction in cells lacking Vam3, which is an essential SNARE for the endosome to fuse with the vacuole. Mvp1-GFP was still coprecipitated with Vps55-FLAG, but not with Vps55<sup>4Ala</sup>-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that 61-YHTSDFM-67 in Vps55 is required for Mvp1 recognition, although it is also possible that the Vps55-Mvp1 interaction is bridged by another protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mvp1 recognizes Vps55 through a specific sorting motif.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>, and <bold>D</bold>) Schematic of Vps55 mutational analysis and quantitation of Vps55-GFP mutant localization, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> (<bold>A</bold>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> (<bold>B</bold>), and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> (<bold>D</bold>).

Some unassembled soluble proteins are ubiquitinated and then degraded through the proteasome. However, the fate of unassembled membrane proteins has not been well studied. Vps55 forms a complex with Vps68. This complex formation is required for the stability of both Vps55 and Vps68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schluter et al., 2008</xref>). When we overexpressed Vps55-GFP, it was sorted into the vacuole lumen and degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Vacuolar degradative protein sorting is mainly mediated through the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, Vps55-GFP was not degraded in ESCRT-defective <italic>vps4</italic>Δ cells, suggesting that the ESCRT pathway is required for the vacuolar sorting of Vps55-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Cargo ubiquitination is a prerequisite for recognition by the ESCRT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>).

Its function is best characterized in the context of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. During endocytic vesicle formation, a subset of BAR domain-containing proteins (FCHO1, FBP17, SNX9, endophilin, amphiphysin, etc), together with clathrin and its adaptor proteins, are recruited to the plasma membrane (PM). Subsequently, they induce membrane curvature to mediate the formation of a budding vesicle. Then, dynamin is recruited to its neck to mediate fission, thereby releasing the vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson and Camilli, 2012</xref>). To ask if dynamin catalyzes membrane scission in Mvp1-mediated recycling, we examined Vps55 localization in dynamin mutants. The yeast genome encodes four dynamin-related proteins, Dnm1, Vps1, Sey1, and Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ford and Chappie, 2019</xref>).

To test this, we biochemically immunoisolated Vps55-containing vesicles and asked if Vps10, a retromer cargo, is also present. In this experiment, we tried to accumulate Vps55-containing recycling vesicles using a temperature-sensitive mutant of Sec18, which is essential for the fusion of recycling vesicles with the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Novick et al., 1980</xref>).

We incubated Vps55-FLAG-expressing <italic>sec18<sup>ts</sup></italic> cells at the non-permissive temperature for 60 min and then immunoisolated Vps55-FLAG-containing structures. Vps55-FLAG was concentrated in the isolated product, but Vps10 was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), nor was Vps21 (endosome) or Pho8 (vacuolar membrane). We also analyzed the isolated Vps55-containing structure by electron microscopy (EM). In the EM images, we could observe spherical structures with a diameter of 40–70 nm attached with anti-FLAG magnetic beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). When we eluted these structures from anti-FLAG beads by FLAG peptide, we could observe similar structures by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1I</xref>).

In the isolated products, Vps10-FLAG was concentrated, but Vps55-GFP was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Next, we performed live-cell imaging of Vps55-mNeonGreen and Vps10-mCherry. The Vps55-mNeonGreen decorated tubules emerged and detached from Vps55-mNeonGreen- and Vps10-mCherry-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).

Mup1 is a methionine permease that localizes to the PM in the absence of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lin et al., 2008</xref>), but upon methionine addition, Mup1 is endocytosed, trafficked to endosomes, and sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) via the ESCRT pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2011</xref>). Then, the endosome fuses with the vacuole, which delivers Mup1 to the vacuole lumen. To visualize Mup1 sorting, we fused the pH-sensitive GFP variant, pHluorin, to Mup1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miesenböck et al., 1998</xref>). When Mup1-pHluorin is sorted into ILVs or the vacuole lumen, its fluorescence is quenched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Prosser et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we can monitor Mup1 sorting by the disappearance of the Mup1-pHluorin signal. After a 60 min treatment with methionine, the fluorescence of Mup1-pHluorin was quenched in the WT cells, whereas Mup1-pHluorin puncta remained stable in <italic>vps35</italic>Δ <italic>snx4</italic>Δ <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Neo1 can flip phospholipids, especially phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), from the extracellular/lumenal leaflet to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane bilayer, thereby establishing an asymmetric distribution of phospholipids. Neo1 mutants are defective in establishing membrane asymmetry, which leads to hypersensitivity to duramycin, a bioactive peptide that disrupts the membrane through the binding of extracellular PE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takar et al., 2016</xref>).

SNX8 forms a homodimer and exhibits membrane-deformation activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). Although SNX8 has been linked to several diseases, especially AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenthal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2019</xref>), its molecular function has not been analyzed in detail. When GFP-SNX8 was expressed in Hela cells, it showed punctate structures that colocalized with the early endosome protein EEA1, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–(i)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyve et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to these puncta, we also observed tubule-like structures that also were labeled by EEA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> -(ii)). Live-cell imaging analysis revealed that the tubule-like structures budded from the GFP-SNX8-positive endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>), which is consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">van Weering et al., 2012</xref>). SNX1 overexpression induces endosomal swelling and tubulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlton et al., 2004</xref>). Similarly, when we increased the expression of GFP-SNX8, the endosome marked by GFP-SNX8 was enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Some of these endosomes have long extended tubule structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B, D, E</xref>). To analyze the biogenesis of this extended tubule structure, we performed live-cell imaging. Once GFP-SNX8 was concentrated on the endosomal surface, the extended tubules emerged from that site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video2">Figure 7—video 2</xref>).

Mvp1 forms a homodimer and is recruited to the endosome through PI3P binding. The Mvp1 dimer recognizes its cargo, Vps55, through a specific sorting motif. The BAR domain of Mvp1 deforms the endosomal membrane to form cargo-containing tubule-like structures. Subsequently, Mvp1 recruits Vps1 to catalyze membrane scission. Importantly, Vps55 retrieval does not require the retromer or the Snx4 complex. In human cells, SNX8, the human homolog of Mvp1, facilitates the formation of endosomal recycling tubules. Thus, we propose that Mvp1 mediates a conserved endosomal recycling pathway mechanistically distinct from retromer- and Snx4-mediated recycling.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2014</xref> proposed that Mvp1 functions in the retromer pathway, but no specific cargo for Mvp1 has been identified. We found that Vps55 (human OB-RGRP) is recycled by Mvp1 in a retromer-independent manner. Consistent with this, Mvp1-dependent sorting of Vps55 requires its 61-YHTSDFM-67 sorting signal, which does not resemble the retromer-binding sequence defined as ØX[L/M/V], where Ø is F/Y/W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cullen and Steinberg, 2018</xref>), although it is still possible that the sorting signal also participates in the interaction with Vps68. Through biochemical analysis, we revealed that retromer and Mvp1 mediate the formation of distinct recycling vesicles. Also, although <italic>vps35</italic>Δ, <italic>snx4</italic>Δ, and <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ single mutants did not exhibit any growth defect at 37°C, <italic>vps35</italic>Δ <italic>snx4</italic>Δ <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ triple mutants failed to grow at 37°C. Based on these results, we propose that Mvp1 mainly functions in retromer-independent recycling, consistent with Mvp1 not being essential for retromer-mediated recycling. However, it does not exclude the possibility that Mvp1 assembles with the retromer. Since Mvp1 and retromer cooperatively recycle Nhx1 and also contribute to the appropriate phospholipid distribution, a subpopulation of Mvp1 molecules may coassemble with the retromer. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chi et al., 2014</xref> reported that 54% of the endosomal tubule was both Vps17 and Mvp1 positive (33% Vps17 only, 13% Mvp1 only). We also observed Vps10- and Vps55-positive tubule structures, but we could not exclude the possibility that these structures resulted in fission of the endosome. To answer this, three-color live-cell imaging of retromer, Mvp1, and the endosomal marker will be required.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bean et al., 2017</xref> reported that the appropriate localization of Vps55 also requires the retromer complex, but why was the localization of Vps55 altered in the retromer mutants? Notably, Mvp1 localized on both the endosome and vacuole in <italic>vps35</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref>), which raised the possibility that the endosome-localized Mvp1 might be reduced in the retromer mutants. Consistent with this idea, when we expressed another copy of Vps55, Vps55-GFP exhibited vacuole localization in <italic>vps35</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We also examined the PI3P distribution by using GFP fused with the FYVE domain, which specifically binds to the PI3P. It localized on the endosome in the WT cells, whereas mainly on the vacuole membrane in the retromer mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These observations suggest that PI3P distribution was altered in the retromer mutants, which impairs the localization of Mvp1. Thus, in some conditions, retromer deficiency might indirectly affect Vps55 localization through an inappropriate PI3P distribution.</p><p>The abnormal accumulation of Aβ is a hallmark feature of AD. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by β-secretase (BACE) at the endosome, and then its fragments (Aβ) are unconventionally secreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Small and Petsko, 2015</xref>). Interestingly, overexpression of SNX8 reduces Aβ levels and rescues cognitive impairment in an APP/PS1 AD mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). However, how SNX8 prevents the accumulation of Aβ has not been determined. In this study, we found that Mvp1 and the retromer not only function independently, but also recycle the same cargo (Nhx1). The human retromer complex has been shown to directly or indirectly (possibly through the sortilin receptor) recycle APP and BACE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Small and Petsko, 2015</xref>). Since defects in this retrieval lead to AD’s pathology, SNX8 may also recycle these AD-related membrane proteins.</p><p>We propose that Mvp1 recruits Vps1 to mediate membrane scission. Since the endosomal localization of Vps1 was altered in <italic>vps35</italic>Δ <italic>snx4</italic>Δ <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ triple mutants, the retromer and Snx4 complexes may also recruit Vps1 to catalyze the fission of recycling vesicles. Future analysis will be necessary to characterize how Vps1 acts on retromer- and Snx4-mediated recycling tubules. In mammalian cells, dynamin mainly localizes not only on the PM, but also to the endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nicoziani et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soreng et al., 2018</xref> reported that SNX18 is responsible for the recruitment of dynamin-2 to the recycling endosome . Inhibiting dynamin causes the tubulation of endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mesaki et al., 2011</xref>). Also, the dominant-negative dynamin mutant impairs the endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of Shiga toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lauvrak et al., 2004</xref>). These observations raise the possibility that dynamin-mediated endosome scission is conserved. However, unlike in yeast cells, the WASH complex, an activator of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization, forms a complex with the retromer, which might be sufficient for membrane scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simonetti and Cullen, 2019</xref>). How membrane scission is catalyzed in endosomal recycling pathways is a fundamental question in this field.</p><p>Recycling of key membrane proteins (SNAREs, receptors, flippases, transporters, etc) allows cells to maintain organelle identity and function. In this study, we reveal that Mvp1 mediates a novel endosomal recycling pathway. Our findings pave the way toward understanding how cells maintain the composition and function of each organelle. However, several questions remain to be answered. (1) To form a uniform size of recycling vesicles, the activity of Mvp1 and Vps1 should be temporally and spatially regulated, but its regulation mechanism(s) remains unknown. (2) How Mvp1 is uncoated from the recycling vesicles also requires investigation. (3) How is Vps55 recycled, before endosome fusion with the vacuole, is still unclear. (4) Other membrane proteins and lipids delivered through the Mvp1 pathway need to be identified. (5) How do SNX-BAR family proteins contribute to the appropriate distribution of phospholipids? Future studies should address these critical issues.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

An extensive set of experiments reproduces and builds on past work and comes to some new conclusions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A PX-BAR protein Mvp1/SNX8 and a dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive endosomal recycling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Ungermann (Reviewer #1); Todd R Graham (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. We hope you will consider all the points raised with focus on strengthening the data related to Mvp1 recognition of Vps55 and Vps1 as described below. We hope you will find these comments constructive.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Show that Mvp1 binds Vps55 cytosolic sequences in vitro, and that this is blocked by the mutation that disrupts sorting, would provide stronger evidence that Mvp1 recognizes and sorts Vps55. Furthermore, transplanting this signal to a heterologous protein would test if this sequence is sufficient for Mvp1-dependent sorting; inclusion of a control cargo that does not bind would also be helpful.</p><p>2. Further defining how Mvp1 binds Vps1 would increase the novelty of the study. It is interesting that mutating the Mvp1 dimerization interface didn't block localization to endosomes, but did block sorting. This could mean that Mvp1 oligomerization creates the tubule that recycles Vps55. Alternatively, as suggested by Chi et al., Mvp1 oligomerization could further constrict an existing tubule to promotes the recruitment of Vps1. Can this dimerization mutant recruit Vps1 to endosomes?</p><p>3. The authors show that overexpression of Vps55 causes its mislocalization to the vacuole in Figure 3G-J. Does overexpression of Mvp1 or the Vps55-interacting protein Vps68 suppress the overexpressed Vps55 missorting to the vacuole? This would address whether or not one of these proteins is the limiting component for sorting Vps55.</p><p>4. Please revise the text throughout to provide a more complete description of the relevant prior literature as described below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Figure 3,4: The authors nicely dissect the role of Vps1 for the Mvp1 pathway, and Vps1 K42 clearly affects recycling via Mvp1. Is Vps1 required for all three recycling pathways? The authors nicely show that Vps55 is affected in the Vps1 K42A mutant, but should also test the other cargoes (like Atg27).</p><p>2. In Figure 6, the authors analyze the triple recycling mutant and its deficiency. Is the same Mup1 trafficking defect and duramycin sensitivity observed in vps1 mutants alone or in combination with snx4 or vps35 deletions? This again would address if Vps1 is required for all three pathways or just for the Mvp1 pathway.</p><p>3. Figure 6: The authors show that the triple mutant of mvp1 snx4 and retromer has a strong sensitivity to heat stress (Figure 6). So far, only Vps55 has been characterized as a cargo, whose function remains unclear. Having a recycling deficient mutant of Vps55, the authors could ask if the Vps55 mutant (Figure 3C, most right) combined with snx4 and retromer deletion results in the same phenotype.</p><p>4. The authors have evidence that Nhx1 is recognized by all three pathways. It would be nice if the authors could speculate on the sorting motif responsible for general vs. specific (e.g. Mvp1 dependent) recycling.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Demonstrating that Mvp1 binds Vps55 cytosolic sequences in vitro, and that this is blocked by the mutation that disrupts sorting, would provide stronger evidence that Mvp1 recognizes and sorts Vps55.

These two residues seem to cause a drastic sorting defect. Why are they not included as important in the model shown in F?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors describe Mvp1/SNX8 as a coat protein involved in Vps55 retrieval. One clear role for coat proteins is in the selection of cargo and it would be great to see the data supporting a role for Mvp1 in recognition of cargo sorting signals strengthened. Figure 3E shows a co-IP experiment between Mvp1 and either WT Vps55 or Vps55-4Ala (sorting signal mutant). The difference in the two co-IPs was rather slight and was not quantified. Quantitation of these results and evidence of reproducibility would improve confidence in this result. It would also be worth discussing if the YXTXXFM motif is similar to other sorting signals recognized by retromer or other sorting nexins.</p><p>2. Related to the first point – the authors show that overexpression of Vps55 causes its mislocalization to the vacuole in Figure 3G-J. Does overexpression of Mvp1 suppress the overexpressed Vps55 missorting to the vacuole? This would address whether or not Mvp1 is the limiting component for sorting Vps55.</p><p>3. Figure 4 shows that Vps1 membrane recruitment is lost in a mvp1 vps35 snx4 triple mutant. This is surprising because I would have assumed Vps1 would also be required for scission of vesicles produced by AP-1, AP-3 and GGA from the Golgi. Perhaps the authors could address this point in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A PX-BAR protein Mvp1/SNX8 and a dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive endosomal recycling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. For the most part, the reviewers were satisfied with the changes made during revision. However one reviewer felt that additional textual changes would still be required as follows.</p><p>(1) The authors were asked to test for direct interaction between Mvp1 and Vps55. Experiments were performed but they failed to detect a direct interaction. They were also unable to provide evidence of sufficiency by transplanting this sequence into a naïve reporter. They have provided better support for the co-IP between these proteins by the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C. However, they should provide a more cautious interpretation of this result as it is possible that the sorting signal identified in Vps55 is not directly binding to Mvp1. I suggest revising line 156 to include something like &quot;…, although it is also possible that the Vps55-Mvp1 interaction is bridged by another protein.&quot; Line 399 in the Discussion should also be revised to &quot;…Mvp1-dependent sorting of Vps55 requires its YHTSDFM sorting signal, which does not…&quot;.</p><p>The authors' response was disappointing in that the desired outcome was not obtained but the primary conclusions of the study are still valid. I believe the suggested revisions to the text will be sufficient.</p><p>(2) I am satisfied with the response to this point regarding the Mvp1-Vps1 interaction.</p><p>(3) I do not think the response to this point is adequate. The authors now state that overexpression of Vps68 suppresses the mislocalization phenotype caused by Vps55-GFP overexpression. However, the new data included in the manuscript (Figure 3 – supplement 1E) does not show any difference that I can detect between the vector only and Vps68 OE. No quantitation of this result was provided and it is unclear how the authors came to the conclusion described in the rebuttal. In addition, line 167 of the manuscript states that &quot;Overexpression of Vps68 suppressed degradation of Vps55-GFP (Figure 3 – supplemental 1E),…&quot;. There is no evidence of degradation in the data provided. Was this supposed to have been a western blot? If there is actual data to suggest Vps68 is the limiting component, the authors should include in the Discussion the possibility that the Vps55 sorting signal define is actually a Vps68-interaction motif.</p><p>(4) The authors have improved their treatment of the literature in the revised manuscript and I think their response to this point is adequate. One more citation they should incorporate into the Discussion is PMID: 29437695, which provides evidence for a sorting nexin recruiting dynamin-2.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have carried out a considerable number of new experiments in response to the reviewers' comments. In most cases, these experiments have addressed my concerns, and those of the other reviewers. In other instances, I am satisfied that the authors tried hard to carry out the requested experiments even if the results were inconclusive; resolving these issues will require more extensive work that I agree is beyond the scope of this paper. I also appreciate the changes made to the text to recognize others contributions to the field. In conclusion, I am satisfied by this revised version and the authors responses to the previous reviews.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69883.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, we were not able to detect the Mvp1-Vps55 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). Because Vps55 is a membrane protein, we also tried to prepare the full length of Vps55 from yeast cells, but we did not obtain enough Vps55 for the in vitro analysis. Characterization of the direct binding between Mvp1 and Vps55 is an essential question. However, to answer this, we might need another expression system (i.e., insect cells, etc.) to prepare a sufficient amount of the full-length Vps55. We feel this is beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We hope that we will be able to answer this in future studies. Since we failed to establish the in vitro binding assay, to address the indirect effect of Vps55 missorting to the vacuole as suggested by reviewer #2, we further examined the Mvp1-Vps55 interaction in vivo by using cells lacking Vam3, which is an essential SNARE for the endosome-vacuole fusion. We confirmed both Vps55-GFP and Vps55<sup>4A</sup>-GFP (recycling sequence mutants) are still localized at the endosome in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Strikingly, Mvp1 was coprecipitated from Vps55-FLAG but was not from Vps55<sup>4A</sup>-FLAG (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C was added to the revised manuscript). These results strengthen our conclusion that the Vps55 sorting signal is required for the association with Mvp1.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69883-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we transplanted the cytoplasmic region of Vps55, including the recycling signal to Vps10 or Ear1, which are endosomal membrane proteins. However, both of them failed to express. It could be because Vps55 has four transmembrane domains, whereas Vps10 and Ear1 only have one. We tried to generate another chimeric protein using tetra-spanning transmembrane proteins, but we could not obtain a suitable TM protein, which is stably localized at the vacuole membrane. Hence, we were not able to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Further defining how Mvp1 binds Vps1 would increase the novelty of the study.

The authors nicely show that Vps55 is affected in the Vps1 K42A mutant, but should also test the other cargoes (like Atg27).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we examined Vps10-GFP localization in vps1Δ cells. It was partially missorted to the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>), consistent with a previous study (Chi et al., 2014). We also confirmed the vacuolar localization of Vps10-GFP in <italic>vps1(K42A)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3B</xref>). To test the Snx4 cargo, we analyzed the localization of GFP-Snc1. It was mislocalized to the vacuole membrane and its lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3C</xref>), consistent with the previous publication (Lukehart et al., 2013). These results suggest that all three recycling pathways (Retromer, Snx4, and Mvp1) require Vps1.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-69883-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 6, the authors analyze the triple recycling mutant and its deficiency. Is the same Mup1 trafficking defect and duramycin sensitivity observed in vps1 mutants alone or in combination with snx4 or vps35 deletions?

Figure 6: The authors show that the triple mutant of mvp1 snx4 and retromer has a strong sensitivity to heat stress (Figure 6). So far, only Vps55 has been characterized as a cargo, whose function remains unclear. Having a recycling deficient mutant of Vps55, the authors could ask if the Vps55 mutant (Figure 3C, most right) combined with snx4 and retromer deletion results in the same phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>Since Schluter et al. suggested that Vps55 is required for the MVB sorting (Schluter et al., 2008), we examined Mup1 sorting in <italic>vps55</italic>Δ cells. It was partially defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5A,B</xref>). Based on this result and previous publication, we believe that Vps55 is involved in the ESCRT-mediated MVB sorting.

The authors have evidence that Nhx1 is recognized by all three pathways. It would be nice if the authors could speculate on the sorting motif responsible for general vs. specific (e.g. Mvp1 dependent) recycling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We did not observe any defect of Nhx1 recycling in each mutant (<italic>vps35</italic>Δ, <italic>snx4</italic>Δ, or <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ), but impaired in <italic>vps35</italic>Δ <italic>snx4</italic>Δ <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ cells. Based on the results, we speculate all three SNX-BAR complexes recognize Nhx1’s sorting signal. Identification of this general sorting signal is an essential question in feature study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Demonstrating that Mvp1 binds Vps55 cytosolic sequences in vitro, and that this is blocked by the mutation that disrupts sorting, would provide stronger evidence that Mvp1 recognizes and sorts Vps55. Furthermore, transplanting this signal to a heterologous protein would test if this sequence is sufficient for Mvp1-dependent sorting.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. As mentioned above, we tried in vitro binding assay and constructed chimeric proteins, but it did not work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further defining how Mvp1 binds Vps1 would increase the novelty of the study. It is interesting that mutating the Mvp1 dimerization interface didn't block localization to endosomes, but did block sorting. This could mean that Mvp1 oligomerization creates the tubule that recycles Vps55. Alternatively, as suggested by Chi et al., Mvp1 oligomerization could further constrict an existing tubule to promotes the recruitment of Vps1. Can this dimerization mutant recruit Vps1 to endosomes?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. As mentioned above, we examined Vps1 localization in Mvp1 dimerization mutants and found that its dimerization is required for Vps1 recruitment (Figure 4—figure supplement 1M was added to the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3B: Why are there asterisks marking two of the residues? This should be explained in the figure legend. These two residues seem to cause a drastic sorting defect. Why are they not included as important in the model shown in F?</p></disp-quote><p>Sorry for this confusion. These mutants marked with asterisks were more highly expressed than other mutants, which indirectly caused the missorting of Vps55. We carefully revised the Figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The authors describe Mvp1/SNX8 as a coat protein involved in Vps55 retrieval. One clear role for coat proteins is in the selection of cargo and it would be great to see the data supporting a role for Mvp1 in recognition of cargo sorting signals strengthened. Figure 3E shows a co-IP experiment between Mvp1 and either WT Vps55 or Vps55-4Ala (sorting signal mutant). The difference in the two co-IPs was rather slight and was not quantified. Quantitation of these results and evidence of reproducibility would improve confidence in this result.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we performed in vitro binding assay, but it did not work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be worth discussing if the YXTXXFM motif is similar to other sorting signals recognized by retromer or other sorting nexins.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We revised the manuscript to reflect this (Page 13, line 399)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to the first point – the authors show that overexpression of Vps55 causes its mislocalization to the vacuole in Figure 3G-J. Does overexpression of Mvp1 suppress the overexpressed Vps55 missorting to the vacuole? This would address whether or not Mvp1 is the limiting component for sorting Vps55.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. As suggested by the reviewer, we overexpressed Mvp1, but it did not rescue the Vps55 missorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, Vps68 overexpression did rescue this (Figure 3—figure supplement 1E was added to the revised manuscript), suggesting that Vps68 is a limiting component for Vps55 sorting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4 shows that Vps1 membrane recruitment is lost in a mvp1 vps35 snx4 triple mutant. This is surprising because I would have assumed Vps1 would also be required for scission of vesicles produced by AP-1, AP-3 and GGA from the Golgi. Perhaps the authors could address this point in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>That is an important point. We did not see the colocalization of Vps1-GFP with the TGN localized Sec7-mCherry (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B), suggesting that Vps1 might only be transiently recruited to the TGN. Strikingly, <italic>vps1</italic>Δ cells exhibited the growth defect at 26 degrees (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A), but <italic>vps35</italic>Δ <italic>snx4</italic>Δ <italic>mvp1</italic>Δ cells did not (Figure 5G), suggesting that Vps1 may have another function beyond recycling. This is an important question to be clarified by future studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the most part, the reviewers were satisfied with the changes made during revision. However one reviewer felt that additional textual changes would still be required as follows.</p><p>(1) The authors were asked to test for direct interaction between Mvp1 and Vps55. Experiments were performed but they failed to detect a direct interaction. They were also unable to provide evidence of sufficiency by transplanting this sequence into a naïve reporter. They have provided better support for the co-IP between these proteins by the new Figure —figure supplement 1C. However, they should provide a more cautious interpretation of this result as it is possible that the sorting signal identified in Vps55 is not directly binding to Mvp1. I suggest revising line 156 to include something like &quot;……., although it is also possible that the Vps55-Mvp1 interaction is bridged by another protein.&quot; Line 399 in the Discussion should also be revised to &quot;…Mvp1-dependent sorting of Vps55 requires its YHTSDFM sorting signal, which does not…&quot;.</p><p>The authors' response was disappointing in that the desired outcome was not obtained but the primary conclusions of the study are still valid. I believe the suggested revisions to the text will be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have carefully revised the manuscript (Line 156; Line 400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I do not think the response to this point is adequate. The authors now state that overexpression of Vps68 suppresses the mislocalization phenotype caused by Vps55-GFP overexpression. However, the new data included in the manuscript (Figure 3 – supplement 1E) does not show any difference that I can detect between the vector only and Vps68 OE. No quantitation of this result was provided and it is unclear how the authors came to the conclusion described in the rebuttal. In addition, line 167 of the manuscript states that &quot;Overexpression of Vps68 suppressed degradation of Vps55-GFP (Figure 3 – supplemental 1E),…&quot;. There is no evidence of degradation in the data provided. Was this supposed to have been a western blot? If there is actual data to suggest Vps68 is the limiting component, the authors should include in the Discussion the possibility that the Vps55 sorting signal define is actually a Vps68-interaction motif.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the quantification of “Figure 3—figure supplement 1E” (Figure 3—figure supplement 1F). Also, we have included the possibility suggested by the reviewer in the Discussion (Line 403).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors have improved their treatment of the literature in the revised manuscript and I think their response to this point is adequate. One more citation they should incorporate into the Discussion is PMID: 29437695, which provides evidence for a sorting nexin recruiting dynamin-2.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have incorporated suggested paper in the Discussion (Line 442).</p></body></sub-article></article>
