Infected cells exhibit profound changes in morphology, physiology, and transcriptional activity. How the parasite effects these changes is poorly understood. We explored the localization of highly polymorphic proteins and found members of the <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> MEDLE protein family to be translocated into the cytosol of infected cells. All intracellular life stages engage in this export, which occurs after completion of invasion. Mutational studies defined an N-terminal host-targeting motif and demonstrated proteolytic processing at a specific leucine residue. Direct expression of MEDLE2 in mammalian cells triggered an ER stress response, which was also observed during infection. Taken together, our studies reveal the presence of a <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> secretion system capable of delivering parasite proteins into the infected enterocyte.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic></kwd><kwd>protein export</kwd><kwd>effector</kwd><kwd>host-pathogen interactions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Striepen</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI112427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Striepen</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dumaine</surname><given-names>Jennifer E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99AI137442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sateriale</surname><given-names>Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32A1055400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gullicksrud</surname><given-names>Jodi A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Following initial invasion events, intracellular life stages of <italic>C. parvum</italic> rely upon an N-terminal host-targeting motif and proteolytic processing at a specific leucine residue to deliver proteins into the infected enterocyte.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Apicomplexan parasite <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a leading cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Young children are highly susceptible to infection, and cryptosporidiosis is an important contributor to child mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khalil et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>). Children in resource-poor settings carry a disproportionate burden of severe disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Choy and Huston, 2020</xref>). Malnutrition enhances the risk of severe cryptosporidiosis, and at the same time, the disease impacts the nutritional state of children, which can lead to impaired growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mondal et al., 2009</xref>). Infection with the parasite results in protective immunity, but this immunity is not sterile and may require multiple exposures to develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chappell et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Okhuysen et al., 1998</xref>). Most human diseases are due to infection with <italic>Cryptosporidium hominis,</italic> which only infects humans, and <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum,</italic> which can be zoonotically transmitted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nader et al., 2019</xref>). The emergence of <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> species is driven by host adaptation resulting in specialization and narrowing host specificity; however, the sexual life cycle of the parasite allows for recombination and can lead to rapid convergent evolution of host specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nader et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infects the epithelium of the small intestine, where it lives in a unique intracellular, but extracytoplasmic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott and Clark, 2000</xref>). The mechanism by which this niche is established during invasion is still debated but involves the rearrangement of the host actin cytoskeleton, the formation of tight junction-like structures between host and parasite membranes, and a dense band of unknown composition at the host-parasite interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott and Clark, 2000</xref>). <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has severely reduced metabolic capabilities and relies heavily upon the host cell for nutrients and metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamsen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Xu et al., 2004</xref>). A number of specialized uptake mechanisms have been proposed to fill this need, many of which are believed to be localized to the so-called feeder organelle at the host-parasite interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Guérin and Striepen, 2020</xref>). In summary, <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> remodels the host cell in significant ways that include its cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonnin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elliott and Clark, 2000</xref>), cellular physiology and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Argenzio et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>), as well as aspects of immune restriction and regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laurent and Lacroix-Lamandé, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Many bacterial, protozoan, and fungal pathogens use translocated effectors to manipulate their hosts to secure nutrients and to block host immunity. In <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, exported effectors form adhesive structures on the surface of red blood cells to alter tissue distribution and mechanical properties to prevent clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Crabb et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leech et al., 1984</xref>) and install new nutrient and ion uptake mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumeister et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, translocated effectors disarm critical elements of interferon-induced cellular restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olias et al., 2016</xref>), establish access to cellular nutrients, and rewire signaling and transcriptional networks to antagonize immune responses to promote a favorable environment for parasite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bougdour et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Braun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Braun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gold et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has been hypothesized to use exported effector proteins to ensure its survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pellé et al., 2015</xref>); however, to date, no such factors have been identified. Here, we report that the polymorphic protein MEDLE2 is exported to the host cell cytoplasm by all stages of the <italic>C. parvum</italic> life cycle in vitro and in vivo. This protein is not injected during invasion, but rather is transported into the host cell following the initial establishment of infection. We carefully mapped the requirements for export and found a signal that includes a proteolytic cleavage site, and we demonstrate that exported proteins undergo processing. Overall, we demonstrate the presence of a robust translocation mechanism established by intracellular parasites that delivers parasite proteins to the host cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>C. parvum</italic> protein MEDLE2 is exported into the host cell</title><p>The genome of <italic>C. parvum</italic> encodes multiple families of paralogous proteins that carry N-terminal signal peptides and share conserved amino acid repeat motifs among family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrahamsen et al., 2004</xref>). These genes are often found within clusters (homologous and heterologous), many of which are located proximal to the telomeres of multiple chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Comparing strains and species, these genes are highly polymorphic and vary in copy number, which has been interpreted as a sign of rapid evolution driven by their roles in invasion, pathogenesis, and host cell specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nader et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2019</xref>) We hypothesized that such roles might be reflected in the targeting of presumptive effectors to the host cell and selected representatives from each polymorphic gene family for initial localization studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Selected loci were modified in the <italic>C. parvum</italic> IOWAII isolate using CRISPR/Cas9-driven homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vinayak et al., 2015</xref>) to append three hemagglutinin epitopes (3XHA) in translational fusion to the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Drug-resistant parasites were recovered for four of six initial candidates, and successful genomic insertion was mapped by PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We next infected human ileocecal colorectal adenocarcinoma cell cultures (HCT-8) with transgenic parasites and assessed the localization of the tagged proteins by immunofluorescence assay (IFA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). For most candidates, the tagged protein (red) appeared to coincide with the parasite and/or the parasitophorous vacuole (cgd8_3560, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, upon infection with parasites tagged in the MEDLE2 locus (cgd5_4590), HCT-8 cells showed HA staining in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We note that the cells that stain for HA (red) were those that were infected with parasites, labeled with <italic>Vicia villosa</italic> lectin (VVL, green), and conclude that MEDLE2-HA is exported by the parasite into the host cell during or following invasion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MEDLE2 is exported to the host cell cytoplasm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the chromosomal location for polymorphic gene families in the <italic>C. parvum</italic> genome.

A cassette driven by the MEDLE2 promoter was inserted into the locus of the dispensable thymidine kinase gene (TK, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and expression level and export of ectopic WT protein was indistinguishable from protein tagged within the native locus.</p><p>Removal of the sequence encoding the N-terminal signal peptide (ΔSP) prevented MEDLE2-HA export, and the resulting protein accumulated within the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we constructed a series of parasite strains in which each of the candidate motifs was replaced by a matching number of alanine residues (all mutants were confirmed by PCR mapping and Sanger sequencing; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutagenesis of three of these candidate motifs had no impact on MEDLE2 translocation to the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, when the most N-terminal sequence KDVSLI was changed to six alanines, HA staining accumulated in the parasite and host cell staining was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We conclude that in this mutant MEDLE2-HA is made but export is ablated. Next, we constructed six additional strains using the same strategy to change each amino acid position of the KDVSLI motif to alanine 1 residue at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of residue leucine 35 to alanine (L35A) ablated export and instead MEDLE2-HA remained with the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Changing the remaining five amino acids individually did not alter MEDLE2 localization in the host cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We conclude leucine 35 to be critical for export.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MEDLE2 export is linked to proteolytic processing</title><p>For both <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic>, leucine residues serve as crucial sites for proteolytic processing events that license proteins to leave the parasite and enter the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marti et al., 2004</xref>). To test whether such processing occurs during export of MEDLE2 in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, we performed western blot analysis on whole-cell lysates of infected cell cultures using antibodies to HA (MEDLE2-HA, green) and the drug resistance marker Neo (loading control, red). For WT MEDLE2-HA, we observed a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 31 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, the predicted molecular weight for full-length MEDLE2-HA is 26.9 kDa but the abundance of positive charges is likely to result in reduced electrophoretic mobility). Protein KPVLKN/6A, carrying a mutation that did not affect trafficking to the host cell cytoplasm, was of identical size to WT MEDLE2-HA. In contrast, the KDVSLI/6A mutant, which is no longer exported, appeared to be of a larger molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The mutant lacking the 22 amino acid signal peptide (ΔSP) produced an intermediate size band larger than the exported WT but smaller than the retained ΔKDVSLI mutant. We found a very similar pattern when analyzing the single amino acid mutants, where the L35A change caused the mutant protein to migrate more slowly when compared to WT or the ΔSP mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). To ensure the observed differences in apparent molecular weight were due to processing by the parasite and not the consequence of folding or subsequent host processing, we also expressed WT and mutants in mammalian cells (see Materials and methods for detail). In this context, the proteins are the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, we interpret the relative sizes of the mutated proteins to indicate processing of MEDLE2 at a point beyond the signal peptide, a position that would be consistent with leucine 35. We note that this processing appears to require translocation into the ER as it does not occur in mutants lacking a signal peptide. Furthermore, the L35A mutation apparently prevented removal of the signal peptide, suggesting that processing at L35 could replace the canonical signal peptidase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>MEDLE2 induces an ER stress response in the host cell</title><p>To begin to understand the consequence of MEDLE2 export on the host cell, we expressed the protein in human cells. MEDLE2 omitting the N-terminal signal peptide (aa 2–20) was codon optimized for human cell expression, appended to the N-terminus of GFP, and the resulting plasmid introduced into HEK293T cells by Lipofectamine transfection (we note that this protein contains 15 amino acids [aa 21–35] that are likely missing in the parasite exported protein due to N-terminal processing). A GFP-only parent plasmid served as control for the impact of transfection on cellular responses. Transfection with both constructs resulted in cytoplasmatic green fluorescence in roughly 40% of cells 24 hr post transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Extensive population genetic studies have since replaced <italic>C. parvum</italic> with a multitude of species, subspecies, and strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Checkley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Xiao et al., 1999</xref>). The genomes of these parasites reflect the overall high degree of similarity in their conservation of gene content and synteny; nonetheless, these parasites show pronounced differences in their host specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Feng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nader et al., 2019</xref>). The genomic differences observed are focused on families of predicted secretory proteins that have been proposed to contribute to host specificity, prominently among them the MEDLE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Su et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies found that treatment of sporozoites with antisera raised against recombinant MEDLE1 or MEDLE2 diminished the efficiency of infection by 40%. This led the authors to consider that MEDLE proteins may play a role in invasion and that host specificity is rooted in receptor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fei et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we screened polymorphic genes for the localization of the proteins they encode by epitope tagging the endogenous loci. We found that <italic>C. parvum</italic> exports multiple members of the MEDLE protein family into the cytosol of the host cell. This is particularly robust for the highly expressed MEDLE2 protein, where the observation is based on more than 15 independent transgenic strains using different epitope tags and antibodies, in locus and ectopic tagging, and held true in cultured cells and infected animals. Importantly, mutation of the tagged gene changed the localization and molecular weight of the protein, highlighting the specificity of the reagents used.</p><p>Apicomplexa evolved multiple mechanisms to deliver proteins to their host cells during and following invasion. The timing of MEDLE2 expression and export and its sensitivity to BFA treatment argues for a mechanism that becomes active after the parasite has established its intracellular niche, in contrast to injection during invasion from organelles already poised to secrete. In <italic>P. falciparum,</italic> such export relies on the translocon complex PTEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Koning-Ward et al., 2009</xref>), which uses the ATPase activity of a heat shock protein to unfold and then extrude cargo through a transmembrane channel into the red blood cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Matthews et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic ablation of this complex results in loss of export and loss of parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Elsworth et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii,</italic> proteins are exported during intracellular growth via the MYR complex, which is independent of ATP hydrolysis and requires intrinsically disordered cargo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>). Translocon and export are dispensable for growth of this parasite in culture, but loss profoundly impacts virulence in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hakimi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marino et al., 2018</xref>).

Point mutation of this residue ablates export and results in a higher apparent molecular weight of the protein, which we interpret as a lack of processing at the mutated site. Disorder may be critical for MEDLE2 export as fusion of well-folded domains potently blocked its export into the host cell. This is consistent with an export mechanism unable to unfold proteins as proposed for <italic>T. gondii</italic> and <italic>Plasmodium</italic> liver stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beck and Ho, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gehde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marino et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Export of proteins in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> and <italic>T. gondii</italic> similarly requires a host-targeting motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hiller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marti et al., 2004</xref>). While the sequence of the motifs varies between species, all share a required leucine residue that has been linked to processing by an aspartyl protease to license export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boddey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coffey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hammoudi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Russo et al., 2010</xref>).

Ablating these genes may provide an opportunity to block export to the host cell.</p><p>Pathogens inject a wide array of factors into the cells of their hosts to remodel cellular architecture, hijack death and survival pathways, change cell physiology and metabolism, and rewire transcriptional networks. Many of them aid immune evasion and the evolutionary arms race between host and pathogen and are potent modulators of host specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Long et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Does and Rep, 2007</xref>). Here, we have identified the first examples of host-targeted effector proteins for intracellular stages of <italic>C. parvum</italic>. We introduced the protein into its target compartment, the mammalian cytosol, by transient transfection, and mRNA sequencing revealed a transcriptional signature of ER stress and UPR upon expression of MEDLE2, but not in matched control transfection with a GFP-only-expressing plasmid. We found that an ER stress response signature was also detectable when cells or mice were infected with <italic>C. parvu</italic>m, which supports previous work identifying a UPR response during <italic>C. parvum</italic> infection in an in vitro model of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Morada et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>ER stress is a common feature of intracellular infection that greatly modulates host cell survival and inflammatory response. Bacteria, viruses, and protozoa alike have evolved strategies to trigger or block the UPR during infection, suggesting the response not to be a by-product of infection, but rather an active participant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abhishek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alshareef et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Perera et al., 2017</xref>). This relationship is complex, and depending on cellular context, the UPR can aid pathogens or restrict them. Modulating the UPR is pivotal for intracellular bacteria that reside in vacuoles, including <italic>Chlamydia, Brucella</italic>, <italic>Listeria,</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium,</italic> to build their intracellular niche and to acquire nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Celli and Tsolis, 2015</xref>). <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> lost the ability to synthesize most required metabolites and depends on an elaborate membranous feeder organelle at the host-parasite interface. This reduction includes biosynthesis of many lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Coppens, 2013</xref>), and we note modulation of lipid synthesis and mobilization as one important consequence of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moncan et al., 2021</xref>). The UPR is also important in the context of recognition of intracellular pathogens and the subsequent cytokine-mediated immune responses. <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> triggers an enterocyte intrinsic inflammasome leading to the release of IL-18 from the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McNair et al., 2018</xref>), and infection also results in pronounced production of interferon λ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ferguson et al., 2019</xref>). We also tested GRA16, a disordered effector protein of <italic>T. gondii</italic> in similar experiments and found it to similarly upregulate the ER stress response. This may indicate that such upregulation is inherent to the structure of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, we note that manipulation of ER stress signaling using pharmacological inhibition of IRE1 in culture or genetic ablation of DDIT3 in mice resulted in reduced growth of <italic>C. parvum,</italic> suggesting that this response may contribute to parasite survival. We deem it likely that MEDLE2 has additional roles yet to be determined.</p><p>The MEDLE genes are highly polymorphic and encoded by multiple loci, but our current view of the family likely underestimates its true plasticity. The recent reannotation of the <italic>C. parvum</italic> genome using long read sequencing found evidence for multiple ‘alternative’ telomeres carrying different MEDLE gene clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baptista et al., 2021</xref>). Our experimental observations support this. When we ablated the MEDLE2 gene by homologous recombination, additional MEDLE2 copies remained in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar observations were made when tagging the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is important to note that <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> has a single host life cycle and undergoes sexual exchange throughout the infection, providing near constant opportunity for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tandel et al., 2019</xref>). This is reminiscent of the importance of chromosomal position and recombination for the antigenically varied VSG and var genes in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dreesen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The fact that MEDLE proteins are delivered into the host cell makes them prime targets for immunity, and immune evasion may drive chromosomal organization, expression, and evolution of these

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Dominique Soldati-Favre as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Daniel E Goldberg (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is an interesting and important study, and that the work is elegant and clearly presented. However they also raised a number of points, as detailed below in the recommendations to the authors, which have to be addressed to strengthen the manuscript. Specifically, the following key points need your full attention:</p><p>1) A key question is whether the observed ER stress response is a byproduct of infection or is triggered by the parasite to promote its growth and/or survival. Some key additional experiments are required to address this issue (for example transfection of GRA protein, testing the effects of UPR inhibitors on infection).</p><p>2) The host cell transcriptome data should be presented in more details, including a list of differentially expressed genes, and a more thorough discussion of which UPR pathways are affected.</p><p>Importantly beside the Essential Revisions, please consider the recommendations made by the individual reviewers and address all the specific points as far as possible in the revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study reporting that the intracellular parasite Cryptosporidium, an understudied yet medically relevant apicomplexan pathogen, exports proteins into the cytoplasm of infected cells. The manuscript is very well written and describes a large amount of work based on state of the art genetic approaches.</p><p>The authors used genetic tagging to investigate the cellular localization of members of multigene families, and identified MEDLE2 as a protein that is efficiently exported into the cytoplasm of infected cells, both in cultured cells and infected mice. The authors found that MEDLE2 export occurs after invasion, indicative of a translocon-mediated process, and is blocked when the protein is fused to ordered reporters. Using a series of mutants, the authors identify a N-terminal host targeting motif and a critical Leucine residue required for export of MEDLE2. They also document MEDLE2 protein cleavage during export. Finally, RNAseq analysis of cells transfected with MEDLE2 revealed a subset of differentially expressed host genes, pointing at a possible ER stress response of the host cell induced by expression of MEDLE2. These data were confirmed on a small subset of genes using qPCR in infected mice.</p><p>While the concept of protein export has been extensively studied in other apicomplexan parasites, this study offers additional insights into host-parasite interactions and a counterpoint to protein translocation mechanisms in Plasmodium and Toxoplasma. MEDLE2 export shares some aspects with protein export in these parasites, but also points at possible divergence, as the translocon elements present in Plasmodium spp or <italic>T. gondii</italic> are not found in Cryptosporidium. Although the export machinery remains to be identified, this study opens perspectives to study protein export as a target for therapeutic strategies against cryptosporidiosis. Initial characterization of the host cell response revealed a transcriptional signature of ER stress and unfolded protein response, but this aspect of the manuscript is rather superficial.</p><p>In summary, this well conducted study provides a comprehensive characterization of protein export in Cryptosporidium-infected cells. This work will stimulate future studies to identify the export machinery. A key question at this stage is the function of MEDLE2 and other exported proteins, and whether the host ER stress response is a bystander effect or a specific response induced by the parasite to promote its growth or survival.</p><p>The host cell response could be explored in more details. There are several UPR pathways and it is not clear whether canonical UPR proteins are affected by MEDLE2. A previous study showed that <italic>C. parvum</italic> induces an ER response in HCT-8 cells (PMID 23986438), and this paper should be discussed here.</p><p>The RNAseq data (Figure 6D) shows that only a small fraction of ER stress response genes are significantly upregulated, and there are other genes that are even more upregulated. What are these genes? A full list of DGE should be provided as a supplemental table and discussed in the text.</p><p>A key question is whether the observed ER stress response is a byproduct of infection or is triggered by the parasite to promote its growth and/or survival. There are a number of simple experiments, based on knockout or knockdown of key UPR components, or using agonists or chemical inhibitors, which could provide elements of response.</p><p>Another open question is the function of MEDLE2. Ectopic expression via transfection of MEDLE2 in host cells may not reflect the natural responses during infection. While the presence of multiple copies of MEDLE genes is probably a major obstacle for genetic studies, the authors could test whether the host cell response differs when MEDLE2 is exported (wildtype protein) or not (mutant versions). This would provide stronger evidence that in the context of infection MEDLE2 is directly responsible (at least in part) for the observed host cell response. Related to this point, line 28 and 75: there is no evidence that MEDLE2 is a pathogenesis factor</p><p>MEDLE2 processing shares common features with processing in Plasmodium/Toxoplasma, where aspartyl proteases are involved. Did the authors try to block MEDLE2 export with aspartyl protease inhibitors?</p><p>The image quality of Fig5D is not optimal, the MEDLE2-HA signal is very weak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This comprehensive study elegantly demonstrates that like other parasites of the phylum <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic> exports proteins into the cytosol of infected cells by a sophisticated mechanism. The authors investigate in great detail the maturation, transit and export of the MEDLE2 protein across the <italic>C. parvum</italic> lifecycle in culture and infected animals. Briefly, they showed that MEDLE2 passes through the secretory pathway and holds a host targeting motif that is processed during export. MEDLE2 is a bona fide intrinsically disordered protein (IDP), i.e., the protein has no single well-defined tertiary structure under native conditions. This feature is also shared by the growing family of exported GRA proteins in <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> and like them, MEDLE2 exports is blocked by ordered reporters.</p><p>While there is substantial evidence presented that supports the delivery of MEDLE2 in the cytosol of the infected enterocytes, the transit and secretion of other MEDLE family members is less clear. This does not detract from the discovery of a highly regulated export system of parasite-derived effectors in <italic>C. parvum</italic>, of which MEDLE2 is the flagship.</p><p>Based on a wide variety of approaches, the experiments were well designed with appropriate controls and biological replicates, but further clarification is needed, especially with respect to transcriptional analyses based on expression in a heterologous system of the parasite effector. MEDLE2 does not accumulate in the nucleus of infected cells, yet its ectopic expression in mammalian cells is altering the expression of genes involved in ER stress response, including changes in genes linked to the unfolded protein response. One would have to rule out the possibility that the induction of this pathway is not simply a byproduct of the transient overexpression of a disordered protein. This argument is to some extent mitigated by the demonstration that alteration of genes in this pathway has also been observed during infection with <italic>C. parvum</italic>, yet definitive evidence with a medle2 KO is still missing.</p><p>Overall, all the molecular and cell biological analyses and data presented are technically strong and quite convincing and support the notion of an important and novel example of a pathogen-derived modulator of the host response in <italic>C. parvum</italic>.</p><p>– Lines 368-371: the authors state that &quot;It remains to be determined whether the UPR is a byproduct of host detection of the disordered protein MEDLE2 following its translocation during <italic>C. parvum</italic> infection, or if it is an active process deliberately triggered to promote parasite survival.&quot; A key experiment to address this dilemma rightly formulated by the authors would be to express in 293 cells in parallel to MEDLE2, instead of GFP, a mock protein with an intrinsically disordered region (e.g. a Tg exported GRA protein), and monitor by qRT-PCR the expression levels of the genes mentioned in Figure 6F.</p><p>– Ectopic expression of MEDLE1 at the TK locus (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E-F) under the control of a fragment of the MEDLE2 promoter only greatly enhances extra-vacuolar MEDLE1 secretion. How were the functional boundaries of MEDLE2 promoter/enhancer (if any) determined? It would have been wise to keep the genomic context of MEDLE2 by making an in-locus promoter fusion (i.e. replacing MEDLE2 ORF by a tagged version of MEDLE1). This would provide insight into whether MEDLE2 protein is better optimized for transport or its expression is strong enough to see accumulation in the cell.</p><p>– In Figure 6F, we would expect to see quantification of target gene expression under both uninfected and infected conditions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript demonstrates that MEDLE2 is exported by diverse parasite stages and fails to export when tethered to folded reporters. Targeted mutagenesis shows that Leucine 35 is required for the correct processing of MEDLE2, and is also a prerequisite for successful export. The authors go on to show that mammalian protein expression of MEDLE2 leads to an unfolded protein response and that this correlates fairly well with the response seen in vivo. The work is well done and the manuscript is clearly written. This paper opens up the field for exploration of effector proteins and their export mechanism.</p><p>– Brefeldin A experiments suggest that transit through the secretory pathway is required, though viability of the treated parasites needs to be demonstrated. A poison like azide would also block transit without demonstrating that vesicular transport is involved.</p><p>– Endogenous tagging of MEDLE2, as well as trials of knocking out the gene showed that the wild type locus is present in the transfected population even after the integration of the transgene cassette. Based on that, the author concluded that there are multiple copies of the MEDLE2 gene in <italic>C. parvum</italic> genome. However, might an alternative explanation be that the transfected population is a mixture of wild type and genetically modified parasites?</p><p>– The MEDLE2-GFP fusion that was used to determine the effect of the protein on host cells has 15 residues (aa 21 to 35) more than what would be expected to remain on the protein exported from the parasite. This is very likely not an issue, but the caveat should be noted.</p><p>– In figure 5D, it would be good to have both infected and uninfected cells to show the background fluorescence.</p><p>– Lines 93-94 refer to Figure 1B and C.</p><p>– Is there some parasite retention of the I36 mutant? Looks like there might be from the one example shown.</p><p>– The most highly upregulated gene is not identified by name, contrary to what is said in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70451.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The host cell response could be explored in more details.

In response we have tested the impact of chemical inhibition of the UPR in HCT8 cells during <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> infection using inhibitors. We chose inhibitors specific for 2 UPR signaling pathways for which we observed changes in our RNA sequencing datasets from MEDLE2 transfection and infection.

However, to date, this has not been possible due to multiple technical limitations. Genetic modifications that ablate export (DSP and L35A) were conducted using ectopic copies of MEDLE2, while the remaining endogenous cop(ies) remain intact and translocated to the host cell. We successfully engineered a parasite strain in which MEDLE2 was replaced with a marker (Figure 1—figure supplement 2); however, additional wild type copies remained. The recent reannotation of the <italic>C. parvum</italic> genome revealed MEDLE2 genes at multiple telomeric sites (Baptista et al., 2021) and we discuss this further in our response to reviewer 3. We did not observe an overt loss of fitness in ectopic mislocalization mutants that we engineered. They produce infections of similar parasite burden in culture and in animals.</p><p>We believe it likely that MEDLE proteins are pathogenesis factors, they are exported into the host cell, and they are under significant selection and encoded in complex highly malleable loci (see below), however, the reviewer is absolutely right that this has not been formally demonstrated. We have thus removed the phrase “pathogenesis factor” from lines 28 and 75 and replaced it with the neutral phrase “parasite proteins”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MEDLE2 processing shares common features with processing in Plasmodium/Toxoplasma, where aspartyl proteases are involved. Did the authors try to block MEDLE2 export with aspartyl protease inhibitors?</p></disp-quote><p>We had attempted to block MEDLE2 export with aspartyl protease inhibitors synthesized for use in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (WEHI916, WEHI842) and <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> (WEHI586). None of the compounds tested fully ablated export (it is our understanding that this is true for Plasmodium as well), but treatment with WEHI842 resulted in accumulation of MEDLE2 and did impact parasite growth. We recognize several potential limitations to these experiments. The specificity and drug sensitivity of the <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> enzyme may be different for that of these other parasites, as may be compound access due to difference in intracellular localization. For these reasons, we decided not to include this data in the current manuscript. We are conducting experiments that seek to explore genetically which <italic>C. parvum</italic> aspartyl protease is responsible for processing exported proteins; however, there are multiple candidates, and these are complex time-consuming experiments that we have not yet concluded, as some of the genes appear to be essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The image quality of Fig5D is not optimal, the MEDLE2-HA signal is very weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality. We have improved the contrast and very much hope the reviewer finds it easier now to appreciate the staining. We cannot redo the full microscopy off all mutants and controls show here. Unfortunately, cryopreservation for <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> oocysts is not fully robust yet. As a result, the parasites need to be passaged through mice to maintain viability every 6 months. Unfortunately, we had to triage what we could keep alive during the pandemic due to our limited access the lab and our mouse facilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>– Lines 368-371: the authors state that &quot;It remains to be determined whether the UPR is a byproduct of host detection of the disordered protein MEDLE2 following its translocation during C. parvum infection, or if it is an active process deliberately triggered to promote parasite survival.&quot; A key experiment to address this dilemma rightly formulated by the authors would be to express in 293 cells in parallel to MEDLE2, instead of GFP, a mock protein with an intrinsically disordered region (e.g. a Tg exported GRA protein), and monitor by qRT-PCR the expression levels of the genes mentioned in Figure 6F.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we cloned TgGRA16 (aa 24-505) into the GFP expression plasmid and performed transfection of HEK293T cells in parallel with MEDLE2-GFP and the GFP only control. qPCR revealed changes in the ER stress response genes CHAC1, DDIT3, NUPR1, and TRIB3. We include these new experiments as Figure 6—figure supplement 2. The experiment shows that multiple unfolded parasite proteins can trigger the response upon transfection. It does not address whether <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic>, or <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> for that matter, benefits from that response to their exported unfolded proteins. We find reduced <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> growth with pharmacological inhibition and genetic ablation experiments – but it’s not a complete block (see response to reviewer one). We agree with the reviewer, that divining pathogen intent is difficult, and thus have taken care in the discussion not to overextend our claim, and to focus on our findings and measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Ectopic expression of MEDLE1 at the TK locus (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E-F) under the control of a fragment of the MEDLE2 promoter only greatly enhances extra-vacuolar MEDLE1 secretion. How were the functional boundaries of MEDLE2 promoter/enhancer (if any) determined? It would have been wise to keep the genomic context of MEDLE2 by making an in-locus promoter fusion (i.e. replacing MEDLE2 ORF by a tagged version of MEDLE1). This would provide insight into whether MEDLE2 protein is better optimized for transport or its expression is strong enough to see accumulation in the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>Little is known about Cryptosporidium promoters, nothing about whether there are enhancers. Intergenic regions are usually small in this very compact genome, and in contrast to e.g. <italic>T. gondii</italic>, 5’UTRs are extremely short. For most genes the transcription initiation site appears to be in close proximity of the initiation codon used for translation. By now we have tested upstream regions of about ten different genes, and empirically found these small regions to be sufficient to drive expression of a reporter gene, and to reproduce the stage specificity and strength of the native locus (see. e.g. Tandel et al., 2019). We did not conduct mechanistic studies into what exactly defines promoters (<italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> is a rather poor model for such studies for numerous technical reasons). There are several published studies exploring this question using <italic>Toxoplasma,</italic> which found epigenetic marks and transcription factor binding sites in proximity of the transcription initiation site. We do have extensive transcriptional data and using multiple transcriptomic datasets we found the transcription initiation site of MEDLE2 to fall within a few bp of the start of the coding region.</p><p>Maybe more importantly, we have experimentally tested the presumptive promoter by using it to drive ectopic (<italic>medle2</italic>)MEDLE2-HA expression in the TK locus. We found expression timing and targeting to be indistinguishable from MEDLE2 tagged in the native locus. We used the same sequence and strategy to construct all of our point mutations with highly consistent results. And thus again used this strategy to engineer the chimeric (<italic>medle2</italic>)MEDLE1-HA (as so often, experiment shown early in the article, in real-life were done towards the end). In planning the point mutation studies, we actually considered performing “in locus” experiments similar to the one the reviewer discussed here. In the end we decided against this, however. The main reason was that <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> genetic engineering relies exclusively on double stranded break repair by homologous recombination. Painful past experience taught us that even short stretches of sequence identity of 10-20 bp can suffice to enable unwanted cross overs (see e.g. Vinayak et al., 2020). As a result, when targeting a locus with identical or highly similar sequences, the repair DNA construct has to be extensively recodonized. Changing the primary sequence and codon usage comes with its own costs and caveats and may impact transcription and translation efficiency. We thus opted to use ectopic expression here. We have made this point more explicitly now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 6F, we would expect to see quantification of target gene expression under both uninfected and infected conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion in how the data is being displayed. The graph in 6F is displayed as the fold change for each the genes of interest compared to the uninfected control. The left most panel represents the fold change of the uninfected, which is 1 for each of the genes being tested. Showing the fold change of the uninfected for each gene may make this clearer and we have updated the graph to reflect this now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript demonstrates that MEDLE2 is exported by diverse parasite stages and fails to export when tethered to folded reporters. Targeted mutagenesis shows that Leucine 35 is required for the correct processing of MEDLE2, and is also a prerequisite for successful export. The authors go on to show that mammalian protein expression of MEDLE2 leads to an unfolded protein response and that this correlates fairly well with the response seen in vivo. The work is well done and the manuscript is clearly written. This paper opens up the field for exploration of effector proteins and their export mechanism.</p><p>– Brefeldin A experiments suggest that transit through the secretory pathway is required, though viability of the treated parasites needs to be demonstrated. A poison like azide would also block transit without demonstrating that vesicular transport is involved.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that pharmacological experiments have their caveats. BFA has more limited effects than azide, as it targets ER to Golgi trafficking and does not cause generalized cellular asphyxiation. However, it is likely to block parasite growth as they depend on BFA sensitive pathways to build secretory organelles required for invasion. For this reason, we also conducted genetic experiments that ablated the signal peptide, and these produced very similar results. We note the extensive short-term use of BFA to study protein trafficking in apicomplexan parasites over the last 20 years (e.g. Soldati et al., 1998 studying rhoptry protein maturation, or Wickham et al., 2001 studying the export of PFEMP1, Tonkin et al., 2006 studying apicoplast targeting). Not every pathway is immediately ablated by BFA toxicity. While targeting to e.g. the rhoptry, the food vacuole, or the host cell is susceptible to BFA, targeting of the apicoplast or the mitochondrion is not (a small number of specific apicoplast proteins does traffic via Golgi, and those are susceptible). We limited our experiments to a single merogony cycle and added BFA 3h following invasion with 7h incubation prior to fixation. Nonetheless, we now formally acknowledge that BFA is likely to inhibit long-term parasite growth in the segment that describes this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Endogenous tagging of MEDLE2, as well as trials of knocking out the gene showed that the wild type locus is present in the transfected population even after the integration of the transgene cassette. Based on that, the author concluded that there are multiple copies of the MEDLE2 gene in C. parvum genome. However, might an alternative explanation be that the transfected population is a mixture of wild type and genetically modified parasites?</p></disp-quote><p>We considered this alternative, however, our mapping studies indicated that the locus was properly modified, but an additional copy (copies) of WT MEDLE2 persisted independently (Figure 1- Supplemental Figure2). We note that this was the same for all our experiments targeting this locus (even when we did not disrupt the gene). In experiments where we introduced an epitope tag or a fluorescent reporter, we could observe the presence of the cassette by following the protein(s) it encoded. All parasites uniformly expressed the endogenously tagged MEDLE2-HA arguing against heterogeneity due to transgene loss. Furthermore, while passaging transgenic oocysts through mice, we maintain selection with paromomycin. The MEDLE2-HA-tdNeon strain has been passaged through mice 8 times, and the presence of the transgene and WT bands remained unchanged. The subtelomeric locus that is home to MEDLE2 has long puzzled us, however, a recent genome reannotation effort by the Kissinger lab (Baptista et al., 2021) found numerous copies of the MEDLE gene family in multigene cassettes at different telomeres. This is not due to assembly artefacts as it is based on nanopore long read, single molecule sequencing. Please refer to Figure 6 in https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.29.428682 which shows complex expression sites with numerous copies of MEDLE genes, and the detailed discussion provided in that article. The overall conclusion was that the population of <italic>C. parvum</italic> parasites infecting an animal maintains multiple alternative telomeres among its individuals which contains members of multigene families with MEDLE being most prominent. These parasites engage in constant sexual recombination, and it appears that different members of the population may carry different cassettes. Note that the rest of the genome is very stable. Similar cassettes are known from antigenically varied pathogenesis factors in other organisms. We believe it likely that this organization reflects the overall importance of this gene family in host-parasite interaction, but more work is needed to fully understand this. The Baptista article and the complex telomere architecture is mentioned directly in the discussion now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The MEDLE2-GFP fusion that was used to determine the effect of the protein on host cells has 15 residues (aa 21 to 35) more than what would be expected to remain on the protein exported from the parasite. This is very likely not an issue, but the caveat should be noted.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We now have made note of this in the text to ensure that the reader is aware of what exactly this construct includes: “we note that this protein contains 15 amino acids (aa 21 to 35) that are likely missing in parasite exported MEDLE2 due to N-terminal processing” (lines 262-264).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In figure 5D, it would be good to have both infected and uninfected cells to show the background fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that we did not include images of these controls. The images provided in Figure 5D are cropped to show only a single parasite containing infected cell. We now provided uncropped images for each of the representative cells shown in panel 5D to include uninfected cells to demonstrate the background fluorescence as a supplemental figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Lines 93-94 refer to Figure 1B and C.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have incorporated this citation for figure 1B and C in the text (lines 93-94).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Is there some parasite retention of the I36 mutant? Looks like there might be from the one example shown.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an astute observation by the reviewer, and we did not initially notice this ourselves. We do agree that the image provided appears to have accumulated MEDLE2 near the site of infection. We looked at additional images and believe the image here may represent MEDLE2 being exported within a normal context, as some images show MEDLE2 accumulation, while others do not. We cannot exclude the possibility that mutation of I36A may lead to accumulated MEDLE2 in the parasite; however, it does not ablate MEDLE2 export as is the observation for L35A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The most highly upregulated gene is not identified by name, contrary to what is said in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion.
