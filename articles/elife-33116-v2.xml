It shares a striking sequence similarity to the Hrd1 complex that plays critical roles in the ER-associated degradation pathway. Using biochemical purification and mass spectrometry, we identified two novel Dsc subunits, which we named as Gld1 and Vld1. Surprisingly, Gld1 and Vld1 do not coexist in the same complex. Instead, they compete with each other to form two functionally independent Dsc subcomplexes. The Vld1 subcomplex takes the AP3 pathway to reach the vacuole membrane, whereas the Gld1 subcomplex travels through the VPS pathway and is cycled between Golgi and endosomes by the retromer. Thus, instead of being Golgi-specific, the Dsc complex can regulate protein levels at three distinct organelles, namely Golgi, endosome, and vacuole. Our study provides a novel model of achieving multi-tasking for transmembrane ubiquitin ligases with interchangeable trafficking adaptors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33116.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins perform many tasks and, to remain healthy, each cell must ensure that its proteins are in good condition and present at the right levels. Plants, animals and fungi all largely deal with damaged, or otherwise unneeded, proteins by tagging them with a small marker called ubiquitin. The tagged proteins are then rapidly destroyed, which prevents them from harming the cells.</p><p>Enzymes known as E3 ligases attach ubiquitin to proteins. Yet, the number of E3 ligases is dwarfed by the number of proteins modified with ubiquitin. For instance, humans have approximately 20,000 different proteins, about one third of which are found in or on cell membranes. However, there are only around 600 E3 ligases, and only about 50 of them are associated with cell membranes. This is further complicated by the fact that proteins are also present in distinct compartments within the cell.</p><p>The Dsc complex, for example, is an E3 ligase from yeast that is found within a compartment of the cell known as the Golgi. It was thus expected to only attach ubiquitin to Golgi proteins. Yet some recent studies showed that the Dsc complex could also tag proteins present in two other compartments of yeast cells: the endosome and vacuole. How can the Dsc complex act on proteins in three distinct compartments?</p><p>The Dsc complex is actually made from multiple proteins, and Yang et al. now report two new protein components. Biochemical and genetic tools showed that these two proteins do not co-exist in the same Dsc complex. Instead, they compete with each other to form two different kinds of Dsc complexes, which Yang et al. refer to as subcomplexes.</p><p>Further work showed that the two new proteins determine the route taken by the Dsc complex along the cell’s protein transport pathway. One subcomplex is transported to the vacuole and the other cycles between the Golgi and endosomes. Thus, by changing just one component, the Dsc complex can be sent to different locations within the cell.</p><p>These findings describe a new mechanism that enables E3 ligases to multi-task on a wide range of proteins, even across distinct compartments of the cell. Future work will determine whether plant and animal cells also use a similar strategy. Since defects in protein quality control contribute to many human diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, working out how E3 ligases work is important for the field of biomedicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>lysosome</kwd><kwd>golgi</kwd><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>Dsc E3 ligase complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCubed fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single transmembrane E3 ligase complex can regulate protein ubiquitination at multiple organelles using interchangeable targeting subunits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ubiquitin-dependent protein down-regulation and quality control are important for maintaining the integrity of all organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arvan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

Focusing on the down-regulation of lysosomal membrane proteins, we recently identified two independent E3 ligase systems on the budding yeast vacuole (yeast lysosome) membrane, each governing a different subset of vacuolar membrane proteins. The Ssh4-Rsp5 system selectively ubiquitinates a vacuolar lysine transporter Ypq1 to down-regulate the lysine import activity after lysine withdrawal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sekito et al., 2014</xref>), whereas Zn<sup>2+</sup> withdrawal results in the selective ubiquitination of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> importer Cot1 by the Dsc E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). Interestingly, Rsp5 can work together with the Dsc complex to down-regulate a Zn<sup>2+</sup> exporter Zrt3 when excessive Zn<sup>2+</sup> is present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). These ubiquitinated membrane proteins will be directly internalized into the vacuole lumen by the ESCRT machinery for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Originally discovered in fission yeast, the <italic>S. pombe</italic> Dsc complex contains six components, including Tul1, Dsc2, Dsc3, Dsc4, Ubx3, and the AAA+ ATPase Cdc48 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>). These components, with the exception of Dsc4, also exist in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobzinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tong et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, most Dsc components share sequence similarity to the Hrd1 E3 ligase complex, a key player in ER protein quality control. Tul1 is a multi-spanning membrane RING domain E3 ligase that is related to Hrd1. Other components, including Dsc2, Dsc3, Ubx3, are homologous to Der1, Usa1, and Ubx2 of the Hrd1 complex, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stewart et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2011</xref>). Furthermore, both complexes contain the same AAA+ ATPase Cdc48. The striking similarity suggests the Dsc complex might play a role in protein quality control at the downstream organelles of the secretory pathway.</p><p>Probably the biggest controversy about the Dsc complex is its subcellular localization. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the Dsc complex has been shown to be critical to the proteolytic activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factor, which is a Golgi membrane protein. Consistently, fission yeast Dsc complex has been shown to localize to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burr et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stewart et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it is also generally accepted that the Dsc complex is a Golgi-specific E3 ligase complex. Tul1 was initially identified as a Golgi protein quality control E3 ligase through its ability to recognize and ubiquitinate an artificial folding mutant of Pep12, which is cycled between Golgi and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Reggiori and Pelham, 2002</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the Dsc complex is also responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of another Golgi membrane protein Yif1, after either amino acid starvation or rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dobzinski et al., 2015</xref>). However, the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologue of Tul1, FLY1, is predominantly localized to the late endosome, instead of the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voiniciuc et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, Graham and colleagues recently demonstrated that the budding yeast Tul1 participates in the ubiquitination and recycling of an exocytic v-SNARE Snc1 at the early endosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Xu et al., 2017</xref>). Lastly, we observed that Dsc complex is responsible for the down-regulation of some vacuole membrane proteins in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). How can a Golgi E3 ligase complex ubiquitinate a vacuole membrane protein such as Cot1?</p><p>In this study, we resolved this controversy by identifying two new components of the Dsc complex, which we named as Gld1 (<underline>G</underline>olgi/endosome <underline>L</underline>ocalized <underline>D</underline>sc protein <underline>1</underline>) and Vld1 (<underline>V</underline>acuole <underline>L</underline>ocalized <underline>D</underline>sc protein <underline>1</underline>). Gld1 and Vld1 are two similar tetra-spanning membrane proteins that compete with each other to form functionally independent Dsc subcomplexes at the ER. The Gld1-containing subcomplex takes the VPS (<underline>v</underline>acuolar <underline>p</underline>rotein <underline>s</underline>orting) pathway for its localization and is cycled between endosomes and Golgi by the retromer complex. In contrast, the Vld1-containing subcomplex travels through the AP3 pathway to the vacuole membrane. Together, this novel mechanism enables the cell to achieve protein regulation and probably quality control at three distinct organelles, namely Golgi, endosomes, and the vacuole, using just one RING domain E3 ligase Tul1. We propose that plant and mammalian cells might use a similar strategy to target their membrane-residing E3 ligases to different organelles in order to expand their substrate repertoire.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting pathways utilized by the Dsc complex</title><p>Two independent pathways have been identified to deliver proteins from the Golgi to vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The VPS pathway transports vacuolar proteases such as CPY, Pep4 and Prb1 to the vacuole lumen via the intermediate endosomal compartments marked by the Pep12 SNARE protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowers and Stevens, 2005</xref>). It is also used to deliver ubiquitinated membrane cargoes to the vacuole lumen for degradation. Furthermore, some vacuolar membrane proteins, such as Vph1 and Ssh4, also utilize the VPS pathway to reach the vacuole surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>).

These membrane proteins typically contain an acidic di-leucine targeting motif (D/EXXXLL, where X can be any amino acid), which can be recognized at the late Golgi by the AP3 adaptor complex for sorting into carrier vesicles that then directly target and fuse with the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>). Deletion of the AP3 complex leads to an accumulation of AP3 cargoes at the Golgi and forces them to traffick to the vacuole membrane via the VPS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Llinares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Odorizzi et al., 1998b</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported that the Dsc complex has three distinct subcellular localizations, including Golgi, endosomes, and vacuole. At the steady state, about 60% of the Dsc complex localizes to the vacuole membrane, whereas the rest appears to be on punctae that co-localize with the Golgi and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). This multi-localization pattern is very interesting among membrane proteins in the endomembrane trafficking pathway. At steady state, most endomembrane proteins are either localized to the vacuole membrane, or to punctae that include Golgi and endosomes. For example, Vph1, a V<sub>O</sub> subunit of the vATPase complex localizes to the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manolson et al., 1992</xref>), while its isoform, Stv1, localizes to Golgi and endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manolson et al., 1994</xref>). As another example, Ssh4 and Ear1, two homologous adaptor proteins for the E3 ligase Rsp5, localize to the vacuole and Golgi/endosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Léon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). Furthermore, to maintain their punctae localization, some Golgi and endosomal membrane proteins are constantly recycled by the retromer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burd and Cullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hettema et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). Only in retromer mutants do these Golgi/endosome proteins mislocalize to the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burd and Cullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strochlic et al., 2007</xref>). Then, how does the Dsc complex achieve three distinct subcellular localizations in wild type cells?</p><p>Intrigued by its localization pattern, we set out to determine the targeting pathway utilized by the Dsc complex. We chose Ubx3 to represent the Dsc complex because: (1) Ubx3 forms a stable complex with the rest of the Dsc components. Antibody-mediated depletion of Ubx3 almost completely depletes the entire Dsc complex from the cell lysate; (2) Ubx3 is the only Dsc component that can be chromosomally tagged with fluorescent proteins without abolishing Dsc function in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). To begin the investigation, we tagged Ubx3 with mNeonGreen, a green fluorescent protein that is similar to GFP in size, but about two times brighter than GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaner et al., 2013</xref>). In the wild type strain, Ubx3-mNeonGreen (hereafter referred to as Ubx3-nG) localized to the vacuole membrane and intracellular punctae, consistent with our previous observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2015a</xref>). In contrast, deleting <italic>VPS27</italic>, which encodes an essential component of the ESCRT machinery, led to a partial accumulation of the Ubx3-nG in the class E compartment. A significant amount of Ubx3-nG, however, was still able to reach the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As a control, Vph1-mCherry (hereafter referred to as Vph1-mCh), a cargo of the VPS pathway, was almost entirely trapped in the class E compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, deleting the gene encoding the endosomal t-SNARE Pep12 blocked the trafficking of Vph1-mCh and led to a ‘cytosolic’ accumulation of Vph1-mCh as numerous small vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The same <italic>PEP12</italic> deletion, however, only resulted in a partial accumulation of Ubx3-nG in the cytosol, with a significant amount of the protein reaching the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the Dsc complex might use both VPS and AP3 pathways for its trafficking. However, VPS and AP3 cargoes use different signals for their targeting. How can one protein complex contain both targeting signals? A possible explanation might be that the Dsc complex has two distinct sub-populations. One uses the AP3 pathway, the other uses the VPS pathway.</p><p>To test whether a fraction of the Dsc complex uses the AP3 pathway for vacuolar delivery, we deleted <italic>APL6</italic>, which encodes a key component of the AP3 adaptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Odorizzi et al., 1998b</xref>). Interestingly, although <italic>APL6</italic> deletion did not change the punctae localization of Ubx3-nG, it led to an accumulation of the Ubx3-nG in the vacuole lumen. The result is different from the reported AP3 pathway cargoes such as ALP and Ypq1, which partially accumulate at the Golgi and partially reach the vacuole membrane via the VPS pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowles et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>), in the absence of the AP3 adaptor complex. This implied that the AP3 Dsc subcomplex, when forced into the VPS pathway, was recognized by an unidentified endosomal protein quality control machinery as an ‘abnormal’ protein complex and degraded in the vacuole lumen. However, this hypothesis cannot explain the fact that Dsc complex normally exists on the Golgi and endosomes at the steady state, unless the AP3 Dsc sub-population carries a distinct unknown subunit that does not exist in the Golgi/endosome subcomplex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of two new components of the Dsc complex</title><p>To investigate if there are unknown components in the Dsc complex that determine its trafficking pathways, we chromosomally tagged Ubx3 with the Flag tag at the C-terminus and performed immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments to isolate the Dsc complex.

Examining the Vld1 protein sequence revealed a putative acidic di-leucine motif (<sub>233</sub><underline>E</underline>ITP<underline>LL</underline><sub>238</sub>) close to the C-terminus of the protein. Fungal sequence alignment indicated that this motif is conserved among orthologues from different fungal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cliften et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kellis et al., 2003</xref>). In order to test if this motif is important for the AP3 pathway trafficking, we mutated the sequence to <sub>233</sub><underline>A</underline>ITP<underline>AA</underline><sub>238</sub>. However, these changes caused an instability of Vld1-nG, and nearly all of it was degraded by an unknown mechanism (data not shown). As an alternative, we deleted the last six amino acids of Vld1 (<sub>237</sub><underline>LL</underline>NIAE<sub>242</sub>), including the di-leucine (<italic>vld1</italic><sup>∆6AA</sup>-nG). This deletion caused a partial punctate (Golgi and endosomes) accumulation and partial vacuolar degradation of <italic>vld1</italic><sup>∆6AA</sup>-nG in wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), a phenotype similar to that of Vld1-nG in the <italic>apl6</italic>∆ strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results indicated the importance of the di-leucine motif. Further deletion of the <italic>PEP12</italic> gene, which eliminates the VPS pathway, completely blocked the <italic>vld1</italic><sup>∆6AA</sup>-nG trafficking and the protein appeared as numerous tiny ‘cytosolic’ punctae outside the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In contrast, the trafficking of an AP3 pathway cargo, mCh-ALP, was not affected by the <italic>PEP12</italic> deletion. We also tested whether the acidic E<sub>233</sub> residue is important for the Vld1 trafficking. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, a single E<sub>233</sub> to A<sub>233</sub> mutation (<italic>vld1</italic><sup>E233A</sup>-nG) was sufficient to cause trafficking defects similar to <italic>vld1</italic><sup>∆6AA</sup>–nG. All together, these results strongly indicate that the putative acidic di-leucine motif is important for the trafficking of Vld1 through the AP3 pathway.</p><p>The observation that Gld1 co-localizes with FM4-64 labelled endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) supports the hypothesis that the protein travels through the VPS pathway. To confirm this, we tested if the ESCRT or <italic>PEP12</italic> deletion mutants can affect the trafficking of Gld1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, a fraction of the Gld1-nG punctae co-localized with the Vph1-mCherry labelled class E compartment in <italic>vps27</italic>∆ strain. The Golgi population of Gld1-nG, however, did not accumulate in the class E compartment. In the <italic>pep12</italic>∆ strain, Gld1-nG trafficking was also disrupted and the protein appeared as ‘cytosolic’, with very few punctae left. This phenotype was also similar to that of the VPS pathway cargo Vph1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). To further verify that Gld1 trafficks through the VPS pathway, we tested if Gld1 is cycled between the Golgi and endosomes by the retromer, a sorting apparatus that functions on the endosomes to prevent important endosomal proteins from mis-targeting to the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burd and Cullen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, deleting <italic>VPS35</italic>, an essential subunit in the retromer complex, resulted in the mis-localization of Gld1-nG to the vacuole membrane.</p><p>Taken together, we conclude that the Dsc subcomplexes use two independent trafficking pathways for their subcellular localizations. The Vld1-containing subcomplex trafficks through the AP3 pathway to reach the vacuole membrane, whereas the Gld1-containing subcomplex travels through the VPS pathway and is cycled between Golgi and endosomes by the retromer machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>One RING to ‘rule’ three organelles</title><p>Protein ubiquitination and degradation is an essential process to rapidly down-regulate protein levels and remove unfolded/damaged proteins in eukaryotic cells. How to recognize so many different substrates in a regulated fashion using a limited number of E3 ligases is a fundamental challenge faced by all eukaryotic cells. For example, the human proteome contains ~19,000–20,000 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>), but only has ~640 E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morreale and Walden, 2016</xref>). This challenge is further complicated by the presence of different organelles that divide the cell into numerous compartments, which requires the proper targeting of E3 ligases to different organelle surfaces. The human proteome has 6,000–7,000 predicted transmembrane proteins. However, there are only ~50 predicted transmembrane E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lussier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura, 2011</xref>). With so few transmembrane E3 ligases, how does the cell achieve the regulated ubiquitination for so many membrane proteins?</p><p>During evolution, eukaryotic cells have developed several ingenious ways to expand the substrate repertoire of existing E3 ligases. At the protein level, one strategy is through the expansion of the interchangeable F-box proteins in the SCF E3 ligase complex. F-box is an approximately 50 amino acids motif that mediates protein-protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kipreos and Pagano, 2000</xref>). As part of the SCF E3 ligase complex, F-box proteins are responsible for recognizing specific substrates. Many SCF complexes only differ in their F-box protein subunits. Therefore, by expanding the F-box protein family, the cell can recognize different substrates using a similar SCF complex. For example, although budding yeast has only 11 F-box proteins, <italic>C. elegans</italic> has more than 300 F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kipreos and Pagano, 2000</xref>), and <italic>A. thaliana</italic> has over 1,300 F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hua et al., 2011</xref>). At the organelle level, another strategy is to use adaptor proteins to recruit cytosolic E3 ligases to different organelle surface. For example, in budding yeast, the NEDD4 family E3 ligase Rsp5 can be recruited to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>), Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hettema et al., 2004</xref>), endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Léon et al., 2008</xref>), and vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2015b</xref>) by different PY motif containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). The PY motif interacts with the WW motifs of Rsp5 to recruit the ligase. A similar recruitment mechanism has been observed for the human NEDD4 family members. The human NEDD4-2 can be recruited to the plasma membrane by the PY motif within the surface epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) protein in order to down-regulate ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fotia et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we report a novel mechanism to directly target a membrane-residing E3 ligase complex to different organelles. Through the characterization of targeting pathways of the budding yeast Dsc complex, we unexpectedly uncovered that the ER can assemble two distinct Dsc subcomplexes using Gld1 and Vld1. Gld1 and Vld1 then guide the Dsc complex through two independent trafficking pathways (VPS and AP3) to reach Golgi/endosomes and lysosomes, respectively. This mechanism allows the cell to achieve protein regulation and probably quality control at three distinct organelles, namely Golgi, endosomes, and vacuole, using just one RING domain E3 ligase Tul1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Because both VPS and AP3 pathways are conserved from yeast to human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that human cells might use a similar strategy to expand the substrate repertoire of their membrane E3 ligases. Consistent with this hypothesis, several human RING domain E3 ligases have been identified in the endomembrane trafficking pathways, such as March2, March3, March11, RNF152, and RNF167 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lussier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>). It remains to be verified whether there is a similar multi-localization mechanism for these E3 ligases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protein quality control on the endosomes</title><p>Endosomes are intermediate transporting organelles between the Golgi (or plasma membrane for endocytosis) and lysosomes. On the endosome, ubiquitinated membrane cargoes are sorted and internalized into the lumen as intraluminal vesicles by the ESCRT machinery, whereas cargo receptors such as LDL receptor in human and Vps10 in yeast will be recycled back to either plasma membrane or Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goldstein and Brown, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seaman et al., 1997</xref>). As stated above, many studies have reported that endosomes also contain E3 ligase systems in yeast, plants, and metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Léon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakamura, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Voiniciuc et al., 2013</xref>). However, it remains to be addressed as to the functions of these endosomal E3 ligases. One reasonable hypothesis is to counteract the activity of endosomal deubiquitinases (Dubs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Léon et al., 2008</xref>). During the endomembrane trafficking, ubiquitinated cargoes can be deubiquitinated by the Dubs and later recycled by the retromer. The presence of endosomal E3 ligases enables the cell to have the capability of determining whether a cargo needs to be degraded or recycled at the endosome stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Léon et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we made a surprising observation that the Vld1-containing Dsc subcomplex, when forced into the VPS pathway, was recognized by an unidentified endosomal protein quality control (EQC) system and degraded inside the vacuole lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). This observation indicated that endosomal E3 ligases may indeed have the capability of recognizing mislocalized proteins and removing them, although the identity of the E3 ligase still needs to be addressed. Strikingly, the only difference between the two subcomplexes were the Vld1 and Gld1 subunits, which are homologous to each other. Yet, the EQC system was able to recognize Vld1 and selectively ubiquitinate the protein. Considering endosomes are constantly receiving exogenous proteins delivered by the transporting vesicles, it is stunning to realize that endosomes can tell the difference between transporting cargoes and mislocalized membrane proteins. Apparently, future investigations, such as identifying the E3 ligase and expanding the substrate list of the EQC system, are needed to address this striking quality control mechanism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (54 yeast strains)</td><td valign="top">please find in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Transfected construct (11 yeast constructs)</td><td valign="top">please find in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-G6PDH</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A9521</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.</td><td valign="top">SC9996</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-Flag</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F7425</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-HA</td><td valign="top">Life technologies</td><td valign="top">715500</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-HA</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">12CA5</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse anti-Vph1</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">10D7</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">rabbit anti-GFP</td><td valign="top">Torrey Pines Biolabs</td><td valign="top">TP401</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">M2 anti-FLAG resin</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">A2426</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-HA resin</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">E6779</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide</td><td valign="top">3xFlag peptide</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F3290</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">Rapamycin</td><td valign="top">LC Laboratories</td><td valign="top">ASW-135</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">Doxycycline</td><td valign="top">Fisher BioReagents</td><td valign="top">162209</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">zymolyase</td><td valign="top">Amsbio</td><td valign="top">120493–1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">FM4-64</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">T3166</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound</td><td valign="top">Protease Inhibitor Cocktail</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">21169500</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, Plasmids, Media, and Growth Conditions</title><p>All yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Christopher G Burd (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The DSC complex is an integral membrane E3 ubiquitin ligase that is broadly localized to organelles of the secretory (Golgi) and endo-vacuolar system of yeast, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This work shows that two forms of the DSC complex exist that differ by inclusion of one of two different subunits. One subunit targets DSC via the AP3 sorting pathway to the vacuole, and the other subunit targets DSC to the Golgi and endosome compartments where each form acts on different substrates.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) gDSC and vDSC should not be presented as an &quot;endosomal protein quality control&quot; system. The presentation of the study highlights the role of the DSC complex as a component of an &quot;endosomal protein quality control&quot; system, using analogy to the ERAD pathway that recognizes and degrades misfolded proteins at the ER. This is in line with the original description of Tul1 activity, but this is the only publication that implicates DSC in quality control per se. Protein &quot;quality&quot; in this sense is not addressed in this study, nor is it clear what aspect(s) of DSC substrates the authors are proposing is recognized. The prevailing view of the field is that the ubiquitin ligases (and their adapters) that operate on nutrient and ion transporters in the endo-vacuolar system recognize open versus closed conformations; these are well ordered, physiological conformations, not misfolded states. The reviewers suggest that you present your study in terms of &quot;regulated ubiquitination&quot; or a related term. The existence of an &quot;endosomal protein quality control&quot; system that harnesses the DSC complexes could be incorporated appropriately in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>2) The statement that Vld1 and Gld1 &quot;govern the ubiquitination of different organelle membrane proteins independently&quot; should only be a suggestion, as it is not experimentally addressed.</p><p>3) The figure legends need to be rewritten to describe strains used and experimental conditions. Currently, it is written more like a Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33116.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) gDSC and vDSC should not be presented as an &quot;endosomal protein quality control&quot; system.

It is an overstatement to claim that the Dsc complex is a protein quality control machinery with the evidence we have. Therefore, we toned down our statements in the Abstract and main text. Specifically, 1) we removed “quality control” in the Abstract; 2) instead of stating “An emerging paradigm of the quality control field is that ubiquitin-dependent protein quality control is important for maintaining the integrity of all organelles”, we started our Introduction with “Ubiquitin-dependent protein down-regulation and quality control are important for maintaining the integrity of all organelles”; 3) also in the Introduction, we replaced “protein quality control” with “down-regulation of lysosomal membrane proteins”; 4) in the second paragraph of the Introduction, we changed the sentence to “the Dsc complex might play a role in protein quality control at the downstream organelles of the secretory pathway”; 5) we replaced “Golgi-specific protein quality control complex” with “Golgi-specific E3 ligase complex”; 6) in the last paragraph of the Introduction, we added “probably” in front of “quality control”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statement that Vld1 and Gld1 &quot;govern the ubiquitination of different organelle membrane proteins independently&quot; should only be a suggestion, as it is not experimentally addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We changed the text to “At these locations, they may govern the ubiquitination of distinct organelle membrane proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The figure legends need to be rewritten to describe strains used and experimental conditions.
