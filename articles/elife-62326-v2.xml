growth in many animals. Multiple upstream components promote Hpo pathway activity, but the organization of these different inputs, the degree of crosstalk between them, and whether they are regulated in a distinct manner is not well understood. Kibra (Kib) activates the Hpo pathway by recruiting the core Hpo kinase cassette to the apical cortex. Here, we show that the Hpo pathway downregulates <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kib levels independently of Yorkie-mediated transcription. We find that Hpo signaling complex formation promotes Kib degradation via SCF<sup>Slimb</sup>-mediated ubiquitination, that this effect requires Merlin, Salvador, Hpo, and Warts, and that this mechanism functions independently of other upstream Hpo pathway activators. Moreover, Kib degradation appears patterned by differences in mechanical tension across the wing. We propose that Kib degradation mediated by Hpo pathway components and regulated by cytoskeletal tension serves to control Kib-driven Hpo pathway activation and ensure optimally scaled and patterned tissue growth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>kibra</kwd><kwd>slimb</kwd><kwd>feedback regulation</kwd><kwd>degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS034783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fehon</surname><given-names>Richard G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007183</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokamov</surname><given-names>Sherzod A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tokamov</surname><given-names>Sherzod A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Kibra-mediated Hippo complex assembly promotes Kibra degradation in a negative feedback loop that is regulated by mechanical tension.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>How organs achieve and maintain optimal size is a fundamental question in developmental biology. The Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved inhibitor of tissue growth that was first identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in somatic mosaic screens for tumor-suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tapon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harvey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wu et al., 2003</xref>). Central to the Hpo pathway activity is a kinase cassette that includes serine/threonine kinases Tao-1, Hpo, and Warts (Wts), as well as two scaffolding proteins Salvador (Sav) and <underline>M</underline>ob <underline>a</underline>s <underline>t</underline>umor <underline>s</underline>uppressor (Mats). Activation of the Hpo pathway results in a kinase cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation of a transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki) by Wts, which inhibits Yki nuclear accumulation. Conversely, inactivation of the Hpo pathway allows Yki to translocate into the nucleus where, together with its DNA-binding partners such as Scalloped (Sd), it promotes transcription of pro-growth genes. As a result, inactivation of the Hpo pathway is characterized by excessive tissue growth. Mutations that disrupt Hpo pathway activity can lead to various human disorders including benign tumors and carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng and Pan, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A distinct feature of the Hpo pathway is the remarkably complex organization of its upstream regulatory modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fulford et al., 2018</xref>). The core Hpo kinase cascade is regulated from the cell cortex by multiple upstream components, including Fat (Ft), Dachsous (Ds), Echinoid (Ed), Expanded (Ex), Crumbs (Crb), Kibra (Kib), and Merlin (Mer). Broadly speaking, these components localize either exclusively junctionally (a term that we use to include both the adherens junctions and the marginal zone; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tepass, 2012</xref>) or both junctionally and at the apical medial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Ft and Ds are protocadherins that promote Hpo pathway activity from the junctions by restricting the activity of Dachs, an atypical myosin that inhibits Wts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vrabioiu and Struhl, 2015</xref>). Ed is a cell–cell adhesion protein that binds and stabilizes Sav at the junctional cortex, thereby enabling Sav to promote Hpo pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yue et al., 2012</xref>). Ex is a FERM-domain protein that also localizes at the junctional cortex where it binds to the transmembrane protein Crb and activates the Hpo pathway by recruiting the core kinase cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). The WW-domain protein Kib and FERM-domain protein Mer localize both at the junctional and apical medial cortex and promote Hpo pathway activity by recruiting the core kinase cassette independently of Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2017</xref>). The existence of multiple upstream regulatory modules that converge to control the activity of a single downstream effector, Yki, raises a question of whether and how these parallel inputs are regulated and to what extent they are distinct from one another.</p><p>One way that cells modulate signaling output is by controlling the levels of signaling components. Within the Hpo pathway, transcription of Ex, Kib, and Mer is positively regulated by Yki activity in a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yee et al., 2019</xref>). Multiple Hpo pathway components are also regulated post-translationally. For example, Crb promotes Ex ubiquitination via Skip/Cullin/F-box<sup>Slimb</sup> (SCF<sup>Slimb</sup>) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which leads to Ex degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fulford et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, Ds and Dachs levels are downregulated by the SCF<sup>Fbxl-7</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase, and Dachs stability is also influenced by an E3 ubiquitin ligase called Early girl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodrigues-Campos and Thompson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Misra and Irvine, 2019</xref>). Sav stability is also inhibited by the HECT (Homologous to the E6-AP Carboxyl Terminus) ubiquitin ligase Herc4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerne et al., 2015</xref>). These studies underscore the importance of post-translational regulation of Hpo pathway components and suggest that individual signaling branches of the Hpo pathway might be regulated in a distinct manner from one another.</p><p>In this study, we reveal that the Hpo pathway negatively regulates Kib levels via post-translational negative feedback. We show that the regulation of Kib levels by the Hpo pathway is independent of Yki- and Sd-mediated transcriptional output and is instead mediated by SCF<sup>Slimb</sup>. We find that this mechanism operates independently of other upstream inputs, such as Ex/Crb or Ft/Ds, and requires Kib-mediated complex formation. Intriguingly, our data suggest that Kib degradation is regulated by mechanical tension across the wing imaginal tissue. We propose a model in which Kib-mediated Hpo pathway complex formation results in Kib degradation in isolation from other upstream inputs, thereby forming a tightly compartmentalized negative feedback loop. Such feedback may function as a homeostatic mechanism to tightly control signaling output specifically downstream of Kib and ensure proper tissue growth during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptional feedback is insufficient to explain the increase in Kib abundance upon pathway inactivation</title><p>A notable feature of the Hpo pathway is that its upstream components Kib, Ex, and Mer are upregulated by Yki transcriptional activity in a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamaratoglu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yee et al., 2019</xref>).

However, when we examined endogenous Kib tagged with the green fluorescent protein (Kib::GFP) in live wing imaginal discs containing either <italic>Mer</italic> or <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones individually, we found that Kib abundance was significantly higher in <italic>Mer</italic> mutant clones than in <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). These results suggest that loss of Mer has a greater effect on Yki transcriptional activity than loss of Ex, which has not been reported previously.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional feedback alone does not explain Kibra (Kib) upregulation in <italic>Mer</italic> clones.</title><p>(<bold>A–G’’’</bold>) All tissues shown are living late third instar wing imaginal discs expressing the indicated fluorescent proteins.

In sharp contrast to what we observed with Kib levels, Yki strongly accumulated in the nuclei of <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones, whereas Yki was mostly cytoplasmic and indistinguishable from wild-type cells in <italic>Mer</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E’’’</xref>). These results indicate that Ex is more potent at inhibiting Yki nuclear translocation than Mer, consistent with Ex’s ability to limit Yki activity by direct sequestration at the junctional cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badouel et al., 2009</xref>) and suggesting that loss of <italic>ex</italic> should have a greater effect on pathway target gene expression than loss of <italic>Mer</italic>.</p><p>To compare the effects of <italic>Mer</italic> and <italic>ex</italic> loss on target gene expression, we examined the expression of <italic>ban3&gt;GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matakatsu and Blair, 2012</xref>), a reporter for one of Yki’s target genes <italic>bantam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Thompson and Cohen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nolo et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>ban3&gt;GFP</italic> expression was significantly upregulated in <italic>ex</italic> mutant clones, whereas no detectible difference was observed in <italic>Mer</italic> clones relative to control tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>), indicating that Yki is more active in <italic>ex</italic> clones than in <italic>Mer</italic> clones. Together, these results suggest that the dramatic increase in Kib levels in <italic>Mer</italic> clones cannot be explained strictly by Yki-mediated transcriptional feedback and that Kib is also regulated via a previously unrecognized non-transcriptional mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Hpo pathway components regulate Kib abundance non-transcriptionally</title><p>If a Yki-independent mechanism is responsible for Kib upregulation in <italic>Mer</italic> clones, then Kib levels should be elevated in <italic>Mer</italic> clones in the absence of Yki activity. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a previously published method of blocking Yki-mediated transcription downstream of the Hpo pathway by removing Yki’s DNA-binding partner, Sd, in the eye imaginal disc, where Sd is dispensable for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koontz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu and Pan, 2018</xref>). Endogenous Kib::GFP was upregulated in <italic>sd; Mer</italic> double-mutant clones to a similar degree as in <italic>Mer</italic> single-mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J’</xref>), suggesting that Mer regulates Kib levels independently of Yki activity.</p><p>To understand how Mer regulates Kib levels, we set out to develop a simpler approach to uncouple Kib protein abundance from its transcriptional regulation. Recently, the <italic>ubiquitin 63E</italic> promoter was used to drive expression of other Hpo pathway components to study their post-translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fulford et al., 2019</xref>), based on the assumption that the ubiquitin promoter is not regulated by Yki activity. Therefore, we made a transgenic fly line ectopically expressing Kib-GFP-FLAG under control of the ubiquitin promoter (Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similar to endogenous Kib::GFP, Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP localized both at the junctional and medial cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Flies expressing Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP had slightly undergrown wings compared to control flies expressing Ubi&gt;GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP promotes Hpo pathway activity. Although wild-type flies expressing Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP were viable, Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP only partially rescued the <italic>kibra<sup>del</sup></italic> null allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), suggesting that expression from the <italic>Ubiquitin</italic> promoter may not be sufficient in some tissues that require Kib for viability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The Hippo (Hpo) pathway regulates Kibra (Kib) levels independently of Yorkie (Yki)-mediated transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cartoon of the DNA construct used to generate the <italic>Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP</italic> transgenic fly line.

Interestingly, Kib<sup>484-1288</sup>-GFP was much less potent at suppressing wing growth compared to wild-type Kib-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1K</xref>), indicating that the first 483 amino acids of Kib are also essential for Hpo pathway activation.</p><p>The first 483 amino acids of Kib contain two WW domains, as well as CC1 and CC2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Deletion of either CC1 or CC2 did not prevent Kib upregulation upon Hpo depletion, indicating that these regions do not mediate pathway-dependent Kib degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E–F’</xref>). However, Kib variants lacking the WW domains, either individually (Kib<sup>ΔWW1</sup>-GFP and Kib<sup>ΔWW2</sup>-GFP) or together (Kib<sup>ΔWW1&amp;2</sup>-GFP), expressed at markedly higher levels than wild-type Kib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Thus, the WW domains of Kib are necessary for its degradation via the Hpo pathway. Importantly, while Kib lacking the WW domains interacted with Slimb normally in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>), depletion of Slimb had no effect on Kib<sup>ΔWW1</sup>-GFP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–D’’</xref>), again suggesting that association between Kib and Slimb alone is not sufficient for Kib degradation.</p><p>Further characterization of the WW domain truncations revealed differences in effects on growth and subcellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1K–O</xref>). Kib<sup>ΔWW1&amp;2</sup>-GFP often had an extremely punctate appearance in imaginal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1N–O’</xref>).

Kib<sup>ΔWW2</sup>-GFP also had a punctate appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1M and M’</xref>), but adults expressing Kib<sup>ΔWW2</sup>-GFP had significantly smaller wings than flies expressing wild-type Kib-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Deletion of WW1 (Kib<sup>ΔWW1</sup>-GFP) resulted in a protein that localized at the apical cortex but did not form puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L and L’</xref>).

Taken together, these results indicate that while both WW domains are required for pathway-mediated Kib turnover, only the WW1 domain of Kib is necessary for Hpo pathway activation.</p><p>We reasoned that if complex formation between Kib and other Hpo pathway components is necessary for Kib degradation, then Slimb might also be a part of this complex. Consistent with this prediction, Slimb co-immunoprecipitated with Mer, Hpo, and Wts in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). We then asked whether the role of the WW domains in Kib degradation was to mediate Kib interaction with other Hpo pathway components. A previous study found that deletion of both WW domains enhanced Kib interaction with Mer in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baumgartner et al., 2010</xref>), a result we confirmed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Kib interacts with Wts in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2010</xref>), and mammalian Kib interacts with Lats2 (a mammalian homolog of Wts) via the WW domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). We found that the interaction of Kib<sup>ΔWW1&amp;2</sup> with Wts was significantly weakened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Additionally, it was previously reported that Pez interacts with Kib via the WW domains in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Poernbacher et al., 2012</xref>), consistent with our in vivo observation that loss of Pez leads to higher Kib levels. Collectively, these results suggest that pathway-mediated Kib degradation requires the WW domains of Kib, possibly because these domains mediate Kib interaction with multiple pathway components.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Mechanical tension patterns Kib degradation across the wing disc epithelium</title><p>We next sought to address the potential developmental significance of Kib degradation by the Hpo pathway and Slimb.

Strikingly, while the relative decrease in width distally was mild in <italic>nub&gt;UASp-Kib-GFP</italic> or <italic>nub&gt;UASp-Kib<sup>S677A</sup>-GFP</italic> wings compared to control wings, the proximal width decreased dramatically in wings expressing Kib<sup>S677A</sup>, indicating that expression of Kib<sup>S677A</sup> inhibited growth disproportionately more in the proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, when the wing length was measured in the proximal-distal (P–D) axis, using L4 vein as an estimate of total length and the posterior crossvein as the approximated midpoint, we found that wing growth was more severely inhibited proximally than distally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that Kib degradation occurs in a patterned manner in the wing imaginal epithelium and could serve to pattern growth of this tissue.</p><p>The pattern of Kib degradation we observe, higher at the periphery and lower in the center, is similar to the pattern of junctional tension in the wing blade reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). This similarity raises the possibility that mechanical tension patterns Kib degradation to regulate pathway activity in parallel to previously described tension-sensing mechanisms that regulate pathway output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alégot et al., 2019</xref>). As an initial test of this hypothesis, we used a previously described method of reducing tension in the wing imaginal epithelium that uses somatic mosaic clones expressing the growth promoting miRNA gene <italic>bantam</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). These clones proliferate faster than and therefore are compressed by the surrounding wild-type cells, leading to lower junctional tension within the clones and higher Hpo pathway activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we observed higher levels of Kib-GFP within <italic>bantam</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E–G’’’</xref>). Interestingly, the increase in Kib abundance in <italic>bantam-</italic>expressing clones was stronger near the center of the wing pouch than its periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–G’’’</xref>), consistent with previous observations that the compression within <italic>bantam</italic>-expressing clones is greater at the center of the pouch than at the periphery, presumably because cells near the center of the wing pouch are already more compressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pan et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, Kib<sup>ΔWW1</sup>-GFP levels did not change in <italic>bantam</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–I’</xref>), as expected if tension-induced Kib degradation requires Kib-mediated Hpo signaling complex formation. Taken together, these results suggest that Kib degradation is patterned by mechanical tension across the wing pouch resulting in decreased Kib in regions of high tension and greater Yki promoted growth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we show that the Hpo pathway negatively regulates Kib levels via a previously unrecognized post-translational feedback loop. Several key results indicate that this feedback is independent of Yki transcriptional activity. First, loss of Mer leads to a dramatic increase in Kib levels without a detectable increase in Yki transcriptional activity. Second, removing Sd, which blocks Yki-mediated transcription, does not suppress the elevated Kib levels upon Hpo pathway inactivation. Third, the abundance of Kib-GFP expressed under a Yki-insensitive promoter (<italic>Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP</italic>) still increases upon Hpo pathway inactivation. Additionally, we show that Kib is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated in a pathway-dependent manner, and that Kib ubiquitination is mediated via SCF<sup>Slimb</sup>.</p><p>Multiple upstream components regulate the core Hpo kinase cassette, but their organization and the degree of crosstalk between them has not been well elucidated. A striking aspect of our findings is the extent to which Kib degradation by the Hpo pathway is insulated from the activity of other upstream pathway regulators. Previous studies have shown that Crb and Ex function together at the junctional cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ling et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sun et al., 2015</xref>) and in parallel to Kib at the medial cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Ft can influence Ex stability at the junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting linkage between these Hpo signaling branches, and Tao-1 functions downstream of Ex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2016</xref>). Although Ex can form a complex with Kib in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Genevet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2010</xref>) and Kib junctional localization is dependent on Crb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Su et al., 2017</xref>), our results show that depletion of Crb, Ex, Ft, or Tao-1 does not affect Kib-GFP levels. Together with our results that Hpo and Wts promote Kib ubiquitination independently of their kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), these data strongly suggest that Kib degradation is triggered by Kib-mediated complex formation. Given the importance of the putative phospho-degron in Kib turnover, we propose that Kib is phosphorylated at S677 upon formation of the signaling complex by an as yet unidentified kinase, leading to the recruitment of SCF<sup>Slimb</sup> and Kib ubiquitination. This model potentially explains the striking compartmentalization of Kib degradation that we observe—loss of Ex or Crb has no effect on Kib abundance because they do not participate in Kib-mediated signaling complexes. Compartmentalized, parallel regulation of pathway activity could clearly have functional implications for the control of tissue growth but at the moment is poorly understood.</p><p>The precise dynamics that lead to Hpo pathway activation vs. Kib degradation remain to be uncovered. In the simplest scenario, we propose that the same complex can function to repress Yki activity or target Kib for degradation. If so, the impact of Kib-mediated complex formation on overall pathway activity could be altered by the relative dynamics of Slimb-mediated degradation vs. Yki phosphorylation. As a consequence, this mechanism could provide a means for regulation of pathway output by factors outside of the pathway itself.</p><p>A remaining question our work defines relates to the functional significance of this mechanism to regulate Kib abundance in developing tissues. Our results suggest that Kib-mediated Hpo signaling is patterned across the wing imaginal epithelium by regulated Kib degradation. Specifically, Kib degradation via the degron-dependent mechanism we have identified is greater at the periphery of the wing pouch than at its center. Previous studies have shown that junctional tension also is greater at the periphery of the wing pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2013</xref>). Higher tension at the wing pouch periphery has been proposed to drive tissue growth, possibly by promoting Yki function, as a compensatory mechanism for low levels of diffusible morphogens that are expressed in narrow bands of cells at the center of the pouch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shraiman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aegerter-Wilmsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hariharan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, junctional tension is known to repress Hpo pathway activity via inhibition of Wts (Lats1/2 in mammals; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rauskolb et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ibar et al., 2018</xref>), though it remains unknown whether junctional tension also affects upstream Hpo pathway regulators such as Kib. Given our results, we propose that tension also promotes Kib degradation and thereby reduces Kib-mediated upstream pathway activation.</p><p>It might seem paradoxical that Kib degradation, which is dependent on signaling complex assembly, is greater at the periphery of the wing pouch where net Hpo pathway activity is thought to be lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hariharan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2018</xref>). However, our results using kinase-dead forms of Hpo and Wts clearly suggest that Kib ubiquitination and degradation can be uncoupled from activation of pathway kinases. We imagine that tension might regulate access of the degradation components (e.g. the putative kinase or SCF<sup>Slimb</sup>) to Kib-organized signaling complexes and thereby regulate Kib-mediated pathway activation. We currently know little about how dynamic Hpo pathway output is in developing tissues, largely because there are no available single-cell resolution reporters for pathway activity. Our findings suggest that pathway output mediated by Kib could be tightly and dynamically regulated in response to mechanical tension or other factors that affect the degradation mechanism described here.</p><p>Another question our study raises is the functional significance of having both transcriptional and post-translational negative feedback mechanisms that regulate Kib levels. Feedback regulation is a common feature in cell signaling, and transcriptional negative feedback can serve to limit the output of a signaling pathway over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perrimon and McMahon, 1999</xref>). In the case of the Hpo pathway, transcriptional feedback mediated by Yki is not specific to Kib, as Ex and Mer expression is also promoted by Yki activity. Moreover, loss of any upstream Hpo pathway regulator, including Ex, Crb, Ft, or Tao-1 would presumably affect Kib levels via the transcriptional feedback. In contrast, the post-translational feedback identified in this study would silence Kib function in a more rapid and specific manner. The role of the post-translational feedback could be to enhance the robustness of Kib-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stelling et al., 2004</xref>), possibly by preventing drastic fluctuations in Kib levels, to ensure optimally scaled and patterned tissue growth. On a broader level, our identification of Kib-specific feedback highlights the importance of understanding why there are multiple upstream inputs regulating the Hpo pathway and how they function during development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Immunoblots were scanned using an Odyssey CLx scanner (LI-COR Biosciences).</p><p>Cells were harvested and lysed on ice in buffer containing 25 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylenediaminetetraacetic_acid">ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid</ext-link>, 0.5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.9 M glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dithiothreitol">Dithiothreitol</ext-link>, and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at one tablet/10 ml concentration.</p><p>For detection of phosphorylated Kib in vivo, dissected wing discs from wandering third-instar larvae (200 discs per condition) expressing <italic>nub&gt;Gal4</italic> with Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP alone or together with an indicated RNAi transgene were immediately flash-frozen in a bath of dry ice and 95% ethanol and stored at −80°C. On the day of IP, the discs were briefly thawed on ice and lysed in buffer described above. PhosSTOP (Sigma Aldrich) phosphatase inhibitor cocktail was added to the lysis buffer to inhibit phosphorylation (one tablet/10 ml of buffer). Kib-GFP was immunoprecipitated with guinea pig anti-GFP antibody (1:1250). A control sample was treated with λ-phosphatase. Samples were run on 8% polyacrylamide gel, with 118:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Scheid et al., 1999</xref>), to better resolve phosphorylated Kib species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Ubiquitination assay and generation of dsRNA</title><p>For ubiquitination assays, pMT-HA-Ub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>) was co-transfected where indicated to provide labeled ubiquitin. To inhibit proteasomal degradation, 50 μM MG132 (Cayman Chemical) and 50 μM calpain inhibitor I (Sigma Aldrich) was added 4 hr prior to cell lysis. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 25 mM Tris [50 mM, pH 7.4]), supplemented with 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide and Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, one tablet/10 ml of buffer). HA-tagged ubiquitin was purified using Pierce anti-HA magnetic beads (clone 2–2.2.14).</p><p>For dsRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, T7 primers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), annealing at the 3′-UTR (for Hpo and Wts) or the coding region (for Slimb), were used to first generate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. The PCR products were then used as templates to transcribe dsRNA using the MEGAscript T7 Transcription Kit (ThermoFisher, catalog #13345).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Image J was used to quantify mean fluorescence intensity in clones vs. control region in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H, O, and P</xref>. In all cases, no more than two clones per imaginal disc were used for quantification. To quantify adult wing sizes, wings were mounted in methyl salicylate and photographed with the same settings on a Zeiss Axioplan 2ie microscope using a Canon camera (EOS rebel T2i). Subsequent measurements of wing size were taken using Image J. Graphical and statistical analyses were performed using MS Excel and R, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank D Pan, K Irvine, J Jiang, N Tapon, D Strutt, J Chiu, M Glotzer, T Lecuit, K Guss, the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, TRiP at Harvard Medical School (NIH/NIGMS R01-GM084947), the Bloomington stock center, and VDRC stock center for fly stocks and other reagents.

One of its upstream regulators is Kibra, which activates the pathway by assembling the Hippo signaling complex to regulate the activity of the downstream transcriptional effector, Yorkie. However, as shown here, activating the Hippo signaling complex also results in the phosphorylation of Kibra itself, which promotes its own degradation via the E3 ubiquitin ligase.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Yorkie-independent negative feedback couples Hippo pathway activation with Kibra degradation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>This is an interesting, well-written manuscript, which addresses the post-transcriptional regulation of Kibra, a regulator of the Hippo pathway, an important pathway controlling growth. The authors convincingly show that Kibra stability is regulated by Slimb, and that Hippo pathway kinases Hpo and Wts promote Kibra phosphorylation and thus Slimb-dependent degradation. They have strong biochemical and imaging-based analyses. They define a function for a Slimb degron, and conduct structure-function to explore Kibra domains in protein turnover.

Their data point to a negative feedback loop mediated by the core Hippo kinase cassette, which regulates one of its upstream regulators, Kibra, in a Yorkie-independent way.

These data indicate loss of ex has a more potent effect on Yki than loss of merlin, and suggest Merlin acts independent of Yki and transcription. Consistent with this model, loss of Sd does not affect Kib levels in the eye. Importantly, ubiquitin driven KibraGFP is increased by loss of Merlin, Sav, Hpo or Wts. The authors note strong junctional accumulation of Kibra upon loss of Hpo or Wts. The authors show Kibra is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated upon Hpo/Wts activation. They show that Kibra has a Slimb degron (DSGVFE), and that mutation of this motif leads to stabilization of Kibra, and makes its levels insensitive to Hpo pathway activation. They also conducted structure function analyses that indicate that the WW domains of Kibra are important for its degradation upon Hpo pathway activation. Because Slimb promotes Ex degradation, loss of Slimb leads to increased Ex, and hence increased Hpo/Wts activity. The authors show overexpressed Ex does not in itself stabilize Kibra. While it is clear that Kibra phosphorylation is promoted by Hpo/Wts, it is still unclear if this is a direct phosphorylation The authors propose a model in which Kibra promotes Hpo/Wts activity, which then locally promotes Kibra degradation. It is not clear how it this local signaling is isolated from other junctional Hpo and Wts.</p><p>The weakest part of this very strong manuscript is Figure 7. If the intent is to show that Kibra is in a pattern in the wing, it would be good to include the staining and intensity quantification of endogenous Kibra in A and B comparison. In Figure 7C and D, the authors should include pictures of examples of adult wings of the different genotypes that they provide the size analysis. Details of the landmarks on the wings they used to define distal and proximal width would be helpful. The manuscript is very strong without this figure, and given the complex feedback loops, it is hard to know if patterned expression drives growth or is a readout of growth.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Tokamov et al. have used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc to explore mechanisms regulating of the abundance of the Hippo pathway upstream regulator, Kibra. They demonstrate that the increase in Kibra protein levels observed upon loss of Hippo pathway activity cannot be fully explained by the known Yki-dependent transcriptional feedback mechanism, and uncover a previously unsuspected post-translational layer of regulation of Kibra protein levels. They show that Kibra is phosphorylated and ubiquitylated in S2 cells, but less so upon knockdown of hpo and wts. They show that knockdown of the ubiquitin ligase substrate recognition subunit Slmb stabilises Kib, and identify a putative phospho-degron for Slmb within Kibra. They further show that mutation of this phospho-degron diminishes Kib ubiquitylation and renders Kibra insensitive to loss of Hippo pathway activity. They then use deletion constructs to narrow down the domains of Kibra necessary for degradation by their new mechanism and find that the regions essential for Kibra to activate the Hippo pathway are the ones necessary for degradation via their mechanism. Finally, they describe a non-uniform pattern of degradation of their Kibra stability reporters across the wing pouch.</p><p>The paper is well written and easy to read. The data are of high quality and the conclusions drawn are supported by the evidence presented. The findings are interesting, novel and should be of interest to the cell signalling and growth control fields.

However, they don't directly test whether Wts kinase activity itself is required for Kibra degradation by Slimb. As they suggest that the assembly of a complex involving Kibra and several pathway members is necessary for degradation, it would be important to test if Wts kinase activity is required, or rather if it is the formation of this complex itself that is necessary to recruit Slimb. For example, this can be done by re-expressing wild type or kinase dead Wts in the S2 cell setup of Figure 3E (dsRNAs targeting the UTRs of wts would have to be used), and/or by looking at the effect of wild type or kinase dead Wts transgenes on ubi-kib-GFP expression in vivo.</p><p>2) To directly connect the Kibra degron identified by the authors with Hippo pathway activity, it would be good to look at expression of a Yki target gene such as ex-lacZ upon Kib-wt and Kib-S677A expression.</p><p>Text/presentation changes:</p><p>1) &quot;These results suggest that the upstream regulation of the Hippo pathway is highly compartmentalized and that the activity of the core kinases is tightly associated with its distinct upstream regulators in a manner that allows little crosstalk between them&quot;.</p><p>Discussion – &quot;Such tightly compartmentalized activity of the Hippo pathway is also suggested by the punctate appearance of all of these proteins at the cell cortex&quot;.</p><p>The authors should clarify in discussion what they mean with these statements.

I assume this is an omission.</p><p>4) The discussion about tension in the wing pouch (Discussion) is confusing. Surely if tension at the periphery of the pouch is higher, leading to decreased Hpo/Wts activity, then Kibra degradation should be lower there, not higher as observed? It therefore doesn't follow that &quot;The results from this study may lead to the elucidation of how external cues, such as mechanical tension, modulate Kib-mediated Hippo signaling and pattern tissue growth.&quot; The authors should clarify this, or remove this part.</p><p>5) The authors should include scale bars in their images.</p><p>6) It would be nice to know which of their images are of live wing discs, and which are fixed (the appearance of reporters such as these can be different in live vs. fixed tissue).

Our point was that because Kibra and Expanded have previously been shown to interact, our concern in this experiment was that the increased Kibra abundance observed upon depletion of Slimb could be due to increased recruitment by Expanded (whose abundance is greatly increased by Slimb depletion). The co-depletion experiment simply shows that increased Kibra is not caused by increased recruitment by Expanded. We have modified the text to make this point clearer to the reader.</p><p>We should also point out that the reviewer was mistaken in that Figure 1 shows endogenous Kibra (GFP-tagged via Crispr) rather than Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP. In this case, we interpret the relatively modest increase in Kibra abundance to the previously identified feedback loop in which Yorkie promotes Kibra transcription. Ubi&gt;Kib-GFP was used in subsequent experiments to eliminate the possibility of Yorkie-mediated transcriptional feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given their conclusion suggesting that the Kibra pathway is patterned, I wonder whether the authors always have studied the same region of the disc when comparing different genotypes.

The main figures that involve wing imaginal discs show images of the entire wing pouch together with higher magnification insets which are indicated by boxes on the lower magnification panels (boxes have been added to Figure 6C-D). This allows the reader to see exactly what part of the wing blade is shown.

With regards to the final point, how this effect can be localized to just medial, Kibra-dependent signaling, we have added new findings to the revised version of the manuscript that we believe are relevant to this issue. As reviewer 3 noted, the data in the original version of the manuscript did not distinguish between a structural vs. enzymatic role for the pathway kinases Hippo and Warts. While the manuscript was being reviewed, we addressed this question using dsRNAs to deplete endogenously expressed Hippo or Warts in S2 cells and expressing RNAi-resistant, kinase dead mutant forms of either kinase. Interestingly, we found that the kinase dead forms of either kinase promote Kibra ubiquitination in S2 cells, indicating that it is formation of the signaling complex (presumably including Merlin, Kibra, Salvador, Hippo and Warts), rather than activation of the kinases, that recruits the Slimb E3 complex that ubiquitinates Kibra. We think this discovery nicely explains how this feedback mechanism is isolated from junctional signaling mediated by Expanded because it indicates that it is formation of the complex itself rather than activation of the kinases that promotes Kibra ubiquitination and degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The weakest part of this very strong manuscript is Figure 7.

A key point that we now realize may not have been clear was that in these experiments Kibra, either wild-type or the degron mutant, was expressed ectopically under Nubbin&gt;Gal4, rather than under its endogenous promoter. We did this because we did not want endogenous transcriptional patterning or transcriptional feedback from Yorkie to confound differences in protein degradation. So, although endogenous Kibra displays a similar abundance pattern to ectopically expressed wild-type Kibra (now shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), we do not think that the endogenous pattern is directly relevant to the question we are asking here. Rather, we think the relevant comparison is between wild-type and degron mutant Kibra, where both forms are expressed identically at the transcriptional level and in a manner not subject to pathway feedback. As the figure shows, in this system the pattern of wild-type and degron mutant Kibra abundance across the wing blade is quite different, suggesting that Kibra degradation is patterned (non-uniform) across the blade. We note that this pattern is strikingly similar to the pattern of observed junctional tension that has been reported previously, leading us to propose that tension might regulate Kibra degradation.</p><p>Additionally, while the original version of the manuscript was under review we used a different experimental approach, designed in the Irvine lab, to further test the hypothesis that tension regulates Kibra abundance. This system uses expression of the microRNA <italic>bantam</italic> to produce small clones of rapidly growing cells in the wing imaginal disc. Because these clones are bounded by slower growing cells, they become compressed and cytoskeletal tension decreases (Pan et al., 2016). We set up this system in the background of either wild-type or ΔWW1 mutant Kibra-GFP expressed under the Ubi promoter. Like the degron mutant, ΔWW1 is not subject to pathway promoted degradation (because it is unable to assemble the complex), but unlike the degron mutant this transgene is not lethal under the Ubi promoter. While we see a robust increase in Kibra-GFP (wild-type) abundance in compressed <italic>bantam</italic>-expressing clones, we do not see any increase in the ΔWW1 mutant Kibra protein.</p><p>Taken together, we feel these two lines of experimental evidence provide evidence that the feedback regulation of Kibra we have identified here is, at least in part, regulated by mechanical tension. While we acknowledge that a fuller understanding of this will depend on understanding its underlying mechanistic basis, we think these interesting observations provide a developmental context that emphasizes the significance of the feedback we have discovered and therefore improve the impact of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7C and D, the authors should include pictures of examples of adult wings of the different genotypes that they provide the size analysis.

In fact, while the original version of this manuscript was under review, we performed exactly the experiment requested. The results convincingly show that the kinase dead forms of Hippo and Warts promote Kibra ubiquitination quite effectively and thus argue that the kinases play a structural rather than enzymatic role in this process. This finding is quite exciting for two reasons. First, it potentially explains the remarkable compartmentalization between Kibra vs. Expanded promoted pathway activation because it argues that the physical presence of the kinases in a complex with Kibra, rather than their enzymatic activity (which might readily spread from one compartment to another), promotes Kibra degradation. Second, this finding suggests that another kinase is required to phosphorylate the degron sequence, a question we hope to solve in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To directly connect the Kibra degron identified by the authors with Hippo pathway activity, it would be good to look at expression of a Yki target gene such as ex-lacZ upon Kib-wt and Kib-S677A expression.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree in principle, in practice the difference in growth is subtle and these reporters are generally less sensitive to gain of upstream pathway function than its loss.
