We developed a novel Förster resonance energy transfer-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FRET-FLIM)-based technique allowing visualization of real-time local interactions of fluorescently tagged SNARE proteins in live cells. We used FRET-FLIM to delineate the trafficking steps underlying the release of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) from human blood-derived dendritic cells. We found that activation of dendritic cells by bacterial lipopolysaccharide leads to increased FRET of fluorescently labeled syntaxin 4 with VAMP3 specifically at the plasma membrane, indicating increased SNARE complex formation, whereas FRET with other tested SNAREs was unaltered. Our results revealed that SNARE complexing is a key regulatory step for cytokine production by immune cells and prove the applicability of FRET-FLIM for visualizing SNARE complexes in live cells with subcellular spatial resolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23525.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23525.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23525.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many processes in living cells involve membranes coming together and fusing. For example, white blood cells known as dendritic cells rely on membrane fusion to fight off infections. When a dendritic cell detects a bacterial infection, it releases signaling molecules called cytokines to recruit other immune cells that help to eliminate the bacteria. The cytokines are contained in membrane-bound packages inside the cell, called vesicles, and are transported outside when these vesicles fuse with the membrane that surrounds the dendritic cell.</p><p>Proteins called SNAREs drive the fusion of a cell’s membranes. These proteins, which are found on both membranes that will fuse, entwine to form a tight complex that pulls the membranes together. Mammals have over 30 different SNARE proteins, and many scientists believe that specific transport routes within cells use distinct pairs of SNAREs. However, to date, it has been difficult to assign specific pairs of SNAREs to specific transport routes with existing techniques.</p><p>Verboogen et al. have now engineered human dendritic cells to add labels onto their SNAREs that fluoresce if the proteins interact. This approach meant that the interactions could be tracked via a microscope. The experiments showed that exposing dendritic cells to a bacterial compound that stimulates the release of cytokines caused two SNARE proteins called syntaxin 4 and VAMP3 to interact more at the cell membrane. This indicates that syntaxin 4 and VAMP3 are important for the release of cytokines from these cells.</p><p>This finding was supported by an additional experiment in which Verboogen et al. switched off the gene for VAMP3 in the dendritic cells and found that this reduced the amount of cytokines that were released. This new microscope-based approach will be useful for identifying the specific pairs of SNARE proteins that are needed for the release and transport of molecules – like hormones and enzymes – that are important in health and disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23525.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23525.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>SNARE proteins</kwd><kwd>membrane trafficking</kwd><kwd>FRET-FLIM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>336479</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Bogaart</surname><given-names>Geert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO-ALW VIDI 864.14.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Bogaart</surname><given-names>Geert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CDA-00022/2014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van den Bogaart</surname><given-names>Geert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel microscopy-based assay shows that dendritic cells encountering pathogenic stimuli form increased complexes of specific SNARE proteins, driving release of large amounts of inflammatory cytokines.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the central paradigms in cell biology is that all intracellular membrane fusion, except for mitochondrial fusion, is catalyzed by soluble NSF (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein) attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>). There are about 36 SNARE proteins identified in mammals which can be classified in R-SNAREs or Q-SNAREs depending on the central residue of their SNARE motif being either arginine (R) or glutamine (Q). The interaction of one R motif and three Q motifs (termed Qa, Qb and Qc) of cognate SNARE proteins located in opposing membranes leads to the formation of a 4-helix coiled-coil bundle. This <italic>trans</italic>-SNARE complex formation brings the membranes in close proximity and catalyzes their fusion. After membrane fusion is complete, the SNAREs are in a so-called <italic>cis</italic>-conformation and need to be disassembled by the AAA-ATPase NSF in conjunction with α-SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Söllner et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>).</p><p>From studies in yeast and many mammalian cell types, including neurons, neuroendocrine cells, adipocytes and epithelial cells, it is clear that different intracellular trafficking steps are catalyzed by specific sets of SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>). Also in immune cells, such as granulocytes, platelets, mast cells, macrophages and T cells, specific combinations of SNARE proteins mediate release of cytokines, chemokines and delivery of surface receptors via specific secretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley and Lacy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacy and Stow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray and Stow, 2014</xref>). In order to identify the combinations of SNARE proteins responsible for a particular intracellular trafficking step, most studies rely on localization microscopy experiments either with endogenous or overexpressed SNAREs. However, these approaches suffer from the problems that many SNAREs locate to multiple organelles, as SNAREs are promiscuous and can be involved in different trafficking steps, and that mere co-localization of SNAREs does not prove their actual interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>). Interactions can be shown with co-immunoprecipitation experiments, but these cannot resolve in which organelle the interactions take place. Perturbation experiments, such as genetic ablation of SNAREs, overexpression of soluble ‘dominant negative’ SNARE fragments, or microinjection of antibodies directed against SNAREs, are also difficult to interpret because SNAREs are functionally redundant and defects in a specific trafficking route cannot be discerned from upstream trafficking steps. Because of this, knockdown or knockout of many SNARE proteins often does not show a clear phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bethani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nair-Gupta et al., 2014b</xref>). Thus, a method that allows quantitative visualization of SNARE complexes with subcellular resolution is highly desirable.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to fill this gap in methodology by developing an assay to locally detect SNARE interactions with Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jares-Erijman and Jovin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallrabe and Periasamy, 2005</xref>). FRET is based on the energy transfer from a donor to an acceptor fluorophore within the Förster distance range. FRET leads to quenching of the donor fluorophore and sensitization of the acceptor fluorophore and can either be measured from fluorescence intensities (ratiometric FRET) or from a decrease in fluorescence lifetime of the donor fluorophore (FRET-FLIM). Ratiometric FRET and FRET-FLIM have been previously used to characterize cytosolic interactions of fungal SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Valkonen et al., 2007</xref>) and of the neuronal Qa-SNARE syntaxin 1 (Stx1) and the Qb/c-SNARE SNAP25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rickman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Medine et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xia et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kavanagh et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesized that FRET-FLIM could also be used to measure full ternary <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complex formation, as the crystal structure of the neuronal SNARE complex revealed that the luminal/extracellular C-termini of the R-SNARE vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) and of Stx1 are in immediate proximity (&lt;1 nm) after membrane fusion (i.e., in the <italic>cis</italic>-SNARE complex) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stein et al., 2009</xref>). In vitro, FRET between these SNAREs can be measured by labeling their C-termini by means of site-specific labeling with organic fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xia et al., 2001</xref>). In vivo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degtyar et al. (2013)</xref> showed interactions between VAMP2 and Stx1 C-terminally fused to fluorescent proteins by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy combined with ratiometric FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degtyar et al., 2013</xref>). However, ratiometric FRET is technically challenging as extensive controls are required to correct for local concentration differences of the donor and acceptor fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jares-Erijman and Jovin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallrabe and Periasamy, 2005</xref>). FLIM does not suffer from this limitation, as the lifetime (τ) is an intrinsic characteristic of a fluorophore which is not influenced by the probe concentration nor by the excitation intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wallrabe and Periasamy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jares-Erijman and Jovin, 2003</xref>). Occurrence of FRET leads to quenching of the donor signal, which in turn shortens its fluorescence lifetime. Therefore, reductions in the donor’s lifetime reflect interactions between the proteins conjugated to the donor and acceptor fluorophores. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of our FRET-FLIM assay to visualize the complexes of several SNAREs in dendritic cells of the immune system.</p><p>Dendritic cells are leukocytes essential for the activation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banchereau and Steinman, 1998</xref>). Activation of dendritic cells by inflammatory or pathogenic stimuli triggers the production and release of cytokines and chemokines that orchestrate the immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley and Lacy, 2010</xref>). Despite many studies characterizing the cytokines that are released by dendritic cells and their mechanisms of action, not much is known about the trafficking pathways involved. Using FRET-FLIM, we measured how activation of dendritic cells affects the interactions between the R-SNAREs vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) and VAMP8 with the Qa-SNAREs syntaxin 3 (Stx3) and syntaxin 4 (Stx4). While both VAMP3 and VAMP8 are associated with cytokine release from immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley and Lacy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacy and Stow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray and Stow, 2014</xref>), VAMP3 is mostly associated with early and recycling endosomes and VAMP8 with late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonin et al., 2000</xref>). VAMP8 has also been reported to inhibit phagocytosis by dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ho et al., 2008</xref>). Stx3 and Stx4 are mainly plasma membrane localized SNAREs mediating exocytosis, but also have intracellular roles in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Naegelen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley and Lacy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacy and Stow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray and Stow, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gómez-Jaramillo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frank et al., 2011</xref>). Our FRET-FLIM experiments revealed FRET of fluorescently labeled Stx3 with VAMP3 in live dendritic cells and this was predominantly present at the plasma membrane, indicative of increased Stx3-VAMP3 complexing at this site. In contrast, FRET of fluorescently labeled Stx3 with VAMP8 was higher at intracellular compartments. Our results also showed an increase in FRET of fluorescently labeled Stx4, but not of Stx3, with VAMP3 upon cellular activation with the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS), indicating that LPS promotes the complex formation of Stx4 with VAMP3. LPS activation of dendritic cells induces an inflammatory response, which is characterized by the secretion of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stow et al., 2009</xref>). VAMP3 plays a key role in this cytokine secretion, as siRNA knockdown of VAMP3 resulted in impaired release of IL-6 from dendritic cells. Our study demonstrates that the secretion of IL-6 is regulated at the level of SNARE complex formation and proves the use of FRET-FLIM for quantitative visualization of SNARE interactions in live cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM</title><p>We generated variants of VAMP3 and Stx3 with their C-termini conjugated to mCitrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griesbeck et al., 2001</xref>) and mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>), respectively. The emission spectrum of mCitrine overlaps with the excitation spectrum of mCherry which makes them a suitable donor-acceptor pair for FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We recorded fluorescent lifetime images of live (unfixed) cells at an image plane locating at the height of the nucleus and accumulated on average ~750,000 photons per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The fluorescence life time histograms of single pixels were fitted with a mono-exponential decay function to generate FLIM images showing the apparent lifetime of each pixel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). Compared to cells expressing only Stx3-mCitrine, the FLIM images of cells co-transfected with Stx3-mCitrine and VAMP3-mCherry showed a reduction of the donor’s apparent lifetime. The lowest apparent lifetime was present at the plasma membrane (quantification below), indicating that the complexing of VAMP3 with Stx3 mainly took place at the cell membrane and less at intracellular compartments. FRET was also clear from Phasor analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinde et al., 2012</xref>), as co-expression of Stx3-mCitrine with VAMP3-mCherry resulted in a shift of the phasor location compared to the condition with the donor fluorophore only (Stx3-mCitrine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, FRET-FLIM allows visualization of SNARE complexes in living cells.</p><p>In order to obtain an estimate of the lowest lifetime observable, we recorded FLIM images of Stx3 conjugated to both mCitrine and mCherry in tandem (Stx3-mCitrine-mCherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). Although the colocalization of the mCitrine and mCherry signals was apparent, the overlap was not complete and the mCherry signal was more present in a cellular area juxtaposed to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G–H</xref>). To investigate this phenomenon further, we co-expressed VAMP3-mCitrine with VAMP3-mCherry or VAMP8-mCitrine with VAMP8-mCherry and compared the localization of these constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Also in this case, the mCherry signals were more prevalent than mCitrine in a juxtanuclear area. This juxtanuclear accumulation of mCherry was also observed upon dissipating the proton gradients by paraformaldehyde fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and J</xref>), indicating that the differential localization of mCherry and mCitrine was not caused by pH-quenching of mCitrine, but possibly due to differences in maturation speed or stability of the used fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Griesbeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shaner et al., 2004</xref>). Consequently, our FRET-FLIM approach likely underestimates the amount of FRET in juxtanuclear regions and more stable or rapidly maturating YFP analogs need to be developed for this. However, we observed clear overlap of mCherry and mCitrine in more peripheral cellular regions (Pearson correlation coefficients between 0.6–0.8 for the whole cell; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H and K</xref>), supporting the conclusion that our FRET-FLIM method can report on SNARE interactions in those regions.</p><p>We performed whole-cell fluorescence lifetime analysis to directly compare between cells and conditions. We fitted all pooled photons collected from each individual cell with single exponential decay functions convoluted with the instrument response function (IRF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). We obtained reasonable fitting accuracy (within ~2% deviation), although these deviations were larger at very short time intervals (&lt;2.5 ns; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These deviations at short time intervals are likely caused by imperfect fitting of the IRF due to drift of the laser pulsing or timing of the detectors, reflections and/or (auto)fluorescence with fast kinetics, but do not cause major deviations of the resulting apparent lifetimes as our experiments with the reference dye rhodamine B show (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In Stx3-mCitrine expressing cells, co-transfection with VAMP3-mCherry significantly reduced the apparent lifetime of mCitrine from 2.79 ± 0.02 ns to 2.49 ± 0.03 ns (mean ± SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cells from at least four different donors (&gt;8 cells/donor) were measured for each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The spread of apparent lifetimes for cells co-expressing Stx3-mCitrine with VAMP3-mCherry was quite large, ranging from 2 to 3 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This large spread was at least partly caused by the availability of VAMP3-mCherry and competition with endogenous SNAREs, because the fluorescence lifetimes inversely correlated with the expression levels of VAMP3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To account for the whole cell population with varying levels of acceptor fluorophore-labeled SNAREs, we randomly selected cells with visible expression of both donor and acceptor fluorophores for our FRET-FLIM experiments. In order to quantify the difference in apparent lifetimes between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments, we manually selected peripheral and intracellular regions of the image cell areas and fitted the fluorescence lifetime histograms of these two areas with mono-exponential decay functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>).

In order to estimate the fraction of FRET, we fitted the whole-cell lifetime histograms of cells co-expressing Stx3-mCitrine and VAMP3-mCherry with double exponential decay functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In our biexponential fitting, we had to fix the lifetime components, as we did not have sufficient photon counts for extra free fit parameters since small errors in the lifetimes will influence the amplitudes of the two components and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The time constants of the slow and fast components of the double exponential decay function were fixed to the values of the donor only (i.e., no FRET; 2.79 ns) and of the tandem Stx3-mCitrine-mCherry construct (100% FRET; 2.0 ns). This allowed estimating the percentage of FRET from the amplitudes of the fast and slow components, which provides a measure for the fraction of Stx3-mCitrine in complex with VAMP3-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Using this analysis, the percentage of complexed Stx3-mCitrine again correlated with the expression level of VAMP3-mCherry, and reached up to almost 100% at high expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data support our conclusion that complex formation of the donor fluorophore-labeled SNARE depends on the availability of acceptor fluorophore-labeled SNAREs. The observed fluorescence lifetimes of mCitrine not only depend on FRET, but will also be sensitive to other factors including the microenvironment, dipole orientation, and self-quenching of mCitrine within SNARE domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, the observed fluorescence lifetimes in our samples may not be the same as in our control samples (i.e., donor only and tandem Stx3-mCitrine-mCherry). Fitting with mono-exponential decay functions does not require any a-priori knowledge of the fluorescence lifetimes. Moreover, correlation of the apparent lifetimes from mono-exponential fits with the amplitudes from the bi-exponential fits resulted in a clear linear correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>; linear regression: R<sup>2</sup> = 0.812), demonstrating that these apparent lifetimes provide a reliable measure of the percentage FRET. We therefore analyzed the remainder of our FLIM data with mono-exponential decay functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Validation of the FLIM assay for SNARE complex formation</title><p>We performed two sets of control experiments to confirm that FRET-FLIM is a reliable method to measure interactions between SNARE proteins in live cells.

Although it is generally accepted that different intracellular trafficking routes are catalyzed by specific sets of SNARE proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stanley and Lacy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lacy and Stow, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray and Stow, 2014</xref>), current microscopy techniques often cannot resolve distinct SNARE pairs for specific trafficking routes. In this study, we demonstrate that FRET-FLIM enables the assignment of SNARE partners to specific trafficking routes, as it allows visualization of SNARE pairing at subcellular resolution. Our data show that FLIM-FRET is a quantitative method that in principle allows to determine the fraction of SNAREs engaged in complex formation by fitting the photon counts with bi-exponential decay functions with fixed lifetimes (i.e., for no FRET (donor only) and 100% FRET (all SNAREs interacting)). While the transient overexpression system used for our primary cells does not allow meaningful quantification of SNARE complexing, we expect that fusing chromosomal SNARE-encoding genes with fluorescent proteins using CRISPR/CAS9 in cell lines will enable to quantify endogenous SNARE interactions by FRET-FLIM.</p><p>We used FRET-FLIM to measure SNARE complex formation in human blood-derived dendritic cells. In unstimulated dendritic cells, the apparent lifetime of fluorescently labeled Stx3 with VAMP3 was lower at the periphery of the imaged cell areas, whereas the apparent lifetime with VAMP8 was lower at intracellular areas. This indicates that complex formation of Stx3 with VAMP3 mainly occurs at the plasma membrane, while interactions with VAMP8 predominantly occur at intracellular compartments. VAMP3 is primarily localized in early and recycling endosomes and VAMP8 locates predominately at late endosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antonin et al., 2000</xref>). Our data are therefore perfectly in line with the widely accepted notion that fusion of compartments of early/recycling endosomal nature with the plasma membrane is more abundant than of late endosomal compartments. Based on differences in apparent fluorescence lifetimes, we also conclude that the interactions of VAMP3 at the plasma membrane with Stx4 are lower than with Stx3 in unstimulated dendritic cells, even though the vast majority of Stx4 is present at the plasma membrane. This changes upon activation of the dendritic cells by the pathogenic stimulus LPS, which results in a decreased apparent lifetime of fluorescently labeled Stx4 with VAMP3 at the plasma membrane, whereas the apparent lifetimes of Stx3 remain unaltered. This result indicates that LPS triggers increased exocytosis by VAMP3 and Stx4.</p><p>VAMP3 is a recycling endosomal SNARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray et al., 2005</xref>) and many cytokines traffic via recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane, including IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manderson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, our data show that siRNA knockdown of VAMP3 impairs IL-6 secretion by monocyte-derived dendritic cells as previously observed for RAW264.7 murine macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Manderson et al., 2007</xref>) and SW982 human synovial sarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boddul et al., 2014</xref>). As supported by our FRET-FLIM data the increased complexing of VAMP3 with Stx4 is thus likely responsible for the increased secretion of IL-6 and other cytokines by activated dendritic cells. Interestingly, we observed that LPS increased FRET only of VAMP3 with Stx4 and not with Stx3. Stx3 and Stx4 have been well described in epithelial cells, where they catalyze apical and basolateral exocytosis respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Low et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">ter Beest et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Procino et al., 2008</xref>), but why non-polarized cells such as dendritic cells express both syntaxins is not well understood. Our study provides a possible clue why this could be the case, as our data indicate that activation of the dendritic cells leads to a rerouting of intracellular trafficking with more VAMP3-containing compartments fusing with the plasma membrane by interacting with Stx4. Perhaps Stx3 catalyzes the constitutive cycling of early/recycling endosomes in resting cells and Stx4 offers the spare capacity to fulfil the additional secretory requirements upon dendritic cell activation needed for the secretion of massive amounts of cytokines.</p><p>What could cause the increased Stx4 complex formation with VAMP3 upon dendritic cell activation? Our data show that such increased SNARE complexing is not caused by increased levels of Stx4 or VAMP3. Possibly, the increased complexing might be regulated by direct phosphorylation of Stx4, VAMP3 and/or the Qb/c-SNARE SNAP23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Malmersjö et al., 2016</xref>). SNAP23 was recently shown to be phosphorylated in an IκB-kinase two dependent fashion upon stimulation of mouse dendritic cells with LPS and this mediates the delivery of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I from recycling endosomes to phagosomes, presumably via Stx4 and VAMP3 or VAMP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nair-Gupta et al., 2014a</xref>). Alternatively, or additionally, the increased complex formation could be regulated by the Sec1/Munc18-protein Munc18c (STXBP3). Munc18c and Stx4 are well known to regulate GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tellam et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong, 2005</xref>), and are also implied in insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), secretion of dense-core granules, α-granules and lysosomes from human platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schraw et al., 2003</xref>) and TNFα secretion from macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pagan et al., 2003</xref>). In any case, the mechanism must be specific for Stx4 and VAMP3, as our data show that FRET of Stx3 with VAMP3 and of Stx4 with VAMP8 are not altered by LPS-activation of dendritic cells. Overall, our study demonstrates the use of FRET-FLIM for the identification of the SNARE partners orchestrating specific organellar membrane trafficking steps. We expect this technique will allow deciphering the precise intracellular trafficking pathways of molecules important in health and disease, such as cytokines, receptors, hormones, metabolic enzymes and metabolites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>Dendritic cells were derived from monocytes by culturing in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF for 6 days as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dingjan et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.

Dynamic complexes formed between VAMP3 and Stx4 or Stx3 at the cell surface and VAMP8 complexes at intracellular sites are revealed. Finally the study concludes that LPS activation causes a switch to preferential formation of Stx4-VAMP3 complexes at the cell surface, which in turn support secretion of the IL-6 cytokine. This conclusion is novel in dendritic cells, in keeping with the functions of SNAREs in other immune cell types, but here it is reached on the basis of a single approach – albeit very elegant FLIM-FRET. The method that allows quantitative visualization of SNARE complexes with subcellular resolution is an important step forward. Overall the manuscript is interesting and the text well written. The figures are well presented and establish the approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) before addressing IL-6 exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). There are several concerns that preclude publication in its current stage:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Authors state that there is decreased lifetime at the plasma membrane but do not attempt to quantify the difference. To make this statement (subsection 2SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”, second paragraph) they would need to quantify the lifetime at both the plasma membrane and the appropriate internal compartments across multiple examples.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors note that Stx3-mCitrine localised to the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. VAMP3-mCherry also located to the plasma membrane and predominantly in intracellular compartments. However, Stx3-mCitrine-mCherry appeared on the plasma membrane (mCitrine channel) and intracellular compartments (mCherry channel). Two concerns were raised. First, is the apparent localization of the VAMP down to the mCherry fusion? For example, all images in the mCherry channel in the manuscript show this accumulation. Second, numerous papers have used C-terminal fusions to VAMP proteins (e.g. pHlourins) and noted significant accumulation on the plasma membrane not observed for endogenous unfused VAMP. How does this mis-targetting impact the conclusions of the manuscript for example preferential pairing in the plasma membrane?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – The authors point out that the tandem dimer of mCitrine and mCherry does not 100% co-localize. They suggest that there might be differences in maturation. Another explanation is that the experimental design is not appropriate to measure FLIM at internal compartments such as lysosomes. As Vamp8-Syntaxin interaction is most likely at the late endosome/lysosome there will be a significant amount of quenching/degradation of mCitrine as compared to the relatively stable mCherry fluorophore that survives in the lysosomal compartment.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> FLIM is used by fitting a single decay to the entire image. The authors should show actual photon count numbers rather than normalized to 100%. This provides a clearer interpretation of this data for the reader. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> FRET lifetime is non-uniform in the cell. The authors should therefore use either a pixel by pixel fitting for all data with a bi-exponential decay or at least a bi-exponential fit to the whole cell data. The example data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows that the fit is deviating at short lifetimes in the residuals.</p><p>Also, the authors note the large spread of lifetimes observed. Excluding the fitting issue above this is most likely due to the proportion of pixels reporting lifetime at the periphery versus the intracellular space. How was the imaging plane in the cell standardized? The authors suggest expression level as a potential issue, however, the number of plotted points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D/2F</xref> does not match the number of points in 2C. If concentration is the answer this would be better proved by using all data in 2C and examining correlation or using bi-exponential fits and examining amplitudes and lifetimes (preferably without fixing the short lifetime as it may not be the same as the positive control state).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> state that cells were used from 'at least 4 donors' or '3 donors' (were these donor numbers used as 'n' values for statistical purposes?). However, the cells appear to have been pooled to conduct the experiments instead of cells from each donor being measured separately. This would simply be a single mixed population rather than providing statistical replicates. If the authors have the separate data from each donor they need to include this and reassess their results.</p><p>In the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the authors state &quot;The interaction between Stx3-mCitrine and VAMP3-mCherry was stronger than for all other tested SNARE pairs&quot;. By stronger I presume they mean a shorter mean lifetime. However, this is misleading. The FRET energy transfer reported by the mono-exponential whole cell fit is a conflation of proportion of interacting molecules, proximity and dipole orientation averaged over the whole cell. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that the lifetime has changed. This issue also impacts on the subsection “Comparison of different SNAREs involved in exocytosis”, the Discussion and Abstract wherever the lifetime value is interpreted as a specific change in strength/number of interactions.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: Given that FLIM is best suited to live cell imaging, Could the authors not show changes in FLIM in the same cell post LPS?

Secondly, the cytokine levels are currently expressed as percent of maximum. This is unconventional and does not convey direct information about the amount of cytokine secretion over the time course. Since the ELISA assay gives direct cytokine amounts, this is how the data should be conveyed (e.g. ng/ml) and ideally for each of the 3 donor cell lines +/- VAMP3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23525.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript by Verboogen et al. utilizes FRET-FLIM to study SNARE complex formation in dendritic cells and the role of VAMP3 and syntaxin 4 in LPS induced IL-6 release.

We manually selected intracellular and peripheral regions in the FLIM images (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>). The photons from these regions were pooled for each individual cell and the fluorescence lifetime histograms were fitted with mono-exponential decay functions (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). We then compared the fluorescence lifetimes at intracellular regions and the cellular periphery for multiple cells from 5 donors (new main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The fluorescence lifetime was on average 55 ps lower at the cellular periphery compared to the intracellular region (P = 0.007; paired 2-sided t-test). However, the reduction was larger in cells with low fluorescence lifetimes (indicative of more SNARE complexing; linear regression, β = 1.174, R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> = 0.821). We now discuss this new analysis in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> the authors note that Stx3-mCitrine localised to the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments.

How does this mis-targetting impact the conclusions of the manuscript for example preferential pairing in the plasma membrane?</italic> </p><p>We first determined to what extent fusing mCherry influences the intracellular localization of the SNARE proteins compared to mCitrine. We co-expressed VAMP3 and VAMP8 constructs fused to mCitrine with the same SNARE fused to mCherry (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). We observed more accumulation of mCherry compared to mCitrine in an intracellular region juxtaposed to the nucleus, especially for VAMP8. As suggested by the reviewers (next point below), this accumulation of mCherry might be due to a higher resistance of mCherry to lysosomal degradation. It was not due to pH-quenching of mCitrine, as juxtanuclear accumulation of mCherry was also observed upon fixation of the cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,1J</xref>). As a consequence, we underestimate the amount of FRET in these juxtanuclear (lysosomal) regions and more stable YFP analogs need to be developed for this. However, we observed clear overlap of mCherry and mCitrine in more peripherally located cellular regions (Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.6–0.8 for the whole cell; new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H,K</xref>) and believe it is justified to conclude that our FRET-FLIM method can report on SNARE interactions at these regions. These new data are now discussed in the third paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concern regarding the localization of the VAMP fusion constructs, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy of endogenous VAMP3 and VAMP8 in dendritic cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Both VAMP3 and VAMP8 were present mainly in intracellular compartments and less at the plasma membrane and this did not notably differ from the localization we observed for the VAMP fusion constructs. Please note that plasma membrane localization of endogenous VAMP3 and VAMP8 has been reported previously (e.g., Antonin, et al. (2000) Mol. Biol. Cell 11, 3289). We now discuss these new data in the second paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM” and in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – The authors point out that the tandem dimer of mCitrine and mCherry does not 100% co-localize.

This limits the use of our FRET-FLIM method for measuring SNARE interactions in such compartments, and more stable YFP variants need to be developed for this. However, as the main conclusion from our manuscript concerns exocytosis at the plasma membrane, we believe the main conclusions of our study are not affected. We now discuss this caveat in the third paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> FLIM is used by fitting a single decay to the entire image.

However, we still normalize the <italic>y</italic>-scaling, because we want to compare conditions (with different photon counts) and present the IRF within the same graphs. As also suggested by the reviewers, we now fit all whole-cell lifetime histograms with biexponential decay functions (new main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–G</xref>). The deviations at short lifetimes (&lt;2.5 ns) are mainly caused by imperfect fitting of the IRF. Technical issues such as drift of the laser pulsing or the timing of the detectors, reflections and/or (auto)fluorescence with fast kinetics may result in deviations at short lifetimes. However, please note that the deviations in our automated fitting are generally below 2%, which we believe is quite reasonable, and our experiments with the reference dye rhodamine B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) indicate that this does not result in major changes of the fluorescence lifetimes. We have included the above discussion on the fit deviations in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”.</p><p>As discussed above in our first response, we quantified the apparent fluorescence lifetimes at intracellular and peripheral regions of the imaged cells. Because primary blood-derived dendritic cells are very heterogeneous in size and morphology, it is difficult to standardize the image plane and we imaged at the height of the nucleus, which is between 2–5 µm above the surface of the cover slips. We now discuss this in the Results and Methods sections of our manuscript (subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”, second paragraph and subsection “FLIM”). As correctly noted by the reviewers, main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,F</xref> (now main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,H</xref>) present data from a single representative donor. Our FLIM measurements were collected during a period of over 3 years, and because of differences in laser power, alignment of the excitation and emission optical paths, objective correction collar adjustment, etc., we cannot directly compare fluorescence intensities of data collected during this period. However, we observed the same trend for all donors, and now show three more representative donors in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref> and Figure 2—figure supplement 3B. Finally, as suggested by the reviewer, we examined the correlation of the amplitudes from biexponential fits with the apparent lifetime from mono-exponential fits and observed a clear linear correlation (new Figure 2—figure supplement 3C; β = -0.007, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.867). In our biexponential fitting, we had to fix the lifetime components, as we did not have sufficient photon counts for an extra free fit parameter. Please note that fitting with biexponential decay functions with three free fit parameters (2 amplitudes and 1 lifetime) is extremely challenging, because small errors in the lifetime will influence the amplitudes and vice versa. Moreover, as the reviewers also note, lifetimes may not be the same as in the positive (and negative) control state(s), and could deviate because of multiple reasons (self-quenching, dipole orientation, variations in the microenvironment). We believe fitting with mono-exponential decay functions is warranted, because this does not require any a-priori knowledge of the lifetimes. To avoid any over-interpretation of our results, we present the lifetimes from these mono-exponential fits as <italic>apparent</italic> fluorescence lifetimes which are indicative of SNARE complex formation. We now provide this rationale for fitting the data with mono-exponential decay in the second paragraph of the subsection “SNAREs interactions in live cells visualized by FLIM”.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> state that cells were used from 'at least 4 donors' or '3 donors' (were these donor numbers used as 'n' values for statistical purposes?). However, the cells appear to have been pooled to conduct the experiments instead of cells from each donor being measured separately. This would simply be a single mixed population rather than providing statistical replicates. If the authors have the separate data from each donor they need to include this and reassess their results.</italic> </p><p>We provide the averaged data for the individual donors in the revised version of our manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 6D). All effects that are important to support the conclusions of our manuscript are statistically significant both when analyzing single cells and donor averages. We choose to present the individual cell data in the main figures (with the donor-averaged data in the supplementary material), as FRET-FLIM is a single cell method and we want to show cellular heterogeneities.</p><p><italic>In the text associated with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> the authors state &quot;The interaction between Stx3-mCitrine and VAMP3-mCherry was stronger than for all other tested SNARE pairs&quot;.

This issue also impacts on the subsection “Comparison of different SNAREs involved in exocytosis”, the Discussion and Abstract wherever the lifetime value is interpreted as a specific change in strength/number of interactions.</italic> </p><p>We revised the Abstract and the rest of the manuscript and now more carefully interpret our results.

We consider endogenous SNARE levels important, because endogenous SNAREs can compete with the overexpressed SNAREs and altered SNARE levels might thereby affect FLIM.</p><p><italic>6) The IL-6 secretion data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> is not very convincing in its current format. The experimental details need to be clarified (is this a 16 hour treatment with LPS followed by collection times of 4-24 hours (with or without LPS?) Secondly, the cytokine levels are currently expressed as percent of maximum. This is unconventional and does not convey direct information about the amount of cytokine secretion over the time course. Since the ELISA assay gives direct cytokine amounts, this is how the data should be conveyed (e.g. ng/ml) and ideally for each of the 3 donor cell lines +/- VAMP3.</italic> </p><p>We incubated the cells for 4–24h with LPS and collected IL-6 during this incubation period. We apologize for the unclarity and amended the Methods section (subsection “LPS stimulation promotes VAMP3 interaction with Stx4 at the plasma membrane”). As requested by the reviewers, we now show the absolute cytokine amounts and for each individual donor. Because of the large heterogeneity among donors, we show the 24 h time point in the main figure (main <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and the full time-traces for each individual donor in the supplementary material (Figure 5—figure supplement 6E).</p></body></sub-article></article>
