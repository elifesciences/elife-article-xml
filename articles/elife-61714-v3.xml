Daughter cells of such divisions can differ not only in their asymmetric inheritance of fate determinants but also in their relative size. Such physically unequal asymmetric divisions are widespread during development. For instance, in <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> <italic>elegans</italic> larvae, QR.a neuroblasts divide unequally owing to the asymmetric distribution of the non-muscle myosin II NMY-2, resulting in a larger daughter with a neuronal fate and a smaller daughter that undergoes apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ou et al., 2010</xref>). Equalizing QR.a division through NMY-2 manipulation results in two cells adopting the neuronal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ou et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, <italic>Drosophila</italic> stem-like larval neuroblasts divide unequally to regenerate a larger neuroblast and a smaller ganglion mother cell that differentiates towards a neuronal fate. Experimentally induced size equalization of the neuroblast division prevents such differentiation despite proper asymmetric inheritance of the neuronal fate determinant Prospero (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabernard and Doe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kitajima et al., 2010</xref>). These examples illustrate how size differences can have a drastic consequence on the fate of resulting daughter cells. Physically unequal divisions are particularly prevalent during early embryogenesis in many systems, but the specific importance of size differences at this early stage for successful completion of development has been scarcely addressed.</p><p>Early embryogenesis in the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic> entails several asymmetric divisions, including ones that yield daughter cells of different sizes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>). The first of these is the unequal cleavage of the one-cell stage embryo (hereafter zygote) into the larger anterior cell AB and the smaller posterior cell P<sub>1</sub>, corresponding respectively to ~60% and 40% of total embryo size. The variability in this size difference is minimal in the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>), suggestive of functional importance. Further support for such importance comes from the fact that unequal first cleavage occurs throughout the entire <italic>Rhabditida</italic> order, which is estimated to encompass an evolutionary distance as large as that between echinoderms and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kiontke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiontke et al., 2011</xref>), although the extent of size asymmetry varies between nematode species within this order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauchle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valfort et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The unequal cleavage of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote results from a rapid sequence of events that begins after fertilization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>). First, symmetry of the zygote is broken by the centrosomes derived from the sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldstein and Hird, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sadler and Shakes, 2000</xref>). Thereafter, the contractile cortical acto-myosin network moves towards the future embryo anterior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Munro et al., 2004</xref>), accompanied by the establishment of mutually exclusive cortical domains of PAR polarity domains, with aPKC-3/PAR-3/PAR-6 at the anterior and PAR-1/PAR-2/LGL-1 at the posterior (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kemphues and Strome, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>). The PAR polarity network then ensures the asymmetric distribution of proteins and mRNAs through the action of polarity mediators, including the RNA-binding proteins MEX-5/6, which are present in an anterior–posterior (A-P) gradient prior to first cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schubert et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>A-P polarity cues also direct asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle, which is located slightly off-center towards the posterior side by the end of anaphase, thus dictating unequal first cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grill et al., 2001</xref>). Asymmetric spindle positioning relies on an evolutionarily conserved ternary complex that anchors the molecular motor dynein at the cell cortex (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kotak and Gönczy, 2013</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this ternary complex comprises the membrane-associated Gα proteins GOA-1 and GPA-16, the TPR and GoLoCo domain-containing proteins GPR-1/2, as well as the coiled-coil protein LIN-5, which interacts with a dynein motor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gotta and Ahringer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). Dynein thus anchored at the cell cortex is thought to exert a pulling force on the plus-end of depolymerizing astral microtubules and, thereby, on the connected spindle poles. In response to A-P polarity cues, more GPR-1/2 and possibly LIN-5 are present on the posterior cortex, resulting in a larger net force pulling on the posterior spindle pole, leading to the unequal cleavage of the zygote into the larger AB cell and the smaller P<sub>1</sub> cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grill et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Park and Rose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tsou et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>During subsequent stages of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis, most cells derived from AB divide symmetrically and with nearly synchronous timing, whereas P<sub>1</sub> descendants undergo three additional asymmetric divisions, generating sister lineages with asynchronous division timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). Overall, this leads to the generation of seven founder cells that will each yield specific tissues; for instance, E will give rise to the intestine and P<sub>4</sub> to the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). The fate of each founder cell is specified by asymmetrically distributed maternally provided components, together with regulated protein translation and degradation mechanisms operating in the embryo (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zacharias and Murray, 2016</xref>). Global activation of zygotic transcription occurs at the ~26-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Powell-Coffman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schauer and Wood, 1990</xref>), which is also when the onset of gastrulation is apparent by ingression of the E descendants Ea/Ep from the embryo periphery (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein and Nance, 2020</xref>). Whereas Ea/Ep descendants adopt an intestinal fate in a cell-autonomous manner, for other cells proper fate acquisition and behavior, including division orientation, relies on interactions among neighbors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goldstein and Nance, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mango, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rose and Gönczy, 2014</xref>). Overall, as a result of stereotyped division timing, cell positioning, division orientation, and fate allocation, the hermaphrodite <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo invariably hatches with 558 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Despite the wealth of knowledge brought by decades of investigating developmental mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the specific importance of the size difference component of asymmetric division in the early embryo is not clear, including for the unequal division of the zygote. Investigating this question requires to specifically alter the size of the daughter cells resulting from first cleavage without altering A-P polarity or compromising subsequent cell divisions. This has been challenging: although <italic>par</italic> mutant embryos undergo equal first cleavage, A-P polarity is abolished entirely in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kemphues et al., 1988</xref>). Moreover, whereas depletion of <italic>goa-1</italic>/<italic>gpa-16</italic>, <italic>gpr-1/2,</italic> or <italic>lin-5</italic> by RNAi results in equal first division without A-P polarity impairment, such embryos exhibit severe cell division defects in subsequent cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Colombo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fisk Green et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gotta et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gotta and Ahringer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Srinivasan et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we specifically equalized AB and P<sub>1</sub> without altering A-P polarity or disrupting later cell divisions using acute genetic inactivation or optogenetic manipulation of LIN-5, allowing us to address specifically the importance of the physical asymmetry of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote division.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Altering cell size asymmetry through manipulation of <italic>lin-5</italic> function</title><p>To address whether the size difference between AB and P<sub>1</sub> that derives from the unequal division of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote is important for subsequent development, we took advantage of the temperature-sensitive <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> mutant allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorson et al., 2000</xref>). We discovered that shifting <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> zygotes from 17°C to 27°C for ~5 min during mitosis results in the spindle remaining in the cell center, yielding AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells of more similar sizes than normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>). Such embryos are referred to as ‘upshifted <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic>’ hereafter. There was a slight variability in the size of AB relative to that of the entire zygote in these embryos (51.2%±2.8 standard deviation [SD], N = 257). Moreover, we found that inactivation of function was readily reversible since returning upshifted <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos to 17°C after the ~5 min upshift rapidly restored LIN-5 function, allowing subsequent cell divisions to proceed (see below). Furthermore, to control for potential effects of the <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> mutation unrelated to AB and P<sub>1</sub> equalization, early 2-cell stage <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos were shifted from 17°C to 27°C for ~5 min; such embryos are referred to as ‘controls’ throughout the article.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two methods for equalizing first cell division in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ternary complex comprising Gα, GPR-1/2, and LIN-5 dimers tethers a dynein complex (only the motor protein is represented here) to the cell cortex, thereby generating pulling forces on astral microtubules (top).

In all eight embryos with such a skew that later died, this alteration led to striking cell mispositioning at the 8-cell stage, with E and MS assuming abnormal oblique positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, top), a defect that propagated subsequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, bottom). By contrast, in the four equalized embryos that lived despite an initially aberrant EMS division angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), the skew was corrected in late anaphase, resulting in essentially normally positioned E and MS. These observations indicate that, unless corrected, a skew in the EMS division axis results in embryonic lethality.</p><p>To uncover further differences between equalized alive and equalized dead <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos, excluding embryos with a T-arrangement at the 4-cell stage and those with an EMS skew at the 6-cell stage, we compared all spatial features between the two sets of embryos from the 4- to the 15-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). This analysis uncovered 10 features that differed significantly between the two groups and that were highly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among these features, we found notably that the division orientation of MS deviated approximately three times more with respect to the A-P axis in equalized dead <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos than in equalized alive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This led to increased mispositioning of the MS daughter cells MSa and MSp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), which were frequently inverted along the L-R axis, a phenotype significantly associated with death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K</xref>). However, such L-R inversion was also observed in some equalized alive <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), indicating that it can be compatible with successful embryogenesis, presumably owing to subsequent compensatory movements. Taken together, these observations lead us to conclude that severe mispositioning of E and MS, as well as of MSa and MSp, can occur in equalized dead <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos and contribute to lethality.</p><p>Like for the temporal data, we explored the overall variability of cell positioning and division orientation in the lineaging data set, comparing the SDs of all individual cells.

Furthermore, equalized dead <italic>lin-5</italic>(ev571) embryos tended to be significantly more compressed than equalized alive ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, 19.8 ± 2.1 µm versus 21.9 ± 2.2 µm, p&lt;0.002), whereas a comparable degree of compression had no detrimental effect on control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These observations led us to investigate directly whether equalized embryos die less frequently in the absence of compression. Therefore, we imaged uncompressed embryos using 45 µm diameter beads or removing the coverslip after first division equalization, finding decreased lethality of equalized embryos compared to imaging under mild compressed condition with 20–25 µm beads or in the continued presence of the coverslip (33% versus 55%, n = 45 and 174, p=0.03, Fisher’s exact test).

In other cases, however, asymmetric division also entails different sizes of daughter cells. Here, we uncover that <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos stemming from experimentally induced equalized first division exhibit a range of incompletely penetrant phenotypic deviations from the norm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), demonstrating that physically asymmetric division of the zygote is critical to ensure invariably successful embryogenesis.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>On the importance of physically unequal asymmetric cell division</title><p>A striking example of physically unequal asymmetric division is that of the female meiotic divisions, where minute polar bodies are generated in addition to the much larger oocyte. There is little doubt that the unequal size of daughter cells is of paramount importance in this case to ensure proper allocation of maternal components to the oocyte and future embryo. Physically unequal divisions, albeit less striking in terms of size inequality, are also frequent during early embryogenesis of metazoan organisms. One possibility is that this ensures swift and proper allocation of components to daughter cells destined to yield different numbers and types of descendants in early embryos that rely on maternally contributed components and undergo rapid cell cycles. This may be particularly important in holoblastic embryos, which cleave within the constraints of an eggshell or an analogous structure, precluding compensation for potential variability in blastomere volumes through differential cell growth.</p><p>A paradigmatic example of a physically unequal division in early embryos is that of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote, which normally yields a larger AB daughter and a smaller P<sub>1</sub> daughter. Previously, the specific role of size inequality had not been addressed independently from fate asymmetry. Here, we addressed this question by altering the function of the spindle positioning protein LIN-5 to equalize first cleavage without affecting A-P polarity. We discovered that first division equalization is tolerated to some extent, as evidenced by approximately half of equalized embryos completing development. Moreover, we discovered that embryos with a relative AB size smaller than 48% always die, revealing a size asymmetry threshold for viability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Alterations in cell cycle timing can be tolerated during <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis</title><p>Prior work established that the size difference between AB and P<sub>1</sub> contributes to their division asynchrony in the wild type because the DNA replication checkpoint is engaged preferentially in P<sub>1 </sub>compared to AB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brauchle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stevens et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to this mechanism, the positive regulators of mitotic entry polo-like-kinase I (PLK-1), cyclin B3, and CDC-25 phosphatase are enriched in AB compared to P<sub>1</sub>, thereby also contributing to division asynchrony, in a size-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budirahardja and Gönczy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michael, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rivers et al., 2008</xref>). As anticipated from these studies, we found here that division asynchrony decreases following first division equalization, in a manner that depends on AB size. However, this asynchrony alone does not cause subsequent death since equalized embryos with experimentally restored asynchrony die at a similar rate. This is in line with the viability of embryos depleted of DNA replication checkpoint components, which also exhibit decreased asynchrony between AB and P<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brauchle et al., 2003</xref>). Likewise, the majority of embryos in which asynchrony between the two cells is abrogated entirely through local infrared treatment of P<sub>1</sub> also live (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, we uncovered here that cell cycle progression is not set merely by size in all <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic blastomeres since diminishing the size of AB and its descendants does not slow their cell cycle, perhaps because the abovementioned positive mitotic regulators are present in excess in AB.</p><p>We found also that not only P<sub>1</sub>, but also many of its descendants, progress faster through the cell cycle upon first division equalization. It will be interesting to address whether these later differences reflect a sustained excess of positive regulators such as PLK-1, cyclin B3, and CDC-25 inherited following first division equalization. Regardless of the underlying cause, faster cell cycle progression in the P<sub>1</sub> lineage might have repercussions also for fate acquisition, which can be reliant on precisely timed expression of transcription factors during <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murray et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nair et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarov et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell positioning, division orientation, and cell fate defects upon first division equalization</title><p>Although not detrimental to viability per se, faster cell cycle progression in the P<sub>1</sub> lineage, but not in the AB lineage, results over time in an altered sequence of cell division in equalized embryos, which can lead to missing or aberrant interactions between cells. A particularly striking example occurs in a minor fraction of equalized embryos that exhibit an aberrant T-arrangement at the 4-cell stage, leading to a lack of inductive Delta/Notch signaling. Suggestively, we found that equalized embryos with such a T-arrangement tend to be elongated (see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Compatible with embryo length playing a role, T-arrangements also occur in <italic>lon-1</italic> mutant embryos, which are very elongated but where AB and P<sub>1</sub> have normal relative sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamamoto and Kimura, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, a similar T-arrangement occurs naturally in other Nematode clades, reflecting plasticity in early division patterns that likely requires adaptations of fate determination networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauchle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schulze and Schierenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Schulze and Schierenberg, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Missing or aberrant interactions between cells can also derive from defective division orientation, leading to daughter cell mispositioning, as exemplified with the skewed EMS and MS division orientation. Interestingly, an EMS skew is observed also upon impaired Wnt signaling from P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bei et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schlesinger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Thorpe et al., 1997</xref>). More generally, a posterior signaling center that relies on a Wnt-dependent relay mechanism originating from P<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>3</sub> polarizes multiple cells during <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bischoff and Schnabel, 2006</xref>), and our findings are compatible with the possibility that this signaling center is compromised upon first cleavage equalization. Furthermore, the EMS skew might affect cell–cell contacts and therefore alter the instructive Delta/Notch signaling that normally occurs between MS and two adjacent ABa-derived cells, which are thereby triggered to differentiate towards pharyngeal fates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mango, 2009</xref>). We indeed observed inappropriate induction of pharyngeal fate in several ABa cells, raising the possibility that aberrant contacts occurred between MS/MSa/MSp, which express a Delta ligand, and ABala or ABarp, which express a Notch receptor, but that are normally shielded from ligand binding owing to their distant location. Moreover, we noted that the intestinal progenitors Ea/Ep expressed less END-3::GFP in equalized embryos, perhaps reflecting insufficient induction by maternal factors, followed by stochastic expression of the downstream component ELT-2. Compatible with this view, maternally provided SKN-1, as well as its targets END-1 and END-3, must reach a critical threshold for complete activation of ELT-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maduro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raj et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Regarding MS position, a physical computational model predicted that abolishing both size asymmetry and asynchrony between AB and P<sub>1</sub> lineages would impact the positions of MS and E daughters at the 24- cell stage in ~25% of embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fickentscher et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, we observed instances of MSa/MSp mispositioning and incomplete ingression of E daughters in equalized <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos. Thus, these defects in equalized embryos could be at least in part explained by abnormal forces experienced by cells with altered volumes and division timing.</p><p>Detailed lineage analysis enabled us to uncover that in many equalized embryos the germline progenitor P<sub>4</sub> undergoes continued divisions in a manner that resembles the behavior of its cousin D. Such a defect in germline fate specification could help explain the reduced fertility observed in some adults that derive from embryos that survived equalization. Lineage transformation of P<sub>4</sub> into D also occurs in embryos derived from <italic>mes-1</italic> mutant animals, in which P<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>3</sub> lack proper polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkowitz and Strome, 2000</xref>). By extension, such polarity defects may also be present following first division equalization. In the wild type, P<sub>4</sub> divides symmetrically and its daughters remain quiescent until hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>). A size-dependent switch from asymmetric to symmetric division occurs in P<sub>4</sub> as it reaches a size too small to allow formation of the reciprocal PAR protein gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hubatsch et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings lead us to speculate that P<sub>4</sub> cell size reduction might be required not only for this switch of division mode but also to maintain germline progenitors quiescent until hatching.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Physically asymmetric division of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote ensures invariably successful embryonic development</title><p>Wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryogenesis is highly stereotyped, exhibiting little variability between embryos in terms of division timing, cell positioning, division orientation, and fate acquisition, ultimately yielding 558 cells at hatching in the hermaphrodite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Richards et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>).

Closer analysis of cell positions in the lineaging data set lends further support to the importance of these three features. Indeed, several AB descendants on the right side of embryo, including ABar and its progeny, were significantly shifted dorsally as early as the 8-cell stage solely in dying embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Although the mechanisms responsible for such dorsally shifted position or for increased Ca movement in equalized dead <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos remain to be fully understood, we conclude that these three features provide a shared early signature among most equalized embryos that then diverges into more variable phenotypic manifestations.</p><p>We also wondered whether having differently sized AB and P<sub>1</sub> blastomeres contributes to robust embryogenesis. Developmental systems are deemed to be robust if they remain unchanged or else change in a reproducible manner in the face of a given perturbation. The loss of robustness is manifested by increased variability upon perturbation without a change in the mean (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Félix and Barkoulas, 2015</xref>). Applying these criteria to features monitored in our data set, we found only 23 of the 1608 analyzed in which the mean remained the same but the variability increased when comparing equalized <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) and control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that these features in particular are less robust to perturbation by first division equalization. Moreover, our findings suggest that having differently sized AB and P<sub>1</sub> blastomeres provides resilience against mechanical stress, as evidenced by the increased lethality of equalized <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>) embryos upon compression. Normally, compressed <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos can correct specific defects in cell positioning through the concerted migration of several AB descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelier et al., 2016</xref>). Presumably compressed equalized embryos cannot undertake such corrective movements for steric reasons or because their fate is compromised.</p><p>How general is the importance of having differently sized blastomeres in early embryogenesis? Physically asymmetric cleavage of the zygote is present across the Rhabditida order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauchle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Valfort et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting functional importance over substantial evolutionary times. Moreover, unequal cleavages are present in early development of other systems, including annelid, ascidian, and echinoderm embryos (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moorhouse and Burgess, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Negishi and Nishida, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shimizu et al., 1998</xref>). Conversely, generating cells of equal sizes seems of importance during early human development since unevenly sized blastomeres frequently correlate with aneuploidy and lower rates of implantation and pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardarson, 2001</xref>). Overall, generating appropriately proportioned daughter cells is widespread in metazoan organisms, and our work demonstrates the importance of physical asymmetry of the first division in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which is fundamental for ensuring invariably successful development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and embryo preparation</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref> and were maintained on standard NGM plates with OP50 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> as a food source.

Interaction of LIN-5::LOV with PH::EPDZ was induced by activating the 488 nm laser at 3–5% intensity only during acquisition in a small rectangular region (~10 × 5 µm) at the anterior cortex, from NEBD until cytokinesis completion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell cycle retardation with 405 nm laser</title><p>A pulsed 405 nm diode laser (at 70% output, 700 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> at 100%) was continuously scanned over the entire P<sub>1</sub> nucleus early in the 2-cell stage for 4.5 min at 8 kHz using a 70 ns dwell time on the SP8 confocal setup described above. This induces photodamage, likely in the form of thymidine dimers in the DNA, which might cause replication fork stalling and activation of the DNA replication checkpoint. Using otherwise wild-type embryos expressing mCherry::H2B, we determined experimentally an optimal non-lethal duration (4.5 min) of continuous laser scanning that induces and enhances the delay between AB and P<sub>1</sub> mitoses from the normal ~3.5 ± 0.34 min to ~6 ± 1.6 min at 17°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image processing and analysis</title><p>All images were rotated, Z-projected, and adjusted in Fiji (ImageJ) for display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). The 2D surface of the AB and P<sub>1</sub> cells was determined manually from DIC images or from the GFP::PH plasma membrane signal in strains expressing this marker. This was achieved by tracing cell outlines with a Fiji polygon tool at the mid-plane, with both nuclei in focus, when the interface between AB and P<sub>1</sub> was perfectly straight, ~5 min after cytokinesis. The size of AB was then expressed relative to the embryo cross-sectional area, corresponding to the sum of the P<sub>1</sub> and AB surfaces. To assess how well the 2D mid-plane cell area measurements matched the corresponding 3D cell volumes, we analyzed embryos expressing GFP::PH, segmenting the full 3D volumes of AB and P<sub>1</sub> using a watershed-based segmentation (MorphoLibJ plugin in Fiji).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of marker gene expression</title><p>Embryos expressing endogenously tagged PAR-2::GFP and mCherry::MEX-5 were imaged on a wide-field Zeiss Axio-Observer microscope as described above. Images were taken every 30 s until the 4-cell stage, capturing 11 planes with 1.5 µm spacing. For signal quantification, we determined the mean intensity in the mid-plane at the 2-cell stage, including the area covering the nucleus and the entire cortex. MEX-5 intensity was normalized to the mean AB intensity in control embryos from the corresponding day because MEX-5 intensity differed significantly between experiments.</p><p>Transgenic embryos expressing END-3::GFP or ELT-2::GFP in a <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> background were imaged using combined DIC and fluorescence time-lapse microscopy as described above, with 2 min intervals and 1 µm optical slicing, capturing a 25 µm stack. Gastrulation movements of Ea/Ep cells were tracked in 3D with the TrackMate Fiji plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tinevez et al., 2017</xref>), utilizing the nuclear END-3::GFP signal, which is expressed from the beginning of the Ea/Ep cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maduro et al., 2005</xref>). We then quantified the peak GFP intensity, that is, the mean voxel intensity in the nuclear volume obtained from the sphere detection macro in TrackMate. The ELT-2::GFP expression pattern was scored visually for the number of GFP-positive cells at the E8 stage. Analysis of pharyngeal differentiation was based on the PHA-4::GFP expression pattern in embryos co-expressing the pan-nuclear mCherry::H2B marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarov et al., 2012</xref>). Embryos were imaged with the SP8 confocal microscope as described above, followed by cell lineaging as described below, allowing us to determine the identity of GFP-positive cells at the ~100-cell stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistics and data analysis</title><p>Box and whisker plots shown throughout this article were generated in R using the boxplot function. Briefly, each box contains 50% of all data points between the first and third quartile (interquartile range [IQR]) and its center lies at the mean along the Y-axis, with the median indicated by a thick line in the box. Whiskers extend to ±1.58 IQR/sqrt(n). Data points out of this range are shown as individual points and can be considered as outliers, except for plots of variability, where outliers are not displayed for simplicity.</p><p>Statistical comparisons were performed in R using Welch’s two-sample t-test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. Simultaneous comparisons of multiple groups for difference in their means were performed using Tukey’s honest significant difference test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Lineage tracing</title><p>Three-dimensional time-lapse recordings of embryos expressing mCherry::H2B in either wild-type or <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> background were first preprocessed to enhance the nuclear signal and remove noise with the Noise2Void/CARE machine learning pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krull et al., 2019</xref>). Thereafter, a custom Fiji macro was used to correct the drift using the first polar body as a bright fiducial marker. The lineage was then traced using a level-set image segmentation and model evolution implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks, USA) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dzyubachyk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krüger et al., 2015</xref>), and corrected in the WormDeLux Java-based lineage editor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelier et al., 2016</xref>). Results were exported in the StarryNite format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Murray, 2011</xref>). Cells were then automatically named in the lineage editor according to the canonical lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sulston et al., 1983</xref>), and manually checked afterward for possible errors, especially in mutant embryos that often substantially deviated in division orientation and cell positioning from the wild-type model used for naming.</p><p>As mentioned also in the results section, all lineage files and the source code are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/UPGON/worm-rules-eLife">https://github.com/UPGON/worm-rules-eLife</ext-link>. Note that we excluded embryos with the 4-cell stage T-arrangement from the lineage analysis because they are known to exhibit specific defects stemming from the lack of ABp induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Priess and Thomson, 1987</xref>), which would introduce additional variability and thus mask potential novel phenotypes. Note that some embryos were imaged only up to the 26 cell stage; therefore, the number of embryos used for statistical comparison differs for individual cells and in different analyses reported in this article; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> reports the number of embryos/cells used for each comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data analysis of lineaged embryos</title><p>Lineages in the StarryNite format were imported into R version 3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">R Development Core Team, 2014</xref>). The growth curves of all embryos were aligned in time, and a specific scaling factor for each embryo was deployed to match the mean pace of wild-type development at 17°C based on the maximum correlation between the wild type and each experimental curve (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Differential pace of development could be caused by slight variations in temperature or by inherent embryo variability. We then set ABa division time as time 0 because time-lapse recording for the lineaging experiments typically started at the 4-cell stage, after the temperature upshift was performed during the first division, or in the early 2-cell stage for controls.</p><p>Embryos were aligned in space with respect to their inferred A-P and D-V axes using a custom Java-based script (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelier et al., 2016</xref>). First, nuclear positions were normalized to length, width, and height of each embryo along each imaging axis. Then, the alignment method first determines the A-P axis coinciding with the first principal component of the PCA calculated from all nuclear positions within first 100 frames of development. The D-V axis is orthogonal to the A-P axis and proceeds through the ventral surface of the embryo defined as the average position of the MS lineage cells. Finally, the left–right (L-R) axis is orthogonal to both the A-P and D-V axes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Feature extraction</title><p>We then computed 13 features (variables) using this aligned data set for each cell in every embryo. First, we computed the time of cell birth (variable name [v]: StartTime), and cell cycle duration (v: LifeTime), as well as the time of division (v: EndTime). Next, we recorded 3D positions of each cell along the three principal axes at the last frame before anaphase (variables: pAP, pLR, pDV), as well as the total trajectory distance (totdis) and the net displacement (netdis) of each cell as the Euclidean distance between nuclear 3D coordinates at birth and at the end of the cell cycle. Further, division angles (v: aAP, aLR, aDV) were computed with respect to the inferred embryonic axes at the first frame after anaphase onset. The last two variables, that is, angular (v: aMean) and positional deviation (v: pOV), required a comparison of a given embryo to the <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> control model that was determined by aligning embryos in time and space using the General Procrustes Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gower, 1975</xref>) and then calculating average positions of individual cells. Using this model, overall angular deviation (v: aMean) was computed as an angle between the reference division vector and the observed spindle orientation vector in a given embryo for each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelier et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, positional deviation was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the position of a given nucleus at metaphase from that in the control model. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> contains complete statistics for all 13 features in experimental groups of embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Variable filtering and intra-group variation</title><p>We filtered variables according to effect size and statistical significance comparing equalized dead and alive <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos at the 15-cell stage.

The p-value cut-off α = 0.008 was determined for a false discovery rate of 10% using scrambled experimental data with shuffled group labels (100 repetitions). We then plotted effect size versus p-value as a volcano plot.</p><p>To assess variability within each group of embryos, we calculated the standard deviation and CV for each cell and every feature. In particular, the CV was used to compare cell cycle variability among different cells that have lineage and stage-specific differences in average cell cycle duration. To assess the mean and the variance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>), we required each feature to be scored in at least five embryos in both alive and dead equalized groups, thereby decreasing the total number of analyzed features to 1608.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Predictive model of developmental outcome using Lasso</title><p>We searched the parameter space of variables at 4-, 8-, 15-, and 28-cell stage for features that would predict lethality in equalized embryos (n = 31 embryos scored for all features at all these stages). Data preprocessing before feeding data into the model building pipeline included removing those variables with low overall variance (empirically set at &lt;2.5%, n = 24 variables), those that would have more than 25% of missing value (n = 12 variables), and also replacing missing values with the group mean (128/18,228 values), and scaling each variable within a 0–1 range. We used the penalized Lasso regression to generate a binary classification model (glmnet R package). We employed a machine learning strategy to obtain a robust value of the shrinkage coefficient lambda by performing fivefold cross-validation (cv) 250 times and choosing a model with minimal cross-validation mean squared error. We report average classification accuracy for best models selected over 250 cv iterations. To evaluate the stability of solutions thus obtained, we scored the number of chosen predictors and their identity over 250 iterations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Zoltan Spiró for his initial observation of acute temperature sensitivity of <italic>lin-5</italic>(<italic>ev571</italic>), as well as to Sander van den Heuvel, Joel Rothman, and Geraldine Seydoux for their generous sharing of strains.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Clemens Cabernard (Reviewer #1); Morris Maduro (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Asymmetric cell division is an evolutionary conserved mechanism that creates cellular diversity. ACD can be manifested in biased segregation of molecular cell fate determinants, organelles or daughter cell size difference. Daughter cell size difference occurs frequently in metazoans but the functional significance remains poorly understood.</p><p>Here, Jankele et al., use <italic>C. elegans</italic> to investigate whether the stereotypic cell size difference between AB and P1 cells in the early embryo is important for overall embryo development. They use a temperature sensitive allele of Lin-5 and an optogenetic approach to misposition the mitotic spindle, resulting in an equalization of the AB and P1 cell in the early worm embryo. The authors discover that a size asymmetry threshold exists that determines embryo viability. Furthermore, they uncover that equalized embryos show faster cell cycle progression but also display additional defects in cell positioning, spindle orientation and cell fate acquisition.</p><p>This is an elegant study, addressing an important question in vivo. With its fixed cell lineage, availability of molecular genetic tools and advanced live cell imaging, <italic>C. elegans</italic> is the ideal choice to address this question. The use of the temperature sensitive lin-5 allele and the optogenetic approach are simple, yet effective.</p><p>In discussing the paper, the editor and reviewers had several broad concerns that must be addressed in a revision. We call particular attention to point (3) below, regarding claims of buffering, which are highlighted by the authors in the title and throughout the manuscript. It is our feeling that these claims were not made in a sufficiently rigorous manner. As the reviewers note, Barkoulas and Felix provide rigorous criteria for what should be called &quot;robustness” and how it should be measured. It is essential that the authors either make a stronger case for robustness by the Barkoulas and Felix (or other appropriate) criteria, or tone down the claims about buffering/robustness.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Our first concern is that their conclusions hinge on LIN-5 manipulation only affecting size asymmetry. While they use appropriate controls, both the lin-5(ts) and the optogenetic lines already show an increase in embryonic lethality, albeit low, in control conditions (permissive temperature, no light) as well as mild cell positioning defects. Moreover, there is also a surprising amount of lethality (25%) in embryos with rather normal size asymmetry. Given the requirements for LIN-5 in many processes beyond spindle positioning in the zygote, including cortex behavior/blebbing, chromosome segregation, pronuclear rotations, spindle positioning in other cells, etc., it is difficult to rule out that these lines may be sensitized or that LIN-5 manipulation comprises development independently of size asymmetry, at least to some degree. To my knowledge, there is no other method available to reliably equalize divisions, so this is probably the best one can do at the moment. However, the authors should at least acknowledge this potential caveat in the absence of an independent mechanism to symmetrize divisions as it is very difficult to be sure that the only thing being affected in these experiments is size asymmetry.</p><p>2) LIN-5 caveats aside, while broadly consistent with a role for size asymmetry in development, what role asymmetry is playing is rather unclear. What emerges most clearly is that loss of size asymmetry via LIN-5 manipulation is associated with a highly pleiotropic array of defects, including changes in division timing, division orientation, blastomere positioning and patterns of fate induction, and it is seems that a variable number of potential defects accumulate, each potentially resulting in an additive increase in probability of death, particularly in perturbed conditions (e.g. excessive compression).</p><p>3) Finally, the phenotypic defects and variability in traits such as cell cycle timing and orientation are used to claim that size asymmetric divisions buffer variability. This is a rather stretched reading of the data. Notably, the authors cite Barkoulas and Felix, who in their review criticize the increasing frequency of claims of robustness genes/pathways. A key argument Barkoulas and Felix make is that compromising the function of a molecule in a system such that the system is more sensitive to further perturbations does not mean that molecule/pathway acts as buffering or robustness mechanism, but could simply be pushing the system closer to a breakdown point. The claim of buffering here rests on the observation that in dying embryos, phenotypes are more variable. However, as Barkoulas argue, one expects higher phenotypic variability as one moves the system away from wild-type behavior and starts to exceed the capacity of development control mechanisms to cope with defects. Following this line of thinking and given that most variability is coupled to pronounced changes in the mean behavior (i.e. shorter cell cycle times, directed positional shifts), we would argue that a more likely conclusion is that lin-5 manipulation simply introduces sub-lethal defects that prime the system for loss of viability when combined with other perturbations such as compression. Hence, while symmetrically dividing cells may be more sensitive to additional perturbations, we would argue that this result does not say anything about whether size asymmetry buffers the effects of other sources of variability or perturbations of development</p><p>4) The reviewers generally found the manuscript hard to follow, and that it would benefit from systematic efforts to make it accessible to a non-technical audience.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) Sibling cell size asymmetry occurs in several metazoan cell types. Unfortunately, the authors failed to cite the corresponding literature in the very first paragraph of the Introduction. I am sure this is not an attempt to inflate the novelty of this study. In most cases, the significance of daughter cell size asymmetry has not been clearly demonstrated in any organism. The authors need to reference not just what has been written in <italic>C. elegans</italic> on the topic but also include studies from human cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species.</p><p>2) The majority of the data is derived from upshifted lin-5 embryos. I wonder whether the optogenetic approach yielded the same results. It would be worth mentioning early in the manuscript why the authors chose to focus on the upshift experiments exclusively.</p><p>3) Figure labelling and annotations are often unclear. For instance, what is meant with “plates” in Figure 2D? The y-axis indicates the range of AB size in %.</p><p>4) Figure 5D and following: what do the colored bar plots on top and on the side of these scatter plots indicate? I could not find any specific information in the legend. Although I could make an educated guess, I would prefer the authors to tell me what the graphs refer to.</p><p>5) Figure 6: The authors mention the extraction of several features from their live cell imaging experiments. I was trying to find specific information about the nature of these features (the supplemental tables did not help) but did not succeed. It would be beneficial to mention in the manuscript and Figure 6B what these features are, and how and why they were extracted.</p><p>6) As mentioned above, the manuscript is riddled with imprecise and diffusive statements such as this:.…&quot; suggesting that the mechanisms coping with equalization are not fully operative, implying that unequal first cleavage is required for invariably successful embryogenesis.” What is meant by “not fully operative”?</p><p>“Developmental systems are deemed to be robust if they remain unchanged or else change in a reproducible manner in the face of a given perturbation, with increased variability upon perturbation indicative of a non-robust system.” What is this supposed to mean?</p><p>Would it be possible to explain in simple terms what “lasso penalized logistic regression machine learning approach” entails?</p><p>7) Several conclusions appear not to be supported by the data. Examples:</p><p>– Figure 3A: The authors conclude that the differences in division timing appear not to be significant. Based on what statistical test did the authors reach this conclusion? I cannot find the corresponding information in the figure or text.</p><p>– The authors conclude that unless corrected, a skew in the EMS division axis results in embryonic lethality. Where is this shown? How can mispositioning of cells, e.g E and MS explain the observed lethality?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Jankele et al. cleverly seeks to use two new tools, a rapidly reversible temperature sensitive allele of lin-5 and optogenetic manipulation of LIN-5 localization to equalize division of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote and assess its impact on development through an impressive and comprehensive array of quantitative readouts, representing one of the best attempts to date in tackling the important and poorly understood question of the role of size asymmetry during cell division. The authors use this approach to make two key claims – first that division asymmetry per se is important for development, and second, that division asymmetry confers robustness to development by suppressing phenotypic variability. In general the manipulations and quantifications reflect a solid body of work and the data are consistent with a role for size asymmetry in development – though see comments above. At the same time why size asymmetry is important is less clear and we are not sold on the claims of phenotypic buffering.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Many of the early embryonic cell divisions of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are asymmetrical in both cell size and fate. The first division of the zygote produces a much larger anterior AB cell and a smaller P1 cell. In this work, the authors use a clever genetic manipulation to interrupt function of the lin-5 gene product, required for the posterior displacement of the spindle that produces this asymmetric division, producing similar-sized AB and P1 cells. They can then restore LIN-5 function to subsequent divisions. An optogenetic method to enhance localization of LIN-5 to the anterior cortex could also produce a similar AB-P1 division in the absence of a temperature shift. The authors can then examine the consequences of the smaller AB and larger P1 on development.</p><p>As a control for potential disruption of A-P polarity, the authors find that asymmetric localization of MEX-5 and PAR-2 occurs apparently normally in lin-5 upshifted embryos. (They also interrupt LIN-5 function for a similar 5-minute window after a normal AB-P1 asymmetric division as a further control.)</p><p>In their first result, they find that degree of symmetry of the AB-P1 division correlates with inability of embryos to undergo proper enclosure and elongation, i.e. the more symmetrical, the more likely is inviability. In particular, if AB represents 48% of the embryo volume or smaller, embryos were always inviable. This establishes a threshold of AB/P1 size ratios compatible with viability.</p><p>The authors next examined cell division timing within the AB and P1 lineages following forced symmetry. Although correlated with loss of asymmetry in cell cycle timings, a forced delay of the AB cell cycle by mild laser treatment could restore cell cycle timings in symmetric AB/P1 embryos, but these embryos were not rescued for loss of viability. A small percentage of embryos were found in which alterations in timing resulted in a T-shaped configuration of cells at the 4-cell stage which prevents the P2-to-ABp induction required for ABp specification and is known to be lethal from other examples in which this induction is blocked.</p><p>Next, the authors perform lineage analysis up to the 120-cell stage and examine various patterns of development to understand the features that are affected by forced AB-P1 symmetry. They find that degree of symmetry correlates with cell cycle durations in the P1 lineage, but not the AB lineage. In general, the cell cycle becomes faster in the P1 descendants with the germline precursor P4 being the most affected as it also underwent an extra division. Relative cell positions between AB and P1 descendants become altered (as expected) because of the heterochrony between the two lineages, but there was not a statistically significant change in the duration of the cell cycle for individual cells between surviving and non-surviving equalized embryos, suggesting this alone was not the proximal cause of a failure to survive.</p><p>Quantitatively, the authors find that the coefficients of variation of cell cycle timing in the surviving embryo P1 lineages is smaller than in the equalized embryos that die. Hence, a loss of robustness in cell cycle durations is correlated with a lack of survival.</p><p>The authors examined their 4D lineage data at high resolution, documenting cell positions and division orientation. As might be expected, cell divisions deviated from controls over time and were more pronounced and variable in embryos that did not survive. An interesting result arose from noting that dead equalized embryos experienced more physical compression by the coverslip than controls by about 10%. More specifically, a skew in the division axis of EMS resulted in a mispositioning of MS and E that correlated with lethality. A similar mispositioning of MSa/p was correlated as well. The E daughters divide precociously if they are mis-specified, and consistent with this the authors find decreased or delayed expression of reporters that mark endoderm specification. Pharynx is made by both the MS and ABa descendants in normal embryos, and the authors find evidence that AB-derived pha-4 expression occurs in excess, likely due to disrupted MS-to-AB lineage cell-cell interactions that induced pharynx specification from the AB lineage.</p><p>Using a machine learning approach, the authors then identify (even from their small sample size) that three features (two from the AB lineage, and one from C) are sufficient to predict survival of an equalized embryo at the 15-cell stage. This is consistent with the notion that cell position deviations from normal are responsible for lethality.</p><p>I really enjoyed this paper. The experiments have a “classic” feel like the early days of experimental embryology in <italic>C. elegans</italic> where pressure from outside the eggshell was used to manipulate the positioning of the spindle as AB divided, reorienting ABa to contact P2 instead of ABp. The data are richly detailed and the images and analysis of high quality. The result that interfering with normal early cell divisions in a stereotyped system leads to stochastic failures in later development is not particularly novel, however given the way this question was addressed and analyzed is makes the manuscript worthy of <italic>eLife</italic> with addressing of my comments below.</p><p>1) If illegitimate contacts are predicted by the ectopic expression of pha-4::GFP, then it should be possible to look in the 4D data for whether or not these cells or their ancestors were in contact with MS lineage descendants, for example by measuring inter-nuclear distances between MS and AB lineage cells and comparing with distances in wild-type embryos.</p><p>2) The hypothesis that embryos tolerate deformation under a coverslip less well following perturbation of the AB-P1 asymmetry is interesting and bears further investigation. For example, it predicts that “equalized” embryos that were treated and then had the coverslip removed would be more likely to be viable.</p><p>3) A major finding of the paper is that cell cycle times in the P1 descendants are sensitive to the size of P1. In the Discussion the authors stopped short of suggesting a mechanism by which cell cycles are sped up. Are there candidate nuclear and/or cytoplasmic factors whose concentrations would be perturbed enough to speed up the cell cycle?</p><p>4) It would be good to mention findings in other nematodes that show that the alternative cell arrangements (in particular the T-arrangement) seen in the lin-5-manipulated <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos are found naturally in other nematode species (e.g. Schulze and Schierenberg, 2011). The size differences between AB and P1 are also not as pronounced in other systems as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This would remind readers of the diversity of early embryonic cell arrangements in other nematodes.</p><p>5) The predictive data in the latter part of the paper could be related to studies of early human embryogenesis (e.g. Wong et al., 2010, PMID 20890283) in which features of mitosis timing and cell arrangements were used to correlate with surviving blastocysts.</p><p>6) Reduced levels of END-3::GFP could also result from a reduction of nuclear POP-1 levels in E. As a general feature of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, POP-1 asymmetry (see Huang et al., 2007, PMID 17567664) results from both cell-cell interactions (in some cases, like the P2 to EMS induction) and the PAR proteins: Anterior daughters resulting from A/P divisions have high POP-1 levels while posterior daughters have lower nuclear POP-1. Perturbation of division axes resulting from similar-size AB and P1 would be expected to alter POP-1 asymmetry as well. In the case of end-3, with a rotated EMS spindle, there may be higher nuclear POP-1 which would in turn decrease activation of end-3.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61714.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Our first concern is that their conclusions hinge on LIN-5 manipulation only affecting size asymmetry. While they use appropriate controls, both the lin-5(ts) and the optogenetic lines already show an increase in embryonic lethality, albeit low, in control conditions (permissive temperature, no light) as well as mild cell positioning defects. Moreover, there is also a surprising amount of lethality (25%) in embryos with rather normal size asymmetry. Given the requirements for LIN-5 in many processes beyond spindle positioning in the zygote, including cortex behavior/blebbing, chromosome segregation, pronuclear rotations, spindle positioning in other cells, etc., it is difficult to rule out that these lines may be sensitized or that LIN-5 manipulation comprises development independently of size asymmetry, at least to some degree. To my knowledge, there is no other method available to reliably equalize divisions, so this is probably the best one can do at the moment. However, the authors should at least acknowledge this potential caveat in the absence of an independent mechanism to symmetrize divisions as it is very difficult to be sure that the only thing being affected in these experiments is size asymmetry.</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted to mitigate this potential issue by minimizing to the extent possible perturbation of LIN-5 function at other times and places. We acknowledge that the strain used for the optogenetic experiments exhibits ~23% embryonic lethality even without exposure to 488 nm laser light, indicating that mCh::LIN-5::ePDZ is not fully functional. By contrast, control <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos upshifted early in the second cell cycle exhibit a marginal embryonic lethality of ~7%. Therefore, the adverse consequences of first division equalization reported in the manuscript cannot be ascribed simply to this mutant background or to spending 5 minutes at 27 <sup>o</sup>C. As suggested by the reviewers, we now explicitly discuss these points in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Note also that we explored two alternative methods in attempting to symmetrize first division. First, we used a microneedle to deform the eggshell and thus prevent the posterior spindle from moving. However, when the needle was retracted in such experiments, the spindle quickly assumed a posterior position anew, thus precluding first division symmetrization. Moreover, substantial cytoplasm mixing took place in such embryos, which would have prevented rigorous analysis of further development. Second, we used laser tweezers to prevent movement of the posterior spindle pole, but the power needed to achieve this killed the embryo. Overall, these attempts led us to the conclusion that restricted perturbation of LIN-5 function, using primarily the <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> allele, was best suited for analyzing the consequences of first division symmetrization for subsequent development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) LIN-5 caveats aside, while broadly consistent with a role for size asymmetry in development, what role asymmetry is playing is rather unclear. What emerges most clearly is that loss of size asymmetry via LIN-5 manipulation is associated with a highly pleiotropic array of defects, including changes in division timing, division orientation, blastomere positioning and patterns of fate induction, and it is seems that a variable number of potential defects accumulate, each potentially resulting in an additive increase in probability of death, particularly in perturbed conditions (e.g. excessive compression).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this view: loss of size asymmetry indeed results in a pleiotropic array of defects rather that a single phenotype. Figure 6—figure supplement 1 encapsulates this point, which we now emphasize also in the Abstract, and expand on in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>In addition, we have now analyzed the phenotype of those equalized <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos that live beyond embryogenesis, finding additional defects in larvae and adults. This data set is reported in the novel panel Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, and indicates that first division equalization can be detrimental also beyond embryogenesis, a point that is mentioned also in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Finally, the phenotypic defects and variability in traits such as cell cycle timing and orientation are used to claim that size asymmetric divisions buffer variability. This is a rather stretched reading of the data. Notably, the authors cite Barkoulas and Felix, who in their review criticize the increasing frequency of claims of robustness genes/pathways. A key argument Barkoulas and Felix make is that compromising the function of a molecule in a system such that the system is more sensitive to further perturbations does not mean that molecule/pathway acts as buffering or robustness mechanism, but could simply be pushing the system closer to a breakdown point. The claim of buffering here rests on the observation that in dying embryos, phenotypes are more variable. However, as Barkoulas argue, one expects higher phenotypic variability as one moves the system away from wild-type behavior and starts to exceed the capacity of development control mechanisms to cope with defects. Following this line of thinking and given that most variability is coupled to pronounced changes in the mean behavior (i.e. shorter cell cycle times, directed positional shifts), we would argue that a more likely conclusion is that lin-5 manipulation simply introduces sub-lethal defects that prime the system for loss of viability when combined with other perturbations such as compression. Hence, while symmetrically dividing cells may be more sensitive to additional perturbations, we would argue that this result does not say anything about whether size asymmetry buffers the effects of other sources of variability or perturbations of development</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this important point. We agree that our original conclusions attributing the observed increase in variance upon first division equalization to loss of robustness did not fit the strict definition of Barkoulas and Félix, which requires increased variance without a change in the mean upon a challenge. As a result, we altered substantially the manuscript, including changing the title to “Physically asymmetric division ensures invariably successful embryogenesis”.</p><p>Moreover, we removed statements about robustness from the Results section entirely, focusing instead solely on the observed increases in variance. We also analyzed our data further, finding that only a minority of features (23/1608 between the 4- and 100- cell stage) exhibited a significant increase of variance without a change in the mean in equalized embryos, suggestive of loss of robustness upon first division equalization merely for these features. We report these findings in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 3, mentioning them also briefly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers generally found the manuscript hard to follow, and that it would benefit from systematic efforts to make it accessible to a non-technical audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized and streamlined the manuscript so that it is now hopefully accessible to a broader readership.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>1) Sibling cell size asymmetry occurs in several metazoan cell types. Unfortunately, the authors failed to cite the corresponding literature in the very first paragraph of the Introduction. I am sure this is not an attempt to inflate the novelty of this study. In most cases, the significance of daughter cell size asymmetry has not been clearly demonstrated in any organism. The authors need to reference not just what has been written in <italic>C. elegans</italic> on the topic but also include studies from human cells, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species.</p></disp-quote><p>We had cited such analyzes of cell size asymmetry in other metazoan systems in the Discussion of the original submission, but agree that they could be mentioned earlier in the text. Therefore, we moved this entire paragraph to the Introduction of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The majority of the data is derived from upshifted lin-5 embryos. I wonder whether the optogenetic approach yielded the same results. It would be worth mentioning early in the manuscript why the authors chose to focus on the upshift experiments exclusively.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to focus on the upshift experiments with <italic>lin-5(ev571</italic>) for two reasons. First, as mentioned above, the optogenetic strain exhibits ~23% embryonic lethality even without exposure to 488 nm laser light, which would have hampered analyzing the consequences of first division equalization for subsequent development. Second, the optogenetic strain is not amenable to investigation with most extant fluorescently labeled marker strains because both GFP and mCherry channels are already occupied with PH::eGFP::LOV and LIN5::ePDZ::mCherry, something that was already mentioned in the Materials and methods section of the original submission. These two reasons are now mentioned explicitly in the Results section of the revised manuscript. Importantly, in addition, we now report that the terminal defective ventral closure phenotype of embryos equalized using optogenetics was similar to that observed in equalized <italic>lin-5(ev571)</italic> embryos (with the exception of one embryo that reached the 3-fold state but did not hatch), as mentioned in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure labelling and annotations are often unclear. For instance, what is meant with “plates” in Figure 2D? The y-axis indicates the range of AB size in %.</p></disp-quote><p>The legend for Figure 2D clearly states that “Plates” refers to the hatching rate on plates of embryos expressing LIN-5::ePDZ::mCherry and PH::eGFP::LOV. To further help clarify that both “Plates” and “No light” correspond to control conditions, we separated them with a horizontal line in the revised Figure 2D to prevent confusion with the y-axis label “AB size %”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5D and following: what do the colored bar plots on top and on the side of these scatter plots indicate? I could not find any specific information in the legend. Although I could make an educated guess, I would prefer the authors to tell me what the graphs refer to.</p></disp-quote><p>Apologies about this lack of clarity. We added an explanation regarding these marginal boxplots in the legend of Figure 5. Note also that we imaged additional embryos expressing END-3::GFP, thereby increasing the data set for Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 6: The authors mention the extraction of several features from their live cell imaging experiments. I was trying to find specific information about the nature of these features (the supplemental tables did not help) but did not succeed. It would be beneficial to mention in the manuscript and Figure 6B what these features are, and how and why they were extracted.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his comment. The features in question correspond to all measured variables for each cell, i.e. the time of division, cell cycle duration, cell position in 3D, division angles along the 3 embryonic axes, as well as two derived measures compared to control embryos – cell mispositioning and angular deviation of division axis. We clarified the nature of these features in the revised manuscript by expanding the corresponding Material and Methods section, and generated a new Supplementary file 7 listing all the features used at each stage, as well as inclusion frequency during model selection and coefficients for the best performing model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As mentioned above, the manuscript is riddled with imprecise and diffusive statements such as this:.…&quot; suggesting that the mechanisms coping with equalization are not fully operative, implying that unequal first cleavage is required for invariably successful embryogenesis.” What is meant by “not fully operative”?</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the sentence that was singled out, thereby clarifying what was meant. We have likewise altered the writing in other places to minimize and hopefully eliminate what was perceived as imprecise and diffusive statements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Developmental systems are deemed to be robust if they remain unchanged or else change in a reproducible manner in the face of a given perturbation, with increased variability upon perturbation indicative of a non-robust system.” What is this supposed to mean?</p></disp-quote><p>What we intended to convey is that developmental robustness refers to the capacity of systems to produce a uniform output despite internal noise and changing external conditions. As mentioned above, loss of robustness is characterized by increased variance in a given trait without change of mean value upon perturbation. As also mentioned above, we have revised our conclusions regarding robustness, which has led to the removal of the sentence singled out by the reviewer from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would it be possible to explain in simple terms what “lasso penalized logistic regression machine learning approach” entails?</p></disp-quote><p>Following the request of the reviewer, we now explain that Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a form of penalized regression approach that iteratively eliminates features that contribute least to a predictive performance of a statistical model, thus eventually converging on a simpler solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Several conclusions appear not to be supported by the data. Examples:</p><p>– Figure 3A: The authors conclude that the differences in division timing appear not to be significant. Based on what statistical test did the authors reach this conclusion? I cannot find the corresponding information in the figure or text.</p></disp-quote><p>We compared cell cycle duration of all individual cells between all pairwise combinations of experimental groups (i.e. wild-type, control, equalized alive, equalized dead, inverted) with Welsh’s two sample t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction. We added a reference in the text to Supplementary file 2, which contains all the statistical analysis for the lineaging dataset, including division timing of individual cells. This shows notably that there is no statistically significant change in timing comparing equalized dead and alive embryos. In addition, we now mention explicitly in the text that the confidence intervals of all groups shown in Figure 3A fully overlap, indicating that there is no difference between proliferation curves for AB lineage cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors conclude that unless corrected, a skew in the EMS division axis results in embryonic lethality. Where is this shown? How can mispositioning of cells, e.g E and MS explain the observed lethality?</p></disp-quote><p>Our statement “unless corrected” stems from the data reported in Figure 4F, where it can be seen that four equalized embryos with an initial EMS division angle deviation &gt;35º survived (Eq. Alive) and, as revealed upon closer inspection of the corresponding lineaging data, exhibited normal E and MS positions following correction during late anaphase/telophase. The lineage data supporting this and all other observations are available from GitHub (https://github.com/UPGON/worm-rules-<italic>eLife</italic>). That this is the case was already indicated in the Materials and methods section of the original submission, but is now mentioned also explicitly in the Results section of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, we now mention a potential hypothesis regarding how such a skew, if not corrected, could eventually lead to embryonic lethality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>1) If illegitimate contacts are predicted by the ectopic expression of pha-4::GFP, then it should be possible to look in the 4D data for whether or not these cells or their ancestors were in contact with MS lineage descendants, for example by measuring inter-nuclear distances between MS and AB lineage cells and comparing with distances in wild-type embryos.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting this interesting analysis. We investigated inter-nuclear distances between MS and ABal/ABar, as well as between their descendants, in equalized embryos expressing PHA-4::GFP (data from Figure 5G, code included on GitHub).</p><p>The most frequently observed aberrant pattern in our data was the ectopic expression of PHA-4::GFP in ABala lineage (see Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Therefore, we compared the 5 such embryos to the 14 that did not express GFP in any ABala cell. We found that MS-ABal, MS-ABala and MSa-ABala internuclear distances were not reduced (Wilcoxon test, not shown). However, we found that MS-ABara and MSa-ABara were significantly further apart in embryos with ectopic PHA4::GFP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), for reasons that remain to be determined. Given the already dense contents of our work, we chose not to include this piece of information in the revised manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61714-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The hypothesis that embryos tolerate deformation under a coverslip less well following perturbation of the AB-P1 asymmetry is interesting and bears further investigation. For example, it predicts that “equalized” embryos that were treated and then had the coverslip removed would be more likely to be viable.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is related to the point raised by reviewer 2, which led us to perform experiments under conditions in which embryos were not compressed. As mentioned above, those experiments lead us to conclude that compression further challenges embryos in which AB size is diminished, as evidenced by compounded embryonic lethality.</p><p>Prompted by the suggestion of the reviewer, we removed the coverslip at the 2- to 4-cell stage to recover specimens for scoring of potential post-embryonic phenotypes. In such an uncompressed setting, we observed 35% lethality among equalized embryos (N=20), which was not significantly different from the 52% lethality in compressed equalized embryos reported in Figure 2A (N=174, p=0.24, Fisher-exact test, documented in Figure 2—source code 1, and source data 1), due to the small sample size. However, combining this small data set with that of embryos imaged using 45 μm beads, we found that lethality decreased in a statistically significant manner to 33% in uncompressed equalized embryos (AB size range 48-53%, N=174 and 45, respectively, p = 0.03, Fisher’s exact test). Overall, these findings indicate that mechanical constrains imposed by compression make equalized embryos more prone to failure during embryonic development, and are reported in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A major finding of the paper is that cell cycle times in the P1 descendants are sensitive to the size of P1. In the Discussion the authors stopped short of suggesting a mechanism by which cell cycles are sped up. Are there candidate nuclear and/or cytoplasmic factors whose concentrations would be perturbed enough to speed up the cell cycle?</p></disp-quote><p>Potential candidates include PLK-1, cyclin B3 and the phosphatase CDC-25, which are positive regulator of cell cycle progression and are normally enriched in AB compared to P<sub>1</sub>. Following first division equalization, P<sub>1</sub> and its descendants are predicted to inherit more such components than normally owing to more centrally positioned cleavage, which could promote cell cycle progression. This hypothesis has been added to the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be good to mention findings in other nematodes that show that the alternative cell arrangements (in particular the T-arrangement) seen in the lin-5-manipulated <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos are found naturally in other nematode species (e.g. Schulze and Schierenberg, 2011). The size differences between AB and P1 are also not as pronounced in other systems as in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. This would remind readers of the diversity of early embryonic cell arrangements in other nematodes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions, which we took on board. We now mention these notions in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The predictive data in the latter part of the paper could be related to studies of early human embryogenesis (e.g. Wong et al., 2010, PMID 20890283) in which features of mitosis timing and cell arrangements were used to correlate with surviving blastocysts.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out to this interesting paper. However, after careful reading, we found two important differences between that study and our work. First, the authors used three time-related variables for predicting blastocyst survival, but did not factor blastomere size in their model. An examination of the Lasso analysis reported in our Figure 6 shows that variables related to cell cycle timing rarely figure among good predictors. Second, the work of Wong et al. demonstrates that all the differences observed amongst human embryos can be traced to the quality of the oocyte, while our experimental intervention occurs in the zygote. Interestingly, in addition, a study by Hardarson et al., 2001 found that having unevenly sized blastomeres in early human embryos frequently correlates with aneuploidy and lower rates of implantation and pregnancy, indicating that proper size allocation at cell division is also important in that case, albeit in a different manner than in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. That this is the case is mentioned in the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Reduced levels of END-3::GFP could also result from a reduction of nuclear POP-1 levels in E. As a general feature of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo, POP-1 asymmetry (see Huang et al., 2007, PMID 17567664) results from both cell-cell interactions (in some cases, like the P2 to EMS induction) and the PAR proteins: Anterior daughters resulting from A/P divisions have high POP-1 levels while posterior daughters have lower nuclear POP-1. Perturbation of division axes resulting from similar-size AB and P1 would be expected to alter POP-1 asymmetry as well. In the case of end-3, with a rotated EMS spindle, there may be higher nuclear POP-1 which would in turn decrease activation of end-3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to assess nucler POP-1 levels in equalized embryos, but this is something that will have to be left out for the future owing to time constraints.</p></body></sub-article></article>
