infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Improvements in care and clinician confidence may shorten the time spent as an inpatient, or the need for admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) or high density unit (HDU). On the other hand, limited resources at times of high demand may lead to rationing. Nevertheless, these variables may be used as static proxies for disease severity, as outcome measures for trials, and to inform planning and logistics.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigate these time trends in an extremely large international cohort of 142,540 patients hospitalised with COVID-19. Investigated are: time from symptom onset to hospital admission, probability of ICU/HDU admission, time from hospital admission to ICU/HDU admission, hospital case fatality ratio (hCFR) and total length of hospital stay.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Time from onset to admission showed a rapid decline during the first months of the pandemic followed by peaks during August/September and December 2020. ICU/HDU admission was more frequent from June to August. The hCFR was lowest from June to August. Raw numbers for overall hospital stay showed little variation, but there is clear decline in time to discharge for ICU/HDU survivors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results establish that variables of these kinds have limitations when used as outcome measures in a rapidly-evolving situation.</p><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Wellcome [215091/Z/18/Z] and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation [OPP1209135]. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>UK FCDO and Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>215091/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baruch</surname><given-names>Joaquín</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunning</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name><name><surname>Escher</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>Horby</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name><name><surname>Olliaro</surname><given-names>Piero Luigi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000865</institution-id><institution>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OPP1209135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baruch</surname><given-names>Joaquín</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunning</surname><given-names>Jake</given-names></name><name><surname>Escher</surname><given-names>Martina</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Jia</given-names></name><name><surname>Horby</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name><name><surname>Olliaro</surname><given-names>Piero Luigi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Oxford's COVID-19 Research Response Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0009146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merson</surname><given-names>Laura</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>Allavena, C. declares personal fees from ViiVHealthcare, MSD, Janssen and Gilead, all outside the submitted work.
