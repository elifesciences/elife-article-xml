This feature is exploited by cancer therapies to either increase RS to unbearable levels or inhibit checkpoint kinases involved in the DNA damage response. Thus far, treatments that combine these two strategies have shown promise but also have severe adverse effects. To identify novel, better-tolerated anticancer combinations, we screened a collection of plant extracts and found two natural compounds from the plant, <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic>, that synergistically inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Bakuchiol inhibited DNA replication and activated the checkpoint kinase CHK1 by targeting DNA polymerases. Isobavachalcone interfered with DNA double-strand break repair by inhibiting the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and DNA end resection. The combination of bakuchiol and isobavachalcone synergistically inhibited cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Importantly, it also prevented tumor development in xenografted NOD/SCID mice. The synergistic effect of inhibiting DNA replication and CHK2 signaling identifies a vulnerability of cancer cells that might be exploited by using clinically approved inhibitors in novel combination therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pasero</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lin</surname><given-names>Yea-Lih</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004099</institution-id><institution>Ligue Contre le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pasero</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Programme de Pré-maturation, Région Occitanie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maiorano</surname><given-names>Domenico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Combined Inhibition of DNA replication and repair synergistically prevents tumor growth, representing a promising strategy for cancer therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome integrity is particularly at-risk during S phase of the cell cycle when thousands of replication forks travel at high speed along the chromosomes to duplicate the DNA. Replication initiates at specific sites called origins, which are sequentially activated throughout the length of the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fragkos et al., 2015</xref>). Faithful DNA replication depends on the coordinated action of the many enzymes that make up the replisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Attali et al., 2021</xref>). During this process, the parental DNA strands are separated by the CMG helicase, consisting of CDC45, the MCM2-7 hexamer, and the GINS complex. DNA is synthesized on the leading strand by DNA polymerase (Pol) ε and on the lagging strand by Pol α-primase and Pol δ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lujan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Replication forks stall when they encounter obstacles such as DNA lesions, highly transcribed genes, or tightly bound protein complexes, causing what is commonly referred to as replication stress (RS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lin and Pasero, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). RS is associated with an excess of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), resulting from the uncoupling of DNA polymerase and helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pasero and Vindigni, 2017</xref>). Stalled or collapsed forks can also give rise to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). A signal transduction pathway called the intra-S checkpoint detects these stalled forks and associated DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). Upon fork arrest, ssDNA coated by the ssDNA-binding heterotrimer RPA recruits the Ser/Thr protein kinase ATR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>). Activation of ATR by TopBP1 initiates a signaling cascade involving phosphorylation and activation of the intra-S checkpoint kinases CHK1 and WEE1, which coordinate a variety of repair mechanisms to prevent fork collapse, resume DNA synthesis, and delay entry into mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pasero and Vindigni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saldivar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stracker et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of DSBs is also signaled by two other protein kinases, ATM and DNA-PK, which activate the checkpoint kinase CHK2 and result in cell cycle arrest or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blackford and Jackson, 2017</xref>). ATR, ATM, and DNA-PK phosphorylate the histone variant H2AX on S139 (γ-H2AX), which is a reliable biomarker of RS and DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonner et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>During the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle, DSBs are preferentially repaired by homologous recombination (HR), which uses the sister chromatid as repair template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moynahan and Jasin, 2010</xref>). In G<sub>1</sub> phase or in HR-deficient cells, DSBs are repaired by more error-prone pathways such as non-homologous end joining and single-strand annealing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). HR-mediated DSB repair is initiated with the resection of DNA ends to generate 3′-protruding extremities that are coated by the RAD51 recombinase to form a RAD51 filament involved in homology search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cejka and Symington, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakraborty et al., 2023</xref>). RAD51 loading depends on BRCA1 and BRCA2, which also play a role at stalled replication forks to prevent the hyper-resection of nascent DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tye et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In precancerous lesions, deregulated oncogenic pathways perturb the proper execution of the DNA replication program, leading to increased fork collapse and chromosome breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015</xref>). This oncogene-induced RS, on the one hand, promotes cancer development by increasing genomic instability and promoting the loss of p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Halazonetis et al., 2008</xref>; on the other hand, it is a burden for cancer cells, which must deal with chronic replication defects and may become dependent on checkpoint function for their survival. This burden can be exploited for cancer treatment by the use of genotoxic drugs that further increase RS and/or by inhibiting the ATR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lecona and Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ubhi and Brown, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Cancer cells eventually adapt to oncogene-induced RS, however, by overexpressing downstream components of the ATR pathway, such as Claspin, Timeless, and CHK1, which correlates with poor prognosis in breast, lung, and colon carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, genotoxic agents used to increase RS in cancer cells are generally effective as first-line treatments to reduce tumor mass, but patients often relapse as the cancer cells become resistant to treatment.</p><p>Since cancer cells depend on an effective RS response for their survival, considerable effort has been made to develop small-molecule inhibitors of the intra-S checkpoint kinases ATR, CHK1, and WEE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobbelstein and Sørensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lecona and Fernandez-Capetillo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ubhi and Brown, 2019</xref>). In principle, inhibiting these kinases should selectively kill cancer cells that have elevated levels of RS while sparing healthy cells. Several inhibitors have now entered clinical trials, with mixed results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bradbury et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorecki et al., 2021</xref>). ATR inhibitors are usually well tolerated when used in monotherapy, but they have limited efficacy because low ATR activity can be compensated by ATM. ATR inhibitors are more effective when combined with subtherapeutic doses of chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., gemcitabine), but at the expense of serious adverse effects, such as myelosuppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dobbelstein and Sørensen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorecki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nazareth et al., 2019</xref>). CHK1 inhibitors are toxic, especially when used in combinatorial therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Neizer-Ashun and Bhattacharya, 2021</xref>). WEE1 inhibitors are better tolerated when used in monotherapy and combination regimens, but clinical trials have shown only modest benefits so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorecki et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, although some of these inhibitors are promising, they are still far from ready to be used in the clinic. Further efforts are still needed to identify new small-molecule inhibitors, or combinations of inhibitors, that target the RS response in cancer cells but are not excessively toxic to normal cells.</p><p>To identify novel small molecules that target the RS response in cancer cells, we screened crude extracts of plants used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine for their ability to kill cancer cells selectively by inducing RS. An extract from the plant <italic>Psoralea corylifolia</italic> showed the most promising anticancer activity. We show that bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC), two compounds isolated from this extract, act synergistically to prevent the proliferation of cancer cells, by inhibiting DNA synthesis and impeding the resection of DNA ends at DSBs, respectively. Together, these compounds reduce tumor growth and improve survival in a xenograft mouse model and IBC alone potentiates the anticancer effect of chemotherapeutic agents in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells.

Briefly, the cells were exposed to one or both drugs for 24 hr and then labeled sequentially with the thymidine analogues 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine (IdU) and 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CldU) each for 15 min and the length of replicated tracks was measured along individual DNA fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Analysis of CldU track length showed that BKC reduced fork speed by a factor of two relative to untreated cells in both cell lines, suggesting that it directly inhibits DNA synthesis. In contrast, IBC inhibited fork speed more in MCF-7 cells than in BJ cells, indicating that it may affect DNA synthesis through a mechanism different from that of BKC. When used in combination, the inhibitory effect of BKC and IBC on fork speed was further increased, consistent with our finding that these drugs have a synergistic effect on cell growth.</p><p>To evaluate the impact of IBC and BKC on the cell cycle, we exposed MCF-7 and BJ cells to these drugs for 24 hr, labeled the cells in S phase with EdU for 30 min and analyzed the distribution of cells in the various phases of the cell cycle by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Together, these data suggest that IBC and BKC induce RS through different mechanisms to prevent cancer cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BKC inhibits DNA replication</title><p>Our data suggest that BKC might be a potent inhibitor of replication fork progression in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) that acts directly on replicative DNA polymerases. Using DNA fiber assay, we found that BKC inhibited fork progression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, BKC treatment significantly increased sister fork asymmetry compared to DMSO-treated control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We then compared its effect to that of aphidicolin, a well-characterized inhibitor of DNA polymerases a, d, and ε (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheng and Kuchta, 1993</xref>). MCF-7 cells were treated with 40 μM BKC, 10 µM aphidicolin, or both for 2 hr and replication fork progression was measured by DNA fiber spreading. Remarkably, BKC inhibited fork progression more effectively than aphidicolin at these concentrations and the combined effect of both compounds was similar to the effect of BKC alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). BKC is a phenolic compound structurally related to resveratrol. Since resveratrol was shown to induce RS by inhibiting dNTP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benslimane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontecave et al., 1998</xref>), we tested the possibility that BKC might also impede DNA replication by inhibiting dNTP synthesis. To this end, we tested its effect on a replication assay in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, which contain high concentrations of dNTPs and do not depend on dNTP synthesis to sustain effective DNA replication. In this assay, demembranated sperm nuclei incubated in egg extracts decondense, assemble pre-replication complexes within 20 min and initiate synchronous DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Méchali and Harland, 1982</xref>). When added at the start of the assay (0 min), BKC (100 µM) exhibited a strong inhibitory effect on DNA replication, although not as profound as the effect of aphidicolin (60 µM). Moreover, when added after 40 min, long after the initiation of replication, BKC was as effective as aphidicolin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that it inhibits elongation. Consistent with this possibility, BKC effectively inhibited replication of ssDNA, a process that relies entirely on priming and elongation of DNA chains by replicative DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We also performed in silico molecular docking to study the potential interaction of BKC with the catalytic subunits of DNA polymerases δ and ε. This analysis showed that BKC can occupy the deoxycytidine sites of both enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Using the cellular thermal sensitivity shift assay (CETSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinez Molina et al., 2013</xref>), we found that BKC interacts with the catalytic subunits of Polδ and Polε in MCF-7 cells to stabilize the thermal sensitivity of both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>).

Overall, IBC and BKC inhibited tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and induced DNA fragmentation, indicative of tumor cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Moreover, BKC induced phosphorylation of CHK2 on T68, a marker of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). However, this activation of CHK1 and CHK2 mediated by BKC was suppressed by the addition of IBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F and G</xref>). Since these checkpoint kinases are important to coordinate DNA repair, this would explain why unrepairable DNA breaks accumulate in tumors exposed to the IBC + BKC<sub>5x</sub> combination.

We showed above that IBC inhibits the DNA damage checkpoint kinase CHK2; therefore, we investigated whether IBC might enhance the potency of chemotherapeutic drugs. To this end, we used cell lines from patients with DLBCL; this is the most common lymphoid malignancy in adults, accounting for up to 35% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Although DLBCL can be cured in over 60% of patients by using rituximab-based chemotherapy regimens, the remainder develop recurrent or progressive disease that is often fatal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sarkozy and Coiffier, 2013</xref>). New therapeutic approaches are still needed to achieve an effective treatment for these patients with high-risk/refractory DLBCL. Since deregulation of DNA repair pathways in DLBCL cells is associated with a poor outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bret et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bret et al., 2013</xref>), we reasoned that IBC could potentiate the effect of agents inducing DNA damage in DLBCL cells.</p><p>To address this possibility, we first determined the IC<sub>50</sub> of IBC for growth inhibition of a panel of DLBCL cell lines. IC<sub>50</sub> ranged from 8 to 28 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), similar to the concentrations we found were effective on the solid cancer cell lines we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To evaluate whether IBC potentiates the growth inhibitory effect of chemotherapeutic agents, we treated the drug-resistant DLBCL cell line U2932 with various concentrations of including etoposide and doxorubicin (topoisomerase II inhibitors) or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide (DNA alkylating agent) in the presence of the IC<sub>20</sub> of IBC (4.5 μM) for 72 hr. We found that IBC substantially enhanced cell growth inhibition by all three of these DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Moreover, by testing a full-range concentration matrix of drug pairs on cell viability after 72 hr treatment, we found that IBC synergistically increased the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin and or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide on U2932 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This is consistent with our evidence from in silico molecular docking that BKC binds the catalytic site of DNA polymerases δ and ε. Thus, BKC probably inhibits the polymerases by competing for dNTP binding. Indeed, we demonstrate that BKC inhibits replication elongation of chromosomal DNA and ssDNA in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts, albeit to a lesser extent than does aphidicolin. These findings argue against the possible explanation that BKC inhibits dNTP synthesis, as proposed for the structurally similar compound resveratrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benslimane et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fontecave et al., 1998</xref>), since dNTPs are available in large amount in these extracts. Moreover, we show that BKC slows replication fork progression in vivo in both normal and cancer cells, indicating that it acts as a bona fide replication inhibitor.</p><p>IBC affects a wide spectrum of biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuete and Sandjo, 2012</xref>), including the activity of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2024</xref>) and shows antitumor activity against drug-resistant cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kuete et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ren et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). IBC is thought to prevent cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in various cancer cell models by inhibiting the AKT kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jin and Shi, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jing et al., 2010</xref>). In our hands, however, IBC does not significantly inhibit AKT, at least when the drug was used at concentrations that inhibit cell proliferation. Rather, IBC inhibits CHK2 in vivo and in vitro at concentrations much lower than those that inhibit other kinases and it has no effect on the activity of the related checkpoint kinase CHK1. As a key effector of the DNA damage response, CHK2 is an attractive target for new drugs that might potentiate the effect of conventional, DNA-damaging treatments for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bucher and Britten, 2008</xref>). However, few CHK2-specific inhibitors are available and those that are have only modest antiproliferative effects compared with inhibitors of other checkpoint kinases such as CHK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ronco et al., 2017</xref>). The results of clinical trials combining the CHK2 inhibitor PHI-101 with other therapeutic agents are still awaited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Park et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, CHK2 inhibitors also protects healthy tissues from radiotherapy or chemotherapy, presumably by inhibiting p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The target of IBC in vivo is very likely CHK2-dependent activation of BRCA1. Indeed, we show that IBC prevents HR-mediated DSB repair by inhibiting the formation of RAD51 foci in cancer cells. The loading of RAD51 depends on the resection of DNA ends by nucleases, through a process that is mediated by the CHK2-dependent activation of BRCA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parameswaran et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). We found that IBC inhibits resection at DSBs as efficiently as the CHK2 inhibitor BML-277. In contrast, IBC does not inhibit resection of nascent DNA at stalled forks, a process that does not depend on BRCA1 but, rather, is repressed by BRCA1 and BRCA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Our data indicate therefore that IBC differentially affects resection at DSB and at stalled forks by inhibiting CHK2.</p><p>The inhibitory effects of BKC on DNA synthesis and IBC on DNA end resection support a model in which BKC increases RS in cancer cells by inhibiting bulk DNA synthesis, so increasing the rate of replication fork arrest/collapse and inducing RS-dependent DSBs, and IBC inhibits HR-mediated DSB repair, resulting in cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This model explains why BKC and IBC synergistically inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells: BKC-mediated RS adds to oncogene-induced RS, explaining the differential sensitivity of normal and cancer cells to the combination of BKC and IBC, and also to the effects of IBC alone.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of the synergistic action of bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC) that kills cancer cells.</title><p>By inhibiting the DNA polymerases, BKC enhances the endogenous replication stress (RS) in cancer cells, leading to increased DNA damage. IBC specifically inhibits CHK2 to prevent DNA repair. The combined use of BKC and IBC enhances DNA damage to a level that triggers cancer cell death.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104718-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In conclusion, our screening of traditional herbal medicine for novel combinations of small-molecule inhibitors identified two compounds, BKC and IBC, acting synergistically to block cancer cell growth in different in vitro and in vivo contexts. Although it is unlikely that these compounds will ever be used in combination therapies, our results indicate that IBC or other clinically approved CHK2 inhibitors could be used to potentiate the cytotoxic effect of known DNA damaging agents. This view is supported by our data showing that IBC potentiates the effect of etoposide, doxorubicin, or 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide on drug-resistant lymphoma cell lines. Finally, recent evidence indicates that RS and DNA damage stimulate anti-tumor immunity by activating cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chabanon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tarsounas and Sung, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Técher and Pasero, 2021</xref>). New combinations of genotoxic agents and inhibitors targeting RS checkpoint kinases might thus be valuable also for potentiating immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Immortalized BJ fibroblasts</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dr. D.

In order to construct human polymerase delta and epsilon protein models, we carried out homology modeling using yeast polymerase delta (PDB code 3IAY) and epsilon from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (PDB code 4M8O) as templates, respectively. Similarly, to investigate the interaction between checkpoint kinase and IBC, IBC was docked into the active site of CHK1 (PDB code 5F4N) and CHK2 (PDB code 4BDK). The crystal structures of DNA polymerase and checkpoint kinase were downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank. The proteins and compound atoms were applied with CHARMm force field.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Animal study</title><p>Female NOD/SCID mice were National Laboratory Animal Center, Taiwan. All mice had free access to chow and water, and were housed at 21–23°C with 12 hr light–12 hr dark cycles. All mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (protocol no. 10-12-097). To generate MCF tumor-bearing mice, MCF-7/Luc cells (1 × 10<sup>4</sup>) were subcutaneously inoculated into the fat pad of the mice as published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuo et al., 2017</xref>). Eight groups of the mice received an intraperitoneal injection of PBS (Ctl), Taxol (5 mg/kg), IBC (0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg), BKC (1 and 5 mg/kg), and a combination of IBC and BKC (0.3 mg/kg IBC + 1 mg/kg BKC and 1.5 mg/kg IBC + 5 mg/kg BKC), thrice a week, from days 2 to 30 after tumor graft. The mice were daily measured for survival rate. Their tumor growth was weekly monitored using the IVIS system (Xenogen, USA). The signal of the bioluminescence from mice was quantified using Living Image 2.5 (Xenogen) as photons/s/region of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>Tumors were removed from mice 28 days post tumor inoculation. The tumors were fixed, dehydrated, and embedded into paraffin. The tumor sections were stained with the antibody against Ki67, p-CHK1, and p-CHK2 and TUNEL kits. The signal of the sections was visualized and quantified using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mice were handled in accordance with the guidelines laid out by the Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care and Utilization Committee (Protocol No. 10-12-097).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-104718-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files; source data files have been provided for Figures 2–5.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Técher, D Gopaul, and B Pardo for comments on the manuscript and C Featherstone (Plume Scientific Communication Services) for professional editing.

These compounds have been previously shown to affect different cellular pathways and the authors use transformed cancer cells of different origins and a non-transformed cell line to question if their combination is toxic in cancer versus non-cancer cells. They propose that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases while IBC targets CHK2. Their results show that both compounds do affect DNA replication, inducing replication stress and affecting double strand break repair. They also show that their combined use increases their toxicity in a synergistic manner.</p><p>Comments on current version:</p><p>The authors have addressed the main questions raised in the original manuscript. The new data provide stronger evidence supporting the inhibition of DNA polymerases by BKC and the effect of IBC on CHK2. In addition, the new data provides information about the potential mechanism of action of IBC in cells and xenograft models. Together, the revised manuscript has notably increased the relevance and impact of the results with stronger conclusions and better controlled experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.104718.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript: &quot;Synergistic effect of inhibiting CHK2 and DNA replication on cancer cell growth&quot; successfully demonstrates that the compounds BKC and IBC found in Psoralea corylifolia act synergistically to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, using a wide range of well-chosen methodologies. Moreover, the authors characterized the mechanisms of action of both drugs, which result in inhibition of cell proliferation. The use of multiple cell lines and the mice models makes the study robust and complete.</p><p>Significance:</p><p>The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field. Although the inhibitors described have been known in science, the authors present convincingly their mode of action, which is either better characterized (for BKC) or inhibiting a different than previously suggested enzyme (for IBC). Authors also nicely pinpoint and explain the narrow window of concentrations when these two compounds act synergistically rather than additively. The analyses in multiple cell lines, mouse models and in combination with other cancer treatments, make this study of interest not only for fundamental researchers but also for translational scientists and industry.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>(1) General Statements</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank all three reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions. We also thank reviewers #2 and #3 for considering our work to be timely and of interest to the field, not only for basic researchers, but also for translational scientists and industry. We are now providing additional results to further support our hypothesis and hope that all reviewers will find that our manuscript is now ready for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>(2) Point-by-point description of the revisions</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</bold></p><p>The manuscript by Coquel et al. investigates the effects of BKC and IBC, two compounds found in Psoralea corylifolia in DNA replication and the response to DNA damage, and explores their potential use in cancer treatment. These compounds have been previously shown to affect different cellular pathways and the authors use transformed cancer cells of different origins and a non-transformed cell line to question if their combination is toxic in cancer versus non-cancer cells. They propose that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases while IBC targets CHK2. Their results show that both compounds do affect DNA replication, inducing replication stress and affecting double strand break repair. They also show that their combined use increases their toxicity in a synergistic manner.</p><p>However, there are some major conclusions that are still not very well supported by the data: first, the differential effect on cancer and non-transformed cells; second, the direct link of BKC to the inhibition of DNA polymerases; and third, it is unclear if CHK2 is the relevant target for IBC in this context.</p><p>Regarding these points the authors should address the following issues:</p><p>(1) Most of the experiments use BJ fibroblasts as a control cell line. In order to evaluate if these compounds are preferentially toxic for cancer cells, the use of more than one non-transformed cell line is necessary. In addition, BJ cells are fibroblasts while most of the cancer cell lines employed are of epithelial origin. The authors could use MCF10 and RPE cells (both of epithelial origin) as control cell lines to complement the results and better support this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now monitored the effect of IBC and BKC on the proliferation of MCF-7, MCF-10A and RPE-1 cells using the WST-1 assay and obtained similar results as for BJ and MCF-7 cells. These results are now included in the revised manuscript as Fig. S1A and S1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In order to explore what are the targets of BKC and IBC Cellular Thermal Shift Assays (CETSA) could be used. Either by doing an unbiased mass spectrometry analysis of proteins stabilized by these compounds or by a direct analysis of candidate proteins by western blot (a similar approach has been used for IBC to show that it inhibits SIRT2 in Ren et al., 2024 Phytotherapy Res).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this Reviewer for suggesting the use of the CETSA assay. We have now performed CETSA on MCF-7 cells and found that IBC stabilizes CHK2 but not CHK1, to the same extent as the commercial CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 used here as a positive control. These results are now shown in new Fig. 4G and 4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For BKC in vitro polymerase assays could be carried out to show the direct inhibition of the DNA polymerase delta, for instance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used high-speed <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts to replicate ssDNA in vitro (Fig. S2C). This assay differs from the in vitro replication assay using low-speed <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Fig. 2H) in that it only monitors elongation by replicative DNA polymerases (Pol δ and ε) and not earlier steps such as origin licensing and activation. The combined use of both low-speed and highspeed extracts strongly supports the view that BKC inhibits replicative DNA polymerases.</p><p>To confirm this result, we have also used CETSA to monitor BKC binding to different subunits of DNA Polδ and Polε in MCF-7 cells and in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts (Fig. 3C-D Fig. S3). We found that BKC binds POLD1 and POLE, the catalytic subunits of Pol δ and ε respectively, but not the accessory subunit POLD3 nor PCNA. Together with our docking results and DNA fiber experiments, these data strongly support the view that BKC is a potent inhibitor of DNA Polδ and Polδ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In addition, the authors could analyze the integrity of replication forks by PCNA immunofluorescence analysis. The colocalization of PCNA and POLD or POLE subunits could also support the role of DNA polymerases as targets of BKC.</p></disp-quote><p>Our molecular docking results also show that BKC occupies the catalytic sites of DNA Pol δ and ε, which may not affect their subcellular localization and/or PCNA binding. Since our DNA replication assays, CETSA and DNA fiber analyses strongly support the view that BKC inhibits replicative DNA polymerases, we have not performed this additional experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In the case of IBC and the inhibition of CHK2, the authors should check the effect of IBC on the phosphorylation of BRCA1 on S988. The changes in CHK2 phosphorylation in Figure 3B are not convincing. The experiment should be repeated and the average of at least three experiments needs to be quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide evidence that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation on S988. Western blots and quantification for three biological replicates are shown in Fig. 4C and Fig. S4H. Densitometric quantification of CHK2 phosphorylation on S516 from 3 biological replicates, along with statistical analysis, is now shown in Fig. S4G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) To prove that CHK2 is the relevant target for IBC the authors could test if ATM and CHK2 knockout cells are more resistant to this compound, since it would prevent the phosphorylation of CHK2.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed siRNA transfection targeting CHK2. The transfected cells died after 72 hours in culture, so we have been unable to determine whether CHK2-KD cells have increased resistance to IBC.</p><p>In addition to these experiments, I would suggest some other major improvements in the manuscript:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) The concentration of both compounds should be provided in molar units throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out, we now use molar units throughout the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors do not clearly indicate the concentration that is employed in the different experiments, making it difficult to assess the results. For instance, Figure 2 does not include the concentration in the legend or in the text. Time and concentration need to be clearly shown for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>The experimental conditions and inhibitor concentrations are now clearly indicated for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Some experiments are only repeated once (fiber assays) or twice (cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry). These experiments need to be repeated 3 times and the proper statistical analysis performed (comparison of the medians).</p></disp-quote><p>Superplots with biological replicates for all DNA fiber assays are now displayed. The number of biological replicates is now indicated in the legends and appropriate statistical analyses are used.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor points or suggestions:</p><p>(1) Analyzing fork asymmetry would further support the direct effect of BKC on DNA polymerases.</p></disp-quote><p>The effect of BKC on fork asymmetry is now shown in Fig. 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) A dose dependent analysis of BKC on the speed of DNA replication would also support this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Superplots of DNA fiber assays showing the effect of different concentrations of BKC on fork speed from three biological replicates are now included in Fig. 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Page 7: BKC reduces fork speed ...two-fold. This sentence is not very clear, it would be better to say that speed is half of the control.</p></disp-quote><p>This sentence was changed to “BKC reduced fork speed by a factor of two relative to untreated cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4G and S4D show contradictory results regarding the induction of Rad51 foci by IBC treatment. This needs to be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 4G and S4D (now Fig. 5G and S5D) do not show contradictory results. In both cases, IBC treatment impaired the induction of RAD51 foci by IR or bleomycin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Page 12, Figure S5C is called for but it does not exist (probably meaning Figure S5B).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this error, which has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Significance):</bold></p><p>The work by Coquel et al. aims at elucidating the use of BKC and IBC as a combined therapy to induce cell death in cancer cells by targeting DNA replication and CHK2. Both BKC and IBC have been previously shown to affect the proliferation of cancer cells. BKC has been shown to induce S phase arrest in an ATR dependent manner in MCF7 cells (Li et al., 2016 Front Pharm), while IBC induces cell death in MDA-MB-231 cells (Wu et al., 2022 Molecules). In this regard, the more interesting contribution of the manuscript is the potential identification of the targets of these compounds in cancer cells. The inhibition of CHK2 by IBC is quite compelling although it needs to be further proven. In contrast, the hypothesis that BKC inhibits DNA polymerases remains highly speculative. The results offer a limited advance in the knowledge of the mechanism of action of these two compounds. Focusing on the action of IBC on CHK2 would increase the impact of the results. In this sense a very recent report has been published showing that IBC inhibits SIRT2 (Ren et al., 2024 Phyto Res), showing that IBC can affect multiple enzymes and processes. This should be taken into account for a further analysis of its mechanism of action.</p><p>In addition to the identification of the targets of BKC and IBC, the authors also focus on their combination for cancer treatment. This is based on the idea that blocking the DSB repair and inducing replication stress at the same time is an efficient approach to induce cancer cell death. This is not a new concept, since the loss of ATM sensitizes cancer cells to the inhibition of the replication stress response and several combination therapies have been put forward with the idea of generating replication stress and preventing the subsequent repair of the double strand breaks induced in these cells. Thus, the novelty here is limited, especially considering that the effect of BKC on DNA replication has already been described. Further, since its mechanism of action is unclear, it is difficult to ascribe the observed synergy to the speculated hypothesis. A deeper analysis of IBC as a CHK2 inhibitor would be more interesting, and the potential combination with other chemotherapy agents such as replication stress inhibitors, HU or DNA damaging agents. Also, the lack of a good control of non-transformed cells also reduces the relevance of the work.</p><p>In its current state, the interest of the manuscript is limited. The mechanistical advance is not strong enough and is not completely supported by the data, and the use of these compounds as a combination therapy does not provide new insights in cancer treatment. In my opinion, focusing on the inhibition of CHK2 by IBC and its potential use would broaden the impact of the results beyond the mere analysis of the action of these compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for his/her constructive and insightful comments. We have followed his/her advice and focused our analysis on the action of IBC on CHK2. Using CETSA, we confirmed that IBC binds CHK2 to the same extent as BML-277 inhibitor, but does not bind CHK1. We also show that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation on S988 and CHK2 phosphorylation on S516. Together with the results presented in the initial version of the manuscript, these data support the view that CHK2 is a key IBC target. We have also applied CETSA to DNA polymerases and confirmed that BKC directly targets DNA Polδ and ε. Although it is unlikely that IBC and BKC will ever be used in combination therapies, the synergistic effect that we measured on cancer cells in vivo and in vitro indicates that IBC sensitizes cancer cells to endogenous replication stress and to exogenous sources of DNA damage, which could be used to replace BKC in combination therapies. For instance, our data indicate that IBC can be used in combination with drugs such as etoposide, doxorubicin or cyclophosphamide to potentiate their effect on drug-resistant lymphoma cell lines (DLBCL). As requested by this Reviewer, we have modified the discussion section to put more emphasis on IBC and CHK2 inhibitors and we hope that he/she will now find this revised version suitable for publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p><p>In the manuscript by Coquel et al., the authors report their findings on the effect of 2 natural compounds from Psoralea corylofolia plant extracts on cancer cells. They show that these compounds, bakuchiol (BKC) and isobavachalcone (IBC), inhibit proliferation of cancer cells and tumor development in xenografted mice, particularly when used in combination. They further show that BKC inhibited DNA polymerases and induced replication stress, and show evidence that IBC inhibits Chk2 kinase activity and downstream double-strand break repair. Based on their findings, the authors conclude that Chk2 inhibition and DNA replication inhibition represent a potential synergistic strategy to selecting target cancer cells.</p><p>Major:</p><p>(1) The data showing IBC is a Chk2 inhibitor is weak and more rigorous investigation is needed to establish this compound as a Chk2 inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicate in our response to Reviewer #1, we have now analyzed the binding of IBC to CHK2 using the Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) in MCF-7 cells. Our data clearly show that IBC binds to CHK2 but not CHK1. These results are now shown in Fig. 4G and 4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For one, the authors mention they screened 43 cell cycle-related kinases in vitro, but only show data for 8 kinases in their kinase activity screens. Of these 8 kinases, Chk2 is the most strongly inhibited, but there are no data shown for the other 35 kinases.</p></disp-quote><p>Data for all the protein kinases tested in the in vitro assay are now presented in Fig. S4D and S4E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, the purpose of the CHK2 mutants should be discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>The CHK2(I157T) mutation is linked to an increased risk of breast and colorectal cancers. CHK2(R145W) is associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. Both mutations do not affect the basal kinase activity of CHK2. This information is now indicated in the legend of Fig. S4D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Secondly, the western blot in Fig 3B, appears to show a very modest effect of IBC on Chk2 autophosphorylation and not that different from the effect of IBC on Akt phosphorylation in Fig S3a. Yet, the authors claim that IBC inhibits Chk2 but not Akt. To strengthen these blots, a known Chk2 inhibitor, such as the one shown in Fig 4 (BML-277) should be included as a positive control for pChk2 similarly to what was shown for Akt with MK-2206.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now replaced the western blot in Fig. 3B (now Fig. 4B) with another biological replicate. Quantifications and statistical analyses of biological replicates are shown in Fig. S4G. Overall, we observed a 50% reduction of CHK2 auto-phosphorylation in MCF7 cells treated with IBC, and a 20% reduction in AKT phosphorylation (Fig. S4A). There was no additional reduction in AKT phosphorylation when cells were treated with IBC in combination with MK-2206, compared to cells treated with MK-2206 alone. We now include the CHK2 inhibitor BML-277 as a positive control alongside with IBC to monitor CHK2 and CHK1 auto-phosphorylation in Fig. 4B, S4G, 4D and S4I, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Western blots showing a loss of phosphorylation of additional Chk2 targets is also needed. The manuscript mentions Brca1 S988 as a Chk2 substrate important for DSB repair. Showing the effect of IBC on this phosphorylation site would strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide evidence that IBC inhibits BRCA1 phosphorylation at S988. Western blots and quantification for three biological replicates are shown in Fig. 4C and S4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors claim that the combination of IBC and BKC inhibit cell growth in a synergistic manner and that the &quot;effect is more pronounce on cancer cells than on non-cancer cells.&quot; However, only 1 non-malignant cell line was used, and it was a fibroblast line. To make this claim, the authors need to show the effect in additional non-malignant cells, preferably with epithelial cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now monitored cell proliferation using the WST-1 assay in two additional non-malignant cell lines, namely MCF-10A and RPE-1 cells. Cells were treated with IBC/BKC and their growth was compared to that of MCF-7 cells. These experiments yielded similar results to those obtained with BJ fibroblasts. These new data are now included in the revised version as Fig. S1A and S1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) Densitometry data for all western blots should be shown with mean+/- stdev of independent western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>Densitometry data for all western blots with biological replicates are now shown in supplementary figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 1B the statistical test used to analyze cell number was not stated.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical test is now indicated in Fig. 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 2A, the DAPI image for BKC is the merged image and should be replaced with just DAPI.</p></disp-quote><p>This error has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 2B, the y-axis label says &quot;yH2AX foci (MFI)&quot;. MFI and foci are not the same thing, and for yH2AX, the signal is often not focal. MFI of yH2AX is an appropriate measurement for replication stress, it's just not appropriate to equate MFI to foci.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this labeling error, which has now been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) For the 53BP1 MFI and Rad51 MFI shown in Fig 4 and Fig S4, it is more appropriate to show the number of foci/cell as these are better indicators of breaks and repair sites. MFI is influenced by expression levels of the proteins and not necessarily the break/repair.</p></disp-quote><p>The numbers of 53BP1 and RAD51 foci are now shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The data in Figures 5B and 5C are very difficult to read. Perhaps color-coat the lines/symbols.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now colored the graph to increase its readability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Significance):</bold></p><p>The findings reported in this manuscript are timely, of interest to the field, and are mostly wellsupported by the experimental data. However, there are a few concerns that need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #2 for his positive assessment of our manuscript. We hope that we have adequately addressed all of his/her specific concerns and that he/she will agree with the need to put more emphasis on IBC and CHK2 inhibition as requested by Reviewer #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity):</bold></p><p>The manuscript: &quot;Synergistic effect of inhibiting CHK2 and DNA replication on cancer cell growth&quot; successfully demonstrates that the compounds BKC and IBC found in Psoralea corylifolia act synergistically to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, using a wide range of well-chosen methodologies. Moreover, the authors characterized the mechanisms of action of both drugs, which result in inhibition of cell proliferation. The use of multiple cell lines and the mice models makes the study robust and complete. The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field.</p><p>A few suggestions to improve the study:</p><p>(1) Given that both compounds BKC and IBC have already been previously described in the literature, it would be helpful for the reader to have them described better at the beginning of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have now better described BKC and IBC at the beginning of the results section, as well as in the discussion. We agree that this could be helpful to readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Addition of western blot quantifications over the number of experimental repeats is important specifically for Fig. 2C and Fig. 3C where partial effect of treatment on a signal level is reported.</p></disp-quote><p>The densitometry analysis of data shown in Fig. 2C and biological replicates are now shown in Fig. S2B. Quantification for Fig. 3C (now Fig. 4D) is shown in Fig. S4I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The quantification of mean intensity for 53BP1 and RAD51 foci should be exchanged with the quantification of number of foci per cell. While the quantification of gH2AX signal intensity is a correct representation of induction of this signal upon damage, foci formed by protein recruitment to DNA damage sites should be quantified by counting the number of foci, rather than signal in the whole cell/nucleus. These proteins exist before damage and are re-located in response to the damage.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of 53BP1 and RAD51 foci is now expressed as the number of foci per cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Materials &amp; Methods section is missing the methods for the experiment described in Fig. 1B. In summary, after addressing our few concerns, we believe the manuscript should be accepted for publication.</p></disp-quote><p>The WST-1 assay used for cell number quantification is included in “Reagents” in Material &amp; Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Significance):</bold></p><p>The manuscript presents a well written study that offers new insights and contributions to the field. Although the inhibitors described have been known in science, the authors present convincingly their mode of action, which is either better characterized (for BKC) or inhibiting a different than previously suggested enzyme (for IBC). Authors also nicely pinpoint and explain the narrow window of concentrations when these two compounds act synergistically rather than additively. The analyses in multiple cell lines, mouse models and in combination with other cancer treatments, makes this study of interest not only for fundamental researchers but also for translational scientists and industry.</p><p>My field of expertise: DNA replication and replication stress across model systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer #3 for his/her very positive assessment of our work and we hope that he/she will find this revised version suitable for publication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
