We have generated mice with the systemic inducible <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout on the background of <italic>Cdk19</italic> constitutive knockout. <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> double knockout (iDKO) males, but not single <italic>Cdk8</italic> or <italic>Cdk19</italic> KO, had an atrophic reproductive system and were infertile. The iDKO males lacked postmeiotic spermatids and spermatocytes after meiosis I pachytene. Testosterone levels were decreased whereas the amounts of the luteinizing hormone were unchanged. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed marked differences in the expression of steroidogenic genes (such as <italic>Cyp17a1, Star,</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic>) in Leydig cells concomitant with alterations in Sertoli cells and spermatocytes, and were likely associated with an impaired synthesis of steroids. <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic> were also downregulated in cultured Leydig cells after iDKO. The treatment of primary Leydig cell culture with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not induce the same changes in gene expression as iDKO, and a prolonged treatment of mice with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not affect the size of testes. iDKO, in contrast to the single knockouts or treatment with a CDK8/19 kinase inhibitor, led to depletion of cyclin C (CCNC), the binding partner of CDK8/19 that has been implicated in CDK8/19-independent functions. This suggests that the observed phenotype was likely mediated through kinase-independent activities of CDK8/19, such as CCNC stabilization.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CDK8</kwd><kwd>CDK19</kwd><kwd>Spermatogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006769</institution-id><institution>Russian Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>22-15-00227</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruter</surname><given-names>Alexandra V</given-names></name><name><surname>Varlamova</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name><name><surname>Stavskaya</surname><given-names>Nina I</given-names></name><name><surname>Khamidullina</surname><given-names>Alvina I</given-names></name><name><surname>Shtil</surname><given-names>Alexander A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tatarskiy</surname><given-names>Victor V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012190</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>075-15-2019-1661</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruter</surname><given-names>Alexandra V</given-names></name><name><surname>Varlamova</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name><name><surname>Tvorogova</surname><given-names>Anna V</given-names></name><name><surname>Korshunova</surname><given-names>Diana S</given-names></name><name><surname>Baikova</surname><given-names>Iuliia P</given-names></name><name><surname>Silaeva</surname><given-names>Yulia Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Tatarskiy</surname><given-names>Victor V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Knockout of CDK8/19, but not its inhibition, impairs spermatogenesis by reducing steroid production in Leydig cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple protein complexes regulate transcription in response to developmental cues, changes in the environment, damage, and other factors, allowing for precise control of gene expression. Among such complexes, the multiprotein Mediator complex is especially important for controlling transcription, regulated by a multitude of signaling pathways through their transcription factors (TFs). The Mediator complex bridges the regulatory enhancer regions with promoters, thereby recruiting RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) and the preinitiation complex. The Mediator possesses its own regulatory subpart – the cyclin-dependent kinase module (CKM), containing either the CDK8 or the CDK19 protein kinases, in a complex with their binding partner, cyclin C (CCNC), as well as proteins MED12 and MED13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>). While CKM is a nuclear complex that regulates transcription, both CCNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ježek et al., 2019</xref>) and MED12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) were shown to have CKM-independent cytoplasmic activities. The CDK8/19 kinase activity positively regulates transcription induced by different signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), at least in part by mediating the RNA Pol II release from pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>). Besides, CDK8 and CDK19 directly phosphorylate a number of transcription factors such as STATs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Fabregas et al., 2020</xref>), SMADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alarcón et al., 2009</xref>), and others, thereby modulating transcription of cognate genes. The CDK8/19 kinase activity also negatively regulates transcription, at least in part, through downregulating the protein levels of all the components of the Mediator and CKM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Despite important CDK8/19 functions discovered in primary cell culture and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luyties and Taatjes, 2022</xref>), the insights gained from in vivo models are limited. Mice with constitutively knocked out <italic>Cdk19</italic> (CDK19 KO) were generated as a part of the COMP project and are basically asymptomatic, fertile, and have a normal lifespan. It has been shown recently that <italic>Cdk19</italic><sup>-/-</sup> Lin<sup>-</sup> hematopoietic stem cells divide slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), however, the blood cell count was unaffected. Heterozygous mice with a constitutive <italic>Cdk8</italic> inducible knockout (CDK8 iKO) were asymptomatic but, when crossed, no homozygous pups were born (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Postlmayr et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westerling et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, conditional CDK8 iKO is almost asymptomatic in adult mice. Minor differences were observed in colon epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dannappel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Prieto et al., 2023</xref>) and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamada et al., 2022</xref>) after tissue-specific <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout. Although two CDK8/19 inhibitors were reported to have systemic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2016</xref>), this toxicity was subsequently found to be due to off-target effects of these inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and several CDK8/19 inhibitors have reached clinical trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">https://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> NCT03065010, NCT04021368, NCT05052255, NCT05300438). Several studies reported the existence of kinase-independent phenotypic activities for both CDK8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menzl et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kapoor et al., 2010</xref>) and CDK19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Audetat et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Steinparzer et al., 2019</xref>), but the only known biochemical activity of both CDK8 and CDK19 that is kinase-independent is the stabilization of their binding partner CCNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barette et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Targeted degradation or knockout of both CDK8 and CDK19 dramatically reduces the cellular levels of CCNC, whereas the knockout of either <italic>Cdk8</italic> or <italic>Cdk19</italic> alone has little effect on the CCNC levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). The effects of double knockout of both <italic>Cdk8</italic> and <italic>Cdk19</italic> on CCNC should, therefore, be considered in interpreting the effect of the double knockout.</p><p>We have now generated mice with a conditional knockout of the <italic>Cdk8</italic> gene on the constitutive <italic>Cdk19</italic> KO background (CDK8/19 inducible double knockout, iDKO). We have found that iDKO males were completely infertile and had an undersized and dedifferentiated reproductive system. In iDKO males, spermatogenesis was blocked after pachytene of meiosis I. iDKO showed down-regulation of key steroid pathway genes, such as <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Lcn2</italic>, <italic>Sc5d</italic>, <italic>Fads2,</italic> and reduced production of testosterone. Expression of key meiotic genes was also deregulated in meiosis I spermatocytes, and the progression of meiosis was halted.

The CDK19 KO group showed slightly reduced fertility: 32 pups along with an increased number of the plugs (16) probably caused by the lower rate of pregnancy onset. Surprisingly, only two plugs and no pups were observed in the CDK8 iKO group despite normal appearance and behavior of males. Neither plugs nor pups were detectable in the iDKO cohort (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Cells at the postmeiotic stages of spermatogenesis were completely absent. Among the spermatocytes, there were only early prophase cells. In contrast, we detected an increased number of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, in these mice the spermatogenesis progenitor cells were present but their differentiation and/or meiosis was blocked. In Sertoli cells, the vacuoles are the sign of the loss of contact between these cells and spermatogenic elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Leydig cells were significantly smaller and were almost depleted of secretory vacuoles suggesting the lack of hormonal activity. The epididymis contained empty tubules; the epithelium appeared undifferentiated, that is, neither typical borders between epithelial cells nor clear Golgi zone were visible. The prostate and the epididymis were also atrophic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These changes were detectable from 2 wk after tamoxifen treatment and persisted for at least 6 m (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, surprisingly they were not observed in CDK8 iKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), which despite showing no microscopic changes, fathered no offspring and had no apparent sexual behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CDK8/19 distribution in testes</title><p>Spermatogenesis failure in iDKO can be caused both by events in testes and extratesticular regulation. Internal events require expression of CDK8/19 at least in some testicular cells and an efficient KO of CDK8, which was not achieved in the female reproductive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilchuk et al., 2022</xref>). Both CDK8 and CDK19 were present in testes and knockout was efficient after 7 d of daily treatment with 3 mg of tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We have also analyzed the levels of the CDK8/19 binding partner CCNC after single and double KOs in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and in mouse testes after iDKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In agreement with the previous observations in human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), CCNC was present if either CDK8 or CDK19 were present, but undetectable in the iDKO embryonic fibroblasts, as well as in iDKO testes. As CDK8 and CDK19 functions are considered to significantly overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), it is possible that in the absence of one of the proteins the level of the other will increase, obscuring a possible single KO phenotype. Indeed, we observed such a compensation for MEFs, but not for testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicating tissue specificity of this mechanism. Decrease in the phosphorylation of STAT1 serine 727 is often used as CDK8/19 inhibition marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rzymski et al., 2017</xref>) despite the fact that different kinases can phosphorylate it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). However, pSTAT1 727 level was not decreased in single or double KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicating that pSTAT1 727 is not a suitable marker of CDK8/19 kinase activity.</p><p>Different testicular cell types contribute to the successful spermatogenesis and little is known about CDK8/19 expression in each type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCleland et al., 2015</xref> performed IHC on different tissues and found CDK8 only in spermatogonia of all testicular cell types. Our IHC analysis showed that CDK8 and CDK19 are present in several types of testicular cells, including Leydig cells, and cells inside the tubule. Interestingly, CDK8 and CDK19 appear to be expressed in different types of cells in the seminiferous tubules, with CDK8 mostly expressed in the periphery of the tubule and in lower levels in the center of the tubule, while CDK19 was mostly expressed in the center of the tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also used flow cytometry to identify cell types expressing CDK8/19. To detect cells with the expression of at least one kinase we used anti-CCNC antibodies. In wild-type male mice, CDK8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>) and CCNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>) positive cells were detected among 1 n (round, but not elongated spermatids), 2 n and 4 n cells, indicating their role at all spermatogenesis stages. In agreement with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>) report, all c-Kit<sup>+</sup> cells were positive for CCNC and CDK8, but other 2 n/4 n c-Kit negative cells were also positive for both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spermatogenic cells of iDKO mice are unable to advance through meiosis I prophase</title><p>To obtain a quantitative spermatogenesis pattern, we performed cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. We examined wild-type, single KOs, and iDKO animals sacrificed 2 mo after tamoxifen treatment. Cell cycle analysis revealed striking differences in iDKO mice, with a disappearance of elongated spermatids, almost all round spermatids, and massive cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). All other groups had the same normal cell distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Noticeably, the 4 n population and cells in the S-phase were not affected by iDKO, indicating that iDKO spermatogonia successfully entered meiosis but could not produce haploid spermatids. This ongoing ‘meiotic catastrophe’ led to an almost full depopulation of the testes in iDKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Due to fast transition from meiosis I to meiosis II, it is difficult to detect secondary spermatocytes by flow cytometry. To specify the stage of CDK8/19-dependent spermatogenesis failure, we performed phospho-γH2A.X and SYCP3 immunofluorescent staining of seminiferous tubules. Phospho-γH2A.X is a DNA damage marker which marks double-strand breaks in leptotene, zygotene, and sex chromosomes during the pachytene. SYCP3 is a component of the synaptonemal complex, expressed during meiosis I prophase, which forms distinct patterns in the late zygotene/pachytene. In the wild-type tubules, all the meiotic stages were visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). At the same time, almost all meiotic cells in iDKO were blocked in the pachytene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating that iDKO cells enter meiosis but cannot traverse through meiosis I prophase and subsequently undergo cell death.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Absence of postmeiotic 1 n cells in inducible double knockout (iDKO) 2 mo after KO induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distinctive histograms of wild-type (left) and iDKO (right) mice.

The enzymatic components of the Mediator-associated CKM module – CDK8 and its paralog CDK19, have emerged as co-regulators in several signal-activated transcriptional pathways, such as Wnt, TGF-beta, androgen and estrogen signaling, STATs, response to serum growth factors, and others (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Menzl et al., 2019a</xref>). Despite that, the knockout of <italic>Cdk8</italic> is only critical in embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Westerling et al., 2007</xref>), with no phenotype in adult organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCleland et al., 2015</xref>), while <italic>CDK19</italic> is wholly dispensable. The same tendency is observed for the knockout of MED subunits and other CKM proteins: constitutive KOs are often embryonically lethal (except for MED12L, a paralog of MED12), while tissue-specific knockouts of these genes in adult animals rarely have a severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ilchuk et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Hypothetically, CDK8 and CDK19 can compensate for each other in KO animals and mitigate the phenotype in single KOs. To confirm this, we produced the first ubiquitous knockout of <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> in 2-mo-old animals. In addition to the specific phenotype described here, the analysis of tissues from the knockout animals provided the first in vivo confirmation of two key molecular observations on the general CDK8/19 activities that were previously described only in vitro and that are not yet widely understood as potential caveats in CDK8/19 studies. The first observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>) is that the knockout of CDK8 and CDK19 leads to the loss of CCNC, in contrast to CDK8/19 kinase inhibition that actually increases the protein levels of CCNC. In the present study, we found that CCNC is depleted both in MEF and in the testes of iDKO mice. This finding underscores that CDK8/19 kinase inhibition may have very different phenotypic consequences from the knockout of these genes. The second finding was that STAT1 phosphorylation at serine 727, a widely used pharmacodynamic marker of CDK8/19 kinase activity, shows variable response to CDK8/19 inhibition, which depends on the cell type and the duration of CDK8/19 inhibitor treatment, and that it can be induced by different signals in a CDK8/19-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we found that the serine 727 phosphorylated STAT1 was undiminished (and possibly even increased) by <italic>Cdk8/19</italic> knockout in the testes of iDKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Hence, a reliance on STAT1 phosphorylation as a pharmacodynamic marker of CDK8/19 activity can be misleading.</p><p>Previously described animals with conditional knockout of <italic>Cdk8</italic> in the intestine on <italic>Cdk19<sup>-/-</sup></italic> background presented with a mild phenotype, moderately affecting the number of specialized secreting cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dannappel et al., 2022</xref>). This phenotype was confirmed by histological observations in our model. The most prominent phenotype in our iDKO mice, evidenced at the physiological, morphological, and molecular levels, was found in the testes, matching the finding that the testes express the highest levels of CDK8 and CDK19 RNA among all the normal human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2024</xref>). In particular, we observed the lack of haploid spermatids and mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>), with primary spermatocytes blocked in pachytene of meiosis I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). CDK8 and CDK19 were expressed in different types of testicular cells, putatively identified as spermatogonia (high expression), Leydig cells, and Sertoli cells, and spermatocytes (weak expression) for CDK8, and Sertoli cells and spermatocytes (high expression) for CDK19. CDK8 and CDK19 were co-localized in some cells, although a substantial part of individual cells with high expression of CDK8 had weaker CDK19 staining and vice versa or expressed just one paralog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We hypothesize that the specific CDK8/19 ratio can depend not only on the distinct cell type but also on the stage of the distinct tubule for the Leydig and Sertoli cells and on the precise meiotic stage for germ cells. Flow cytometry analysis also showed high levels of CDK8 and CCNC in 2 n, 4 n, and in some haploid round spermatids (but not elongated spermatids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-G, I-J</xref>). We also confirmed previous reports of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCleland et al., 2015</xref> identifying CDK8 expression in c-Kit +spermatogonia cells, but also showing expression of CDK8 and CCNC in other 2 n and 4 n c-Kit- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>). Surprisingly, CDK8 iKO males previously described as asymptomatic revealed their infertility due to the lack of sexual behavior, despite the absence of morphological changes in the urogenital system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As our results imply that fertility problems and spermatogenesis failure are caused by changes in the gene expression in the Leydig cells, it is important to mention that CDK8 is expressed in Leydig cells at a relatively high level, whereas CDK19 is also expressed but at a lower level. This corresponds well with the phenotype intensity: CDK19 KO has only decreased fertility, CDK8 iKO are infertile but without evident histological abnormalities, while iDKO exhibit complete spermatogenesis failure. This also corroborates the hypothesis of the CDK8 and CDK19 interchangeability.</p><p>Mice with <italic>Med1</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>/Vasa-Cre tissue-specific KO had an opposite phenotype to the one described here: prophase I passage was accelerated in these mice and spermatocytes entered zygotene/pachytene stage prematurely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huszar et al., 2015</xref>). The difference between these effects is quite interesting in the context of the concept that association with CKM attenuates Mediator-dependent transcription either by sterically preventing TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freitas et al., 2022</xref>), or by post-transcriptional regulation of Mediator complex subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Poss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).

A number of studies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ilchuk et al., 2023</xref>) affirm a significant role of Mediator complex in lipid metabolism and biosynthesis as one of the main cofactors for the key adipogenic TFs such as C/EBPα, PPARγ, and SREBP.</p><p>We detected a decrease in steroidogenic gene expression by scRNAseq (primarily <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>), and then confirmed this finding by WB, immunofluorescence, and direct testosterone measurement. This corresponds well with perturbed Leydig cells morphology (reduced size and secretory vacuoles depletion) and explains the observed atrophy of prostate and epididymis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It is worth mentioning that constitutive <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> knockout in mice leads to female phenotype in XY mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aherrahrou et al., 2020</xref>). Besides <italic>Cyp17a1</italic>, several other steroid metabolism-related genes were downregulated (<italic>Lcn</italic>, <italic>Fads</italic>, <italic>Star</italic>, <italic>Sc5d</italic>, <italic>Sult1e1</italic>). Interestingly, the main feature of <italic>Fads</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stoffel et al., 2008</xref> and <italic>Sult1e1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Song, 2007</xref>) KOs is male infertility, caused by spermatogenesis arrest.</p><p>There is substantial evidence that meiosis in spermatocytes depends on AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2022</xref>). Several papers established a connection between AR signaling, and the Mediator complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo et al., 2019</xref>). MED1 and MED19 directly interact with the AR and regulate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weber et al., 2021</xref>). Additional evidence of the role of the Mediator complex and CDK8/19 in the urogenital system comes from studies of their role in prostate cancer, where CDK19 is elevated together with the AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becker et al., 2020</xref>) and where CDK8/19 inhibition and MED12 knockdown partially inhibit the transcriptional AR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andolfi et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The iDKO has also dramatically impacted Sertoli cells. The SCARKO mice were engineered two decades ago and show morphological abnormalities (i.e. reduced testes, epididymis, and prostate, meiotic arrest during meiosis I prophase) similar to iDKO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Gendt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2004</xref>). The scRNAseq analysis used to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the meiotic arrest revealed a number of similarities with iDKO data for Sertoli cells, especially in terms of pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, genes associated with cytoskeleton, cellular membrane, and cell-cell contacts were enriched among the DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Nevertheless, the overlap of genes affected in the SCARKO and iDKO mice was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, an important difference between our model and SCARKO is that <italic>Cdk8</italic> knockout is induced after puberty. Another important consideration is that Sertoli cells are not the only cell type impacting spermatogenesis through AR signaling. AR signaling in peritubular myoid cells is also essential for successful spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Welsh et al., 2009</xref>). In this regard, probably a more relevant model for comparison with our results is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanton et al., 2012</xref>, where androgen signaling was suppressed in grown-up rats by low dose testosterone, or its combination with an AR antagonist. In that paper, the rats with the most complete inhibition of AR signaling displayed increased apoptosis in spermatocytes and full blockage of second meiotic division.</p><p>Just as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stanton et al., 2012</xref>, genes differentially expressed in spermatocytes blocked in prophase I can be divided into the following groups: (1) genes with known roles in meiosis, especially DNA synapse, homologous recombination, and DNA repair, (2) genes associated with cellular stress and apoptosis, and (3) genes with roles in RNA processing and splicing. Changes in the first group can be explained by the compensatory mechanisms and changes in the second group are in concordance with the observed extensive cell death of spermatocytes, whereas changes in the third group remain enigmatic.</p><p>Noteworthy, 99.2% of spermatocyte DEGs with |logFc|&gt;0.4 were upregulated genes, which is very similar to the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pelish et al., 2015</xref> and agrees with the negative regulation of the Mediator complex by CDK8/19 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Based on these results, we can conclude that iDKO causes perturbance in different testicular cell types: Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, and spermatocytes. We hypothesize that all these changes are caused by disruption of testosterone synthesis in Leydig cells, although, at this point, we cannot definitively prove that the affected genes are regulated by CDK8/19 directly. Data for other cell types are consistent with this hypothesis, however, there is still a possibility that CDK8/19/CCNC have distinct roles in other testicular cell types which are not visible against the background of the testosterone reduction. However, our data are not sufficient to make the conclusion about the role of CDK8/19/CCNC directly in meiosis, besides its hormonal regulation. To answer this question, definitive mouse strains with cell-type-specific iKO in Sertoli cells and meiotic spermatocytes would be needed.</p><p>The effects of iDKO on spermatogenesis were maximal at 1–2 mo after tamoxifen administration. At later time points, we detected partial restoration of spermatogenesis, and signs of re-differentiation of the epididymis and activity of secreting cells in the prostate. This restoration did not lead to the production of mature sperm, and the total number of haploid cells increased insignificantly. There are several possible explanations for such an effect. It is unlikely that restoration happened in cells that did not activate Cre-Lox, as the absence of CDK8 has been confirmed by us through PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, no restoration of CYP17A1 was found in 5-mo-old animals. There is a possibility that transcription of genes previously regulated by CDK8/19/CCNC was rewired through other transcriptional regulators. An intriguing possibility is activation of a compensatory AR-independent pathway that was recently shown in a zebrafish model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhai et al., 2022</xref>). An argument against such hypothesis would be the absence of such compensation in <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> KO animals or SCARKO mice, but in the former animals the male reproductive system does not develop at all, and in the latter, non-canonical AR signaling through Src kinase may lead to progression to round spermatid stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cooke and Walker, 2021</xref>).</p><p>The luteinizing hormone produced in the pituitary gland is a major regulator of steroidogenesis in Leydig cells. It was shown that LH regulates expression level of <italic>Cyp17a1</italic> and several other steroidogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2004</xref>). As CDK8 iKO in our model is ubiquitous, infertility could be caused by decrease of LH level due to improper regulation in the brain. However, we measured LH level in the serum and found it unaffected by single or double KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). That means that CDK8/19/CCNC are required for steroidogenic genes’ transcription in Leydig cells, although we cannot definitively prove that CDK8/19 directly regulates the affected genes. And indeed, in our ex vivo experiment with Leydig primary cell culture, even without addition of LH, expression of <italic>Star</italic> and <italic>Fads</italic> was downregulated upon in vitro induction of CDK8 iKO by hydroxytamoxifen on the CDK19 KO background.</p><p>Steroidogenesis decline could be related to the altered overall lipid metabolism and precursor deficiency. Several groups reported CDK8/19 role in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2022</xref>) and lipid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). However, contrary to this, we detected high levels of lipids in iDKO Leydig cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar effect was detected in StAR knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hasegawa et al., 2000</xref>), further confirming that downregulation of steroidogenic gene transcription is the primary cause of steroidogenesis failure in CDK8/19 mice.</p><p>The results of the present study reveal for the first time the role of CDK8/19/CCNC in the function of the male reproductive system. The key question regarding the results described here is whether the phenotypic effects are due to the inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity or to the loss of CCNC, which is protected by CDK8 and CDK19 from proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2023</xref>), or other kinase-independent functions of CDK8/19. Here, we show that CCNC essentially disappears both from the embryo fibroblasts and from the testes of the iDKO mice. Given the known CDK8/19-independent functions of CCNC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ježek et al., 2019</xref>), and the effect of <italic>CcnC</italic> knockout on lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Song et al., 2022</xref>), the likelihood of CCNC rather than CDK8/19 mediating the observed effects should be investigated. As we have shown, 30 d treatment of 11-wk-old mice with a potent CDK8/19 kinase inhibitor produced no anatomical changes in the testes, and previous reports examining CDK8/19 inhibitors did not produce similar effects. Furthermore, ex vivo treatment of Leydig cells with a CDK8/19 inhibitor did not reproduce the iDKO effect on gene expression, suggesting that the effects of iDKO were kinase-independent and possibly mediated by CCNC. A definitive answer to the role of CCNC <italic>vs</italic> CDK8/19 kinase activity will require a phenotypic comparison of iDKO mice with mice expressing kinase-inactive mutants of CDK8/19 or inducible CCNC knockout.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and conditional iDKO</title><p><italic>Cdk8<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> and ROSA26<italic><sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> (Jax:008463; B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm1(cre/ERT2)Tyj/J</sup>) provenance and genotyping procedures were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ilchuk et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>Cdk19</italic><sup>-/-</sup>, mutant mouse strain C57BL/6N-<italic>Cdk19<sup>em1(IMPC)J</sup></italic>/Mmucd was obtained from the MMRRC at UC Davis KOMP, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:MMRRC_047035-UCD">MMRRC_047035-UCD</ext-link>.</p><p>Mice were genotyped by real-time PCR using oligonucleotides listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>.

The physiological roles of these two kinases, CDK8 and CDK19, are currently rather poorly understood; although conserved in all eukaryotes, and among the most highly conserved kinases in vertebrates, individual knockouts of genes encoding CDK8 homologues in different species have revealed generally rather mild and specific effects, in contrast to Mediator itself. Here, the authors provide evidence that neither CDK8 nor CDK19 are required for adult homeostasis but they are functionally redundant for maintenance of reproductive tissue morphology and fertility in males.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The morphological data on atrophy of the male reproductive system and arrest of spermatocyte meiosis are solid and are reinforced by single cell transcriptomics data, which is a challenging technique to implement in vivo. The main findings are important and will be of interest to scientists in the fields of transcription and developmental biology.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There are several weaknesses.</p><p>The first is that data comparing general health of mice with single and double knockouts is not shown, and data on effects in other tissues are sparse and very preliminary. The only strong phenotype of double knockouts that is described is in the male reproductive system. Furthermore, data for the genitourinary system in single knockouts are very sparse; data are described for fertility in figure 1E, ploidy and cell number in figure 3B and C, plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels in figure 6C and 6D and morphology of testis and prostate tissue for single Cdk8 knockout in supplementary figure 1E (although in this case the images do not appear very comparable between control and CDK8 KO), but, for example, there is no analysis of different meiotic stages or of gene expression in single knockouts. Given that the authors have shown that CDK8 and CDK19 expression levels differ widely between different cell types, such an analysis would be interesting. This might have provided insight into the sterility of induced CDK8 knockout.</p><p>The second weakness is that the correlation between double knockout and reduced expression of genes involved in steroid hormone biosynthesis is hypothesized to be a causal mechanism for the phenotypes observed. While this is a possibility, there are no experiments performed to provide evidence that this is the case. Furthermore, there is no evidence shown that CDK8 and/or CDK19 are directly responsible for transcription of the genes concerned.</p><p>Finally, the authors propose that the phenotypes are independent of the kinase activity of CDK8 or CDK19 because treatment of mice for a month with an inhibitor does not recapitulate the effects of the knockout, and nor does expression of two steroidogenic genes change in cultured Leydig cells upon treatment with an inhibitor. However, there are no controls for effective target inhibition shown.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>This manuscript is slightly improved compared to the previous version, though it still does not address the weaknesses that were highlighted in the first version, which largely remain relevant. Please note the typo in the abstract (line 30) and the absence of response to the query of how many crypts and villi were counted in the experiment shown in Suppl Fig 1D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96465.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors tried to test the hypothesis that Cdk8 and Cdk19 stabilize the cytoplasmic CcNC protein, the partner protein of Mediator complex including CDK8/19 and Mediator protein via a kinase-independent function by generating induced double knockout of Cdk8/19. However the evidence presented suffer from a lack of focus and rigor and does not support their claims.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is the first comprehensive report on the effect of a double knockout of CDK8 and CDK19 in mice on male fertility, hormones and single cell testicular cellular expression. The inducible knockout mice led to male sterility with severe spermatogenic defects, and the authors attempted to use this animal model to test the kinase-independent function of CDK8/19, previously reported for human. Single cell RNA-seq of knockout testis presented a high resolution of molecular defects of all the major cell types in the testes of the inducible double knockout mice. The authors also have several interesting findings such as reentry into cell cycles by Sertoli cells, loss of Testosterone in induced DKO that could be investigated further.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The claim of reproductive defects in the induced double knockout of CDK8/19 resulted from the loss of CCNC via a kinase-independent mechanism is interesting but was not supported by the data presented. While the construction and analysis of the systemic induced knockout model of Cdk8 in Cdk19KO mice is not trivial, the analysis and data is weakened by systemic effect of Cdk8 loss, making it difficult to separate the systemic effect from the local testis effect.</p><p>The analysis of male sterile phenotype is also inadequate with poor image quality, especially testis HE sections. Male reproductive tract picture is also small and difficult to evaluate. The mice crossing scheme is unusual as you have three mice to cross to produce genotypes, while we could understand that it is possible to produce pups of desired genotypes with different mating schemes, such vague crossing scheme is not desirable and of poor genetics practice. Also using TAM treated wild type as control is ok, but a better control will be TAM treated ERT2-cre; CDK8f/f or TAM treated ERT2 Cre CDK19/19 KO, so as to minimize the impact from well-recognized effect of TAM.</p><p>While the authors proposed that the inducible loss of CDK8 in the CDK19 knockout background is responsible for spermatogenic defects, it was not clear in which cells CDK8/19 genes are interested and which cell types might have a major role in spermatogenesis. The authors also put forward the evidence that reduction/loss of Testosterone might be the main cause of spermatogenic defects, which is consistent with the expression change in genes involved in steroigenesis pathway in Leydig cells of inducible double knockout. But it is not clear how the loss of Testosterone contributed to the loss of CcnC protein.</p><p>The authors should clarify or present the data on where CDK8 and CDK19 as well as CcnC are expressed so as to help the readers to understand which tissues that both CDK might be functioning and cause the loss of CcnC. It should be easier to test the hypothesis of CDK8/19 stabilize CcnC protein using double knock out primary cells, instead of the whole testis.</p><p>Since CDK8KO and CDK19KO both have significantly reduced fertility in comparison with wildtype, it might be important to measure the sperm quantity and motility among CDK8 KO, CDK19KO and induced DKO to evaluate spermatogenesis based on their sperm production.</p><p>Some data for the inducible knockout efficiency of Cdk8 were presented in Supplemental figure 1, but there is no legend for the supplemental figures, it was not clear which band represented deletion band, which tissues were examined? Tail or testis? It seems that two months after the injection of Tam, all the Cdk8 were completely deleted, indicating extremely efficient deletion of Tam induction by two-month post administration. Were the complete deletion of Cdk8 happening even earlier ? an examination of timepoints of induced loss would be useful and instructional as to when is the best time to examine phenotypes.</p><p>The authors found that Sertoli cells re-entered cell cycle in the inducible double knockout but stop short of careful characterization other than increased expression of cell cycle genes.</p><p>Overall this work suffered from a lack of focus and rigor in the analysis and lack of sufficient evidence to support their main conclusions.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>This reviewer appreciated the authors' effort in improving the quality of this manuscript during their revision. While some concerns remain, the revision is a much improved work and the authors addressed most of my major concerns.</p><p>Figure 2E CDK8 and CDK19 immunofluorescent staining images seem to show CDK8 and CDK19 location are completely distinct and in different cells, the authors need to elaborate on this results and discuss what such a distinct location means in line of their double knockout data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96465.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bruter</surname><given-names>Alexandra V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Gene Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Varlamova</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Gene Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stavskaya</surname><given-names>Nina I</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute of Gene Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Antysheva</surname><given-names>Zoia G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Manskikh</surname><given-names>Vasily N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Lomonosov Moscow State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Moscow</named-content></addr-line><country>Russian Federation</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tvorogova</surname><given-names>Anna V</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>City Clinical Hospital Named After I.V.

I do not agree that it is not justified to perform experiments to investigate the sterility of single CDK8 knockout mice since this could be important and given that the new data show that while there is some overlap in expression of the two prologues, there are also significant differences in the testis. At the least, it would have been interesting and easy to do to show the expression of CDK8 and CDK19 in the single cell transcriptomics, since this might help to identify the different populations.</p></disp-quote><p>Certainly, we tried to analyse Cdk8/Cdk19 in single cell transcriptomics. However, we were unable to draw a clear conclusion. Due to a limited sensitivity of single cell sequencing, especially for low abundant transcripts, such as transcription factors (for 10x technology used in our study) (Chuang et al., 2024), it is challenging to establish with certainty CDK8/19 positive and -negative tissues from single cell data because both transcripts are minor. Nevertheless, the majority of cell types showed some expression of CDK8/19, with maximum expression in pachytene/diplotene spermatocytes. We do not include these data to the manuscript particularly as we were successful to assess Cdk8/19 expression patterns using IF approaches.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96465-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only definitive way of concluding a kinase-independent phenotype is to rescue with a kinase dead mutant.

These experiments are already underway in our lab, however, their results will be published in our future works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 legend includes (G) between (B) and (C), and appears to, in fact, refer to Fig 1E, for which the legend is missing the description.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, Figure S1C appears wrong. Goblet cells are not in the crypt but on the villi (so the graph axis label is wrong), and there are normally between 5 and 15 per villus, so the DKO figure is normal, but there are a surprisingly high number of goblet cells in the controls. And normally there are 10-15 Paneth cells/crypt, so it looks like these have been underestimated everywhere. I wonder how the counting was done - if it is from images such as those shown here then I am not surprised as the quality is insufficient for quantification. How many crypts and villi were counted? Given the difficulty in counting and the variability per crypt/villus, with quantitative differences like this it is important to do quantifications blind. I personally wouldn't conclude anything from this data and I would recommend to either improve it or not include it. If these data are shown, then data showing efficient double knockout in this tissue should also accompany it, by IF, Western or PCR. Otherwise, given a potentially strong phenotype, repopulation of the intestine by unrecombined crypts might have occurred - this is quite common (see Ganuza et al, EMBO J. 2012).</p></disp-quote><p>We added fig. S1C with Western blot showing presence of CDK8 and CCNC in WT intestine and their absence in the DKO intestine. We also corrected that the part of the intestine analyzed was the duodenum, not ileum. We also replaced intestine sections photos with the ones of better quality and higher magnification (200X) and corrected Y axis legend. We apologize for the confusion, and thank the reviewer for careful analysis of our data, which allowed us to make this correction. The numbers of cells were counted on 600x magnification, and the magnification given in the article is for presentation purposes only. Our number of goblet cells was indeed calculated per villus, not crypt, and the resulting number is similar to ones reported in Dannapel et al (Dannappel et al., 2022). As for Paneth cells their numbers correspond to several articles that use the c57bl6 strain (Brischetto et al., 2021; King et al., 2013), as the number of Paneth cells differs between different part of the intestine and different mouse strains (Nakamura et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>This reviewer appreciated the authors' effort in improving the quality of this manuscript during their revision. While some concerns remain, the revision is a much improved work and the authors addressed most of my major concerns.</p><p>Figure 2E CDK8 and CDK19 immunofluorescent staining images seem to show CDK8 and CDK19 location are completely distinct and in different cells, the authors need to elaborate on this results and discuss what such a distinct location means in line of their double knockout data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We had expanded the discussion in the lines 518 and 529 and included a better quality picture of the 200x magnification. Our main line of reasoning is that despite distinct expression in different cell types, high magnification show a certain level of expression of both proteins in most cells, so single knockouts will not demonstrate more than a slight phenotype, while the full knockout will have the full effect. This is especially true if our hypothesis that CCNC stabilization is important here, as both kinases can stabilize the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Supplemental figure 1(C) legend typo : (C) Periodic acid-Schiff stained sections of ilea of tamoxifen treated R26/Cre/ERT2 and DKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the effort to identify and generate new antibodies is appreciated, the specificity of the antibodies used should be examined and presented if available.</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity of the antibodies for the western blot is confirmed in figure S1F.
