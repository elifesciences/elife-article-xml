by a poorer prognosis. Mice lacking IMP2 exhibit a longer lifespan and a reduced tumor burden at old age. Herein we show in a diverse array of human cancer cells that IMP2 overexpression stimulates and IMP2 elimination diminishes proliferation by 50–80%. In addition to its known ability to promote the abundance of Insulin-like Growth Factor 2/IGF2, we find that IMP2 strongly promotes IGF action, by binding and stabilizing the mRNA encoding the DNA binding protein <italic>HMGA1</italic>, a known oncogene. HMGA1 suppresses the abundance of IGF binding protein 2/IGFBP2 and Grb14, inhibitors of IGF action. IMP2 stabilization of <italic>HMGA1</italic> mRNA plus IMP2 stimulated IGF2 production synergistically drive cancer cell proliferation and account for IMP2’s tumor promoting action. IMP2’s ability to promote proliferation and IGF action requires IMP2 phosphorylation by mTOR.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27155.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some types of cancers develop when genes known as oncogenes or tumor promoters become faulty, and are present at abnormally high levels or inappropriately turned on. For example, cancer cells often have extra copies of the gene <italic>IMP</italic>2 and therefore produce too much the IMP2 protein. Previous research has shown that mice that lack the IMP2 protein develop fewer cancers and live longer, while patients whose cancers make too much IMP2 have a poorer prognosis.</p><p>In healthy cells, the IMP2 protein normally helps to make new gene products by stabilising certain newly produced RNA molecules – the precursors of proteins, and in some cases by promoting the translation of these RNAs into proteins. For example, IMP2 binds to the mRNA that encodes the protein IGF2, which is a protein that helps cells to grow and is commonly produced in large quantities by cancer cells. However, until now it was not clear whether IMP2 only acts by increasing the production of IGF2 or also contributes to cancer growth in other ways.</p><p>Using a range of human cancer cell lines, and healthy mouse cells, Dai et al. first confirmed that without IMP2, cancer cells made less IGF2 and grew less quickly. When IGF2 was added to the cells lacking IMP2, it only partially restored their ability to grow. Further experiments revealed that cells without IMP2 had increased levels of proteins that counteract the effects of IGF2. Usually, IMP2 binds and stabilizes the mRNA that encodes the oncogenic protein HMGA1, which is known to regulate the number of ‘anti-IGF2 proteins’. However, without IMP2, the HMGA1 levels drop, which causes an increase of the anti-IGF2 proteins.</p><p>This indicates that IMP2 promotes cancer cell growth both by enabling cells to produce more IGF2 and by suppressing inhibitors of IGF2 action. This suggests that cancer patients whose tumors have abnormally high levels of IMP2 may be especially sensitive to drugs that target and inhibit IGF2.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IGF2BP2</kwd><kwd>IGF2</kwd><kwd>HMGA1</kwd><kwd>Grb14</kwd><kwd>IGFBP2</kwd><kwd>mTOR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 DK17776</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avruch</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK057521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avruch</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 DK040561</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadreyev</surname><given-names>Ruslan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The IGF2 mRNA binding protein-2/IMP2, overexpressed in many common cancers, drives cancer cell proliferation by increasing the abundance of IGF2 and the oncogene HMGA1, which controls a network of effectors that enhance IGF2 action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA-binding proteins (IGF2BP1-3 or IMP1-3) are a family of RNA binding proteins that participate in post-transcriptional gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yisraeli, 2005</xref>); notably, SNPs in the second intron of the human IMP2 gene are associated with increased risk for Type 2 Diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxena et al., 2007</xref>). IMPs enable translation of RNAs containing the IGF2 leader 3 5’UTR by internal ribosomal entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>) and also bind to the IGF2 mRNA 3’UTR; IMP1 but not IMP2 participates in IGF2 RNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). The IMPs contain six RNA binding motifs, two RRM domains followed by four KH domains and each are substrates for mTOR, which phosphorylates one (IMP1/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2013</xref>) or two (IMP2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>) serine residues in the segment that links the second RRM domain with the first KH domain. In RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells, the concurrent dual phosphorylation of IMP2 Ser162 and Ser164 is inhibited by rapamycin coincident with inhibition of IMP2 binding to the IGF2 leader 3 5’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>) and IGF2 leader 3 mRNA translation by internal ribosomal entry.</p><p>In the mouse embryo, all three <italic>IMP</italic>s are expressed coordinately starting ~e10.5 coincident with the onset of IGF action; the expression of <italic>Igf2, Imp1</italic> and <italic>Imp3</italic> is largely extinguished before birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nielsen et al., 1999</xref>), whereas <italic>Imp2</italic> is widely expressed postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>). Despite their architectural and sequence similarity, functional differences between the IMPs exist, as displayed most emphatically by the phenotypes of <italic>Imp</italic>-deficient mice. <italic>Imp1</italic> null mice are ~40% smaller than wildtype with aberrant intestinal development and ~50% mortality at p3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>). <italic>Imp1</italic> null mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) exhibit deficient <italic>Igf2</italic> RNA splicing and translation and greatly slowed proliferation; the latter is rescued entirely by exogenous IGF2. In contrast, <italic>Imp2</italic> null mice are nearly normal in size through weaning, lean and slightly small as adults, highly resistant to diet-induced obesity and long lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2015</xref>). Investigating the prolonged lifespan of <italic>Imp2</italic> deficient mice, necropsy of an apparently healthy cohort at ~845–850 d age revealed the presence of malignant tumors in 4/6 <italic>Imp2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice but in 0/6 <italic>Imp2<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2015</xref>), raising the possibility that IMP2 contributes to tumorigenesis.</p><p>Herein we demonstrate that although the oncofetal IMPs are commonly reexpressed in human cancers, <italic>IMP2</italic> is usually much more abundant in most human cancers than its paralogs <italic>IMP1</italic>or <italic>IMP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lederer et al., 2014</xref>); moreover, the <italic>IMP2</italic> gene is amplified at a high frequency in several common solid tumors, a phenomenon rarely seen with the <italic>IMP1</italic> or <italic>IMP3</italic> genes. We show that IMP2 overexpression promotes, and IMP2 deficiency strongly inhibits the proliferation of both MEFs and an array of human tumor-derived cell lines. Beyond its known ability to promote <italic>IGF2</italic> translation, IMP2 controls the abundance of the oncogenic transcriptional regulator HMGA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fedele and Fusco, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozturk et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sumter et al., 2016</xref>) by binding and stabilizing <italic>HMGA1</italic> mRNA. In turn, HMGA1, another oncofetal protein, suppresses the transcription of <italic>Igfbp2</italic>, a high affinity extracellular IGF binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diehl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoeflich et al., 1999</xref>), and also reduces Grb14, an inhibitor of IGF1R and Insulin Receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desbuquois et al., 2013</xref>).

Consequently, we attempted to overcome both the relative deficiency of IGF2 as well as the ability of IGFBP2 overabundance to sequester IGF2 by the addition of an excess of IGF2. The effect of adding exogenous IGF2 and shRNA-induced Grb14 depletion, singly and in combination, on the proliferation of the parental and IMP2 deficient cancer cell lines shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>. Depletion of Grb14 from parental cancer cells increased proliferation by only 1.04–1.12 fold whereas Grb14 depletion from the IMP2-deficient variants increased their proliferation by 1.5–2.09 fold. Similarly, addition of saturating amounts of IGF2 to the parental and IMP2 deficient cancer cells causes a substantially greater fractional increase in cell number in each of the IMP2 deficient variants than in the parental cells (except IMP2 deficient SNU-423, bottom right). Excess IGF2 alone however, like Grb14 depletion, restores total cell number of the IMP2 deficient variants only partially toward the parental levels; in the IMP2 deficient HeLa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle left), MB-231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, middle right) and Hep3b cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top left), combining depletion of Grb14 with the addition of IGF2 restores cell numbers of the IMP2 deficient variants to 72%, 79% and 96% of the parental levels. Thus in these three lines the large majority of the IMP2-stimulated proliferation is mediated by enhancing the production and action of IGF2. The IMP2 deficient variants of RD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom left) and HCC1359 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top right) exhibit a more modest additivity suggesting the contribution of other IMP2-regulated proliferative regulators. Only in the SNU-423 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom right) did the parental cells show a more robust proliferative response to IGF2 than did the IMP2 deficient variant (2.44 fold vs. 1.63 fold). Nevertheless, IMP2 deficient SNU-423 cells responded to depletion of Grb14 with a greater increase in proliferation than the parental SNU-423 cells (1.5 fold vs 1.12 fold). We conclude that the pro-proliferative effect of IMP2 in most cancer derived cell lines is mediated predominantly by upregulation of IGF2 production and suppression of Grb14 and IGFBP2 polypeptide abundance which together facilitate IGF2 signaling.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27155.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The ability of IMP2 to drive the proliferation of human cancer cells is mostly due to IMP2 regulation of IGF2, Grb14 and IGFBP2 abundance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CRISPR mediated deletion of <italic>IMP2</italic> from human cancer cell lines causes markedly increased abundance of IGFBP2 and Grb14.

Overnight withdrawal of serum, brief incubation in amino acid and serum-free medium or torin1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, column 1 vs columns 3,4,5 respectively) fully abolish the concomitant dual phosphorylation at IMP2 Ser162 and Ser164; the sensitivity of this dual phosphorylation to amino acid withdrawal and rapamycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>) as well as its rapid stimulation by insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, column 2 vs column 3) point strongly to the mediation of mTORC1. Nevertheless, serum withdrawal or torin1 cause little dephosphorylation of IMP2(Ser162P) and only partial dephosphorylation of IMP2(Ser164P), a pattern previously observed with shRNA-induced depletion of mTOR in RD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai et al., 2011</xref>). The modest dephosphorylation of IMP2(Ser164) caused by torin1 or amino acid withdrawal contrasts with the ability of these treatments to cause the near-total dephosphorylation of sites phosphorylated exclusively by mTORC1, such as S6K1(Ser389) or 4E-BP(Thr37/46). The marked resistance of IMP2(Ser162P) to dephosphorylation by torin1 is similar to that seen previously with the co-translational phosphorylation of IMP1(Ser181) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore examined whether IMP2 is phosphorylated co-translationally by incubating 293 cells with puromycin, which is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptides because of its resemblance to the 3’ end of aminoacylated tRNA, thereby terminating elongation. Puromycin immunoprecipitates contain IMP2 polypeptides that are phosphorylated at both Ser162 and Ser164 as well as at both sites concomitantly, which can have only occurred co-translationally; pretreatment of the cells with torin1 20 min. prior to addition of puromycin strongly inhibits these phosphorylations of nascent IMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus IMP2 undergoes mTOR dependent cotranslational phosphorylation at both Ser162 and Ser164, in addition to an insulin-, serum- and rapamycin-sensitive post-translational phosphorylation primarily (if not exclusively) at IMP2(Ser164), which results in concomitant dual phosphorylation. How the mature IMP2 polypeptide attains its steady state level of phosphorylation is not entirely understood; it is clear however, that the phosphorylation at either IMP2 site does not affect phosphorylation at the other site; substitution of Ser164 with either Ala or Asp has little effect on the extent of phosphorylation at Ser162 and the same is true of such substitutions at Ser162 on the phosphorylation at Ser164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>IMP2</italic> is amplified and overexpressed in many cancers and recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mu et al., 2015</xref>) have pointed to a tumorogenic role in individual cancer types, often with a poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barghash et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigagli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kessler et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with the view that IMP2 contributes broadly to tumor progression, we show herein that IMP2 drives the proliferation of both MEFs and a wide and unselected cohort of cancer cell lines. IMP2 is best considered a tumor promoter rather than an oncogene; although mice with transgenic overexpression of IMP2 in liver exhibit a higher tumor burden after diethylnitrosamine-induced hepatotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kessler et al., 2015</xref>), IMP2 has not as yet been shown capable of initiating tumorigenesis. The conclusion that IMP2 is a tumor promoter raises for consideration the biology of IMP2 in normal, noncancerous circumstances and how this might underlie tumor promotion. <italic>IMP1</italic> and <italic>IMP3</italic> are so-called ‘oncofetal’ genes because their high expression in embryonic development is strongly downregulated before birth, but frequently reappears in cancers. <italic>IMP2</italic> diverges from this model in that it continues to be expressed widely in adult life, however IMP2 appears to be preferentially expressed in tissue resident stem cells, such as satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boudoukha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2012</xref>), neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujii et al., 2013</xref>) and white adipocyte precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2015</xref>), where it is critical for their ability to proliferate, differentiate and gain motility. Thus <italic>IMP2</italic> gene amplification and/or upregulated expression may be important to the genesis of cancer stem cells and thereby central to IMP2’s tumor promoting capability, as proposed by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Degrauwe et al., 2016a</xref>) and demonstrated in glioblastoma stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Degrauwe et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>The present work also elucidates a major molecular pathway that underlies IMP2’s tumor promoting activity; IMP2 occupies a central place in a network of gene products that drive proliferation through the IGF1R and INSR-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The HMGA1 protein binds to the AT-rich regions in the DNA minor groove; although lacking direct transcriptional regulatory activity, it modulates gene expression by changing chromatin structure and promoting the assembly of other TFs. HMGA1’s output is thus cell context dependent; in addition to oncogenic transformation, HMGA1 can also promote expression of a stem cell-like program and/or an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Numerous transcriptional targets relevant to tumorigenesis have been described, including <italic>p53</italic> and <italic>Rb</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sumter et al., 2016</xref>) or the oncogenic miR222 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panneerselvam et al., 2016</xref>); here we identify the ability of HMGA1 to suppress the abundance of two previously unknown targets, IGFBP2 and Grb14, inhibitors of IGF1R and Insulin receptor signaling. HMGA1 binds directly within the <italic>Igfbp2</italic> gene promoter to suppress transcription.

IGFBP2 has IGF-dependent and independent, proproliferative actions in cell culture; IGFBP2 contains an RGD domain and can interact with the integrins αVβ3 and α5β1 to affect cell survival or motility (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Russo et al., 2015</xref>), and functions coordinately with IGF1 to promote endothelial proliferation through polymerization and inactivation of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase RTPTβ, causing inhibition of PTEN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, the ability of transgenic overexpression of IGFBP2 to inhibit postnatal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hoeflich et al., 1999</xref>) and colonic tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diehl et al., 2009</xref>) attests to its ability to sequester IGF in vivo.</p><p>A central role for IGFs in tumorigenesis had been predicted by the finding that mouse embryo fibroblasts devoid of an IGF1R are resistant to transformation by many cellular and viral oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sell et al., 1993</xref>).

The reason(s) for this disappointing outcome are not known, however one likely mechanism is the frequent overexpression of IGF2, due in part to loss of imprinting at the IGF2 locus and/or loss of the IGF2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brouwer-Visser and Huang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Livingstone, 2013</xref>). IGF2 has high affinity for the fetal-predominant A form of the insulin receptor (INSR-A), also frequently reexpressed in tumors.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;IGF2 mRNA binding protein-2 is a tumor promoter that drives cancer proliferation through its client mRNAs IGF2 and HMGA1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Charles Sawyers as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The report addresses potential mechanisms whereby the IGF-2 mRNA binding protein IMP2 promotes tumor growth and progression. The findings reveal new information regarding the role of IMP2 in regulating HMGA1 intracellular concentrations to modulate IGFBP-2, IGF-II and Grb14. The study also elucidates the role of these factors in regulating tumor cell proliferation. Extensive genomic and proteomic analyses clearly support the conclusion that these are the predominant factors that act together to regulate this signaling system. Overall, the findings are clearly presented and conclusions are well justified by the experimental data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One might expect there to be a synergy between IGFBP2 and Grb14, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> suggests that there isn't one. Perhaps the investigators could include this in the discussion, as it would suggest that in their model IGFBP2 inhibits proliferation primarily by sequestering IGF2. This actually strengthens their hypothesis.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: there appears to be constitutive phosphorylation of Akt in IMP2<sup>+/+</sup> cells, which does not appear to be significantly altered (judging by the blots) in response to IGF1. Moreover, whereas the robust decrease in IGF-1R and IRS phosphorylation in IMP2<sup>-/-</sup> cells is partially rescued upon addition of IGF1, rescue of the corresponding decrease in Akt phosphorylation appears to be minimal. This discrepancy should be explained.</p><p>3) The mechanism of Grb14 protein stabilization by IMP2 is unexplained. Given that Grb14 plays a role that is shown to be as important as that of IGFBP2 in disrupting IGF2-mediated cell growth, some insight into the mechanism whereby IMP2 stabilizes Grb14 ought to be provided. For example, does IGFBP2 exert an effect, direct or indirect, on Grb14 expression? Does depletion of IGFBP2 alter Grb14 expression? And if HMGA1 does not affect Grb14 stability, what are the candidate factors that may do so?</p><p>4) The mechanism of HMGA1 mRNA protection by IMP2 is unexplored. Without going into excessive depth here, the investigators could easily determine whether IMP2 binds to let-7 binding sites in the 3' UTR of HMGA1. This would at least suggest whether or not HMGA-1 mRNA stability is mediated by the ability of IMP2 to block or displace let-7 family miRNA binding to their targets.</p><p>5) The investigators begin their discussion by stating that their findings define the functional significance of IMP2 in cancer cells. However, other observations have shown that IMP2, in addition to other IMPs, promotes stemness in cancer cells. There are therefore probably several, possibly synergistic, mechanisms whereby IMP2 promotes tumor growth and this notion should be included in the Discussion. Furthermore, the investigators cite several studies that show a correlation between the poor prognosis of a variety of cancers and IMP2 expression. Recent work (Degrauwe et al., as well as others) has revealed precise mechanisms whereby IMP2 may be implicated in tumor maintenance and growth and should be cited.</p><p>6) The results regarding P21 are interesting however it is not clear why lowering P21 levels had no effect on proliferation. The assumption would be that even after deliberately lowering the levels they are still relatively high and therefore even a 5.9 fold change in levels is not adequate to alter proliferation. Some comment should be made on these findings. The authors comment in two places in the manuscript that the changes in proliferation could be in part mediated through insulin receptor A. Since Foti et al. (Nature Medicine 2005) reported that knocking out HMG A1 markedly downregulated insulin receptor expression and that transfection of the cells with HMG A1 restored insulin receptor expression one would expect the manipulations herein to alter insulin receptor number. If these manipulations of HMGA1 do change insulin receptor expression then tumor proliferation could be driven through this receptor. Therefore, showing the change in insulin receptor number would strongly support their hypothesis that this is the mechanism mediating tumor cell proliferation under these conditions. It seems reasonable to measure insulin receptor expression under conditions of high and low HMGA1 expression.</p><p>7) The authors should discuss the data of Foti et al. and how they apply to their system. Additionally, those authors (Liritano et al. Mol endo 2012) have published data indicating that with HMG A1 downregulation there is enhanced insulin/IGF-I sensitivity which, if discussed, would also contribute to a more complete consideration of their hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27155.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) One might expect there to be a synergy between IGFBP2 and Grb14, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> suggests that there isn't one.

We agree with the reviewer that this non-additivity suggests that both interventions act through the same pathway, i.e., by restoring signaling though the InsR and/or IGF-1R. We have added a sentence to that effect (subsection “Depletion of Grb14 and IGFBP2 each partially rescue Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEF proliferation but depletion of p21Cip1 does not” last paragraph).</p><p>The non-additivity and known ability of IGFBP2 to bind IGFs certainly supports the view that the predominant action of overabundant IGFBP2 in the Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs is to sequester autocrine IGF, but doesn’t rule out other possible sites of IGFBP2 action on that pathway.</p><p>The finding that neither intervention enables complete restoration of Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs proliferation and that together they are not additive may indicate that each intervention is sufficient to regain the full effect of the InsR/IGF1R pathway on the proliferation of Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs; i.e., impaired signaling by the InsR/IGF1R pathway perhaps accounts for ~2/3 of the ~75% reduced proliferation of Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs and other, as yet unidentified IMP2-dependent factors, that act through other proproliferative pathways or processes, account for the remaining deficit.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>: there appears to be constitutive phosphorylation of Akt in IMP2<sup>+/+</sup> cells, which does not appear to be significantly altered (judging by the blots) in response to IGF1.

In the Imp2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, basal Akt(Ser473P) is high and IGF1 causes a somewhat variable increase in Akt(Ser473P). The striking and consistent finding is the markedly lower basal and IGF1-stimulated Akt(Ser473P) signal in the Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. Nevertheless, IGF1 addition does increase the Akt(Ser473P) signal in the Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs in all three experiments. Regardless of the difference in the basal activity of Akt, we think that the lesser Tyr-P of the IGF1R and IRS polypeptides in the Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs is strongly indicative of impaired IGF signaling.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>IGF1R signaling is impaired in Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs.</p></caption><p>These two experiments were carried out exactly as described in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>.</p><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27155-resp-fig1-v3"/></fig><p>We have not pursued experimentally the mechanism underlying the difference in the basal/stimulated activation state of Akt in Imp2<sup>+/+</sup> vs. Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. HMGA1 has been reported to suppress the activity of PP2A, by driving expression of miR222, which promotes degradation of the mRNA encoding PPP2R2A (PP2A subunit Bα), reducing PP2A activity and activating Akt(Wong et.al., 2010, Zhang et.al., 2011, Paneerselvam et.al., 2016). Our proteomic analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) however finds similar levels of PPP2R2A in Imp2<sup>+/+</sup> and Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs. Thus, we have no satisfactory explanation for the difference in Akt activity in serum-deprived Imp2<sup>+/+</sup> and Imp2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs.</p><p><italic>3) The mechanism of Grb14 protein stabilization by IMP2 is unexplained. Given that Grb14 plays a role that is shown to be as important as that of IGFBP2 in disrupting IGF2-mediated cell growth, some insight into the mechanism whereby IMP2 stabilizes Grb14 ought to be provided. For example, does IGFBP2 exert an effect, direct or indirect, on Grb14 expression? Does depletion of IGFBP2 alter Grb14 expression? And if HMGA1 does not affect Grb14 stability, what are the candidate factors that may do so?</italic></p><p>We have been unable to identify the proximate mechanism by which IMP2 regulates the degradation of Grb14. Clearly, HMGA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), like IMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), regulates Grb14 abundance, and as with reduced IMP2, the effect of reduced HMGA1 is to prolong the half-life of the Grb14 polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>); this change is not mediated by IGFBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data are described in the subsection “Reduced HMGA1 underlies the increased abundance of IGFBP2 and Grb14 and the slower proliferation of IMP2 deficient MEFs and tumor cells”.</p><p>We have therefore hypothesized that IMP2 acts through HMGA1 which regulates the abundance of a E2 or E3 component of the ubiquitination pathway, a deubiquitinase, a protease or protease inhibitor, or some gene product (including miRs) that regulate the abundance of such elements. The number of steps that intervene between HMGA1 and Grb14 degradation is unknown. We have been unable to identify plausible candidates among the HMGA1 transcriptome and have not identified the elements that directly control Grb14 degradation.</p><p><italic>4) The mechanism of HMGA1 mRNA protection by IMP2 is unexplored. Without going into excessive depth here, the investigators could easily determine whether IMP2 binds to let-7 binding sites in the 3' UTR of HMGA1. This would at least suggest whether or not HMGA-1 mRNA stability is mediated by the ability of IMP2 to block or displace let-7 family miRNA binding to their targets.</italic></p><p>RNAseq of IMP2 IPs confirms that IMP2 binds extensively to the HMGA1 mRNA 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and as shown by Degrauwe et.al., (2016b), IMP2 overlaps the Let-7 MRE in the HMGA1 3’UTR. Those workers demonstrated convincingly that IMP2 antagonizes Let-7 mediated HMGA1 mRNA degradation. We cite this work in the second paragraph of the Discussion, as providing a likely mechanism for the marked reduction in HMGA1 mRNA we observe with IMP2 deletion; we have not attempted to repeat those experiments.</p><p><italic>5) The investigators begin their discussion by stating that their findings define the functional significance of IMP2 in cancer cells. However, other observations have shown that IMP2, in addition to other IMPs, promotes stemness in cancer cells. There are therefore probably several, possibly synergistic, mechanisms whereby IMP2 promotes tumor growth and this notion should be included in the Discussion.

Recent work (Degrauwe et al., as well as others) has revealed precise mechanisms whereby IMP2 may be implicated in tumor maintenance and growth and should be cited.</italic></p><p>This is an important point, and we have modified the opening paragraph of the Discussion, to emphasize this aspect of IMP2 biology. We stress that in adult life IMP2, in contrast to IMP1/IMP3, is widely expressed and appears to be preferentially expressed in tissue resident stem cells, citing examples where IMP2 has been shown to be important to their ability to both proliferate and differentiate. We then cite the work of Degrauwe et.al., 2016b, which demonstrates the importance of IMP2 in glioblastoma stem cells.</p><p><italic>6) The results regarding P21 are interesting however it is not clear why lowering P21 levels had no effect on proliferation. The assumption would be that even after deliberately lowering the levels they are still relatively high and therefore even a 5.9 fold change in levels is not adequate to alter proliferation. Some comment should be made on these findings.</italic></p><p>Although P21 CDKi is ~5X more abundant in IMP2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs than in IMP2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs, depletion of P21 to nearly the same level accelerates proliferation by only ~30% in both cell types. This similarity suggests to us that the impedance of the IGF1R/InsR pathway in the IMP2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs imposes a restraint on proliferation that is largely independent of that imposed by P21.That said however, we have no compelling explanation for why depletion of P21 accelerates proliferation to a similar extent in WT and IMP2 KO MEFs. An obvious possibility is that the restraint to cell proliferation attributable to P21 in WT MEFs is modest and already near maximal, so that the 5-fold increase caused by IMP2 deletion has little further inhibitory effect. We have not however examined the effect of P21 overexpression in WT MEFs, because that would be an inappropriate model for IMP2<sup>-/-</sup> MEFs, which exhibit numerous changes in cell cycle regulators other than P21, in directions that could either speed or slow proliferation (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, tab 3). Consequently, we have not pursued the question of why reducing P21 has a small effect of similar magnitude in both WT and IMP2 null MEFs, nor do we think that any of our explanations are sufficiently compelling to merit discussion.</p><p><italic>The authors comment in two places in the manuscript that the changes in proliferation could be in part mediated through insulin receptor A. Since Foti et al. (Nature Medicine 2005) reported that knocking out HMG A1 markedly downregulated insulin receptor expression and that transfection of the cells with HMG A1 restored insulin receptor expression one would expect the manipulations herein to alter insulin receptor number. If these manipulations of HMGA1 do change insulin receptor expression then tumor proliferation could be driven through this receptor. Therefore, showing the change in insulin receptor number would strongly support their hypothesis that this is the mechanism mediating tumor cell proliferation under these conditions. It seems reasonable to measure insulin receptor expression under conditions of high and low HMGA1 expression.</italic></p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> upper left, shRNA induced depletion of HMGA1 from WT MEFs reduces the abundance of InsR-B and InsR-A mRNA, determined by Q-PCR, ~four fold, in confirmation of several reports from the Brunetti and colleagues (Foti et.al., 2005; Liritano et.al., 2012); reciprocally, (lower left) doxycycline-induced overexpression of HMGA1 in both WT (lanes 1,3) and IMP2 null (lanes 2,4) MEFs increases InsR-B mRNA and InsR-A in MEFs ~2.1-2.6 fold. In contrast, deletion of IMP2 from MEFs (lower left, lanes 3,4), although reducing HMGA1 to a similar extent as accomplished by HMGA1-directed shRNA, has no effect on insR-A or InsR-B mRNA levels.</p><p>Similarly, in RD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, right), although doxycycline induction of HMGA1 increases InsR mRNA levels ~3-3.5 fold, the marked reduction in HMGA1 caused by CRISPR-mediated deletion of IMP2 does not alter the abundance of InsR A or B mRNA.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><p>Depletion of HMGA1 reduces InsR mRNA whereas reduction or elimination of IMP2, although reducing HMGA1 abundance, does not alter InsR abundance.</p></caption><p>Left, upper: Imp2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNA directed against GFP or HMGA1 were treated with doxycycline (100 ng/ml).

Nevertheless, this data indicates clearly that the slowed proliferative rate of IMP2 depleted cells cannot be attributed to a reduced InsR abundance. Similarly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, neither does IMP2 deletion alter the abundance of the IGF1R, but only the ability of IGF1R to be activated by IGF1, which in the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> we attribute predominantly to the upregulated expression of Grb14 and in cell culture proliferation to IGFBP2 as well.</p><p><italic>7) The authors should discuss the data of Foti et al. and how they apply to their system. Additionally, those authors (Liritano et al. Mol endo 2012) have published data indicating that with HMG A1 downregulation there is enhanced insulin/IGF-I sensitivity which, if discussed, would also contribute to a more complete consideration of their hypothesis.</italic></p><p>The metabolic phenotype of the HMGA1 KO mice as described by Foti et al., 2005 and pursued in the followup paper from this group (Liritano et.al., Mol Endo 2012; 26:1578) remains inexplicable. There is a reduction in insulin receptor abundance in the KO, but serum insulin levels are lower than in WT and glucose tolerance is minimally impaired; moreover, the hypoglycemic effect of injected insulin is actually greater in the KO. Liritano et.al, show that HMGA1 deletion reduces expression of the IGF binding proteins 1 and 3; IGFBP3 binds ~60-70% of circulating IGF1/2, IGFBP1 ~5% and most of the rest is bound by IGFBP2 (which our current paper shows is greatly increased by HMGA1 KO in cell culture). Liritano finds ~3X increase in unbound/free IGF-1in HMGA1 KO mice and reports modestly enhanced glycemic lowering to exogenous IGF-1 in the KO mice. Unfortunately, inasmuch as insulin does not bind the IGFBPs or IGF1R, these findings do not explain why there is a greater hypoglycemic effect of insulin in the HMGA1 KO despite reduced InsR expression. These complexities and unexplained phenomena discouraged us from dwelling on this data in our Discussion. Nevertheless, we have added a paragraph at the end of the Discussion that summarizes the information we consider defensible regarding the relationship of the components of the tumor promoting pathway we describe herein (i.e., HMGA2, IMP2, IGF2, HMGA1 and Grb14) to type 2 diabetes and the increased risk for cancers associated with that condition.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
