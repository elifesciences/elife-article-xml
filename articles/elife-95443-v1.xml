mechanisms leading to neurodegenerative disease. Factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch neurons, are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the <italic>C. elegans</italic> ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the <italic>C. elegans</italic> reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. Overall, genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths and genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons are specialized cells in the brain and nervous system that transmit signals between the brain and the rest of the body, enabling humans and animals to react to internal and external stimuli. For this communication system to function effectively, neurons must remain healthy.</p><p>Neurons maintain their function in a variety of ways, including by removing excess or damaged cellular components (such as organelles and protein aggregates) that could compromise neuron function. One way to do this is by extruding organelles and aggregates. During ‘extrusion events’, the material to be removed is gathered within a budding portion of the plasma membrane, which forms a vesicle that ejects the material from the neuron. However, the factors driving the extrusion process remained unknown.</p><p>To investigate, Wang, Guasp, Salam et al. conducted experiments in the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> finding that the number of extrusion events in a certain type of neuron increases at the peak of reproduction. More specifically, a greater number of extrusion events were associated with the presence of fertilized eggs, which accumulate in the uterus before they are laid. Disrupting eggs, sperm or the fertilization process suppressed the increase in extrusion events, suggesting the presence of fertilized eggs is responsible.</p><p>To determine how the eggs might trigger extrusion events, Wang et al. stretched the uterus using dead eggs, unfertilized eggs or by injecting fluid, finding that each of these approaches increased the number of extrusion events. Further analysis suggests that this mechanical stretching of the uterus signals to the neurons that reproduction has started, encouraging the neurons to remove old components and optimize their function. Wang et al. hypothesize that this stretch response could support neuronal behaviors that aid in successful reproduction, such as sensing food and selecting where to lay eggs.</p><p>The findings increase our understanding of the factors that trigger vesicle extrusion in living organisms. These observations could have implications for human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, in which protein aggregates accumulate in neurons. It is possible that mechanical signals generated by factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease, such as high blood pressure, could influence neuronal extrusion and contribute to some of the mechanisms underlying aggregate transfer in neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>exopher</kwd><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>mechanical stress</kwd><kwd>mechanobiology</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>transgenerational signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24OD010943</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01GM135326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Barth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37AG56510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Driscoll</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG047101</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Barth D</given-names></name><name><surname>Driscoll</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K12GM093854</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chuang</surname><given-names>Edward</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large extracellular vesicle extrusion that eliminates neuronal protein aggregates and organelles is potentiated by uterine filling, linking reproductive status to maternal nervous system health, and demonstrating mechanobiology components in exophergenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In neurodegenerative disease, prions and protein aggregates can transfer among cells of the nervous system to promote pathology spread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davis et al., 2018</xref>). Determination of the factors that enhance or deter pathological transfer is, therefore, a central goal in the effort to clinically address neurodegenerative disease. Study of aggregate transfer in the context of the mammalian brain is a major experimental challenge as events are rare, sporadic, and transiently apparent, and tissue is not easily accessible for in vivo observation. We model aggregate transfer by proteostressed ALMR touch receptor neurons in the living <italic>C. elegans</italic> nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2023</xref>), an experimental system that enables molecular and genetic manipulation and evaluation in a physiological context, directly through the transparent cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corsi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>More specifically, <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult neurons can extrude large vesicles called exophers (~5 µm; 100 X larger than exosomes) that carry potentially deleterious proteins and organelles out of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2023</xref>). Disrupting proteostasis via diminished chaperone expression, autophagy, or proteasome activity, or over-expressing aggregating proteins like human Alzheimer’s disease associated fragment Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, expanded polyglutamine Q128 protein, or high concentration mCherry fluorophore, increases exopher production from the affected neurons. Neurons that express proteotoxic transgenes maintain higher functionality if those neurons produce exophers as compared to those that do not, suggesting that exopher-genesis can be neuroprotective, at least in young adult neurons. Extruded exopher contents can be transferred to neighboring glial-like hypodermal cells for content degradation in the lysosomal network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Several mammalian models feature similar biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lampinen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nicolás-Ávila et al., 2022</xref>), and thus we speculate that the basic transfer biology represents a conserved process that can be recruited for animal-wide proteostasis balance.</p><p>Neuronal exophers are generated only in adult animals, with an unexpected pattern of a peak at young adult days 2–3 and then later in age with more variable onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>). While using chemical regent 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to block progeny production for aging studies, we found that blocking reproduction strongly limited the early adult peak of exopher production. Here, we report data that support that early adult exopher production is sensitive to the load of eggs in the reproductive tract. We document that uterine expansion, rather than chemical signals emanating from fertilized eggs, correlates strongly with the level of exopher production and suggest a model in which mechanical signaling, normally induced across generations from egg to parent via uterine stretch, is a license for proteostressed neurons to release potentially toxic materials in large extracellular vesicles.</p><p>Mechanical signaling exerts a profound impact on virtually all cell types, and has been implicated in traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative disease, yet remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2021</xref>). Our observations direct enhanced experimental attention to studies on how mechanical force can influence extracellular vesicle formation and aggregate transfer in the living brain and in neurodegenerative disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The six <italic>C. elegans</italic> gentle touch receptor neurons (AVM, ALML, and ALMR located in the anterior body, and PVM, PLML and PLMR located in the posterior body) can be readily visualized in vivo by expression of fluorescent proteins under the control of the touch neuron-specific <italic>mec-4</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We commonly monitor exophers extruded by the ALMR neuron, which typically produces more exophers than the other touch neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>), using a strain in which fluorophore mCherry is highly expressed in touch neurons and is avidly eliminated (strain ZB4065 <italic>bzIs166</italic>[P<italic><sub>mec-4</sub></italic>::mCherry], hereafter referred to as mCherryAg2 for simplicity). ALMR exopher production occurs with a distinctive temporal profile, such that at the L4 larval stage ALMR rarely, if ever, produces an exopher, but in early adult life, the frequency of exopher events increases, typically reaching a peak of 5–20% of ALMR neurons scored at adult day 2 (Ad2); exopher detection then falls to a low baseline level after Ad3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>), a pattern that parallels adult reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Late in life, exophers can reappear with variable frequency, but here we focus on the young adult exopher generation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Exophergenesis is dependent on the presence of the germline, ooyctes, and sperm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exophers produced by ALMR are readily visualized in living <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Over-expression of mCherry in <italic>bzIs166</italic> is associated with enlargement of lysosomes and formation of large mCherry foci that often correspond to LAMP::GFP-positive structures; ultrastructure studies reveal considerable organelle morphological change not seen in low reporter-expression neurons; polyQ74, polyQ128, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> over-expression all increase exophers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Melentijevic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2023</xref>).

We tested four genetic conditions that lower or block egg-laying: a null mutation of prolyl hydroxylase <italic>egl-9</italic>, for which disruption induces a mild egg-laying defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trent et al., 1983</xref>); a null allele of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 2 <italic>egl-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Salem et al., 2018</xref>) that perturbs neuropeptide processing and confers a severe egg-laying defective phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trent et al., 1983</xref>); a reduction-of-function mutation in SOX transcription factor SEM-2 (<italic>sem-2(n1343)</italic>) that eliminates production of the sex myoblasts needed to generate egg laying muscle; and RNAi directed against the <italic>lin-39</italic> homeobox transcription factor HOXA5 ortholog required for vulval cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wagmaister et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sternberg, 2005</xref>).</p><p>We found that the associated massive egg retention correlated with a dramatic elevation of exopher numbers for each genetic impediment to egg laying (<italic>egl-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>); <italic>egl-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>); <italic>sem-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), <italic>lin-39</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>)).

For the Exopher- ALMRs that had not produced exophers, 63/91 (70%) had neuronal somas located in the egg zone.

During development, the ALM neurons migrate posteriorly to near the mid-body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sym et al., 1999</xref>), and most commonly, ALM somas are situated posterior to AVM. ALM soma positions, however, can be influenced by migration and specification cues. In particular, transgenic introduction of a <italic>mec-3</italic> promoter fragment bearing an internal deletion (fusion of the –1 to –563 sequences to the –1898 to –2372 <italic>mec-3</italic> promoter fragment, plasmid pJC4) can induce anterior ALM migration during development, sometimes resulting in final ALM positions anterior to AVM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Toms et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We took advantage of the partially deleted <italic>mec-3</italic> promotor sequences in pJC4 to manipulate the ALM position. In these studies, we introduced pJC4 with the co-transformation marker pRF4 (<italic>rol-6(su1006))</italic> that disrupts the cuticle to induce rolling of transgenic animals into the P<italic><sub>mec-4</sub></italic>::mCherry background. Rol hermaphrodites have a strikingly high baseline of ALMR exophergenesis (~40% exophers in rollers vs. ~20% in the wild-type). Strikingly, we found that when ALMs are situated anterior to AVM, ALMR exophergenesis drops to ~5% (4/73) vs 71% for the posterior position (55/78) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although we cannot exclude that physiological changes in differently-positioned touch neurons underlie reduced exophergenesis, data are consistent with a model in which proximity to the egg zone correlates with exophergenesis.</p><p>Another way to increase egg proximity to ALMR is to disrupt egg-laying capacity, which confers egg retention and uterine expansion. We hypothesized that in the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> mutant, which is associated with considerable internal egg accumulation, additional touch neurons should experience increased proximity to eggs in the blocked uterus. Indeed, we find that in the <italic>sem-2(rf)</italic> background, every touch neuron that is positioned in the general region of the expanded uterus (ALML, AVM, PVM) increases exopher production, but the posterior PLM neurons, which cannot be approached by the gonad, do not produce exophers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, touch neurons can be stimulated to produce exophers if the egg domain is artificially brought closer to them. Data are consistent with a model in which ALMR normally makes most exophers because of its closest natural positioning near the egg-filled uterus. Possibilities are that a diffusible signal may eminate from the filled uterus or that mechanical pressure associated with a filled uterus might signal enhanced exophergenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Uterine expansion associated with high egg load correlates with high exophergenesis</title><p>How might the presence of eggs signal to the maternal neurons to induce exophers? We consider two main possibilities: (1) eggs filling the uterus might exert physical pressure that activates essential stretch-signaling for young adult neuronal exopher release. This mechanical stretch signal might act directly (for example introducing chronic and/or dynamic pressure on the touch neurons), or indirectly (possibly inducing the stretched uterus/somatic gonad to release chemical signals that promote neuronal exopher formation); (2) early fertilized eggs might release a short-range chemical signal that contributes to young adult proteostasis reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>) to promote exophergenesis.</p><p>To begin to dissect the role of egg pressure in promoting exophergenesis, we analyzed the physical relationships of neurons, eggs, and uterine shape.

Here, we report that the early exophergenesis peak is dependent on uterine occupation, which normally is conferred by fertilized egg accumulation prior to the deposition of eggs. Uterine expansion that is associated with the filling of a blocked uterus with unfertilized oocytes or by fluid alone can also induce high neuronal exopher production, supporting a model in which the physical distention associated with uterine occupancy, rather than chemical signals derived from fertilized eggs per se, is a required component of the signaling relay between reproduction and young adult neuronal debris elimination. Trans-tissue cross-talk to the maternal nervous system thus appears accomplished via mechanical force transduction. Our findings hold implications for mechano-biology in neuronal proteostasis management.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The mechanical landscape of reproduction that influences neuronal exophergenesis</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> reproduction features physical expansion and contraction of multiple tissue/cell types--the gonad houses the expanding germline, and the spermatheca expands and retracts vigorously as each mature oocyte enters and exits. The uterus also stretches to house eggs and can contract locally as eggs transit or are expelled via the action of the vulval and uterine muscles. The filled reproductive apparatus can thus clearly exert both constitutive and sporadic pressure on surrounding tissues as it enacts its essential functions.</p><p>What is the source of the force that promotes exopher production? Elegant work on the egg-laying circuit (comprising the somatic gonad, the HSN and VC neurons, and the vulval, and uterine muscle) has provided evidence for mechanical signaling within the egg-laying circuit that regulates initiation, promotion, and termination of egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Medrano and Collins, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ravi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kopchock et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ravi et al., 2021</xref>). Working backward, exopher-promoting force seems unlikely to derive from the vulva or vulval muscle contractions, since when these cells are genetically disrupted in <italic>lin-39</italic> RNAi or in <italic>sem-2</italic> mutants, high levels of exophers still are generated. Changes in spermatheca volume, which expands and contracts dramatically as mature oocytes enter via valve opening/closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan and Zaidel-Bar, 2015</xref>), might be sensed, but spermatheca contractions are reported to be normal in hyperactive egg-laying <italic>goa-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Govindan et al., 2006</xref>), which is an exopher-suppressing background. Under no-sperm conditions, oocyte transit rates are lower than for fertilized eggs, and sperm-derived signals influence spermathecal valve opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McGovern et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller et al., 2001</xref>), but if the egg-laying apparatus is genetically compromised and oocytes accumulate in the absence of sperm, exopher levels are high, suggesting deficits in spermatheca operations or sperm signals per se do not drive exophergenesis. Given that under normal reproductive conditions of egg-laying proficiency, correctly shelled eggs are required for the early peak in exopher production, a plausible hypothesis was that fertilized eggs might produce an essential diffusible factor that stimulates neuronal exopher-genesis. However, exophers can be produced abundantly in the absence of fertilized eggs when the vulva is unable to open and release uterine contents, resulting in uterine distention due to debris filling. Thus, the simplest model we envision for the reproductive cues that influence maternal neuronal exophergenesis is that a filled uterus (under normal conditions the consequence of hard-shelled eggs that occupy it) is sensed and required for the early adult peak in exopher production.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How might force be sensed and transduced?</title><p>Mechanotransduction is the sensing of a mechanical signal, such as pressure or stretch, and conversion into a cellular response.

Together with our observations, data raise the possibility that the onset of reproduction and the initial filling of the uterus triggers, or generates a ‘license’ for EV/exopher production across tissues.

At the same time in early adult life, proteasome activity is relatively enhanced (at least as measured in the hypodermis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). These measures may reflect a general proteostasis reorganization (chaperone activity, proteosome activity) that occurs in early adult life in response to reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sala and Morimoto, 2022</xref>).

Mouse kidney proximal tubular epithelia cells (PTEC) under constant mechanical stress due to both fluid shear stresses and absorption-associated osmotic pressure, also release exopher-like vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Large vesicle extrusion, mechanobiology, and neurodegenerative disease</title><p>The impact of mechanical force on in vivo production of extracellular vesicles has not been a major focus of the EV field, although a range of studies have considered force consequences (such as fluid shear responses, stretch) in cultured cells. Overall, however, EV biogenesis and uptake appear to be markedly influenced by biomechanical force type, magnitude, and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Thompson and Papoutsakis, 2023</xref>). At the same time, the neurodegeneration field has generated myriad studies linking Alzheimer’s disease susceptibility and AD pathology signatures such as extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β protein and/or intracellular accumulation of tau as outcomes of mechanical stress-based stimuli such as traumatic brain injury, arterial hypertension, and normal pressure hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ramos-Cejudo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Malone et al., 2022</xref>). Mechanical stress may trigger or promote protein misfolding, aggregation, and extrusion. Examples of recent implication of mechanical stimuli in AD-related outcomes include that stretch in the brain vascular system can increase APP and B-secretase expression to increase Aβ production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gangoda et al., 2018</xref>) and that microglial mechanosensing via the Piezo1 mechanotransducing channel limits progression of Aβ pathology in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2023</xref>). Our study reveals a capacity of mechanical force to influence neuronal release of large vesicles containing neurotoxic species, inviting more serious consideration of the roles of mechanobiology in maintaining proteostasis and influencing aggregate transfer within the context of a living nervous system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and maintenance</title><p>All strains used in this study carry the transgene bzIs166[P<italic><sub>mec-4</sub></italic>::mCherry] to mark the six touch receptor neurons: ALMR, ALML, AVM, PVM, PLMR, and PLML.

We left the plate on an open bench at room temperature for one or two days to dry out the auxin solution, then seeded the plate with 200 ul OP50-1 <italic>E. coli</italic> and waited for another two or three days before storing the plates in a 4 °C environmental room. We only used the plates which had been stored in the 4 °C environmental room for at least a week, so the concentration of auxin can be equilibrated into 1 mM.

Exphers can remain intact for approximately 2 hr, but the vesicle form of exophers is mostly identifiable in the following 24 hr. Therefore, the exopher count includes both the intact form and the fragmented degraded form, also known as ‘starry night’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). We scored the exopher count with the protocol published in JoVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2020</xref>). We age-synchronized the animal via egg-laying, bleaching, or L4 picking.

Although baseline exopher levels are low in this strain, we demonstrate that inducing egg retention in this background markedly increases exopher generation from a baseline of near zero to ~60% (new Fig. 3H), supporting that uterine distention, rather than reporter identity, is associated with early life exopher elevation. Data also add to our observations indicating that high protein-expressing strains generally produce higher baseline levels of exophers in early adulthood (for example, Melentijevic et al. (PMID 28178240) documented that mCherry RNAi knockdown in the strain primarily studied here can lower exopher levels).</p><p>The second point raised here, regarding the occurrence and physiological role of early-adult exophers in “native” non-stressed neurons is a fascinating question that we are beginning to address in continuing experiments. Readers will appreciate that quantifying relatively rare, “invisible” touch receptor neuron exophergenesis accurately without expressing a fluorescent reporter is technically challenging. Our speculation, outlined now a bit more clearly in the Discussion here, is that certain molecular and organelle debris that cannot readily be degraded in cells during larval development may be stored until release to more capable degradative neighbors or to the coelomocytes for later management, as one component of the early adult transition in proteostasis (see J. Labbadia and R. I. Morimoto, PMID 24592319). Receiving cells may be primed for this at a particular timepoint, possibly analogous to the “bulky garbage” collection of over-sized difficult-to-dispose-of household items that a town will address with specialized action only at specific times. The prediction is that we should be able to detect some mass protein aggregation through early development, and at least partial elimination by adult day 3; this elimination should be impaired when eggs are eliminated.

Indeed, these experiments provide a model generally for how one would methodically test different models for exopher production. The paper is well-written and easy to understand. I had been skeptical of the origin and purpose of exophers, concerned they were an artefact of imaging conditions, caused by deranged calcium activity under stressful conditions, or as evidence for impaired animal health overall.

I list a few below, which could be addressed in this paper or which could be the subject of follow-up studies.</p><p>- Why do such a low percentage of ALMR neurons produce exophers (5-20%)? Does it have to do with the variability of the proteostress?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not yet understand why some ALMR neurons within a same genotype will produce exophers and some will not. We know that in addition to the uterine occupation we report here, proteostasis compromise, feeding status, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress can elevate exopher numbers (PMID 34475208); cell autonomous influences on exopher levels include aggresome-associated biology (PMID 37488107) and expression levels of the mCherry protein (PMID 28178240). Turek reports that social interaction on plates can influence muscle exopher levels (PMID 34288362). Thus, although variable proteostress experienced by neurons is likely a factor, we have not yet experimentally defined specific trigger rules. We suspect the summation of internal proteostasis crisis and environmental conditions, including particular force vectors/frequency will underlie the variable exopher production phenomeonon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why does the production of exophers lag the peak in progeny production by 24-48 hours? Especially when the injection method produces exophers right away?</p></disp-quote><p>The progeny production can track well with exopher production (Fig. 1B), although the nature of egg counts (permanent, one time events) vs. exophers (which are slowly degraded) can skew the peak scores apart. We synchronized animals at the L4 stage. 24 hours later was adult day 1, and we measured then and every subsequent 24 hours. The daily progeny count reflects the total number of progeny produced every 24 hours; exopher events were scored once a day, but exophers can persist such that the daily exopher count can partially reflect slow degradation, with some exophers being counted on two days. We now explain our scoring details better in the Methods section.</p><p>The rapid appearance of exophers, as early as about ~10 minutes after sustained injection, is fascinating and probably holds mechanistic implications for exopher biology. For one thing, we can infer that in the mCherry Ag2 background, touch neurons can be poised to extrude exophers, but that the pressure/push acts to trigger or license final expulsion. It is interesting that we found we needed to administer sustained injection of two minutes to find exopher increase (now better emphasized in the expanded Methods section). We speculate that a multiple pressure events, or sustained force vector might be critical (like an egg slowly passing through??). Minimally, this assay may help us assign molecular roles to pathway components as we identify them moving forward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- As mentioned in the discussion, it would be interesting to know if PEZO-1/PIEZO is required for uterine stretching to activate exophergenesis. pezo-1 animals accumulate crushed oocytes in the uterus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have begun to test the hypothesis that PEZO-1 is a signaling component for ALMR exophergenesis, initially using the N and C terminal pezo-1 deletion mutants as in Bai et al. (PMID 32490809). These pezo-1 mutants have a mild decrease in ALMR exophergenesis under normal conditions. However, vulva-less conditions in pezo-1N and piezo-1C increased ALMR exophergenesis from approximately 10% to 60%, similar to the response of wild-type worms to high mechanical stress, data that suggest PEZO-1 is not a required player in mediating mechanical force-induced ALMR exophergenesis. We are currently testing genetic requirements for other known mechanosensors. We intend comprehensive investigation of the molecular mechanisms of mechanical signaing in a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>-The study would be significantly strengthened by the addition of data detecting regulation of exophergenesis by uterine forces in a more physiological context, in the absence of overexpression of a toxic protein. In other words, is this a process that occurs naturally during reproduction, or is it specific to proteotoxic stress induced by overexpression? Perhaps the authors could repeat key experiments using a single copy transgene, and challenge the animals with exogenous proteotoxic stress if necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include data using a single copy alternate fluorescent reporter expressed in touch neurons. Although baseline exopher levels are low in this strain, we demonstrate that inducing egg retention in this background markedly increases exopher generation from a baseline of near zero to ~60% (Fig. 3H), supporting that uterine distention, rather than reporter identity or over-expression alone dries early life exopher elevation.</p><p>Also noteworthy is that we find exophergenesis in the single-copy transgenic line is only approximately 0.3% on adult day 2 (average in three trials, data not shown), which is much lower than the 5-20% exophergenesis rate typically observed in the multi-copy high expression mCherry transgenic line. Therefore, consequences of overexpression of mCherry likely potentiate exophergenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-The authors mention that exophergenesis has been described in muscle cells. Is this also dependent on the proximity to the uterus? It would have been interesting to include data on other cell types in the vicinity of the reproductive system.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, in interesting work on exophers produced by muscle, Turek et al. reported that muscle exopher events are mostly located in a region proximal to the uterus. Moreover, this work also documented that sterile hermaphrodites are associated with approximately 0% muscle exophergenesis, and egg retention in the uterus strongly increases muscle exophergenesis (PMID: 34288362).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Is exophergenesis also induced by other forms of mechanical stress? For example, swimming.</p></disp-quote><p>We have looked at crude treatments such as centrifugation or vortexing without observing changes in exopher levels. Our preliminary work indicates that swimming can increase exophergenesis, and this effect depends on the presence of eggs in the uterus. We appreciate the question, and expect to include documentation of alternative pressure screening in our planned future paper on molecular mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-In Figure 1E, the profile of exopher production for the control condition at 25oC is very similar to the profile observed at 20oC in Figure 1B. However, the profile of progeny production at 25oC is known to have an earlier peak of progeny production. Perhaps egg retention is differently correlated with progeny production at this temperature? The authors could easily test this.</p></disp-quote><p>Overall, exophers (which degrade with time) and progeny counts (a fixed number) have slightly different temporal features, anchored in part by how long exophers or their “starry night” debris persist. Most exophers start to degrade within 1-6 hours (PMID: 36861960), but exopher debris can persist for more than 24 hours. An exopher event observed on day 1 may thus also be recorded at the day 2 time point, which leads to a higher frequency of exopher events on day 2 as compared to day 1.</p><p>We have previously published on the impact of temperature on exopher number (Supplemental Figure 2 in PMID 34475208). In brief, increasing culture temperature for animals that are raised over constant lifetime temperature modestly increases exopher number; a greater increase in exophers is observed under conditions in which animals were switched to a higher temperature in adult life, suggesting changes in temperature (a mandatory part of the ts mutant studies) engages complex biology that modulates exopher production. Our previous data show that in a temperature shift to 25oC, the peak of exophers was at adult day 1. Here, Fig. 1B is constant temperature, 20oC; Fig. 1E has a temperature shift 15-25oC. That egg retention might be temperature-influenced is a plausible hypothesis, but given the complexities of temperature shifts for some mutants, we elected to defer drill-down on the temperature-exopher-egg relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-It is not clear how to compare panels A and B in Figure 3. In panel A the males are present throughout the adult life of the hermaphrodites whereas in panel B the males are added in later life. Therefore, the effect of later-life mating on progeny production is not shown and the title of panel A in the legend is misleading.

The baseline of exophergenesis in rollers is ~40%, and we corrected the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>-Considering the conclusion of Figure 2 that blocking embryonic events passed the 4-cell stage does not impact exopher production, it would have been interesting to compare the uterine length for emb-8 and for mex-3, since it is quite intriguing that the former suppresses exopher production while the latter has no effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We repeated the emb-8 and mex-3 RNAi for these studies and encountered variability in outcome for 2 cell stage disruption via emb-8 RNAi, which is consistent with the range of published endpoints for emb-8 RNAi. We elected to include these emb-8 findings in the figure legend 2G, but removed the RNAi data from the main text figure. mex-3 uterine measures are added to revised panels 5H, 6I.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>-Leaving the worms in halocarbon oil for too long (e.g. 10 min) can desiccate and kill them. Did the authors take them out of the oil before analyzing exopher production? The authors refer to these as 'sustained injections' without much description beyond that. As the worms are very small, the flow rate needed for a sustained injection over 2 minutes must be very low - so low that the needle is in danger of being clogged. Do the authors have an estimate of how much fluid was injected or the overall flow rate? I realize the flow rate measured outside of the worm may not compare directly to that of a pressurized worm, but such estimates would be instructive, particularly if they can be related to the relative volume of the eggs the injection is trying to mimic.</p></disp-quote><p>After injection or mock injection, we removed the animal from the oil and flipped it if necessary to observe the ALMR neuron on the NGM-agar plate. We now expanded description of the experimental details of injection, including the estimated flow rate, in the revised Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors describe the ALMR neurons as &quot;proteostressed&quot;, but I am not clear on whether these neurons were treated in a unique procedure to induce such a state or if the authors are merely building on other observations that egg-laying adults are dedicating significant resources to egg production, so they must be proteostressed. If they are not inducing a proteostressed state in their experiments, the authors should refrain from describing their neurons and effects as depending on such a state.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised to more explicity feature published evidence that the ALMR neurons we track with mCherryAg2 bz166 are likely protestressed. Overexpression of mCherry in bz166 is associated with enlargement of lysosomes and formation of large mCherry foci that often correspond toe LAMP::GFP-positive structures in ALMR neurons (PMID: 28178240; PMID: 37488107). Marked changes in ultrastructure reflect TN stress in this background. These cellular features are not seen in wild type animals. We previously published that mCherry, polyQ74, polyQ128, Ab1-42 (which enhance proteostress) over-expression all increase exophers (PMID: 28178240). Likewise most genetic compromise of different proteostasis branches--heat shock chaperones, proteasome and autophagy--promote exophergenesis, supporting exophergenesis as a response to proteostress. In sum, the mCherryAg2 bz166 appear markedly stressed above a non-over expressing line and produce more exophers. RNAi knockdown of the mCherry lowers exopher levels (PMID: 28178240).</p><p>In response to reviewer comment, we added a study with a single copy mKate reporter (new data Fig. 3H). We find a very low baseline of exophers in this background. This would support that high autonomous compromise associated with over-expression influences exopher levels. Interestingly, however, we found that ALMR neurons expressing mKate under a single-copy transgene still exhibit excessive exopher production (&gt;60%) under high mechanical stress (Fig. 3H). These data are consistent with ideas that mechanical stresses can enhance exopher production, and may markedly lower the threshold for exophergenesis in close-to-native stress level neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors should include more details on the source and use of the RNAi, for example, if the clones were from the Ahringer RNAi library, made anew for this study, or both.</p></disp-quote><p>We now add this information in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I would be curious if the authors would similarly see an induction in exopher production after acute vulval muscle silencing with histamine.
