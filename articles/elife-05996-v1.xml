Here, through a genome-wide genetic screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we uncover a highly complex Notch-dependent genetic circuitry that profoundly affects proliferation and consequently hyperplasia. We report a novel synergistic relationship between Notch and either of the non-receptor tyrosine kinases Src42A and Src64B to promote hyperplasia and tissue disorganization, which results in cell cycle perturbation, JAK/STAT signal activation, and differential regulation of Notch targets. Significantly, the JNK pathway is responsible for the majority of the phenotypes and transcriptional changes downstream of Notch-Src synergy. We previously reported that Notch-Mef2 also activates JNK, indicating that there are commonalities within the Notch-dependent proliferation circuitry; however, the current data indicate that Notch-Src accesses JNK in a significantly different fashion than Notch-Mef2.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05996.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05996.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05996.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells within animals are organized into tissues and organs that perform particular roles. To develop and maintain these structures, the ability of individual cells to divide and grow is strictly controlled by the activities of many proteins, including one called Notch. This protein is found in all multicellular organisms and allows cells to communicate with each other. Mutations in the gene that encodes Notch can cause cells to divide excessively and lead to cancer and other diseases.</p><p>Notch regulates the growth and division of cells by interacting with many other proteins. For example, Mef2 works with Notch to activate a communication system called the JNK pathway. This pathway is involved in controlling cell division, cell death, and cell movement. However, it is thought that Notch may also interact with other proteins that have not yet been identified.</p><p>Now, Ho et al. have conducted a genome-wide screen in fruit flies to find proteins that interact with Notch. The experiments used flies that develop abnormally large eyes because they have an over-active Notch protein. Ho et al. identified hundreds of fruit fly genes that could increase or decrease the size of the flies' eyes in the presence of Notch activity. Many of these genes are known to be involved in development, cell division, or in controlling the activity of other genes.</p><p>Ho et al. found that two of these genes encode similar proteins called Src42A and Src64B, which are similar to the Src proteins that are involved in many types of human cancers. The experiments show that both proteins interact with Notch to promote uncontrolled cell division and lead to tissues in the flies becoming more disorganized. The JNK pathway is also activated by Notch working with Src42A or Src64B, but in a different manner to how it is activated by Mef2 and Notch, and with different consequences for cells.</p><p>This study provides new insights into how genes work together in order to influence cell division and other events in development. Also, it suggests that Notch activity may regulate the growth of cancers linked with defects in the Src proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05996.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05996.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Notch</kwd><kwd>Src</kwd><kwd>JNK</kwd><kwd>hyperplasia</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Postdoctoral Fellowship (PF-10-230-01-DDC)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>Diana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 098402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Artavanis-Tsakonas</surname><given-names>Spyros</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A diverse group of modifier genes, including the proto-oncogene Src, cooperate with Notch specifically to control cell proliferation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A relatively small number of highly conserved cellular signaling pathways are responsible for a broad array of distinct, specific biological processes in metazoan development. It is clear that these pathways must interact in a combinatorial and context-dependent manner to produce the wide and diverse range of downstream events required for development, homeostasis, and disease.</p><p>One of these fundamental signaling mechanisms is the Notch pathway, which is conserved amongst all metazoans and controls a wide range of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2006</xref>). Aberrant Notch signaling levels can lead to developmental defects and various pathological conditions including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2012</xref>). In addition to the well-documented causative role of activating Notch mutations in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellisen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weng et al., 2004</xref>), Notch activity has been positively correlated with a number of solid cancers, including those of the breast, prostate, skin, brain, lung, colon, and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koch and Radtke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganathan et al., 2011</xref>). However, Notch can also act as a tumor suppressor in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dotto, 2008</xref>). The specific mechanisms by which Notch contributes to oncogenesis remain largely opaque, although it seems clear that integration with other genes in a context-dependent fashion are key for mediating the action of Notch and its involvement in pro-oncogenic events as proliferation and metastasis.</p><p>Ligand binding to the Notch cell surface receptor results in a series of cleavages that release the active C-terminus, which subsequently translocates to the nucleus and modulates the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hori et al., 2013</xref>). Given that Notch is highly pleiotropic, it is clear that the developmentally crucial and highly specific downstream responses to Notch signal activation depend on its cellular context and the integration of the signal with other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hurlbut et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bray and Bernard, 2010</xref>). Indeed, a number of genetic screens in our lab and others have revealed a staggering number of genes that interact with Notch to modulate downstream phenotypes; given that the results from these studies, which encompass various biological processes, have surprisingly little overlap, it seems likely that the full gamut of genes that can genetically interact with and influence Notch has not yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kankel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurlbut et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shalaby et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Saj et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guruharsha et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported a synergistic interaction between activated Notch and the transcription factor Mef2, and showed that it activates the JNK signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pallavi et al., 2012</xref>). In addition to its classical role as a cell stress mediator, JNK, like Notch, plays roles in multiple morphogenetic processes including proliferation, cell death, and cell shape changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rios-Barrera and Riesgo-Escovar, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we report the results of a systematic, genome-wide modifier screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to dissect and define the genetic circuitry that interacts with Notch to affect proliferation events.

Given that Notch defines an essential, ancient, and highly pleiotropic developmental pathway, it is plausible that the genetic circuitry that has evolved to influence the biological outcome of Notch signals is complex. The present analysis highlights the complexity and, significantly, the subtlety of Notch signal synergies. We focused our attention here on N/Src synergy partly because the proliferation phenotype we monitor depends, like our previously reported N/Mef2 synergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pallavi et al., 2012</xref>), on the activation of JNK signals. Importantly, however, we demonstrate that N/Src both accesses and interprets JNK signals in a manner distinct from that of N/Mef2. This sort of differential access to the same pathway to effect developmental outcomes may serve as a paradigm of the integration of a pleiotropic signal, such as Notch, with diverse, context-dependent factors. In turn, understanding the mechanisms of signal integration has profound implications for both normal development and disease.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Notch interacts with a large, diverse cohort of genes to control proliferation</title><p>Notwithstanding the fact that the genetic circuitry surrounding Notch signals is very complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guruharsha et al., 2012</xref>), we were surprised to find such an abundance and diversity of genes that can cooperate with activated Notch signals to modulate cellular proliferation, a fact that has obvious potential consequences for oncogenesis as well as normal development.</p><p>It is important to note that our screen is not saturating because the Exelixis mutant collection disrupts only approximately 53% of the fly genome and has other inherent limitations, which have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thibault et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kankel et al., 2007</xref>). In the current screen, we tested all lines (with the exception of insertions on the X chromosome, which would be hemizygous in male progeny) heterozygously, so weaker or recessive effects may not be observed. We also did not score combinations that were 100% lethal. Therefore, we do not expect to find every member of a complex or pathway or all redundant genes. In light of the above information, we presume that the true number of genes that can modify Notch-induced proliferation phenotypes is far greater (perhaps at least double) than the 360 we have identified in this work, indicating a surprising complexity and diversity of the potential genetic circuitry that can, in conjunction with Notch signals, affect proliferation.</p><p>Despite the diversity of the identified gene set, there are nevertheless some commonalities. Most notably, 31 genes are annotated as cell cycle genes, representing a more than twofold enrichment. In particular, genes involved in mitosis are highly represented. Given the phenotypic parameters of the screen, it is not surprising that cell cycle genes have been identified as modifiers. Interestingly, we identified <italic>nanos</italic> (<italic>d06728</italic>, which is predicted to be a GOF allele) as a suppressor of the large eye phenotype. This finding is corroborated by the observation that nanos can directly repress <italic>Cyclin B (CycB)</italic> in the germline, thereby preventing mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>). However, we also identified <italic>c04775</italic>, a predicted disruption of <italic>Cyclin B3 (CycB3)</italic>, as an enhancer; the evidence would suggest that loss of mitotic cyclins should, like <italic>nanos</italic> GOF, suppress rather than enhance hyperplasia. It is conceivable that this may point to a context-specific feedback regulation that, if indeed true, may have implications for oncogenesis. Such an interesting possibility, however, awaits experimental corroboration especially in view of the fact that additional analysis would be necessary to ensure that <italic>c04775</italic> is indeed a true loss-of-function mutation of <italic>CycB3.</italic></p><p>We should also note that the screen did not always identify plausibly predicted genes.

Given that the majority of N/Src phenotypes and changes in almost 70% of the transcriptional targets can be effectively reversed upon JNK inhibition it seems clear that the major target of the N/Src synergy is the JNK pathway. Our previously reported N/Mef2 synergy activates JNK via the TNF ligand <italic>egr</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pallavi et al., 2012</xref>), which is clearly not the case for N/Src, which actually causes suppression of both <italic>egr</italic> and its receptor. Additionally, N/Src causes a great deal of apoptosis, whereas N/Mef2 does not, and only N/Src is capable of differentially upregulating <italic>E(spl)mγ</italic>. Finally, although both combinations activate JAK/STAT ligands, the degree of upregulation is more than an order of magnitude greater for N/Src vs N/Mef2. These observations suggest that while JNK activation may be a common thread in Notch-related hyperplastic phenotypes, there may be multiple routes through which a single pathway (JNK) is activated, and this difference in access may subsequently contribute to differential downstream outputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05996.016</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Model of convergence and divergence of the Notch/Mef2/JNK and Notch/Src/JNK signaling axes.</title><p>N/Mef2 and N/Src synergies converge on JNK, through <italic>eiger</italic>-dependent and <italic>eiger</italic>-independent means respectively.

However, our data indicate that the combination of Notch and Src actually leads to loss of the ZNC and expansion of the hyperproliferative zone, suggesting that Src modulates the activity of Notch in this situation and leads to proliferation rather than differentiation (as is also implied by the loss of cut in the D–V boundary). Our observation of differential regulation of the <italic>E(spl)</italic> complex genes supports the notion that Src modulates the target specificity of Notch.

The G1 phase is important during normal development and homeostasis to allow newly-divided cells to increase in size and replenish protein and energy stores; additionally, regulatory checkpoints during G1 control cell fate choices such as the decision to exit the cell cycle and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hindley and Philpott, 2013</xref>). <italic>Dap</italic> is a member of the p21/p27 family of Cdk inhibitors, and is required during <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis for proper timing of cell cycle exit at G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Nooij et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lane et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos undergo their first 16 cell divisions without G1 or G2, resulting in rapid cell division without a corresponding increase in compartment size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee and Orr-Weaver, 2003</xref>). In contrast, we observe hyperplasia of N/Src wing discs, indicating that compartment growth must occur even in the absence of a detectable G1 phase. In the case of Ras or Myc overexpression, the other phases of the cell cycle are prolonged to compensate for decreased time in G1, and the overall growth rate also increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Prober and Edgar, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2002</xref>).

Like ESCs, N/Src cells remain in an actively proliferating state rather than undergoing G1 arrest followed by differentiation. Therefore, this raises the very interesting possibility that N/Src synergy may interfere with cell fate determination, conferring pluripotency. This could have important implications for tumorigenicity as well as for the maintenance of a differentiated state. A recent report found that Src42A and Src64B in <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestinal stem cells (ISCs) could stimulate the expansion of a transit-amplifying population of Notch-positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kohlmaier et al., 2014</xref>). In light of our findings, we suggest that Src may actually interact with Notch in this cell population to induce proliferation. It will therefore be informative to compare our list of N/Src transcriptional targets with the genes induced by Src in ISCs or other pluripotent cell types in both mammals and flies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Implications for cancer biology</title><p>Several previous studies have shown that Src acts through JNK to induce invasive phenotypes, including activation of MMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rudrapatna et al., 2014</xref>). However, invasiveness is only one part of the oncogenic equation. Once they have migrated into a tissue, metastatic cells also need to grow and proliferate, preferably in an unchecked fashion. Our work suggests that the addition of Notch promotes hyperplastic growth while still retaining and perhaps even enhancing Src-driven invasive behavior. Strikingly, this occurs even in the presence of significant amounts of apoptosis. Should an additional mutation or gene activation occur that suppresses this cell death, the N/Src cells may become even more malignant. A clue might be found in the comparison with N/Mef2, where tissues overgrow but very little cell death is observed.</p><p>Other studies have reported that loss of the Src antagonist Csk in the wing disc can induce activation of JNK and JAK/STAT signaling as well as morphological disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Read et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vidal et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vidal et al., 2007</xref>). We hypothesize that these Csk phenotypes may result from activation of endogenous Src, which then interacts with endogenous Notch. The Src family members <italic>Src</italic>, <italic>Fyn</italic>, and <italic>Yes</italic> in mammals, as well as <italic>Src42A</italic> and <italic>Src64B</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are widely, even ubiquitously expressed, and kept in check partly by the similarly widespread expression of <italic>Csk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takahashi et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tateno et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Takahashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wheeler et al., 2009</xref>). Notch is likewise expressed in a large number of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Artavanis-Tsakonas et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artavanis-Tsakonas and Muskavitch, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, although the activity and levels of both Src and Notch are often increased in cancers, activating mutations in the genes themselves are rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishizawar and Parsons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ranganathan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Louvi and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 2012</xref>). One explanation suggested by our data is that synergy between even relatively low levels of active Notch and Src can activate JNK and cause exponentially increased levels of hyperplastic growth and stimulation of oncogenic events. Additionally, an inactivating mutation in Csk could have devastating consequences in both development and cancer by triggering a Notch/Src synergistic response.</p><p>Among the human orthologs of our N/Src targets, genes involved in metabolism and stress response are both overrepresented. Thus these cells may have an increased metabolic rate (which may also explain the observed overgrowth in the absence of G1) and heightened protection from stress, both of which could contribute to a favorable environment for oncogenesis. In particular, this may explain how N/Src cells survive and indeed hyperproliferate despite the strong pro-apoptotic JNK signal.</p><p>An earlier study revealed that activated Notch could act as a tumor suppressor in v-Src-transformed quail neuroepithelial cells, causing a reversion of the transformed phenotype along with suppression of JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mateos et al., 2007</xref>). This report may seem on the surface to contradict our findings. However, Notch can act as either an oncogene and a tumor suppressor depending on context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lobry et al., 2014</xref>). Here, too, context, including other genes that interact with the N/Src axis, is likely to be essential; further analysis of the hits from our genetic screen may shed light on this issue as well as on the larger question of how Notch switches between oncogenic and tumor suppressive behavior.</p><p>Our observation that the N/Mef2 and N/Src synergies both activate the same pathway (JNK) but display differences in downstream phenotype suggests that it may be possible to identify targeted, refined signatures for different types of Notch, Src, and JNK-related cancers.</p><p>While single gene mutations can occasionally trigger an oncogenic state, it is more often the context-dependent interplay between genes that causes or modulates cancerous growth. Understanding the mechanistic consequences of cross-talking gene activities is essential if we are to unveil the molecular basis of oncogenic events and develop rational therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Crosses were carried out at 25°C under standard conditions unless otherwise noted.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>It has become increasing obvious that the driving force for many cancers involves combinations of signalling pathways. Identifying fundamental synergies between pathways is therefore of major significance. In this manuscript, the authors investigate the consequences from combined activity of Notch and Src. The manuscript reports the results of a genome-wide genetic screen to identify modifiers of Notch-mediated hyperplasia in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. From the list of modifiers, the authors focus their attention on Src and in the involvement of JNK on the N/Src synergy. A valuable contribution is the screen itself whose results will be welcomed by the research community. Therefore, giving more prominence to the screen and its results, compared to the Src/N synergy (which is important too, see below) could make the paper's general value more apparent.</p><p>The experiments reveal that the phenotypes from combining ectopic Notch (expressing N<sup>act</sup>) and from ectopic Src (expressing various forms) are considerably more severe than either alone. Notably the tissues exhibit exacerbated hyperplasia. Additional experiments demonstrate that there are changes in cell cycle regulation, enhanced apoptosis and altered expression of a number of different types of downstream genes including <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>decapo</italic>, JAK-STAT ligands (<italic>upds</italic>). The authors also perform RNA-seq to characterize fully the transcriptome of the different genotypes. These are therefore substantial and valuable studies that are analysed but also provide data to the community for further mechanistic studies.</p><p>There are some intriguing aspects of the data from the screen that the authors could elaborate as discussed below.</p><p>An interesting feature of the manuscript is the demonstration that synergy between Notch and Src42A in the eye and wing discs causes hyperplasia and activates JNK, and that halved Notch activity can rescue the phenotype of over-expressed Src: the striking result is the rescue of Src64B phenotype in N/+ heterozygotes. These data suggest that Src64B requires Notch for many actions, potentially a profound observation. One concern about this, and some other experiments, is that they rely on <italic>vg-Gal4</italic> driver. As <italic>vg</italic> is regulated by Notch activity, there is a possibility that the suppression in N/+ and the augmented phenotypes with N<sup>act</sup> are due to changes in Gal4 expression, leading to less or more Src being expressed respectively. At least some of the experiments should be repeated with a Notch-independent driver (e.g. engrailed-Gal4) to rule out this possibility. Or alternative ways of addressing this concern need to be elaborated. This important issue bears reiterating: Given the likelihood that <italic>vg-GAL4</italic> is influenced by Notch activity, at least some of the core findings, including this one, should be reproduced with another strategy.</p><p>Several of the results from the screen are intriguing and merit discussion. For example, the authors could elaborate on their finding of <italic>nanos (d06728)</italic> as a suppressor of somatic hyperplasia. A second interesting aspect of the results of the screening is the involvement of <italic>CycB3 (d04775)</italic>. It is remarkable that loss of function of a mitotic cyclin can enhance Notch-mediated hyperplasia and it is striking that none of the other cyclins appears as a modifier. Something similar applies to <italic>Bub1 (c04512)</italic>, which shows up as a strong enhancer while none of the other gatekeepers of the metaphase to anaphase transition (<italic>Mad3/BubR1, Mad2,</italic> or <italic>Bub3</italic>) do so.</p><p>Previous studies investigating Src64 reported some similar phenotypes (MMP1, apoptosis, JNK activity; Cell Death Dis.;4:e864; Oncogene.33(16):2027-39). It would be helpful to place the current results in the context of the previous studies of ectopic Src, which also clearly demonstrated that JNK was required. It is therefore not unexpected that bsk<sup>DN</sup> blocks many of these phenotypes (as shown previously). What is unclear is how N<sup>act</sup> augments these Src phenotypes. This remains a major gap in the current work that should be discussed in a revised version.</p><p>The RNA-seq experiment does not appear to support other qPCR/ immunofluorescence data in the manuscript: <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>puc</italic>, <italic>dap</italic>, <italic>upd</italic> are not included in the genes synergistically regulated. Do the authors have an explanation? As it stands these data undermine their conclusions. Use of additional methods to substantiate core targets (<italic>dap</italic>, <italic>upd</italic>, <italic>E(spl)mγ</italic>) would strengthen their conclusions (e.g. in situ hybridisation or reporter genes ) and would give useful insight into whether the effects are autonomous.</p><p>The data showing effects on the Zone of non-proliferating cells (ZNC) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> are not sufficiently clear. The disc appears to totally lack a ZNC. Is this because of a broad non-autonomous effect or is the disc younger?</p><p>Additional controls would strengthen the conclusions. Most studies of this type control for the numbers of UAS present (using <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> or <italic>UAS-lacZ</italic> etc.) and also mark the region of ectopic expression (e.g. Oncogene. 33(16):2027-39). Although it is unlikely that UAS titration has confounded the results here (in most experiments there is an increased phenotype) there are some genotypes where this could be a factor.

Specifically, we have tried to use both <italic>dppGal4</italic> and <italic>C96Gal4</italic> wing drivers, as well as both the <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>j1d8/j1d8</italic></sup> mutant (which inactivates Csk, an inhibitor of Src) and the <italic>Csk</italic><sup><italic>j1d8</italic></sup><italic>/+,puc</italic><sup><italic>E69</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> trans-heterozygous mutant, which were both reported by Langton et al. (Dev Cell, 2007) to cause Src-like phenotypes in the wing disc. Unfortunately, all of the above approaches failed due to excessive lethality and we were thus unable to replicate the rescue experiment using a vg-independent method. We have therefore decided to move this result into the supplemental data (it is now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and explicitly state in the text the caveat that effects of Notch reduction on <italic>vgGal4</italic> may play a role. We also avoid drawing any conclusions in the Discussion based on this finding.</p><p><italic>Several of the results from the screen are intriguing and merit discussion.

With regard to only single members of a pathway or process showing up in the screen, it is important not to read too much into such things as they may be caused by the fact that the screen is not saturating (this and other limitations of the screen are now discussed). However, we note that <italic>BubR1, Mad2</italic>, and <italic>Bub3</italic> are indeed represented in the Exelixis collection and were not identified as modifiers in our screen; we now discuss this as a potentially interesting avenue for further study.</p><p><italic>Previous studies investigating Src64 reported some similar phenotypes (MMP1, apoptosis, JNK activity; Cell Death Dis.;4:e864; Oncogene.33(16):2027-39).

While they do indeed show that Src activates JNK/MMP1/apoptosis to promote invasive behavior, they do not document hyperplastic growth. We believe that the addition of Notch is important to contribute the equally important overgrowth aspect of oncogenesis. It is striking that even in the presence of such massive apoptosis as induced by JNK, N/Src tissues can still overgrow.</p><p><italic>The RNA-seq experiment does not appear to support other qPCR/ immunofluorescence data in the manuscript:</italic> MMP1<italic>,</italic> puc<italic>,</italic> dap<italic>,</italic> upd <italic>are not included in the genes synergistically regulated.

For <italic>MMP1</italic> and the <italic>upd</italic> genes, the discrepancy can be largely explained by the observation that Src alone can induce these genes to a lesser degree. This seems to sometimes be enough for the algorithm/false positive correction to deem the N/Src vs. Src condition statistically insignificant. For <italic>dap</italic>, we see a significant reduction of the Notch-induced <italic>dap</italic> in the presence of Src; however, we do not see the reduction below WT that we see with qPCR. This discrepancy remains unexplained at the moment; we make note of this fact in the text. With regards to <italic>puc</italic>, we believe that the RNA-seq gave a false positive reading for the WT condition that threw off the subsequent calculations. This is explicitly now mentioned in the text.</p><p><italic>Use of additional methods to substantiate core targets (</italic>dap, upd, E(spl)mγ<italic>) would strengthen their conclusions (e.g. in situ hybridisation or reporter genes ) and would give useful insight into whether the effects are autonomous</italic>.</p><p>We have performed experiments using the <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter lines for <italic>upd</italic>, <italic>dap</italic>, and <italic>E(spl)mγ</italic> as you suggested.

The overlapping data (showing N/Mef2 activity on MMP1, apoptosis, and JNK) is clearly described in the text as replicating our previous work; we believe that it is important to show it in the current work for comparison/control purposes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
