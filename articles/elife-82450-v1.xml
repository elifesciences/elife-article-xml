cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Actin polymerization dynamics and filament morphology differ between nucleus and cytoplasm. However, it is unclear how the Arp2/3 complex mediates distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic actin polymerization in response to a common stimulus. In humans, the ARP3, ARPC1, and ARPC5 subunits of the Arp2/3 complex exist as two different isoforms, resulting in complexes with different properties. Here, we show that the Arp2/3 subunit isoforms ARPC5 and ARPC5L play a central role in coordinating distinct actin polymerization events in CD4 T cells. While ARPC5L is heterogeneously expressed in individual CD4 T cells, it specifically drives nuclear actin polymerization upon T cell activation. In contrast, ARPC5 is evenly expressed in CD4 T cell populations and is required for cytoplasmic actin dynamics. Interestingly, nuclear actin polymerization triggered by a different stimulus, DNA replication stress, specifically requires ARPC5 but not ARPC5L. TCR signaling but not DNA replication stress induces nuclear actin polymerization via nuclear calcium-calmodulin signaling and N-WASP. Diversity in the molecular properties and individual expression patterns of ARPC5 subunit isoforms thus tailors Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization to different physiological stimuli.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nuclear F-actin</kwd><kwd>Arp2/3 complex</kwd><kwd>CD4 T cell activation</kwd><kwd>DNA replication stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FA 378/20-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fackler</surname><given-names>Oliver T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CC2096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>810207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Way</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

In concert with co-stimulatory receptors such as CD28, T cell activation is primarily governed by engagement of surface exposed T cell antigen receptor (TCR/CD3) complexes with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II-bound peptides on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dustin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grakoui et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sedwick et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tskvitaria-Fuller et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>). T cell activation triggers proliferation and polarized differentiation of naïve T cells required for their development into effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Constant et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaech et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu and Paul, 2008</xref>). Physiologically, APC-T cell interactions occur in the context of stable cell–cell contacts referred to as immunological synapses and trigger a broad range of downstream signaling events, including a sequential tyrosine phosphorylation cascades to activate PKC and MAPK signaling, as well as rapid elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, which together regulates the expression of TCR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dustin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Joseph et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monaco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monks et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oh-hora and Rao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rhee and Choi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>). TCR engagement also triggers the immediate polymerization of cortical actin at the immune synapse, which regulates downstream signaling by facilitating the formation and proper spatial distribution of signaling competent microclusters as well as by coordinating TCR and integrin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Billadeau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jankowska et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morimoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Valitutti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Varma et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the cytoplasm, actin is also highly abundant in the cell nucleus, but the role of nuclear actin is much less studied or understood. The advent of improved probes to visualize nuclear F-actin facilitated the detection of nuclear actin assembly into complex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melak et al., 2017</xref>). Following the initial observation of short-lived F-actin networks in fibroblasts upon stimulation with serum, evidence for the formation of nuclear actin filaments in mammalian cells, for example, upon integrin and G-protein-coupled receptor signaling or DNA damage response and chromosome break repair, DNA replication stress, postmitotic nucleus expansion, or infection with cytomegalovirus emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baarlink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Belin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilkie et al., 2016</xref>). The morphology of nuclear actin filaments ranges from stable thick cables to very transient thinner filament bundles. Different actin nucleators have been implicated in the formation of the nuclear actin filaments: the formins Dia1 or Formin-1/Spire1/2 for F-actin networks triggered by serum and integrin signaling or DNA damage, or Arp2/3 complex for nuclear actin filaments induced in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baarlink et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caridi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Analyzing nuclear actin dynamics in response to TCR engagement in CD4 T cells, we previously observed the rapid induction of a transient meshwork of thin nuclear actin filaments within seconds after stimulation that is subsequently disassembled after a couple of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>). This nuclear actin assembly, which drives a selective gene expression program required for the helper function of CD4 T cells, is triggered by nuclear calcium–calmodulin signaling and precedes actin polymerization in the cytoplasm. Interestingly, TCR-induced actin polymerization in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm relies on the Arp2/3 complex, but how spatiotemporal control of these distinct actin polymerization events is achieved is unclear. Arp2/3 is a seven subunit complex that mediates actin polymerization in a wide range of diverse cellular processes, including the formation of lamellipodia, endocytosis, and/or phagocytosis at the plasma membrane. Further, Arp2/3 activity is regulated by interaction with nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs), including WASP, N-WASP, WASH, and WAVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pizarro-Cerdá et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rottner et al., 2010</xref>). NPF binding to and concomitant activation of Arp2/3 is induced by diverse upstream signals, and the involvement of different NPFs therefore represents one level of spatiotemporal control of the Arp2/3 complex. In addition, the Arp2/3 subunits ARP3, ARPC1, and ARPC5 exist as two different isoforms in humans that can assemble into complexes with different biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balasubramanian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galloni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jay et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Millard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Loeffelholz et al., 2020</xref>). As recently demonstrated for ARP3, different subunit isoforms can provide the Arp2/3 complex with sensitivity for distinct upstream regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galloni et al., 2021</xref>). To assess how Arp2/3 can mediate distinct actin polymerization events in the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to a common stimulus, we investigated herein the role of Arp2/3 subunit isoforms and NPFs in these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Arp2/3 regulates nuclear and cytoplasmic actin polymerization during CD4 T cell activation</title><p>Transient nuclear and cytoplasmic actin remodeling in response to T cell activation can be visualized using several experimental approaches, including live-cell imaging using Jurkat CD4 T cells stably expressing a nuclear lifeact-GFP reporter (JNLA). Importantly, the endogenous nuclear F-actin meshwork can also be detected by F-actin staining of stimulated CD4 T cells that did not express any reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>). Immune synapses between T cells and APCs can be induced via superantigens like Staphylococcus enterotoxin E (SEE), that cross-links unspecifically MHCII with the TCR and results in potent T cell activation. Upon immune synapse formation between JNLA cells with SEE-loaded Raji B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), actin polymerization is first observed in the nucleus and is followed by actin polymerization at the cell–cell contact site. These processes are recapitulated by surface-mediated stimulation of JNLA cells when plated on dishes coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>): TCR engagement rapidly induced a nuclear F-actin (NFA) meshwork, followed by cell spreading and actin polymerization into a circumferential F-actin ring (AR) at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>) followed by subsequent disassembly of actin filaments. The simultaneous visualization of nuclear and cytoplasmic actin dynamics is challenging due to their transient nature and occurrence in different focal planes. To specifically study nuclear actin polymerization, we therefore often induce T cell activation by PMA/ionomycin (P/I), which only triggers nuclear actin polymerization in the absence of cytoplasmic actin remodeling or cell spreading. The formation of nuclear F-actin can be triggered by ionomycin alone, but for optimal nuclear actin polymerization, ionomycin is typically used in combination with PMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>). Generally, the formation of both NFA and AR can be blocked with comparable efficacy by pretreating the cells with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK869, regardless of the stimulus type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D, G and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). Within the short time frame of the experiment, CK869 treatment does not cause significant changes in CD3 surface expression, excluding receptor downregulation as cause for reduced actin polymerization upon stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Arp2/3 complex thus mediates distinct phenotypically discernable actin polymerization events in CD4 T cell activation that are equally sensitive to pharmacological interference independently of the T cell stimulus used.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Arp2/3 complex-mediated nuclear and plasma membrane actin polymerization in CD4 T cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental setup to visualize actin dynamics at the immune synapse, as performed for <bold>B</bold>–<bold>D</bold>.

However, both nuclear and cytoplasmic actin polymerization require activation of the Arp2/3 complex and only a subset of T cells undergoes nuclear actin polymerization, that is, approximately 25% Jurkat T cells and 65% of primary CD4 T cells display nuclear actin polymerization upon stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that differences in the nuclear actin polymerization response of CD4 T cell populations may be governed by molecular diversity. In search for the molecular basis for this differential regulation of the Arp2/3 complex, we hypothesized that nuclear and cytoplasmic actin polymerization might involve distinct Arp2/3-complex subunit isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Millard et al., 2003</xref>).

Primary resting CD4 T cells displayed low expression levels of all Arp2/3 complex subunits, but T cell activation increased their levels significantly.

The consistently low expression of ARPC1A and ARPC5L could result from weak expression of these isoforms in every cell or a heterogeneous expression pattern that manifests as overall low expression levels in bulk cultures. To assess whether individual cells display heterogeneous expression of Arp2/3 subunit isoforms, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) analysis of publicly available CD4 T cell data sets. As expected, UMAP clustering of Jurkat T cells revealed an overall homogenous cell population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Quantification of Arp2/3 subunit isoform expression levels showed robust expression of ARP2, ARP3, and ARPC5, an intermediate level of expression of ARPC1B, and relatively low expression of ARPC1A and ARPC5L, consistent with the findings from the bulk analysis. To quantify the number of cells robustly expressing these isoforms, we counted all cells that expressed a given gene above the cutoff level of 1 transcript per million (TPM). Interestingly, ARPC1A and ARPC5L were strongly expressed in only 33 and 46% of Jurkat cells, respectively. Since ARPC1A and ARPC5L expression was not associated with a particular cell-cycle phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), we assume that these two proteins are heterogeneously expressed within Jurkat cells, where some cells show robust expression, and the majority exhibits weak or undetectable expression.</p><p>Next, we wondered whether this heterogeneity is also represented in primary human CD4 T cells, which are inherently diverse in nature. UMAP embedding of scRNA-Seq data from lymph node-derived CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szabo et al., 2019</xref>) allowed us to define four cellular clusters based on conventional markers: resting CD4, memory CD4, activated CD4, and effector T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). While ARPC3, ARPC2, ARPC1B, and ARPC5 were strongly and homogenously expressed throughout the clusters, ARPC1A was very weakly expressed and only barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, the highest heterogeneity of expression was displayed by ARPC5L, and its expression levels correlated with the activation status of CD4 T cells, ranging from 15% in resting CD4 T cells to 22% and 31% in memory and activated CD4 T cells to 66% in effector CD4 T cells. Based on this observation, it appears that there is a functional relationship between T cell activation and expression of ARPC5L isoform containing Arp2/3-complexes. In sum, all Arp2/3 subunit isoforms are expressed in Jurkat and primary CD4 T cells, but their expression is heterogeneous in individual cells. Of all subunits, ARPC5L displays the highest heterogenic expression within a given T cell population and the frequency of cells that express ARPC5L is similar to that of cells displaying nuclear actin polymerization in response to T cell activation. Heterogeneously expressed molecules may thus be molecular discriminators that govern nuclear actin polymerization in CD4 T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Distinct ARPC5 isoforms mediate cytoplasmic and nuclear actin polymerization induced by TCR signaling</title><p>Motivated by the notion that Arp2/3-complex isoform subunits might be discriminators that govern actin polymerization in T cells, we went on to systematically test the role of these Arp2/3 subunit isoforms in the context of nuclear and cytoplasmic actin polymerization triggered by TCR signaling. First, we sought to selectively suppress expression of individual isoforms. However, combining gene silencing with expression of a nuclear lifeact-GFP reporter while maintaining a low activation state that would allow us to study the response to T cell activation in primary T cells proved to be challenging. We therefore focused all subsequent work on cell line models, which faithfully capture many aspects of T cell activation-induced actin remodeling including the heterogeneity of Arp2/3 complex subunit expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). For this, we transduced bulk JNLA cultures with isoform-specific shRNAs to reduce the expression of ARPC1A, ARPC1B, ARPC5, or ARPC5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Selective silencing of ARPC1A, ARPC1B, or ARPC5 did not significantly reduce the frequency of cells that displayed NFA in response to P/I. In contrast, JNLA cells with reduced ARPC5L levels were significantly impaired in NFA formation upon stimulation with P/I but also in response to TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). As with NFA, ARPC1A or ARPC1B silenced cells were both able to support cell spreading and formation of cytoplasmic AR after surface-mediated TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref> for a lower magnification overview and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref> for quantification of cell morphologies). Importantly, ARPC5 but not ARPC5L was required for efficient cell spreading and cytoplasmic AR assembly triggered by TCR engagement and cells lacking ARPC5 often displayed aberrant F-actin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C, E, and F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ARPC5 isoforms differentially regulate nuclear and plasma membrane actin polymerization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative immunoblots show knockdown of ARPC1 and ARPC5 isoforms in bulk JNLA cells treated with indicated shRNAs.

In addition, we reintroduced transgenic ARPC5 or ARPC5L mCherry fusions to rescue the KO or mCherry alone as control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Endogenous ARPC5 or ARPC5L levels were strongly reduced (by at least 80%) in the resulting bulk KO cultures as well as in clones expanded from single KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2A</xref>). The levels of other Arp2/3 subunits were mostly unaffected, but the expression of ARPC1B was reduced by almost twofold compared to the non-targeting control (NTC) in both KO cultures. ARPC5 KO, on the other hand, led to a decrease in ARPC1A levels (to 76%) and an increase in ARPC5L levels (to 240%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The nucleofection and transduction procedures used to generate and study these KO cells slightly reduced the overall efficiency of NFA formation in response to T cell activation. Nevertheless, T cell stimulation confirmed that ARPC5 is selectively required for cytoplasmic actin polymerization and is not substituted by the elevated levels of ARPC5L. In turn, ARPC5L is essential for NFA formation and dispensable for cytoplasmic actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>, see mCherry controls, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B–E</xref>).

ARPC5L-driven nuclear actin dynamics precede ARPC5-guided cytoplasmic actin polymerization upon TCR stimulation but whether ARPC5L affects microcluster formation at the plasma mebrane or their function is unclear. We therefore tested whether ARPC5 isoforms differently impact generation and composition of these microclusters formed in response to surface-mediated TCR engagement. Disruption of cytoplasmic actin polymerization upon KO of ARPC5 significantly reduced the number of signaling microclusters as well as the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation (pTyr) or phospho-SLP-76 (pSLP-76) within the microclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E and F–H</xref>). In contrast, loss of ARPC5L had no effect on the amount of TCR signaling-induced microclusters formed or their pSLP-76 content. In turn, the pTyr intensity in these microclusters was reduced relative to that in control cells, albeit to significantly lower extent than in C5 KO cells. These findings are consistent with the idea that ARPC5 selectively regulates actin polymerization events at the plasma membrane, while ARPC5L is involved in nuclear actin polymerization.</p><p>To extend the relevance of ARPC5 isoforms to T cell effector functions, we assessed their contribution to cytokine production in A30.1 cells that produce robust amounts of TNFα and IL-2, 4 or 16 hr post T cell activation. Since we noted that the KO procedure per se impaired cytokine production, ARPC5 isoform gene expression was silenced by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). Inhibition of Arp2/3 activity by CK869 strongly impaired production of both cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). Reducing the expression of either ARPC5 or ARPC5L resulted in a significant but partial reduction of TNFα and IL-2 production. This reduction was less pronounced for ARPC5L than ARPC5 in the case of IL-2, possibly reflecting the lower silencing efficiency for ARPC5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Together, these results revealed that TCR proximal signaling in response to CD4 T cell activation is governed by ARPC5-mediated actin polymerization at the plasma membrane that occurs independently from the formation of nuclear actin filaments mediated by ARPC5L. Optimal cytokine production in response to T cell activation, however, requires both isoforms, suggesting a cooperative function between ARPC5 and ARPC5L for proper cytokine gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Subcellular localization and association with NFA do not determine the functional specificity of ARPC5 isoforms</title><p>We next assessed whether the differential role of ARPC5 and ARPC5L in TCR-induced actin remodeling reflects their distinct cellular distribution. Since immune fluorescence did not allow us to distinguish between the distribution of endogenous ARPC5 and ARPC5L, we examined the localization of transiently expressed, mCherry-tagged isoforms that functionally rescued our KO cell lines. Both mCherry-tagged ARPC5 and ARPC5L had a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution but were also detected as punctae in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Staining of endogenous ARPC5 and ARPC5L by the nondiscriminating anti-ARPC5 antibody revealed similar punctae in the cytoplasm and nucleus with an additional localization at the plasma membrane that was particularly pronounced following surface-mediated TCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Consistently, immunoblot analysis of nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionations revealed that endogenous ARPC5 and ARPC5L are both present in the nucleus, albeit at lower levels than in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This distribution of ARPC5 and ARPC5L was unaffected by the loss of expression of the other ARPC5 isoform. To assess the localization of ARPC5.mCherry and ARPC5L.mCherry relative to the NFA network, we applied two-color super-resolution STED microscopy on P/I-stimulated A301 CD4 T cells, which are best suited to visualize endogenous NFA meshwork in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>).

In fibroblasts and epithelial cells, Arp2/3 also mediates nuclear actin polymerization in response to DNA replication stress induced by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lamm et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with that fact that effective drug concentrations are often elevated in CD4 T cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vesela et al., 2017</xref>), we observed efficient formation of NFA in JNLA cells in response to APH starting at 15 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This response was paralleled by the induction of DNA replication stress as indicated by phosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase CHK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). NFA formation in response to APH was transient with a maximum of cells (approx. 25%) displaying NFA approximately 90 min post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> for tracks of individual cells). The APH-induced NFA meshwork consists of fewer but thicker F-actin bundles that disassemble more slowly than those induced by T cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Next, ARPC5L and ARPC5 KO cells were stimulated in parallel by T cell activation (P/I or anti-CD3/CD28) or APH. For T cell activation, this confirmed the requirement of ARPC5 for the formation of actin rings (AR) and ARPC5L for the NFA network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In contrast, NFA formation in response to APH was indistinguishable to control cells in ARPC5L KO cells but significantly impaired in ARPC5 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and D</xref>). NFA induction by T cell activation or DNA replication stress is thus mediated by specific ARPC5 subunit isoforms containing Arp2/3 complexes. Since both isoforms of ARPC5 are present in the nucleus, their nuclear localization alone cannot determine their respective involvement in nuclear actin polymerization events following a specific stimulus. We therefore tested whether this specificity for ARPC5 isoforms is provided by upstream signaling. NFA formation induced by T cell activation is mediated by nuclear calcium transients and can be inhibited by interfering with nuclear calmodulin by expressing the nuclear calmodulin inhibitor calmodulin binding protein 4 (CAMBP4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monaco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).

Similarly, pharmacological inhibitors of downstream effectors of calmodulin including calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporinA (CsA), calmodulin-kinase kinase inhibitor STO609, as well as the calmodulin-kinase II inhibitors KN93 and KN62 did not prevent NFA induction by APH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

Unfortunately, we were unable to generate stable WASp KO JNLA cells. However, we managed to obtain bulk KO cultures of N-WASP, WASHC5, an essential subunit of the WASH regulatory complex that is required for the NPF function of WASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jia et al., 2010</xref>), and WAVE2. All anti-NPF antibodies we tested recognized a significant number of unspecific bands, but the comparison of differences between NT and KO cells in signal intensities relative to the GAPDH or Tubulin loading control allowed us to identify NPF-specific NPF protein species, whose expression was significantly reduced in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Functional characterization revealed the specific involvement of these NPFs in distinct actin polymerization events: while N-WASP was essential for efficient NFA formation in response to P/I, WASHC5 was dispensable for NFA formation and loss of WAVE2 did not affect the frequency of NFA formation but was associated with the formation of shorter nuclear actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). A role for N-WASP in NFA formation was also supported by the inhibition by a pharmacological N-WASP inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). In contrast, N-WASP was dispensable for cell spreading and AR formation induced by TCR signaling while loss of WASHC5 or WAVE2 significantly impaired these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

NFA formation by TCR signaling is thus governed by a selective pathway that depends on ARPC5L containing Arp2/3 complexes that are activated by N-WASP and nuclear Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. Interestingly, while expression levels of Arp2/3 subunits and isoforms were overall unaltered in NPF KO cells, ARPC5L levels were significantly reduced in N-WASP KO cells, suggesting a co-dependency for stable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Given that (i) nuclear actin polymerization events, such as those induced by TCR signaling or APH-mediated induction of DNA replication stress, are mediated by distinct Arp2/3 complexes with preferences for specific ARPC5 subunits and (ii) Arp2/3 complexes containing both isoforms are functional in the nucleus, it appears that the specificity for a particular ARPC5 isoform is not determined by its subcellular distribution. Rather, the nature of the stimulus is critical for the selective induction of actin polymerization by ARPC5 or ARPC5L containing Arp2/3 complexes (see schematic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our results define responsiveness to nuclear calcium-calmodulin signaling and regulation by the NPF N-WASP as specific triggers of ARPC5L containing complexes. The selective involvement of N-WASP likely reflects that its ability to activate Arp2/3 can be achieved by calcium-calmodulin. This may occur directly via the interaction of N-Wasp with calmodulin, which is known to activate the NPF. Alternatively, the Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP has been reported to be activated by binding to calmodulin. Activated IQGAP could in turn induce N-Wasp by direct interaction or via activation of Rho-GTPases upstream of N-Wasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Le Clainche et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Miki et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pelikan-Conchaudron et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhoads and Friedberg, 1997</xref>). It will be important to dissect which of these scenarios allow ARPC5L to determine the sensitivity of Arp2/3 to regulation by N-WASP-calcium-calmodulin at the molecular level. The identity of the ARPC5 isoform could potentially influence the affinity of Arp2/3 to N-WASP independently of its activation by calcium-calmodulin. However, existing structural and biochemical data cannot explain a direct involvement of ARPC5/C5L in interactions with nucleation-promoting factors (NPFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">von Loeffelholz et al., 2020</xref>). ARPC5 isoforms thus likely undergo specific interactions with additional interaction partners that govern the susceptibility of Arp2/3 complex to activation via N-WASP-calcium-calmodulin. Indeed, a recent study by Fäßler and colleagues reports that in migrating fibroblasts the identity of the involved ARPC5 isoform affects the positioning of the Arp2/3 effectors Mena/VASP and thereby affects filament polymerization velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faessler et al., 2022</xref>). In addition to defining this mechanism, it will be interesting to determine whether induction of ARPC5L-containing complexes by calcium-calmodulin can also occur in the cytoplasm and how the observed stabilization of ARPC5L expression by N-WASP contributes to the regulation of this pathway. Our attempts to gain spatio-temporal information on Arp2/3 complexes containing specific ARPC5 isoforms with respect to these NPFs were hampered by high background staining of anti-NPF antibodies and toxicity of co-overexpression of NPF and C5 isoform and new experimental approaches need to be developed to tackle this issue.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Graphical summary of our findings.</title><p>Schematic model for Arp2/3-dependent differential regulation of actin dynamics induced upon TCR engagement (left) compared to the induction of replication stress by aphidicolin (APH) (right).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82450-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In contrast, Arp2/3 complexes containing ARPC5 such as those involved in DNA replication stress trigger nuclear actin polymerization independently of calcium-calmodulin-N-WASP and are likely regulated by another NPF. It is tempting to speculate that the regulation of ARPC5L containing Arp2/3 complexes by nuclear calcium-calmodulin reflects the requirement for rapid conversion of an extracellular signal, for example, to elicit a transcriptional response. In line with this scenario, calcium-mediated induction of nuclear actin assembly by the formin INF2 in mouse fibroblasts also represents a rapid response to conversion of an extracellular signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, DNA replication stress provides a signal from within the nucleus without the need for a fast second messenger. Notably, T cell activation or DNA replication stress induces NFA networks of different filament morphology and dynamics. These architectural differences may reflect physiological properties of Arp2/3 complexes with different ARPC5 isoforms and translate into distinct functional roles. In this scenario, thin/dynamic filaments may mediate transcriptional regulation following TCR engagement while thicker and more stable filaments could exert mechanical functions during DNA repair. The ARPC5 isoform subunit specificity of Arp2/3 activity in the cytoplasm and the nucleus identified herein opens avenues for dissecting the roles of the transient nuclear actin filament network such as the control of gene expression triggered by T cell activation. The currently available data link the visualization of nuclear actin dynamics in individual cells to the analysis of cellular functions in bulk populations. Our single-cell expression analysis revealed a good correlation between ARPC5L expression and NFA formation. However, the frequency of cells that respond to T cell activation with cytokine production is significantly lower than that of cells displaying NFA formation, suggesting that NFA formation is necessary but not sufficient for cytokine production and might also regulate other T cell effector programs. Dissecting the specific role of NFA in gene expression control in future studies will require analyzing the transcriptional activity of single cells of which the NFA response has been recorded previously.</p><p>The preference for distinct ARPC5 isoforms thus likely adjusts the activity of Arp2/3 complex to divergent actin polymerization events that are triggered by specific upstream signals. Similarly, Arp2/3 complexes containing different ARP3 isoforms were recently shown to be differentially regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abella et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galloni et al., 2021</xref>). The subunit isoform composition of Arp2/3 complexes thus emerges as an important parameter that allows Arp2/3 to mediate distinct actin polymerization events tailored to specific activation signals at selected subcellular sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>All cell lines were received by ATCC, were tested negative for mycoplasma, and were recently authenticated via STR profiling.

BCA protein measurements were performed using the Pierce BCA protein estimation kit, followed by loading 500 µg protein per sample with 25 µl RFP-Trap bead (ChromoTek) slurry for immunoprecipitation overnight at 4° on a rotator. All other steps of the pulldown were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ChromoTek). Immunoblot analysis was performed with the indicated antibodies (mentioned in the reagent section).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsopoulidis et al., 2019</xref>), to study the actin dynamics in JNLA cells activated on stimulatory coverslips, 1–2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells are put on the stimulatory coverslips for 5 min at 37℃ before fixing them with 3% PFA. Following permeabilization and blocking, coverslips are incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in 1% BSA (PBS). For phospho-specific targets/antibodies, all steps were done in 1× TBS. The following dilutions are used for the primary antibodies: rabbit anti-pTyr (1:100), rabbit anti-pSLP76 (1:1000), and mouse anti-mCherry (1:500). Species-specific secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 568/647 (1:1000) were used along with Phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 488 (1:600) for staining the F-actin. Although the nuclear lifeact reporter carries a nuclear export signal and thus also labels cytoplasmic F-actin, cortical F-actin is only labeled with low efficacy following permeabilization/fixation. An additional F-actin stain with Phalloidin is therefore required to efficiently stain and visualize cortical actin filaments. Coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Merck Millipore) and analyzed by either epifluorescence microscopy (IX81 SIF-3 microscope and Xcellence Pro software; Olympus) or confocal microscopy (TCS SP8 microscope and LAS X software; from Leica).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Generation of CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout cells</title><p>We designed three single-guideRNAs (sgRNA) for knocking out each of our gene of interest with the help of Synthego’s publicly available CRISPR design tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://design.synthego.com/#/">https://design.synthego.com/#/</ext-link>). The sgRNA sequences are also mentioned in the MDAR report. The sgRNAs were premixed with Cas9.3NLS (IDT) to create ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) for faster and better editing efficiency as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albanese et al., 2022</xref>). Premixed RNPs were then nucleofected (using either Amaxa 2b or Nucleofector 4D, Lonza) into the JNLA cells. JNLA cells post nucleofection are maintained in RPMI containing 10% FBS as a heterogeneous pool, followed by knockout (KO) validation in the bulk pool using immunoblotting. For single KO clone expansion, nucleofected cell pools were expanded gradually for 4–5 d until they are validated for KO. Post KO validation, the cell suspension was diluted stepwise to reach a density of 0.5 cells/50 μl to seed 50 μl/well in 96-U-bottom plates. Cells were then kept undisturbed for 1–2 wk in the incubator until we observe change in color of the media. Wells with multiple colonies growing were discarded, whereas single clonal populations were expanded gradually further until they were validated for KO using western blotting and surveyor assay, followed by initial functional characterization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Nuclear and cytoplasmic biochemical fractionation</title><p>JNLA cells were fractionated using the REAP method as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>. 8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were harvested for each condition. The only difference we adapted is the manual sonication instead of an automated one. The number of sonication cycle varies between 10–15 (60 s ON, 10 s OFF) with the manual sonicator at 4°C or with ice. Each of the nuclear, cytoplasmic, and total cell fractions are then immunoblotted as described above. As and when necessary, immunoblots were often stripped in 1× stripping buffer, followed by blocking for 1 hr at RT and re-probing with primary antibodies ON at 4°C. The protocol we followed for stripping including the preparation of stripping buffer was adapted from Abcam’s published protocol online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/stripping%20for%20reprobing.pdf">https://www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/stripping%20for%20reprobing.pdf</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Single-cell RNA-seq analysis</title><p>For single-cell RNA-seq analysis of Jurkat CD4 T cell, we used data from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zheng et al., 2017</xref> stored at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/datasets">http://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell/datasets</ext-link>.

To reduce batch effects, we integrated the primary T cell samples (GSM3589410 resting primary T cells and GSM3589411 activated primary T cells) or (Jurkat cells, 50% Jurkat:293T and 99%:1 Jurkat:293T Cell Mixtures) via the Seurat integration procedure. In a second step, only cells with less than 5% mitochondria expression were retained. The data was normalized and scored using Seurat NormalizeData and ScaleData function and decomposed using PCA. UMAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McInnes et al., 2020</xref>) embeddings were then computed using the first five (Jurkat) or eight (primary CD4 T cells) dimensions as input. Based on the UMAP embedding, further quality control was performed by removing clusters of contaminating cells (identified by differential expression) and of poor-quality cells (identified as outliers by number of genes expressed or percentage mitochondria). Subsequently, all cells that did not express T cells markers (FOXP3, CD8A, CD8B, IL2, IFNG, TNF, MIR155HG, IL4R, GZMB, MAL) were removed. To enrich for CD4 T cells, clusters expressing CD8A, CD8B, GZMB were filtered out. Primary CD4 T cell populations were annotated with conventional T cell markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Because of the low heterogeneity within the Jurkat population, all computed clusters were merged to one. Cell cycle scoring analysis was performed with cell cycle marker genes reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowalczyk et al., 2015</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical measurements</title><p>Statistical evaluation was performed with GraphPad Prism 8 using different two-tailed tests: for two groups, unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test with Welch’s correction (for nonequal standard deviation) was performed. Based on the experiment question asked, for multiple groups (more than two), either one-way ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis test for nonparametric data sets) with no correction for multiple comparison was performed to keep the comparison of control to test sample as a stand-alone comparison or one-way ANOVA (for parametric data sets) with Tukey’s multiple comparison was performed when multiple comparisons were analyzed. The number of independent data points always refers to biological replicates as mentioned in the legends, also indicating the technical replicates, when performed for some of the experiments. Each data point as mentioned in the figure legends represents the mean of one independent experiment with the errors calculated based on mean ± SD.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Pekka Lappalainen as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The imaging experiments focusing on the nuclear localization of ARPC5 and ARPC5L should be strengthened. The authors need to examine how well do the tagged proteins incorporate into native Arp2/3 complex. This could be done e.g. with native PAGE. Moreover, possible co-localization of ARPC5 and ARPC5L with N-WASP in the nucleus could be examined.</p><p>2. The authors should examine if there are any functional consequences of losing either ARPC5 or ARPC5L. This could be approached e.g. by using Jurkat cells, because the authors previously showed that nuclear actin has consequences for cytokine expression in Jurkat cells.</p><p>3. There are also some technical issues that should be addressed to strengthen the study, and these are listed in the 'specific comments' by the three reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Critique:</p><p>Figure 1 – not too clear how the quantifications were done.</p><p>&quot;All data points indicate mean{plus minus} s.d values from three independent experiments with at least 40 cells analyzed per condition per experiment&quot;.</p><p>There are only 3 data points within the bar charts shown!

The imaging experiments focusing on the nuclear localization of ARPC5 and ARPC5L should be strengthened. The authors need to examine how well do the tagged proteins incorporate into native Arp2/3 complex. This could be done e.g. with native PAGE. Moreover, possible co-localization of ARPC5 and ARPC5L with N-WASP in the nucleus could be examined.</p></disp-quote><p>The Way lab had previously demonstrated in HeLa cells by co-immunoprecipitation that ectopically expressed C5 and C5L isoforms are assembled into Arp2/3 complexes with similar efficacy (Abella JV et al., 2016). We performed analogous experiments in Jurkat CD4 T cells transiently expressing C5.mCherry or C5L.mCherry. The results, now shown as figure S3D in the revised manuscript, reveal that both ectopically expressed C5 isoforms are incorporated into endogenous Arp2/3 complexes with comparable efficacy.</p><p>We also attempted to address whether ARPC5 and ARPC5L colocalize with N-WASP in the nucleus of CD4 T cells. Since we lack antibodies that reliably discriminate between both C5 isoforms in immunofluorescence and the various anti N-WASP antibodies we tested all gave marked background signals in CD4 T cells, this had to be approached by ectopic expression of ARPC5/C5L as well as N-WASP. We attempted this by co-transfection as well as by simultaneous as well as consecutive lentiviral transduction, however the frequency of cells with detectable co-expression of both factors was too low (below 2%) to allow robust co-localization analysis. Overexpression of C5 isoforms with the NPF thus appears to be toxic in CD4 T cells, which prevented us from performing this relevant analysis. This is now discussed in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors should examine if there are any functional consequences of losing either ARPC5 or ARPC5L. This could be approached e.g. by using Jurkat cells, because the authors previously showed that nuclear actin has consequences for cytokine expression in Jurkat cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we assessed cytokine production in response to T cell activation in a CD4 T cell line that responds to PMA+Ionomycin stimulation by the formation of nuclear actin filaments (A3.01 cells, see Tsopoulidis et al., 2019) and the production of TNF-a as well as IL-2. Knockdown experiments reveal that both, ARPC5L and ARPC5, are required for full cytokine production (new figure 4I-J, S5D-E). Thus, cytoplasmic as well as nuclear actin dynamics and hence also both ARPC5 isoforms contribute to cytokine production of CD4 T cells in response to T cell activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This is now explained better in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1F is the response transient? Or are these filaments stable over long time?</p></disp-quote><p>The nuclear actin filament network induced in response to T cell activation is transient. As we characterized in our previous study, filament formation initiates within seconds of stimulatory contacts and the network is typically dissolved after approximately 5 min in the majority of cells (Tsoupoulidis et al. 2019). Formation of the nuclear network precedes actin polymerization in the cytoplasm, which is typically initiated 2 min post stimulatory contact and the resulting F-actin structure (circumferential F-actin ring) persists over 10-20 min. The transient nature of the nuclear F-actin network and the different timings of cytoplasmic vs nuclear F-actin structures is now emphasized in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1G only about 25% cells respond with nuclear actin formation?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct, nuclear F-actin is only detected in a fraction of stimulated cells. The percentage of cells responding with nuclear actin formation slightly varies between different types of stimulation but ranges between 22-30% between PMA+ionomycin stimulation and stimulatory coverslips for in Jurkat cells. While we cannot exclude that the sensitivity of our visual detection of nuclear F-actin represents a limitation, it is noteworthy that responses of CD4 T cells cultures are known to be heterogeneous and e.g. not all cells express cytokines in response to activation (Figure S6D-E). As a first possible explanation for this heterogeneity, we mined available single cell RNASeq data for expression of ARPC5 and ARPC5L. This analysis revealed that distinct subfractions of CD4 T cell lines but also primary CD4 T cells express one or the other subunit isoform and that the frequency with which cells display nuclear actin polymerization in response to T cell activation roughly matches that of cells that express ARPC5L. This suggests that the ARPC5 isoform expression status governs the response only individual CD4 T cells to activation. These results are now included as Figures 2B-C and S2C-E in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 seems to be more of a supplemental information perhaps?</p></disp-quote><p>We added the new single cell RNASeq data to this figure to address the important aspect raised by the reviewer above and hence kept the figure in the main body of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3, only 1 shRNA was used, no rescue experiments were performed.

Because this is a limitation for conclusions made.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that the shRNA data alone are not conclusive. Since knock down efficiencies achieved by shRNA were moderate, we moved on to knock out the respective genes, which resulted in more robust protein depletion and is used for most of the reminder of the study. We therefore also conducted the rescue experiments in knock out cells. Since the results from shRNA and knock out experiments are consistent, we did not carry out rescue experiments in the shRNA treated cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4, why was PMA plus Inonomycin used here and how does that compare to the other stimuli or using them singularly?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 1, stimulation by anti-CD3/28 or PMA/Ionomycin results in the induction of comparable nuclear actin dynamics, but PMA/Iono does not induce cytoplasmic actin polymerization because it bypasses proximal TCR signaling and activates the cascade downstream of plasma membrane associated factors, thus it represents a useful tool to activate T cells by circumventing the need for actin polymerization driven receptor and tyrosine kinase clustering at the plasma membrane. It is therefore used when we want to focus our analysis on the immediate signaling that impacts nuclear events. We saw previously (Tsopoulidis et al., 2019) that ionomycin alone is sufficient to trigger nuclear F-actin formation but that the combination of PMA/Ionomycin is slightly more efficient. We therefore use this combination in our experiments here and explain this in more detail in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 and 7, how did they determine whether they actually successfully and reliably induced replication stress?

Building on this finding as well as our new technology to achieve activation neutral gene editing in resting CD4 T cells (Albanese et al., 2022 Nature Methods), we extensively tried to conduct as many experiments in primary CD4 T cells as possible. However, live visualization of nuclear F-actin formation relies on prior transduction of the nuclear lifeact.GFP reporter constructs, which is only efficient in activated CD4 T cells. We therefore had to activate the cells, transduce, wait until the activation state returned to baseline, and then re-activate to visualize the formation of nuclear F-actin. This procedure was associated with significant cytotoxicity and it was impossible to distinguish between TCR-specific and unspecific nuclear F-actin event. Combining this approach with knock down or knock out procedures, as would be required to conduct functional experiments in primary cells, did not yield any viable cells to study. We therefore had to focus our experiments on cell line models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors use tagged ARPC5 and APRC5L to show that both isoforms can be found in the nucleus.

This certainly includes the question how nuclear F-actin governs selective gene expression programs. The analysis of available RNASeq data sets revealed that indeed, Arpc5L expression seems to be increased in cytokine expressing effector CD4 T cells relative to non-cytokine expressing cells (see revised Figure 2, Figure S2). While this suggests that Arpc5L isoforms might play a role in shaping T cell identity and the immune response in general, addressing this experimentally is very complicated since the microscopic analysis of nuclear actin dynamics as immediate response to T cell activation needs to be coupled to cytokine detection in the very same cell many hours later. We started to explore the use of advanced microfluidics systems in which microscopy can be coupled to morphotype-based selection of individual cells but are far from having a robust system for such analysis available. We therefore feel that exploiting the subunit isoform selectivity identified here as tools for mechanistic dissection represents an ambitious new study. This future perspective is now mentioned in the revised text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.
