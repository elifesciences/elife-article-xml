Population-wide restrictions (‘lockdowns’) were imposed worldwide to minimise the spread of infection with COVID-19 and to lessen the burden on the healthcare systems. Within some healthcare systems, resources were reallocated to ensure sufficient capacity to take care of COVID-19 patients in need of hospitalisation.</p><p>The prioritisations within the healthcare system resulted in a temporary closure of the cancer screening programmes in most countries worldwide. The reason for this was mainly to decrease the risk of women being infected by COVID-19 and due to the shortage of health professionals as they were involved in pandemic-related activities. Congruently, the European Society for Medical Oncology deemed population-based mammography screening to be of low priority at the start of the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Azambuja et al., 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, in Denmark the mammography screening programme continued – and invitations and reminders were sent out – throughout the pandemic since early detection of cancer was considered of high priority. Studies from other countries have shown marked reductions in breast cancer screening during the pandemic as a result of the temporary closures of the screening programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ng and Hamilton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cairns et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jidkova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sprague et al., 2021</xref>); however, the participation in mammography screening in Denmark with a continuation of the programme has not yet been described.</p><p>Disruptions to the mammography screening programme could result in later diagnosis of breast cancer and a more advanced stage of diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Figueroa et al., 2021</xref>), and the disruptions to the programme are therefore worrisome. Congruently, studies from the Netherlands found that the temporary closure of the screening programme resulted in a reduction in the number of breast cancer diagnoses, in particular screen-detected breast cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eijkelboom et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dinmohamed et al., 2020</xref>) and in particular among early-stage tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eijkelboom et al., 2021a</xref>). In Denmark, an early study reported that a 19% reduction in the number of breast cancers was observed in the spring of 2020 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Skovlund et al., 2022</xref>). Contrarily, more recent data from the Danish Breast Cancer Group show a modest reduction of 5% in the number of breast cancer in 2020 compared to 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">The Danish Clinical Quality Program – National Clinical Registries, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The participation in mammography screening is generally lower among women with low socio-economic status and among immigrant women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhargava et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kristiansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). This gap may have worsened during the pandemic. One study from Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch et al., 2022</xref> found that the participation in mammography screening decreased with age and with lower socio-economic level post-COVID-19; however, to our knowledge, no studies have examined participation according to ethnicity, cohabitation status, or healthcare use throughout the pandemic.</p><p>We examined the participation in mammography screening in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison with the previous years. Moreover, we assessed whether the participation in mammography screening during the COVID-19 pandemic differed according to socio-economic variables.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>The study is set in Denmark, which has a population of approximately 5.8 million inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>). In Denmark, there is free access to healthcare for all inhabitants funded via taxes. Danish population-based administrative and health registries can be linked using the unique personal identifier, assigned to all residents at birth or immigration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The mammography screening programme</title><p>In Denmark, all women aged 50-69 years old are invited to participate in mammography screening every 2 y (except women, who have opted out of the programme). The mammography screening programme is administered by the five Danish regions. Digital invitation letters with a fixed appointment and link to an information leaflet are sent to the women. In the capital region, previous non-participants who have not responded to neither invitation nor reminder letter in the previous screening round do not receive a fixed appointment but only an invitation letter when it is time for the next mammography screening. The women can reschedule their appointments by e-mail, through a website, or by telephone. At the mammography screening session, two standardised X-ray images of each breast are performed and these images are evaluated independently by two radiologists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mikkelsen et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark</title><p>Three main waves of the COVID-19 pandemic have occurred in Denmark, that is, in the spring of 2020, in the winter of 2020/2021, and again in the winter of 2021/2022 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Statens Serum Institut, 2021a</xref>).</p><p>The pandemic response in Denmark comprised ‘lockdowns,’ COVID-19 testing, and COVID-19 vaccination. The first lockdown was imposed in Denmark on 11 March 2020, closing down schools and workplaces and restricting travel. This was done in an effort to minimise the spread of infection and reduce the potential burden on the healthcare system. Within the healthcare system, elective procedures were cancelled or postponed and resources were reallocated to take care of patients in need of hospitalisation because of COVID-19. The subsequent lockdowns occurred together with the new surges of infection. Widespread COVID-19 testing was implemented in Denmark from May 2020 providing PCR and antigen COVID-19 tests free of charge to the whole population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Pottegård et al., 2020</xref>). Vaccination against COVID-19 was implemented in Denmark in December 2020, and by March 2022, approximately 81% of the population had received two doses and more than 61% had received three doses of the vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Statens Serum Institut, 2021b</xref>). In Denmark, individuals living in nursing homes were vaccinated first, followed by individuals ≥85 y, then healthcare personnel, thereafter individuals with underlying health conditions and their relatives, and finally, individuals were offered the COVID-19 vaccination by decreasing age (75–79 y, 65–74 y, 60–64 y, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sundhedsstyrelsen, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Study population</title><p>We included all invitations to women aged 50–69 y invited to participate in mammography screening from 1 January 2016 to 30 September 2021 as registered in the Danish Quality Database for Mammography Screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mikkelsen et al., 2016</xref>), which retrieves information on invitations to the national mammography screening programme directly from the regional administrative systems.</p><p>We excluded invitations to women with an unknown postal address (N = 753 in 406 women), invitations to women residing in the Faroe Islands or Greenland (N = 310 in 220 women), invitations to women with unknown/uncertain living status (N = 199 in 146 women), invitations to women who emigrated within 1 y since invitation (N = 2692 in 2,581 women), invitations to women who died within 1 y since invitation (N = 8860 in 8,854 women), and women excluded due to dates being out of order (e.g. pre-booked date for mammography screening was prior to date of invitation; N = 8218 in 1,023 women) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the study population.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83541-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Exposure of interest</title><p>The COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark and the different phases of the pandemic are the exposure of interest.

From <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>, we obtained information on ethnicity, cohabitation status, educational level, and disposable income. Ethnicity was categorised as Danish descent, Western immigrant, and non-Western immigrant and descendants of immigrants in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>. Cohabitation status was categorised as living alone, co-habiting/co-living, and married (i.e. married or registered partnership) in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>. Education level was defined in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) of the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization into short (ISCED levels 1-2), medium (ISCED levels 3–4), and long (ISCED levels 5–8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Statistics Denmark, 2021</xref>). Income was defined as official disposable income depreciated to 2015 level and categorised into five quintiles. To indicate the level of healthcare use by each patient, we counted the total number of contacts to general practitioners, private practising medical specialists, physiotherapists, and chiropractors in the year for invitation as registered in the Danish National Health Service Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersen et al., 2011</xref>), which contains information on visits to primary healthcare (e.g. general practitioners and medical specialists) in Denmark since 1990.

From first reopening and onwards, the participation in mammography screening normalised. A lower participation was, nevertheless, seen among immigrants and among women with a low income.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Comparison with previous studies and explanation of findings</title><p>Throughout most of the world, the mammography screening programmes were paused at the start of the pandemic. The screening programmes were stopped mainly to decrease the risk of women being infected by COVID-19 while being screened, but also due to the shortage of health professionals, as they were involved in pandemic-related activities (e.g. radiologist addressed to emergency department to assure diagnosis of pneumonia). This led to marked reductions in screening mammographies performed at the start of the pandemic in many other countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ng and Hamilton, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cairns et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jidkova et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Miller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sprague et al., 2021</xref>). In Denmark, the mammography screening programme continued throughout the pandemic, and the situation in Denmark is therefore unique and few studies are comparable to our study.</p><p>We found a short-term reduction in participation in mammography screening at the start of the pandemic, which may have been caused by the governmental instructions to stay at home. Congruently, a qualitative study from Denmark found that women weighed the benefits of screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19 in their decision-making process as to whether to participate in mammography screening during the pandemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kirkegaard et al., 2021</xref>). This was also demonstrated in a study from the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schifferdecker et al., 2021</xref>). With longer follow-up time, we found that most women did participate in screening, indicating a postponement of participation in mammography screening. COVID-19 vaccination was implemented in Denmark in December 2020, which could explain the unaltered participation in mammography screening during the second reopening of the society. During the pandemic, initiatives were made throughout Denmark to inform women of the possibility of participating in mammography screening during the pandemic and to inform women about safety measures when participating in screening; for example, a letter was sent to women opting out of the programme (i.e. withdrawing from the screening programme) in some regions, in some regions press releases were sent out and in some regions, and women calling in to cancel their appointment for mammography screening were individually counselled and encouraged to consider participation later on (instead of waiting for the next biannual round of screening). This could explain the overall modest reduction in participation. Before the pandemic, 83.1% of women participated in mammography screening within 365 d, and this was reduced to 79.6% for those invited during pre-lockdown and to 81.5% for those invited during the first lockdown, indicating that a minor reduction in participation remained even with the longest follow-up time. However, the participation in screening for cervical and bowel cancer in Denmark during the pandemic showed similar patterns, with a decrease in the short term, but to a much lesser extent in the longer term. This indicates that people invited for screening in Denmark more often postponed their participation by a few months, rather than not attending at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olesen et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Olesen et al., 2023b</xref>; this study).</p><p>The decreased participation at the start of the pandemic was most pronounced among immigrants and in particular among women with a low income. The participation dropped by 3.3% among women of Danish descent for those invited during pre-lockdown, whilst the participation dropped by 5.0% among Western and 5.7% among non-Western immigrants. Even larger differences were seen when stratifying by income level: among women with the lowest income, the participation dropped by 6.9% during pre-lockdown and by 4.6% during the first lockdown, whilst the participation among women with the highest income was almost unchanged. This indicates that the restrictions imposed in Denmark may have affected some groups of women disproportionally. A study from Spain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bosch et al., 2022</xref> found that the participation in mammography screening decreased with age and with lower socio-economic level post-COVID-19; this has also been reported for the two other screening programmes in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olesen et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Olesen et al., 2023b</xref>; this study). The evidence is scarce on participation according to ethnicity throughout the pandemic; however, the lower participation during the pandemic has also been demonstrated for bowel and cervical cancer screening in Denmark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Olesen et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Olesen et al., 2023b</xref>; this study). Immigrants may find it more difficult to navigate the healthcare system in Denmark, and possibly this has been exacerbated by the pandemic where the majority of the communication at press conferences and news media were conveyed in Danish, a language that may not be fully comprehensive to all immigrants. Moreover, the COVID-19 vaccination coverage was lower among immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gram et al., 2023</xref>), which could partly explain the lower screening participation. Women with a low income may not have access to private means of transport and may have been reluctant to use public transportation to reach a mammography screening clinic during the pandemic, which could explain the lower participation among this group of women. Women without private means of transport generally have a lower participation in mammography screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>), and this may have worsened during the pandemic. The lower participation in screening continued throughout the study period among women with a low income, indicating that the pandemic had lasting negative effects on the participation in mammography screening in this group of women.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>An important strength of the study is the high quality of data covering the entire population of women invited to participate in the mammography screening programme in Denmark during the pandemic and the years before. Danish administrative and health registries have a high completeness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thygesen et al., 2011</xref>), which is also the case for the Danish Quality Database for Mammography Screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mikkelsen et al., 2016</xref>). Limitations of the study should, however, be acknowledged. In this study, we calculated participation in mammography screening from the date of invitation to the date of participation; however, the length of time from invitation to the pre-booked appointment may vary depending on the capacity of the mammography screening clinics. A more accurate measure may have been time from first pre-booked appointment to participation; however, this information is unfortunately not available in the Danish Quality Database for Mammography Screening. We did not have data on underlying disease or vaccination status, which could affect one’s perception of risk and willingness to participate in screening. We did adjust for age, and since age is strongly associated with the level of comorbidity, the theoretical impact of comorbidity is reduced. Moreover, the severity of the pandemic and the pandemic response was different in different countries, with Denmark managing to keep the number of hospitalisations due to COVID-19 at a relatively low level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Statens Serum Institut, 2021a</xref>), and our observations may not be directly transferable to all countries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Implications of the findings</title><p>Our study indicates that women postponed screening at the start of the pandemic. The mammography screening remained open throughout the pandemic, and this is contrasting to the health communication conveyed at the national televised press conferences at the start of the pandemic in Denmark instructing people to stay at home and cancel appointments. Inconsistent health messages may thus have resulted in a reduced participation in screening. The pandemic was an unprecedented situation, and the health authorities had to navigate unknown terrain; however, in hindsight it is important to ensure that the health communication is aligned among all parties to ensure that women both feel safe and that it is indeed safe to participate in screening.</p><p>We identified groups of women who had a low participation in screening before the pandemic and found that for some groups the participation was even lower at the start of the pandemic (immigrants and women with a low income), and for women with a low income the participation remained low throughout the pandemic. Our study thus indicates that the social inequity in mammography screening participation was slightly exacerbated during the pandemic.</p><p>The effect of the short-term reduction in mammography screening participation on the detection of early-stage breast cancer is unknown. A study from Denmark by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Skovlund et al., 2022</xref> reported a 19% reduction in breast cancers diagnosed in the spring of 2020; however, this large reduction may partly be a result of a delayed registration of cancer diagnoses at the time of that study as cancer diagnoses have been shown to be incompletely registered for months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, more recent data from the Danish Breast Cancer Group show a modest reduction of 5% in the number of breast cancers in 2020 compared to 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">The Danish Clinical Quality Program – National Clinical Registries, 2022</xref>). Nonetheless, some women may have changed their health-seeking behaviour possibly not contacting their general practitioner at the start of the pandemic despite symptoms of breast cancer. Moreover, our study supports that delayed participation in mammography screening might to some degree contribute to a reduction in the number of breast cancers diagnosed in the spring of 2020. However, since by far most women merely postponed their participation and showed up later, the lower participation at the start of the pandemic most likely only has a minor effect on the overall mortality from breast cancer at a population level.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that the short-term mammography screening participation was reduced at the start of the pandemic, whilst only a minor reduction in participation was observed with longer follow-up time.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paolo Giorgi Rossi (Reviewer #1).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision clearly marked in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please add reasons or explanations around screening services shut-off.</p><p>2) The issue of safety for women and the lack of health professionals during pandemic waves should be explained as the rationale of stopping screening.</p><p>3) Consider shortening the description of results and including some discussion on the differences between the mammography program with results from the other Danish cancer screening programs (e.g., for colorectal or cervical cancer) reported on by the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Background</p><p>Lines 97-98 &quot;however, to our 97 knowledge no studies have examined participation according to ethnicity, cohabitation status or 98 healthcare use throughout the pandemic.&quot; I suggest avoiding sentences like this, it is extremely likely that they will be outdated in a few months.

In Denmark, the mammography screening programme was kept open throughout the COVID-19 pandemic – thus there were no shut-downs of the screening services (see Background section page 3, lines 76-78).

Opting out refers to women actively drops out of the screening programme permanently (or until the actively signs up again). These women are thus different from women who do not participate after an invitation i.e. non-participants. We have clarified this in the text by clarifying that opting out refers to withdrawing form the programme (page 9, line 320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 307-308: &quot;women calling in to cancel their appointment for mammography screening&quot; what's the difference between opting out and calling to cancel the appointment?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. When opting pout, women drops out permanently, whereas when cancelling the appointment wither leads to a reminder or a new invitation within two years time (as the screening programme is biannual).

The 19% decrease is from a previous study (Skovlund et al) that was limited by the data sources used and thus a delay in the registration of cancer diagnoses. More recent data from the Danish Breast Cancer Group (DBCG) suggest that the decline in breast cancer diagnoses &quot;only&quot; was 5% in 2020 compared to 2019.

Please see our response to the same issue in the public review.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A question for the authors: what happened around January 2019?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We are not aware of any specific changes in the programme in January 2019. We expect that this is fluctuations in screening participation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
