force-producing units of all striated muscles. Their nanoarchitecture critically depends on the large titin protein, which in vertebrates spans from the sarcomeric Z-disc to the M-band and hence links actin and myosin filaments stably together. This ensures sarcomeric integrity and determines the length of vertebrate sarcomeres. However, the instructive role of titins for sarcomeric architecture outside of vertebrates is not as well understood. Here, we used a series of nanobodies, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin nanobody toolbox, recognising specific domains of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs Sallimus and Projectin to determine their precise location in intact flight muscles. By combining nanobodies with DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy, we found that, similar to vertebrate titin, Sallimus bridges across the flight muscle I-band, whereas Projectin is located at the beginning of the A-band. Interestingly, the ends of both proteins overlap at the I-band/A-band border, revealing a staggered organisation of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs. This architecture may help to stably anchor Sallimus at the myosin filament and hence ensure efficient force transduction during flight.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>From ants to humans, the muscles that set an organism in motion are formed of bundles of fiber-like cells which can shorten and lengthen at will. At the microscopic level, changes in muscle cell lengths are underpinned by contractile filaments formed of multiple repeats of a basic unit, known as the sarcomere. Each unit is bookended by intricate ‘Z-discs’ and features an ‘M-band’ in its center.</p><p>Three protein types give a sarcomere its ability to shorten and expand at will: two types of filaments (myosin and actin), which can slide on one another; and a spring-like molecule known as titin, which ensures that the unit does not fall apart by mechanically connecting myosin and actin. More specifically, actin filaments are anchored to the Z-discs and extend towards the M-band, while myosin filaments are centered around the M-band and extend towards the Z-discs. As myosin and actin slide alongside each other, the overlap between the two types of filaments increases or decreases and the whole unit changes its length.</p><p>In vertebrates, one gigantic molecule of titin spans from the Z-disc to the M-band, linking together actin and myosin filaments and determining the length of the sarcomere. In insects and other invertebrates, however, this single molecule is replaced by two titin proteins known as Projectin and Sallimus. Understanding how these titins work together remains unclear and difficult to study. Traditional approaches are unable to precisely label titin in an environment teaming with other molecules, and they cannot offer the nanometer resolution required to dissect sarcomere organization.</p><p>As a response, Schueder, Mangeol et al. combined super-resolution microscopy and a new toolbox of labelling molecules known as nanobodies to track the position of Sallimus and Projectin in the flight muscles of fruit flies. These experiments revealed that the two proteins are arranged in tandem along the length of the sarcomere, forming a structure that measures about 350 nm. Sallimus is anchored in the Z-disc and it runs alongside actin until it reaches the end of a myosin filament; there, it overlaps with Projectin for about 10 nm. Projectin then stretches for 250 nm along the length of the beginning myosin filament.</p><p>These findings confirm the importance of titin in dictating the length of a sarcomere; they suggest that, in invertebrates, this role is split between two proteins, each possibly ruling over a section of the sarcomere. In addition, the work by Schueder, Mangeol et al. demonstrate the value of combining nanobodies and super-resolution microscopy to study complex structures in tissues.</p></abstract><kwd-group

These forces are produced by conserved macromolecular machines called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are organised into long periodic chains called myofibrils that mechanically span the entire muscle fibre length and thus sarcomere contraction results in muscle contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gautel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huxley, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemke and Schnorrer, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The sarcomeric architecture is conserved in striated muscles across animals. Sarcomeres are bordered by two Z-discs, which anchor the plus ends of parallel actin filaments. These extend towards the centrally located bipolar myosin filaments that are cross-linked at the M-band of the sarcomere. In vertebrate sarcomeres, actin and myosin filaments are mechanically linked by the connecting filament built by the gigantic titin protein, whose N-terminus is anchored to α-actinin at the Z-disc while its C-terminus is embedded within the sarcomeric M-band. Thus, titin spans as a linear protein across half a sarcomere in vertebrate muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gautel and Djinović-Carugo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lange et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Squire et al., 2005</xref>). This stereotypic sarcomere architecture results in a defined sarcomere length (distance between two neighbouring Z-discs), which is about 3 µm in relaxed human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ehler and Gautel, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Llewellyn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Regev et al., 2011</xref>), and is responsible for the typical striated appearance of skeletal muscles.</p><p>The defined sarcomeric architecture sparked the ‘titin ruler hypothesis’, proposing that the long titin protein rules sarcomere length in vertebrate muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2017</xref>). Recently, this hypothesis has been strongly supported by in vivo genetic evidence. Deletion of parts of titin’s flexible I-band or its stiff A-band regions in mouse skeletal muscle resulted in a shortening of the sarcomeric I-band or A-band, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tonino et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent evidence substantiated that titin is the main sarcomeric component responsible for the passive tension of the muscle, suggesting that mechanical tension present in relaxed muscle is stretching titin into its extended conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Swist et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, titin mechanically links actin and myosin filaments together and is responsible for establishing and maintaining sarcomeric architecture in vertebrate striated muscle.</p><p>Striated muscle architecture is not restricted to vertebrates but is conserved in insects and nematodes. However, in contrast to vertebrates, titin’s role in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> appears to be split in two proteins, one containing the flexible I-band features and the other the stiff A-band features of titin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flaherty et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Porto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tskhovrebova and Trinick, 2003</xref>). Surprisingly, the sarcomere length in flies and worms is still stereotypic for the respective muscle fibre type. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> the sarcomere length is about 3.5 µm for indirect flight muscles and about 8 µm for larval body wall muscles. To date, it is unclear how sarcomere length in these muscles is determined. Furthermore, it is unknown how the titin homologs are precisely organised within the sarcomere and whether they contribute to sarcomere length regulation in insect muscle.</p><p>We aimed to address the questions of how invertebrate titin homologs instruct sarcomere architecture and whether the titin nanoarchitecture would be consistent with a ruler function mechanically linking actin to myosin at a defined distance, as proposed for vertebrates. A first step to answer these important questions is to determine the exact positions of the titin homologs within the sarcomere.</p><p>Here, we chose the <italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscles to determine the precise topology of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs Sallimus (Sls) and Projectin (Proj). We selected key domains at different locations within Sls and Projectin, against which we recently raised specific nanobodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>). We applied single and dual-colour DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy to intact flight muscle specimens, which determined the precise architecture of Sls and Projectin in the flight muscle sarcomere. Interestingly, we found that Sls but not Projectin extends from the Z-disc to the myosin filament. The end of Sls overlaps with the beginning of Projectin, which projects further along the myosin filament. This staggered organisation of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> titin homologs may explain how high mechanical tension can be stably transmitted across the sarcomere and how sarcomere length can be ruled without the presence of a single protein linking the Z-disc to the M-band as observed in vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> titin domain organisation and flight muscle isoforms</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> indirect flight muscles (called flight muscles in the remainder of the article) are stiff muscles that oscillate at high frequency to power flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dickinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pringle, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schönbauer et al., 2011</xref>). The majority of this stiffness is due to Sls in flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kulke et al., 2001</xref>). To achieve this high stiffness, a large part of the flexible spring domains encoded in both titin gene homologs <italic>sls</italic> and <italic>bent</italic> (<italic>bt</italic>; protein name: Projectin) are skipped by alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayme-Southgate et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>). Older work had suggested that the most prominent Sls flight muscle isoform (also called Kettin) uses an alternative poly-A site terminating the protein after Sls-immunoglobulin (Ig) domain 35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bullard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>). However, more recent systematic transcriptomics and splice-site annotation data from dissected flight muscles, as well as expression of large genomic Sls-GFP tagged transgenes, showed that the usage of this early poly-A site is largely restricted to leg muscles and hardly present in flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spletter et al., 2018</xref>). To identify the most prominent Sls and Projectin protein isoforms in mature flight muscles, we carefully reanalysed the published transcriptomics and splice data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spletter et al., 2018</xref>). We verified that in both genes the flexible PEVK spring domains are largely spliced out in adult flight muscles; however, their more 3′-located exons are present at least in some longer isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This predicts an Sls isoform containing the C-terminal five fibronectin (Fn) domains and a Projectin isoform containing a long stretch of Ig-Fn super-repeats and a kinase domain close to its C-terminus being present in flight muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Sallimus and Projectin nanobodies in flight muscles</title><p>In order to verify the expression and to determine the precise location of the different Sls domains in adult flight muscle sarcomeres, we selected three different regions in Sls, against which we recently generated nanobodies: Sls-Ig13/14, Sls-Ig49/50, and Sls-Ig51/Fn2, the first being relatively close to the N-terminus, the other two being close to the C-terminus of the Sls flight muscle isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

In contrast, nanobodies against C-terminally located Projectin domains, here Proj-Nano33 (binding Proj-Ig27-Fn35) and Proj-Nano37 (binding the Projectin kinase domain), result in two bands at large distances from the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data demonstrate that Projectin is present in an extended conformation, and since the flight muscle I-band extends less than 100 nm from the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kronert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>), a large part of Projectin is present along the myosin filament. However, the diffraction-limited spatial resolution of a confocal microscope (about 250 nm) is not sufficient to precisely localise Sls and Projectin domains close to the Z-disc. Hence, higher spatial resolution is necessary to determine the precise architecture of Sls and Projectin within the flight muscle sarcomere.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging of entire flight muscles</title><p>To resolve the relative localisation of Sls and Projectin, we turned our attention to super-resolution imaging with DNA-PAINT as it enables imaging at particularly high spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lelek et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>). For DNA-PAINT, nanobodies binding the protein epitope of interest need to be site-specifically conjugated to either one- or two single-stranded DNA molecules. Previously, DNA-oligos for PAINT were either coupled to antibodies via biotin-streptavidin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jungmann et al., 2014</xref>), which is a 66 kDa tetramer and thus relatively large, or more frequently by click chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabricius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>), which comes with a number of potential disadvantages, such as a bulky hydrophobic coupling group and an initial lysine modification that might destroy the paratope. Instead, we used maleimide-coupling through ectopic cysteines at the N- and C-terminus of the nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pleiner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>), which allows a simpler workflow, analogous to direct fluorophore coupling, and protects the antigen-binding site from undesired modifications.</p><p>In contrast to fluorophore-maleimides, maleimide-activated oligonucleotides are not commercially available. However, as described in the ‘Methods’ in detail, they are straightforward to synthesise from a 5′-amino-modified oligo and a bifunctional maleimide-NHS (N-hydroxysuccinimide) cross-linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The NHS group forms an amide bond with the 5′-amino group of the oligo under reaction conditions that leave the amino groups of the DNA bases non-reactive. The maleimide-activated oligo is then reacted with the nanobody that still contains its His14-SUMO or His14-NEDD8 tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2014</xref>). The resulting conjugate is purified by binding to an Ni(II) chelate matrix (whereby non-conjugated oligo remains in the non-bound fraction) and followed by elution of nanobody-oligo conjugate with a tag-cleaving protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Hence, these oligo-coupled nanobodies remain similarly small as the fluorescently coupled nanobodies and thus are ideal for effective super-resolution imaging using DNA-PAINT.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-strand DNA oligonucleotide-nanobody coupling.</title><p>Schematic representation of the five steps from nanobody purification, oligo activation and coupling, purification, and elution of the oligo-coupled nanobody.

As imager strands are continuously replenished from solution and binding times are controllable over a wide range, a large number of photons can be detected from a single binding event, thus enabling unprecedented sub-5 nm spatial resolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscle DNA-PAINT imaging and automated extraction of sarcomeric protein domain positions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Concept of DNA-PAINT imaging of sarcomeres labelled with an oligo-conjugated nanobody.

To prepare hemi-thoraces, we fixed thoraces in paraformaldehyde and then bisected them with a sharp microtome knife (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see ‘Methods’ for details). Then, we incubated the hemi-thoraces with oligo-coupled nanobodies and mounted them for imaging. Hemi-thoraces are very large, with a length of about 1 mm and a thickness of about 300 µm. To mount them as close as possible to the coverslip, we developed an imaging chamber that contains the imaging buffer surrounded by spacers thick enough to slightly press the flight muscles against the coverslip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, see ‘Methods’ for details). This enabled DNA-PAINT imaging with total internal reflection (TIRF). We imaged for 30 min per sample and obtained about 15,000 frames at an imaging rate of 10 Hz. For image reconstruction and post-processing, we used the established Picasso software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; see ‘Methods’ for details). This enabled us to resolve the two bands flanking a Z-disc with ease, which cannot be resolved in the diffraction-limited image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>To further refine the precision of determining the epitope positions, we have developed an image-processing pipeline that relies on an interactive selection of well-stained myofibrils in the volume of TIRF excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Next, we removed localisations arising from multiple binding events by filtering based on specific localisation parameters (see ‘Methods’ for details). Furthermore, we automatically detected the individual sarcomeric Z-discs and the respective flanking bands of the stained Sls or Projectin epitopes for all selected myofibrils. We applied a Gaussian fit to each band and determined their centre positions within the sarcomere with nanometric accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This results in an accurate location of the measured bands for each of the epitopes in every analysed sarcomere. Hence, we do not need to average across many sarcomeres to precisely localise the Sls or Projectin epitopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In conclusion, our method allows detecting individual differences in sarcomeric band positions in each sarcomere investigated down to the nanometre-scale.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Positions of Sallimus and Projectin domains within intact flight muscle at the nanometric scale</title><p>To precisely determine the location of Sallimus and Projectin, we applied our DNA-PAINT imaging pipeline of flight muscles to the entire Sls and Projectin nanobody toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>). In most cases, we co-stained with two nanobodies that are spaced sufficiently apart to detect the expected four bands centred around the Z-disc, even when using only a single imaging colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This allowed us to resolve the positions of Sls-Nano2 (Sls-Ig13/14) located close to the N-terminus of Sallimus and also Sls-Nano39 (Sls-Ig49/50) close to its C-terminus, which we could combine with distantly located anti-Projectin nanobodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, we imaged the N-terminally located Proj-Nano29 (Proj-Fn1/2) and Proj-Nano30 (Proj-Ig5-8), which we combined with one of the C-terminally located Proj-Nano33 (Ig27-Fn35), Proj-Nano35, or Proj-Nano37 (both Projectin kinase domain). This enabled us to locate the exact position of the different Projectin domains in sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Interestingly, all the analysed epitopes localise in similarly sharp bands in each of the sarcomeres, suggesting a very precisely aligned architecture of Sls and Projectin. The result that nanobodies recognising Sls-Ig13/14 localise 50 nm away from the centre of the Z-disc is compatible with the very N-terminus of Sls being located at the centre of the Z-disc because the additional twelve N-terminal 12 Ig domains are likely to span 48 nm (longest dimension of an Ig domain = 4 nm), whereas the N-terminus of Projectin is located around 100 nm away from the Z-disc (Proj-Ig5-8 and Proj-Fn1/2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and hence cannot be anchored directly at the Z-disc. Our distance measurements are very reproducible between samples, as shown for the different samples stained with Sls-Nano2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> as well as between different nanobodies that recognise neighbouring domains as shown for Proj-Nano29 and Proj-Nano30.

However, quantifying the exact positions of two closely located titin domains in the same sarcomere is critical as the relative length of the flexible titin molecules may vary in individual sarcomeres.

This strategy is valid as we found that although our mounting protocol for TIRF imaging results in a slightly variable sarcomere length of around 3.5 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>), the distance between the measured epitopes is constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, the localisation of the different Sls and Projectin domains investigated using all sarcomeres measured resulted in a very high localisation precision with 95% confidence intervals of only 1–8 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Pooling all data verified that the N-terminal Proj-Ig5-8 epitope is located 90 nm from the Z-disc, whereas the C-terminal Sls epitopes Sls-Ig49/50 and Sls-Ig51-Fn2 are located about 98 nm from the Z-disc. This is consistent with a staggered linear organisation of Sallimus and Projectin, which suggests an attractive mechanism how to mechanically link the sarcomeric Z-disc in insect flight muscle with the myosin filament using both titin homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Super-resolution of flight muscles with nanobodies</title><p>The value of nanobodies and other small binders is well appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harmansa and Affolter, 2018</xref>).

Our titin nanobody toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>) enabled us now to apply DNA-PAINT super-resolution technology to image the titin nanostructure in large intact flight muscle tissue at nanometre-scale resolution.</p><p>It had been shown that dye- or DNA-labelled nanobodies work well to achieve high labelling densities in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agasti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabricius et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mikhaylova et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schlichthaerle et al., 2019</xref>). We have shown that our nanobodies are also very efficient in penetrating the large flight muscle fibres containing highly packed sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>), which are amongst the most protein-dense macromolecular structures in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daneshparvar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2019</xref>). This high labelling efficiency enabled us to perform DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy of the large flight muscles without dissecting individual myofibrils.

This shows that DNA-PAINT can be readily applied to super-resolve structures in large tissues if mounting and labelling protocols are optimised.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Titin nanoarchitecture in flight muscles – Do titins rule?</title><p>Flight muscles are an ideal tissue to perform architectural studies of their sarcomeric components at the nanoscale because these components display an extremely high molecular order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loison et al., 2018</xref>). This was impressively demonstrated by substructural averaging that resolved the nanostructure of myosin filaments isolated from insect flight muscles at a 7 Å resolution by cryo-electron-microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daneshparvar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). Another recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>) took advantage of this stereotypic order and used a series of existing antibodies against sarcomeric protein components to probe isolated myofibrils from <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscles using the super-resolution microscopy technique called STORM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). The precisely reproducible sarcomeric morphology enabled averaging several hundred sarcomeres to reconstruct distances of various epitopes located at the Z-disc, including Zasp52 and α-Actinin, with 5–10 nm precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). Although done on isolated dissected myofibrils and by averaging many sarcomeres, the large diversity of antibodies studied gave a comprehensive understanding of domain positions for a variety of important sarcomeric components. This included the Sls-Ig16 antibody, locating Sls-Ig16 about 50 nm from the centre of the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>), which is in good agreement with the location of Sls-Ig13/14 we found here. This study further showed that the Z-disc components α-Actinin and Zasp52 extend only about 35 nm from the centre of the Z-disc, whereas Filamin stretches with its C-term to about 55 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). This strongly suggests that the N-terminus of Sls, with its remaining 12 Ig domains, can reach and interact with these Z-disc components and possibly also with Filamin, as has been reported biochemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González-Morales et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liao et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, the N-terminal part of the fly titin homolog Sls is arranged similarly to the N-terminus of vertebrate titin that binds to α-Actinin, anchoring it within the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gautel and Djinović-Carugo, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ribeiro et al., 2014</xref>). The exact molecular arrangement will need to await cryo-electron tomography data as recently achieved for the mammalian Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>An important part of the titin ruler model is that the titin spring part, which relaxes and stretches during muscle contraction and relaxation, respectively, spans across the I-band and sets the I-band length of vertebrate sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brynnel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linke, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luis and Schnorrer, 2021</xref>). Thus, it is insightful that our newly developed C-terminal Sls nanobodies show that the C-terminal end of Sls is located about 100 nm from the centre of the Z-disc in flight muscles. This is consistent with the Sls-B2 antibody that supposedly recognises Sls-Ig44 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>), which was localised to about 80 nm from the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). However, this Sls-Ig44 is only present in a few Sls isoforms called ‘Sls-700’, which are likely expressed at early developmental stages at which the sarcomeres have just assembled. Hence, this antibody labels only the centre of each radially symmetric myofibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, our nanobodies bind Sls more C-terminally and show a wider band, suggesting that a larger number of Sls isoforms are reaching the myosin filaments. The fact that the C-terminal Sls nanobodies do not label the entire height of the myofibril (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) suggests that these epitopes are still not included in all the flight muscle Sls isoforms.</p><p>Although we have not imaged myosin directly in our samples, both STORM and electron-microscopy studies demonstrated that myosin filaments begin about 100 nm from the centre of the Z-disc, making the half I-band less than 100 nm wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kronert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loison et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reedy and Beall, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). This strongly suggests that, as in vertebrates, Sls is indeed spanning across the short flight muscle I-band, where it could interact through its C-terminal domains with the myosin filament and hence could mechanically link the Z-disc with the myosin filament. Interestingly, the long isoform of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> titin homolog TTN-1 was shown to also bridge across the I-band reaching the beginning of the A-band in <italic>C. elegans</italic> body muscles and in vitro studies demonstrated that its C-terminal Ig38-40 domains indeed bind to myosin with low nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forbes et al., 2010</xref>). These data are consistent with our hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sls may interact with myosin or Projectin and thus function as an I-band ruler in insect muscles (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>The exact molecular arrangement of Sls in the I-band is still unknown. As the length of an isolated Ig domain is about 4 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mayans et al., 2001</xref>), a chain of 40 Ig domains, which are present in the flight muscle Sls isoforms that we studied here, would result in a length of about 160 nm instead of the observed 100 nm. Hence, the Sls native structure in close proximity to actin filaments present in the flight muscle I-band might be more complex than a straight linear array of Ig domains.</p><p>The interpretation that Sls length rules I-band length is also supported by the observation that non-flight muscles like leg, jump, and larval muscles, which contain long I-bands, do express longer versions of Sls that include the large and flexible PEVK domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spletter et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, in the accompanying paper using the Sls nanobodies, we showed that Sls is more than 2 µm long in larval muscles to bridge over these long I-bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>). This strongly suggests that Sls determines I-band length in the different muscle types; however, a direct genetic test that modifies Sls length and assays I-band length remains to be done.</p><p>The vertebrate A-band contains the Ig-Fn super-repeats of titin, which extend from the beginning myosin filament until the M-band, where titin’s C-terminal kinase is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Granzier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lange et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Linke, 2018</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscles, Projectin, which is very similar to the A-band part of vertebrate titin, with long Ig-Fn super-repeats and a C-terminal kinase domain, starts about 90 nm from the Z-disc. Hence, it is very unlikely that it can interact with Z-disc components directly as these are far from the N-terminal end of Projectin (model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Our precise distance measurements suggest that the N-terminus of Projectin, which does contain a series of Ig domains, typical for the I-band part of titin, is sticking into the flight muscle I-band, whereas its first Fn/Ig super-repeat is located at beginning of the A-band (110 nm from the Z-disc) and hence can interact with myosin, as can its remaining Ig-Fn super-repeats that extend over a length of about 250 nm towards the M-band. This localisation differs somewhat from what was found by STORM of dissected myofibrils which placed the Ig domain 26 of Projectin only about 70 nm from the Z-disc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Szikora et al., 2020</xref>). We found that the Projectin kinase localises in a sharp band; however, it remains far from the M-band. Hence, it is hard to imagine that Projectin alone can directly rule the A-band length of flight muscle sarcomeres as it is only present at its distal ends, spanning about 15% of the myosin filament.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Staggering insect titins to effectively transduce forces during flight?</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> flight muscles are very stiff to effectively power wing oscillations during flight at 200 Hz. The perpendicular arrangement of the antagonistic dorsoventral (DVMs) versus the dorso-longitudinal flight muscles (DLMs) enables an effective stretch-activation mechanism as trigger: contraction of the DVMs moves the wings up and stretches the DLMs to induce their contraction, which will move the wings down again for the next cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickinson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pringle, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Syme and Josephson, 2002</xref>). The importance of strain in these muscles is highlighted by their expression of a particular troponin C isoform (TpnC4), which requires to be stretched to displace tropomyosin from myosin binding sites on actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agianian et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, myosin also experiences a stretch-induced deformation before effective actin binding and maximum force production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iwamoto and Yagi, 2013</xref>). This suggests that very effective force transmission is needed during flight muscle oscillations.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> sarcomeres contractions have a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 3.5% or 60 nm per half sarcomere during flight (measured in <italic>Drosophila virilis;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Dickinson, 1996</xref>). This 3.5% strain is needed to produce the up to 110 W/kg power output of insect flight muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Dickinson, 1996</xref>), which is consistent with the hypothesis that strain across molecules stores the elastic energy for the next contraction cycle in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickinson et al., 2005</xref>). A perfect candidate for such a molecule is Sls as it bridges across the I-band, which likely changes length during the fast contraction cycles. Thus, Sls length would oscillate during flight, which likely results in high oscillating forces across Sls during flight. A similar storage of elastic energy has been suggested for mammalian titin during sarcomere contraction cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eckels et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rivas-Pardo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>What is the role of Projectin? The precise linear arrangement of Projectin at the beginning of the myosin filament and the found overlap with Sls suggests that this staggered architecture of Sls and Proj might be required to effectively anchor Sls to the myosin filament and to prevent sarcomere rupturing during flight. Such flight-induced muscle ruptures are generated when muscle attachment to tendons is weakened, underscoring the high muscle forces and high strain produced during flight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lemke et al., 2019</xref>). Projectin may thus serve as an effective glue to stably connect Sls to the myosin filament. This is also consistent with the findings that both Sls and Projectin are needed to assemble contractile sarcomeres in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval muscles. Knockdown of either protein results in embryonic lethality and defective sarcomerogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schnorrer et al., 2010</xref>).

To couple nanobodies to DNA oligos, the oligos (P1, P2, PS3) were ordered with a 5′ amino group modification (e.g., Am-C6-<named-content content-type="sequence">TTT CTT CAT TAC</named-content>) from IBA (Göttingen) in HPLC-purified form and lyophilised as a triethylammonium (TEA) salt. Note that the absence of ammonia (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) is essential for the procedure. 1 µmol of oligo was dissolved in 200 µl 30% acetonitrile (ACN), 15 mM TEA, which yielded a 5 mM stock at neutral pH (~7). 5 µl of a 100 mM cross-linker stock in 100% ACN (maleimido β-alanine NHS ester, Iris Biotec # MAA1020 or mal-PEG4-NHS, Iris Biotec # PEG1575) were added and allowed to react for 30 min on ice. Then, 1.6 µl 5 M sodium acetate, 0.1 M acetic acid (pH ~7) were added, and the modified oligo was precipitated by adding 1 ml 100% ACN and centrifugation for 10 min at 0°C at 12,000 rpm. This step removes any non-reacted maleimide. The pellet was then dissolved in 100 µl 30% ACN, and either stored in small aliquots at –80°C or used directly to label nanobodies at ectopic, reduced cysteines, as described for fluorophores in the accompanying paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Loreau et al., 2023</xref>). Note that free oligo cannot be removed by gel filtration on Sephadex G25 because it appears with the conjugate in the void volume. It is best removed by modifying a still His14-SUMO or His14-NEDD8 tagged nanobody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frey and Görlich, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pleiner et al., 2015</xref>) and then using Ni(II) capture (where the free oligo remains non-bound) and proteolytic release of the then tag-free nanobody conjugate. The efficiency of conjugation can be assessed by SDS-PAGE, in which the oligo-modification results in a clear size shift. In addition, the density of modification can be calculated through OD260 and OD280 readings using ε260 and ε280 of the initial oligo and nanobody as input variables. The oligo modification by this method is usually quantitative already with a small (≥1.1) molar excess of the maleimide oligo over modifiable cysteines. In case of incomplete modification, the conjugate can be purified on a MonoQ column, whereby the highly negative charged oligo causes stronger retention of the conjugate compared to the non-modified nanobody.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flight muscle preparation, staining, and mounting for imaging</title><p>Intact hemi-thoraces from adult males were prepared similar as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weitkunat and Schnorrer, 2014</xref>).

After washing twice with relaxing solution, the thoraces were placed on a slide with double-sticky tape and cut sagittally with a sharp microtome blade (Pfm Medical Feather C35). The fixed hemi-thoraces were transferred to 24-well plates or Eppendorf tubes and blocked for 30 min at room temperature with 3% normal goat serum in PBS + 0.5% Tx-100 (PBS-T). Hemi-thoraces were stained overnight at 4°C with the combinations of nanobodies indicated, labelled with fluorophores or oligonucleotides (final concentration of about 50 nM). Actin was stained with phalloidin-rhodamine or phalloidin-Alexa488 (1:2000, Thermo Fisher; 2 hr at room temperature or overnight at 4°C). To mount the flight muscles as close as possible to the coverslip, an imaging chamber was built using a slide and #1 coverslips as spacers right and left of the samples. A layer of double sticky tape was built on the spacer and the imaging chamber was filled with either SlowFade Gold Antifade (Thermo Fisher) for confocal imaging or Imager solution for DNA-PAINT imaging.

First, the localisations were detected by a threshold-based detection and fitted with a least-square fit; the resulting localisation precision was estimated between 4 and 8 nm using the NeNA metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Endesfelder et al., 2014</xref>). Next, the data was drift-corrected using a redundant cross-correlation and a fiducial marker-based drift correction. Then, a super-resolved image was rendered using Picasso render. From the images, the myofibrils for further analysis were selected interactively using the rectangular pick tool. All further analysis was done with customised Jupyter Notebooks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Extraction of band positions from DNA-PAINT data</title><p>Extraction of band positions from DNA-PAINT data was achieved the following way: first, individual myofibrils were manually selected using the rectangular selection tool from Picasso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2017</xref>) and saved in individual files.</p><p>Second, the remaining of the analysis was automated in custom codes written in Python. To limit localisation events arising from multiple emitters that create artefacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lelek et al., 2021</xref>), localisations were filtered based on the standard deviation of their Gaussian fits. Localisations kept were within a disc in the standard deviation space (sx, sy), centred on the maximum of the distribution and of radius 0.2 pixel.</p><p>Third, individual Z-discs were automatically detected. This did not require super-resolved data and the process was the result of multiple steps: (a) the algorithm rotated selections and their localisations to orient the selection horizontally. (b) Localisations were projected along the main axis of the selection and their density was reported in a histogram, in which bin size was the same as the pixel size of the camera. The histogram can be seen as a low-resolution intensity profile along the myofibril. (c) The algorithm found peaks in the resulting histogram (with find_peaks from the SciPy library) corresponding to positions of Z-discs. (d) Once peaks were detected, the algorithm selected peaks that were relevant to the analysis using the fact that the distance between Z-discs is the size of a sarcomere.</p><p>Fourth, with the knowledge of Z-disc positions, the algorithm then focused on windows centred on Z-discs to extract the positions of bands: (a) Similar to step 3, the algorithm rotated the selection and stored localisations in a histogram, in which bin size is adjusted for best results (typical bin size was 13 nm). (b) Because DNA-PAINT data accumulate the localisations, the histogram of localisations can display fluctuations that make automated extraction of band positions difficult. Therefore, to locate the rough position of a given band, the data were first convolved with a Gaussian function of standard deviation 25 nm that smoothens fluctuations. (c) The resulting histogram was then analysed with a peak-finding algorithm to locate rough band positions. (d) Finally, to precisely locate band positions, the algorithm fitted a Gaussian function on the non-convolved data, in a window centred on each of the positions detected at the previous step. To ensure that the analysis was properly achieved, the results were visually checked.

In brief, each dataset of an epitope is used to create 1000 bootstrap replicates. We generated a replicate by drawing individual values in a given dataset with replacement (i.e. each value can be drawn multiple times). The size of one replicate is the same as the one of the initial dataset. From each of these replicates, we computed the mean, and therefore obtained 1000 means from 1000 replicates. These 1000 means constitute the bootstrap data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, each epitope having its own bootstrap data.

Their results provide compelling evidence that Sallimus can bridge the Z-disk with the beginning of the myosin A-band. Furthermore, their results convincingly establish that Sallimus and Projectin partially overlap at the beginning of the A-band. The work should appeal to people interested in muscle biology and more generally to people interested in providing high-resolution images of long proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79344.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Labouesse</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01c2cjg59</institution-id><institution>UMR7622, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine, Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Labouesse</surname><given-names>Michel</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01c2cjg59</institution-id><institution>UMR7622, Institut de Biologie Paris-Seine, Sorbonne Université</institution></institution-wrap><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Benian</surname><given-names>Guy M</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03czfpz43</institution-id><institution>Emory University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.14.488306">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.14.488306v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michel Labouesse (Reviewer #1); Guy M Benian (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three external reviewers for each of your two manuscripts, along with myself as a guest editor, are overall supportive of your work. We think that you are introducing interesting tools, although one of the reviewers thinks that you overemphasized the novelty of nanobodies as an approach. The model you propose for sarcomere localization of the titin-like fly homologs Sallimus and Projectin is interesting and should inspire further work.</p><p>That being said, after exchanging views among the reviewers, we feel that there is probably too much redundancy between the two manuscripts in terms of methods and overall conclusions.</p><p>1) We suggest that you merge both manuscripts. This would allow you to show that your data are consistent among the two different muscle types (leg muscle and flight muscle), with an overlap in localization of the C-term of Sls with the N-term of Projectin at the outer edge of the A-band. Generation of the nanobodies and their ability to penetrate tissues would be described only once.</p><p>2) In terms of additional experiments, we ask that you use a nanobody-GFP to determine whether expression of the nanobody fused to mNeonGreen in muscle might affect muscle function or affect behavior of the fusion. You could easily test this by performing some sort of motility assays on the larva and determine whether muscle sarcomere structure is affected after immunostaining with various marker antibodies. Alternatively, you could use the nanobody-GFP to follow the course of a contraction/relaxation cycle in vivo. When reorganizing your manuscripts into a single one, please give better credit to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> muscle field (as requested by one reviewer), and generally attend to other minor comments formulated by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My main reservation over the two papers by Schueder et al. and by Loreau et al. concerns their level of redundancy. The Schueder et al. work is certainly more innovative and goes one step further in terms of biological conclusions than its companion manuscript by Loreau et al. In particular it makes an interesting comparison with vertebrate titin.</p><p>As it stands, Figures 1, 4, 5 of the Loreau et al. ms and much of Figures 1, 2 in this one are the same; furthermore, the Loreau et al. ms looks at the organization of different Sallimus isoforms in different muscle types, whereas this one looks at short isoforms in flight muscles, but the objectives are similar. One avenue to make the two manuscripts more clearly different would be to keep the presentation of nanobody isolation and penetration qualities to a single manuscript. A parallel strategy is to push the characterization of the use of nanobodies in vivo in the other manuscript and to explore whether the Sallimus C-ter and Projectin N-ter interact over their staggered overlapping area as the authors suggest at the end of their discussion, or whether the Sallimus C-ter could interact with myosin as the authors also raise in their discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is very clear and neatly presented. I have very few comments on the experimental design or the results, which follow very high standards. An apparent limitation to the study would reside in the lack of functional analysis to explore the insight gained from this work, and the functional role of the overlap between the two titin homologs. The study however is self sufficient, presents interesting and significant results, and describes a very clear experimental design which might be helpful to others in the field attempting to address similar questions.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>Lines 200-219: The DNA-PAINT description of chemical coupling is detailed but a figure would be helpful to support the text, showing reactions with structural formula.</p><p>Lines 515-516, Figure 1, Figure 2: A more detailed description of classical confocal microscopy setup (including pixel size) would be useful.</p><p>Line 574: I could not find the number of independent samples/replicates (number of experimental replicates, individuals, muscles, sarcomeres) supporting the author's experimental results. In addition to the sample ID used for the microscopy images that are presented, it would thus be interesting to provide a statistics table including this information and in particular showing, for key quantitative results, the number of samples from which the data are derived.</p><p>Line 580: An explicit description of the localisation precision for individual particles in the considered imaging conditions would be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a very nicely executed and described study! I have only a few minor suggestions for interpretation and mostly on writing to improve clarity:</p><p>1. lines 115-117: In referring to exons in the gene, please change, &quot;C-terminally located exons&quot; to &quot;3' located&quot; or &quot;3'-most located&quot; exons.</p><p>2. lines 148-152: &quot;These data demonsrate that Projectin is present in an extended conformation and since the flight muscle I-band extends less than 100 nm from the Z-disc…, a large part of Project is present along the myosin filament.&quot; Are there reports of EM imaging of isolated Projectin with contour length measurements? Given the domain composition and molecular mass, it is likely that Projectin is about 200 nm long. Can this be taken into account in their description?</p><p>3. lines 263-265: &quot;The N-terminus of Sls is located close to the Z-disk, with Ig13/14 only about 50 nm away from the center of the Z-disc…&quot; Can the authors be more definitive in their description, perhaps saying something like, &quot;The result that nanobodies to Ig13/14 localize 50 nm away from the center of the Z-disc, is compatible with the very N-terminus of Sls being located at the center of the Z-disc, because the more N-terminal 12 Ig domains are likely to span 48 nm (longest dimension of Ig domain = 4 nm X 12 = 48 nm).</p><p>4. lines 282-284 and Figure 5A: &quot;Our results verifeid that Sls-Ig13/14 is localizised about 50 nm away from the center of the Z-disk and that Sls-Ig51/Fn2 is about 50 nm further towards the middle of the sarcomere.&quot; Given that in the Sls domain map, Ig13/14 and Ig51/Fn2 are about 27 Ig domain from each other, wouldn't the authors expect that the observed distance should be about 108 nm? (27 Ig X 4 nm = 108 nm). And if so, can the authors say here that this implies that in the flight muscle imaged, this portion of Sls is not in an extended but likely &quot;jumbled&quot; or &quot;compressed&quot; chain of Ig domains?</p><p>5. For all the images presented, how do you know where the center of the Z-disk is located? There do not appear to be any co-stainings with antibodies or nanobodies to α-actinin.</p><p>6. line 385: Given that the I-band is bisected by the I-band, shouldn't the authors say here &quot;half I-band&quot; rather than &quot;I-band&quot;?</p><p>7. In Figure 1B, it seems like three of the nanobodies (39, 42 and 48) localize to Z-disks but not to the bottom (or even top) of the Z-disks compared to nanobody 2, which seems to localize the full height of the Z-disk. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>8. Figure 6 is nicely presented. However, to help the reader, in part B, instead of listing the nanobody number, could the authors indicate to which domains the nanobodies were made? In part C, again to help the readers understand the full impact of the excellent results, could the authors indicate the N- and C-termini of Sls and Projectin?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, as it stands, this manuscript even if of high technological value, remains entirely descriptive and short in providing new insights into muscle structure and architecture. The main finding, an overlap between short Sls isoform and Proj in flight muscle sarcomeres, is redundant with the author's observation in the companion paper that in larval muscles expressing a long Sls isoform, Sls and Proj overlap as well.</p><p>I would not recommend this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. It appears more suited for a specialized methodological development journal.</p><p>Combination of Sls and Proj nanobodies with DNA-Paint represents an attractive example of technological development which alternatively could strengthen the co-submitted nanobodies toolkit manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79344.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three external reviewers for each of your two manuscripts, along with myself as a guest editor, are overall supportive of your work.

To substantiate this, we have largely expanded the nanobody toolbox paper. We provide all the details of this expansion in the response to reviewers’ letter of the toolbox paper. Briefly, we have added 10 additional new nanobodies against different domains of Obscurin, α-Actinin and Zasp52 to the resource paper to make the resource more complete.</p><p>We have further included the asked characterisations of the larvae expressing the NeonGreen tagged nanobodies and generated additional Nanobody-NeonGreen tagged fly strains. Finally, we provide a first analysis of nanobodies tagged with a deGrad signal in vivo. Furthermore, to remove redundancy, we have moved the nanobody penetration data in flight muscles from the PAINT paper to the toolbox paper and also moved almost all the confocal analysis to the toolbox paper, as requested. We will be ready to submit the revised toolbox paper in a few days, too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) We suggest that you merge both manuscripts. This would allow you to show that your data are consistent among the two different muscle types (leg muscle and flight muscle), with an overlap in localization of the C-term of Sls with the N-term of Projectin at the outer edge of the A-band.

We only left a basic Figure1 in the DNA-PAINT manuscript to be able to understand it for the reader as a stand-alone paper (see also below in the reviewers’ comments why this is important). Hence, the DNA-PAINT manuscript does now only include flight muscle data.</p><p>We want to point out that one major finding is that Projectin organisation is different in flight and larval muscle. In flight muscles, Projectin is only located at the tip of the myosin filament, overlapping the end of Sallimus (see PAINT paper), whereas in the larval muscle Projectin decorates the entire thick filament, likely in an oriented fashion (see Loreau et al). The latter assembly still allows a possible overlap of Sallimus and Projectin at the myosin filament ends, but this overlap is still hypothetical to date. Importantly, only a fraction of Projectin molecules will be able to do so. Hence, both are independent biological findings and only the flight muscle part was thus far analysed with super-resolution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In terms of additional experiments, we ask that you use a nanobody-GFP to determine whether expression of the nanobody fused to mNeonGreen in muscle might affect muscle function or affect behavior of the fusion.

We have entirely removed old Figure 2 (nanobody penetration in flight muscles) and replaced it with a new Figure 2 showing the chemistry of the oligo coupling following the request of reviewer 2. We have also strongly slimmed Figure 1, now only showing the dominant flight muscle splice isoforms of Sls and Projectin in the supplement and one representative set of nanobodies analysed with confocal resolution to justify the following super resolution experiments. We feel that without this basic figure the paper is less well understandable on its own (see point 2 and reviewers 2 and 3). We hope that this reviewer will agree with our solution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript is very clear and neatly presented.

Pixel size on a scanning confocal is somewhat arbitrarily set, as one can digitally zoom and set the resolution at the microscope resulting in a strong oversampling of the image beyond the technical resolution of the microscope. We have added a brief explanation to the text that the typical resolution of the confocal microscopy technique used here is limited to about 250 nm. This point again shows why we believe it is necessary to keep a slimmed Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 574: I could not find the number of independent samples/replicates (number of experimental replicates, individuals, muscles, sarcomeres) supporting the author's experimental results.

So, all the data are within the manuscript. The number of sarcomeres measured in the samples shown in the figures can also be seen in the charts on the right side of the figure in which we show ‘frequency’, which is the number of sarcomeres in a particular length bin shown.

This is the aim of our manuscript. We do not think that the other nanobody resource paper reports an overlap of Sls and Projectin in the larvae. To resolve such a possible overlap, super resolution would be needed. The other paper does report that larval Sls isoform is dramatically stretched, more than 2 µm, and that Projectin is decorating the thick filament, likely in an oriented manner. If N-term of Projectin overlaps with C-term of Sallimus in this muscle is an open question that needs DNA-PAINT imaging of larval muscle. This requires a TIRF setting that is technically not trivial to achieve for larval muscle and hence has not been done by anybody.</p></body></sub-article></article>
