However, the effects observed upon inoculation were not the same as the diverse symptoms observed in fields.</p><p>Second, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref> relied on the color and morphology of colonies to identify pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> and infer their abundance in orchards.</p><p>Third, amplification of <italic>vicA</italic> was used to demonstrate the bacteria re-isolated from greenhouse-infected plants were identical to PBTS1 and PBTS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>). It is unclear how PBTS1 could have been verified. When using primers with the same sequences as those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, we could not amplify <italic>vicA</italic> of PBTS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>vicA</italic> allele deposited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref> does not align to the genome sequence of PBTS1, from which it was reportedly amplified (KP274063.1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). Results in a Masters thesis by a student at Ghent University supervised by Drs. Randall and Vereecke showed that amplification of <italic>vicA</italic> from PBTS1 is not reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deckers, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, <italic>vicA</italic> is recommended and used to inform on the presence of pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Randall, 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015b</xref>). This gene does not discriminate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic genotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Fifth, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref> stated that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolated from UCB-1 pistachio ‘contain a subpopulation of bacterial cells with virulence genes.’ Testing a mixed culture goes against the intent of Koch’s postulates, which recommend the isolated microorganism to be grown in pure culture.</p><p>Sixth, our tests using pure cultures of PBTS1 and PBTS2 failed to reproduce previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). We did not observe disease symptoms on UCB-1 pistachio, <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, or pea; the latter two are commonly used susceptible hosts for testing phytopathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. We also tested other isolates that lack virulence genes, and none could cause disease symptoms. In a key experiment, we demonstrated that when isolates, including PBTS2, were modified to carry a virulence plasmid, they caused disease to <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>.</p><p>Seventh, to cause disease, phytopathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> require the <italic>fas</italic> genes, which are frequently carried on a plasmid. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref> described the successful amplification of <italic>fas</italic> genes from PBTS1 and PBTS2. However, the deposited sequences are from two small regions of <italic>fasD</italic> and are joined with 280 Ns (KP274064.1, KP274067.1). A different fragment of <italic>fasD</italic> amplified from four additional pistachio-associated isolates was described separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>). The only available sequence of one of the amplified products aligns distal to the regions where the primers anneal (KR153288; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Stamler et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Both ourselves and the Masters student at Ghent were unable to amplify <italic>fasD</italic> from DNA derived from pure cultures of wild type PBTS1 or PBTS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deckers, 2017</xref>). The thesis reported on the use of primers similar in sequence to those used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref> and designed for amplifying <italic>fasD</italic>. The thesis further reported that use of the primers led to the false amplification of products from DNA purified from isolates demonstrably lacking virulence plasmids and PBTS1 (aka JK1) and PBTS2 (aka SR13). The thesis concludes: ‘Therefore, for these four primers [primer pairs for <italic>vicA</italic>, pFi_09, <italic>attA</italic>, and <italic>fasD</italic>], the results obtained for the isolates are unreliable.’</p><p>Last, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015b</xref> did not report data on the amplification of genes or report data that initially led them to <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref> described direct sequencing of 16S rDNA amplified from total DNA isolated from UCB-1 rootstocks showing the syndrome. The sequences of the products were described as having 89% to 99% identity to 16S rDNA of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>. It is unclear how products corresponding to single genotypes of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> could be amplified in reactions consisting of universal primers that target conserved regions of 16S rDNA and templates with microbial community DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the universal primers match perfectly to diverse chloroplast genome sequences and their use will preferentially amplify the plastid genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Randall, 2015a</xref>, slide 66).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref> states: ‘the statements regarding tree removal…are inaccurate’. This is inconsistent with an article published in the <italic>Western Farm Press</italic> on February 19, 2015 that quotes Dr. Randall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Northcutt, 2015</xref>). The following extract is taken from this article: 'some growers are responding to PBTS [pistachio bushy top syndrome] in their fields by removing entire orchards and bearing the extensive costs of replanting with new trees. Others are removing only those trees showing signs of PBTS and replanting with new trees. However, Randall cautions... &quot;We’ve detected <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> on trees that looked healthy in some infected orchards and, when we’ve gone back later to check, we’ve found these trees had developed PBTS symptoms&quot;, she says’.</p><p>The preponderance of evidence published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al. (2017)</xref> and described herein, are consistent with the likelihood that non-pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates were misdiagnosed as the causative agent of pistachio bushy top syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Subpopulations and loss of detectable virulence genes in PBTS <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates when culturing on synthetic media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>); Appropriateness of diagnostic tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Vereecke, 2018</xref>)</title><p>If the plasmid harboring the virulence gene is unstable, it is unclear how <italic>fasD</italic> fragments could have been amplified from the pistachio-associated isolates in the original studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015b</xref>). Similarly, it is unclear how pure cultures of PBTS1 and PBTS2 were grown to fulfill Koch’s postulates. Detailed descriptions of the methods that were used to grow <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> and the data that confirmed the plasmids were maintained during culturing should be provided.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref> states that the published genome sequences of PBTS1 and PBTS2 ‘concerned draft sequences’. This argument fails to explain why <italic>fasA, fasD</italic>, or the virulence plasmid-specific pFi_09 gene cannot be amplified from the isolates. It is also confusing because both genomes were sequenced using a PacBio, the deposited sequences have assembly levels of ‘Complete Genome’, and each has a single assembled chromosome contig (CP015219 and CP015220; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Stamler et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Conclusions stated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Nikolaeva et al., 2009</xref> were used to support the plasmid instability hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Vereecke, 2018</xref>). Nikolaeva et al. demonstrated that plants are hosts to mixed populations of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> but did not show that colonies were genetically homogenous, nor did they directly test whether plasmids were lost from <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> grown in pure culture or after growth <italic>in planta</italic>. We cultured <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> isolates and successfully sequenced 64 plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Creason et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>). The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Nikolaeva et al., 2009</xref> are consistent with ours showing bacteria isolated from plants are a mixed population that can be polymorphic for the plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>High plasmid instability in <italic>R. fascians</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>)</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref> suggest that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Savory et al.

We suggested that <italic>vicA</italic>, as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2015b</xref> is not appropriate for diagnosing pathogenic <italic>Rhodococcus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Poor growth of the control pistachio UCB-1 trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>)</title><p>It is not valid to compare between the datasets to infer on the health of plants.

Our assays were done in greenhouses in Oregon (44° N, 123° W) whereas in previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>), plants were assayed in a different year and in New Mexico (32° N, 106° W). We fertilized the plants when necessary and periodically inspected the plants and saw no signs that their health was compromised. It is also important to note that our experiments included negative and positive controls, findings were consistent across all genotypes of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> and species of plants tested, and results were repeatable.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Plant growth promotion by the <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> pistachio bushy top syndrome (PBTS) isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>)</title><p>We hypothesized the changes are beneficial because root hairs increase surface area.

Published observations do not support their conclusion that bacteria lacking virulence genes isolated from asymptomatic tissues of symptomatic plants are pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Stamler et al., 2015a</xref>). This can only be concluded if Koch’s postulates are reproducibly fulfilled.</p><p>In point iv, our statement that absence of data makes it challenging to disprove a hypothesis was interpreted as admission that there was no misdiagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Randall et al., 2018</xref>). This is incorrect. We were acknowledging that even if deep sampling yielded no pathogenic strains, one cannot definitively exclude the possibility that <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> could cause disease to pistachio.
