From invertebrates to humans, aversive differential conditioning is widely used to study memories produced by threatening experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carew et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corches et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gentile et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schneider et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). After repetitive spaced trials of conditioning, animals form two complementary long-term memories (LTMs) of opposite valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pollak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pollak et al., 2010</xref>), including the aversive memory to the conditioned stimulus (CS+) and the rewarding memory to the non-conditioned stimulus (CS–) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such complementary LTMs result in enhanced long-lasting discrimination between CS+ and CS– through guiding avoidance to CS+ and approach to CS–. However, it remains unclear whether and how occasional threatening experiences, such as single-trial conditionings, would induce long-lasting changes in future escape behavior.</p><p>From invertebrates to humans, experience-dependent long-lasting behavioral modifications mainly rely on the formation of LTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kandel et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are at least two categories of aversive olfactory LTMs that last for more than 7 days. One is the spaced training-induced LTM that can be observed after repetitive spaced training with inter-trial rests (multiple trials with a 15 min rest interval between each), but not after either single-trial training or repetitive massed training without interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tully et al., 1994</xref>). Forming such aversive LTM requires new protein synthesis and the paired posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) cluster of dopaminergic neurons (DANs) to depress the connection between odor-activated Kenyon cells (KCs) in the mushroom body (MB) αβ lobe and downstream α2sc (MB-V2) MB output neurons (MBONs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Modi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pascual and Préat, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). The other is a recently reported context-dependent LTM that forms after single-trial training, which does not require protein synthesis-dependent consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). The expression of context-dependent LTM relies on multisensory integration in the lateral horn and is not affected by blocking KCs. However, all these observations derived from the same design principle that evaluates memory performance through testing the discrimination between CS+ and CS– (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). Thus, direct responses to CS+ and CS– have been largely overlooked.</p><p>In the current study, we introduced a third-odor test, in which flies were given a choice between either CS+ and a novel odor, or CS– and a novel odor. We therefore identified that the single-trial differential conditioning produces a merged LTM (mLTM) guiding avoidances of both CS+ and CS– for several days after training. The encoding and expression of such mLTM involve new protein synthesis, PPL1 DANs, αβ KCs, and α2sc MBONs. These findings suggest that animals utilize distinct escape strategies for facing occasional and repeated dangers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-trial training produces aversive LTMs to both CS+ and CS–</title><p>We first plotted the memory retention curve at various time points after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, when trained flies were instead tested between either CS+ and a novel odor, or CS– and a novel odor, they gradually exhibited significant avoidances of both CS+ and CS– from 12 hr to more than 7 days after training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The time course of the consolidation of such LTMs could be revealed by cold-shock treatment, which is known to abolish labile memories but leave consolidated LTM intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Tully et al., 1994</xref>).

Three categories of evidence in support of this conclusion are outlined below.</p><p>First, throughout our study, the amplitudes of long-term avoidances of CS+ and CS– are always at a similar level under various conditions, including pharmacological treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), cold-shock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), odor re-exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), paradigm alteration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>), and neural circuitry manipulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Second, re-exposure to either one of CS+ and CS– alone can extinguish both CS+ avoidance and CS– avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Third, the long-term avoidances of CS+ and CS– can be recorded as the depression of odor-evoked responses in the same α2sc MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), meanwhile, CS+ avoidance and CS– avoidance both involve the same PPL1 DANs, αβ KCs, and α2sc MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Thus, CS+ avoidance and CS– avoidance derive from the same aversive mLTM, instead of two parallel LTMs of the same valence. The significance of these findings is further discussed below.</p><p>Combining with a recent report that uses a similar third-odor test to dissect LTMs induced by multi-trial spaced training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref>), we are led to conclude that spaced multi-trial aversive differential conditioning produces two independent LTMs of opposite valence for avoiding CS+ and approaching CS–, whereas single-trial aversive differential conditioning yields one mLTM that guides avoidances of both CS+ and CS–. Thus, animals can develop distinct escape strategies for different categories of dangers. When the same dangerous situation has been experienced repeatedly, animals would remember the detailed information to guide behavior in the next similar situation. However, when the dangerous event has only been experienced occasionally, animals would choose to avoid all potentially dangerous cues as a more reserved survival strategy.</p><p>Moreover, the differences between single-trial training-induced mLTM and multi-trial training-induced complementary LTMs lead us to ask: how these differences are induced by different training sessions? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref> reported that multi-trial spaced training induces depressed responses to CS+ in α2sc MBONs and α3 MBONs are required for aversive LTM to CS+, whereas the modulated responses to CS– in β’2mp MBONs and γ3, γ3β’1 MBONs appears to be responsible for the safety memory to CS–. In contrast, here we found that single-trial training is sufficient to induce the depressed responses to both CS+ and CS– in α2sc MBONs. Therefore, our results suggest a lower threshold and specificity of the plasticity between KCs-α2sc MBONs, compared to KCs-α3 MBONs, KCs-β’2mp MBONs, and KCs-γ3, γ3β’1 MBONs connections. Consequently, changing these synaptic connections requires involving more training sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>All flies (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>) were raised on standard cornmeal medium at 23°C and 60% relative humidity under a 12 hr light-dark cycle as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shuai et al., 2010</xref>).

Classical protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory forms only after repetitive spaced trials of olfactory conditioning. The authors discovered that flies also form a &quot;blurred&quot; or &quot;vague&quot; protein-synthesis-dependent long-term memory which distinguishes experienced two odors from a third naive odor after single-trial training. This merged long-term memory lacking the event details likely occurs in most animals since long-lasting memory of occasional threatening experiences for future escape behavior is crucial for survival.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Differential Conditioning Produces Merged Long-term Memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ann-Shyn Chiang (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should keep these essential revisions in mind while attending to the reviewers' comments which are appended below.</p><p>The final model presented in the Zhong manuscript presents an integrated view of the results obtained by them and by Jacob and Wadell, Neuron 2020. To do this it is important to replicate some of the essential results from Jacob et al. In addition the reviewers put a high value on manuscript data that replicates data, in the same or complementary ways from other laboratories. Please keep these points in mind while preparing your revisions.</p><p>1. By using cell-type-specific Gal4 lines that are readily available, target neurons for &quot;the avoiding CS+ memory&quot;, &quot;the early approaching CS- memory&quot; and &quot;the late avoiding CS- memory&quot; should be identified. For example, PPL1-DANs and PAM-DANs expressed in TH-Gal4 can be respectively tested with specific split-Gal4 lines.</p><p>2. In Figure 2B, when CS- was presented 20min after CS+ even the mLTM of CS+ vs novel odor was impaired, the result means that the formation of CS+ mLTM requires the presence of CS- within a certain time window. This raises an alternative interpretation of the data that CS- presented 20min after CS+ actually serves as interference for the formation of CS+ mLTM, rather than the merged CS+/CS- memory. As to distinguish these two hypotheses, training the flies with only CS+ without delivering CS-, and then test between CS+ and novel odor should be able to address the question. If presenting CS+ alone fails to form LTM of CS+ vs the third odor, then CS- presented within a certain time window is necessary. Otherwise, CS- presented 20min after CS- may serve as an interference.</p><p>3. In Figure 4B, the author measured the odor responses of CS+, CS-, and novel odor in MBON-a2sc one day after association, and found that both CS+ and CS- showed depression response. To strengthen the link between the functional response of MBON-a2sc and behavioral phenotype, conditions abolished mLTM by reactivation or prolong odor delivery interval (Figure 2A and 2B) should also be tested to see whether the memory trace are also abolished. Also, what is the responses immediately after 1X training? As CS- mLTM changes from appetitive to avoidance within the first 24 hours after training, the calcium responses of MBON-a2 during this period are necessary for understanding the circuit mechanism of mLTM dynamics.</p><p>4. (Point 1 of Reviewer 2) The observation that presentation of a novel third odor leads to mLTM after only a single session of aversive conditioning is intriguing. Authors describe in their methods using three odors for their experiments (as CS+, CS- or novel), but did not alternate/rotate the different combination pairings used as the &quot;novel&quot; one. A panel of odors as &quot;novel&quot;, not listed in the manuscript, should be tested which will strengthen the larger conceptual framework and impact. In addition, the authors should perform at least a subset of the experiment using air during testing rather than a 3rd odor.</p><p>5. (Point6 of Reviewer 2) More experimentation and discussion regarding the differences between single-trial conditioning to form mLTM and spaced conditioning to form complementary LTM, is required. The authors contrast/merge their behavioral results with those published by Jacob et al., (2020). The authors should reproduce the essence of those found by Jacob et al., and publish them in this paper. Replication of experimental results across labs is very important, especially for behavioral outcomes and when models are constructed using results obtained by other investigators. The authors allude to the two pairs of DAN that project to α2sc MBN for this plasticity, but did not specifically mention those DAN (lines 220-221) nor elaborate on this speculation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The finding of mLTM opens many questions.

However, to sustain the authors' claims that the same neurons are involved in both CS+/CS-avoidance, the authors need to use specific split-Gal4 lines expressed in only the target neurons. Also, to claim this is a merged LTM, authors need to address how the trained flies turn from the initial CS- approaching memory to late CS- avoidance memory. Without additional data to address these critical issues, the authors should largely tune down their claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Citations or references are not included when the phrase &quot;described previously&quot; is used (lines 238, 248, 275, 287).</p><p>2) Provide more detail on odor re-exposure methods (lines 283-284).

Currently there is random organization.</p><p>8) Figure 2A – why use the term &quot;reactivation&quot; rather than &quot;extinction trials?&quot;</p><p>9) The Abstract and the Introduction use the extremely vague phrase, &quot;…that animals utilize escape strategies for facing occasional and repeated dangers…&quot; Either bring this point home for the reader with specific and concrete examples in the Discussion or modify/eliminate the sentence.</p><p>10) A good overhaul of the referencing throughout the manuscript is warranted. One glaring omission of perhaps several references that should be offered is in support of the sentence, &quot;In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, aversive olfactory memories are mainly encoded by the PPL1 cluster of DANs,&quot; (line 124).

In the revised manuscript, we added the suggested experiments with two more specific Gal4 lines, R58E02 for PAM-DANs and R52H03 for PPL1-DANs (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B). The 24-h avoidances to CS+ and CS– were both impaired by blocking PPL1-, but not PAM-DANs (Figure 3A). Interestingly, although the early avoidance to CS+ was impaired specifically by blocking PPL1-DANs, the immediate response to CS– was affected oppositely when PPL1-DANs or PAM-DANs were blocked (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). These data support our theoretical model in the revised edition that the response to CS– is the sum of two opposite memory components: the hours-lasting safety-memory to CS– and the aversive mLTM (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The obtained data support presenting CS+ and CS– are both necessary for forming mLTM. Moreover, this conclusion can be further strengthened by the result that mLTM was gradually decreased with the prolonged intervals between CS+ and CS– (Figure 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In addition, we found that the depression of odor-evoked responses to CS+ and CS– can be observed immediately after training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Our data suggest that the merged memory should be encoded during training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and then consolidated within 8 hours (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We added a detailed description of the odor combination protocol in the Methods (line 244-257). A panel of odors, OCT and MCH, were used as the novel odor alternatively throughout our study. In addition, we performed the suggested experiment and observed increased 24-h avoidance to CS+ and CS– when they are compared with air (Figure 1—figure supplement 2), which is consistent with our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

As CS- mLTM changes from appetitive to avoidance within the first 24 hours after training, the calcium responses of MBON-a2 during this period are necessary for understanding the circuit mechanism of mLTM dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide new data in revision that training with 10-min temporal intervals fails to form the long-term depression in α2sc MBONs (Figure 5). In addition, we found that the depression of odor-evoked responses to CS+ and CS– can be observed immediately after training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). Our data suggest that the merged memory should be encoded during training (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B) and then consolidated within 8 hours (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Citations or references are not included when the phrase &quot;described previously&quot; is used (lines 238, 248, 275, 287).</p><p>2) Provide more detail on odor re-exposure methods (lines 283-284).
