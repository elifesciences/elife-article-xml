sensorimotor integration. POm provides axonal projections to the dorsal striatum, a hotspot of sensorimotor processing, yet the role of POm-striatal projections has remained undetermined. Using optogenetics with mouse brain slice electrophysiology, we found that POm provides robust synaptic input to direct and indirect pathway striatal spiny projection neurons (D1- and D2-SPNs, respectively) and parvalbumin-expressing fast spiking interneurons (PVs). During the performance of a whisker-based tactile discrimination task in head-restrained mice, POm-striatal projections displayed learning-related activation correlating with anticipatory, but not reward-related, pupil dilation. Inhibition of POm-striatal axons across learning caused slower reaction times and an increase in the number of training sessions for expert performance. Our data indicate that POm-striatal inputs provide a behaviorally relevant arousal-related signal, which may prime striatal circuitry for efficient integration of subsequent choice-related inputs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural circuitry</kwd><kwd>thalamus</kwd><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>fluorophotometry</kwd><kwd>pupil</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS117093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yonk</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1845355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Margolis</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS094450</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Margolis</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NCATS TL1TR003019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yonk</surname><given-names>Alex J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rutgers Busch Biomedical</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linares-García</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><name><surname>Margolis</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A thalamic nucleus plays a previously unappreciated role in behavioral arousal and learning through its innervation of the dorsal striatum.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The process of sensorimotor learning is underpinned by sensory perception and motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Petersen, 2019</xref>). In the mouse whisker system, tactile sensations are acquired via active sensor (e.g. whisker) movement to obtain relevant environmental information and subsequent processing by the well-characterized primary somatosensory barrel cortex (S1) circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Petersen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">El-Boustani et al., 2020</xref>). This whisker-related information is transmitted from the periphery to S1 via two thalamic nuclei, ventral posterior medial (VPM) and posterior medial (POm), constituting the lemniscal and paralemniscal pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Deschênes et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Bureau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Petersen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Diamond et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Moore et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Deschenes and Urbain, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib177">Yu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Mo et al., 2017</xref>).

In addition to its cortical projection, POm axons pass through and collateralize with terminal synaptic boutons in both thalamic reticular nucleus and posterior dorsolateral striatum (pDLS) as they ascend toward cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib153">Spreafico et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Descheˆnes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Viaene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alloway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">O’Reilly et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we focus on the POm-striatal projection as striatal circuitry modulation may have powerful effects on sensorimotor integration and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib176">Yonk and Margolis, 2019</xref>). However, POm’s influence over striatal microcircuitry and behavioral performance is unresolved.</p><p>The striatum is the predominant input nucleus of the basal ganglia and is predominantly composed of GABAergic spiny projection neurons (SPNs) expressing either D1 or D2 dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Gerfen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib163">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>), but it also contains a rich diversity of interneurons, such as parvalbumin-expressing (PV) fast-spiking interneurons that exert robust modulatory control over SPN output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib159">Tepper et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Owen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Tepper et al., 2018</xref>). Within this microcircuitry, the dorsal striatum integrates widespread convergent cortical and thalamic inputs that constitute part of the force driving normal striatal functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Wall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Huerta-Ocampo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Oh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib150">Smith et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hooks et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, functionally related cortical (S1 and M1) and thalamic (POm) inputs converge within shared striatal subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Hintiryan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>).

The Shaping time point permitted mice to learn to lick the spout for a water reward during the first three sessions without the presence of the textures. During the last two Shaping sessions, the Go and NoGo textures were presented simultaneously with a Go texture probability of 0.90 for the first session and 0.75 for the second session. For the first Learning session, and all subsequent sessions, the Go texture probability was set to 0.50. Mice were considered Learning at this time point. The Early Learning time point was considered the first two sessions after Shaping, while the Late Learning was considered the last two sessions before achieving Expert status. Mice were considered Expert when they had a Hit Rate ≥0.80 and a FA Rate ≤0.30 for two consecutive sessions. After discrimination training was completed, mice were subjected to a Reward session.

Thus, despite all three activity parameters increasing across learning, POm activity is not related to motor activity and is only correlated with pre-PT pupil dilation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Increased POm axonal calcium activity is independent of trial type or outcome</title><p>This whole-session analysis did not account for sensory (texture) or outcome differences. To assess whether POm axonal activity is sensory-related (texture-specific), sessions were segmented by the presented texture (Go or NoGo; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>) and by trial outcome (below). Notably, licking and pupil dynamics have discrete activation patterns based on the presented texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lee and Margolis, 2016</xref>). Licking activity in the Go condition occurs squarely within the PT window and is indistinguishable from whole-session licking activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), while licking peaks near the end of the grace period in the NoGo condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Similarly, pupil activity starts to increase at the same point in both conditions but deviates at the end of the grace period. Conversely, POm axonal activity remained strikingly consistent between the Go and NoGo conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). This observation was further validated by comparing the average maximum calcium amplitude of each behavioral time point between the presented texture conditions. The main effect of behavioral time points was significant (F <sub>(4,32)</sub>=57.16, p&lt;0.0001), but the main effect of presented texture was not (F <sub>(1,8)</sub>=0.3797, p=0.5549; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Post-hoc comparisons found that the maximum calcium amplitude during Shaping (Go: 0.55±0.06; NoGo: 0.53±0.04) was significantly reduced compared to Early Learning (Go: 1.18±0.11, p=0.0016; NoGo: 1.05±0.11, p=0.0128), Late Learning (Go: 1.65±0.23, p&lt;0.0001; NoGo: 1.59±0.16, p&lt;0.0001), and Expert sessions (Go: 1.68±0.21, p&lt;0.0001; NoGo: 1.52±0.12, p&lt;0.0001), but not the Reward session. The same overall effects were noted for the auROC analysis (main effect of behavioral time point: F <sub>(4,32)</sub>=66.43, p&lt;0.0001; main effect of presented texture: F <sub>(1,8)</sub>=0.01694, p=0.8997; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). As with the maximum amplitude, post-hoc comparison highlighted that the auROC value during Shaping (Go: 0.59±0.02; NoGo: 0.61±0.03) was significantly smaller than Early Learning (Go: 0.72±0.02, p=0.0035; NoGo: 0.70±0.04, p=0.0355), Late Learning (Go: 0.84±0.02, p&lt;0.0001; NoGo: 0.83±0.02, p&lt;0.0001), and Expert sessions (Go: 0.87±0.02, p&lt;0.0001; NoGo: 0.85±0.02, p&lt;0.0001), but not the Reward session. Thus, despite divergent licking and pupil activity as a function of the presented texture, axonal calcium activity remained unchanged, indicating POm-striatal projections do not encode vibrissae-specific sensory information.</p><p>We next tested whether POm calcium activity correlated with trial outcome (e.g. Hit, Miss, False Alarm, Correct Rejection; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

However, the only significant post-hoc comparisons were between Hit-Shaping and CR-Shaping (p=0.0305) and FA-Shaping and CR-Shaping (p=0.0114).

However, once the Learning phase started, POm-striatal axons of the JAWS cohort were photoinactivated for ~50% of trials per session until reaching the Expert phase. Photoinactivation occurred via an amber (617 nm) LED (~7 mW) for 2 s of constant illumination centered around the PT window start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>) where the maximum calcium signals were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

However, photoinactivation of POm-striatal axons during the Learning phase resulted in the JAWS cohort requiring significantly more sessions (12.50±0.50 sessions, n=4 mice) to attain Expert status compared to the other two cohorts with different experimental conditions (FP with constant illumination across the entire session: 7.60±0.51 sessions, n=5 mice; No Stim with no illumination: 7.40±0.24 sessions, n=5 mice) (F<sub>(3,11)</sub> = 8.542, p=0.0041, JAWS vs. FP p=0.0470; JAWS vs. No Stim p=0.0202; FP vs. No Stim p&gt;0.9999; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I–J</xref>). We assessed whether photoinactivation modified behavioral responding parameters between the Learning and Expert phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). The only significant effect was a decrease in overall responding (Bias) during the Learning phase (Off: 0.56±0.32, On: 0.48±0.32, p=0.0351).

VPM thalamus, by contrast, projects to much more delimited domains of S1, with axons coursing through striatum without forming synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>). POm projections to the dorsal striatum arise from branches of the main axons bound for the cortex and terminate in a region of the dorsal striatum that overlaps with corticostriatal inputs from S1 and M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">El-Boustani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alloway et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Groh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib175">Yamawaki and Shepherd, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sumser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Casas-Torremocha et al., 2022</xref>), potentially placing POm projections in a powerful position to influence sensorimotor integration. We aimed to elucidate the functional innervation pattern of POm onto striatal cell types, and the role of POm-striatal projections on behavioral performance and learning. Slice electrophysiology revealed strong POm-mediated synaptic inputs to D1-SPNs, D2-SPNs, and PV interneurons, with shorter latency responses in PVs. In vivo photometry recordings showed increasing activation of POm-striatal axons across task learning, with axonal signals and pupil dilation in expert mice increasing prior to and becoming stereotyped to stimulus presentation, independent of stimulus type or trial outcome. Photoinactivation of POm-striatal axons resulted in prolonged RTs and delayed learning, with more training sessions required to achieve expert behavioral performance. We discuss below the complex feedforward and feedback circuitry that POm is part of, and potential functional differences in POm-striatal projections compared to POm-cortical projections in sensorimotor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). We propose that POm could provide an early salience- or arousal-related ‘priming’ signal to the pDLS that interacts with subsequent corticostriatal signals, leading up to behavioral action selection.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Does POm provide a ‘priming’ signal to striatum?</title><p>A striking feature of our POm-striatal projection measures in behaving mice was the early task-related activation, with the strongest increases before and during texture presentation rather than during trial outcome, reward presentation, or licking. SPNs require an up-state transition from their relatively hyperpolarized resting potentials to reach action potential threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib171">Wilson, 1993</xref>). While this up-state transition is correlated with cortical oscillatory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib154">Stern et al., 1997</xref>), the role of thalamostriatal projections has not been fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Reig and Silberberg, 2014</xref>). POm inputs likely arrive in striatum with shorter latency than cortical inputs following whisker stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alloway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alloway et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Mowery et al., 2011</xref>), and therefore could be involved in initiating the up-state transition in the SPNs they innervate. We refer to this early POm-striatal input as a putative ‘priming’ signal because it could serve to sensitize striatal neurons to respond to subsequent synaptic input. We found that POm provides large amplitude PSPs to D1- and D2-SPNs, of similar amplitude to previously measured M1 inputs and larger amplitude than S1 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). This equally strong innervation of D1- and D2-SPN is consistent with previous work on the co-activation of SPN populations during natural movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Cui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib158">Tecuapetla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>). The early timing, together with the equal large-amplitude innervation of both direct and indirect pathways (D1- and D2-SPNs and PV interneurons), suggest that POm projections are well-positioned to ‘prime’ dorsal striatal circuitry for processing subsequent synaptic input.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Impact of PV-interneuron-mediated feedforward GABAergic signaling</title><p>POm innervation of PV interneurons was particularly prominent, providing equal amplitude PSPs with shorter latency than SPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Striatal PV cells are thought to provide feedforward inhibition to surrounding neurons via short-latency GABAergic synaptic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Tepper et al., 2018</xref>) How could PV cells be involved in ‘priming’? First, PV cells do not exert an inhibitory effect, as defined by postsynaptic hyperpolarization, under all conditions. Stimulation of a presynaptic PV cell in synaptically coupled PV-SPN paired recordings causes GABA-mediated depolarization in the postsynaptic SPN when the SPN’s resting potentials was negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>). Indeed, recent work found that the chloride equilibrium potential is surprisingly positive in adult striatal SPNs, closer to –60 mV compared to the more typical –80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Day et al., 2024</xref>) An approximately –60 mV equilibrium potential means that a GABA receptor-mediated chloride current produces depolarization instead of hyperpolarization when the postsynaptic neuron is at a down-state resting potential of approximately –80 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Day et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Koós and Tepper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fino et al., 2018</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Day et al., 2024</xref>, when GABA-mediated depolarization was paired with further glutamate-evoked depolarization, the probability of action potential firing was increased, suggesting that GABA-mediated depolarization was excitatory rather than shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Day et al., 2024</xref>). In this scenario, if SPNs are sitting at a relatively hyperpolarized (down state) resting potential when POm becomes active, the disynaptic GABAergic input provided by PV interneurons could actually have a depolarizing effect on SPNs and combine with the direct glutamate-mediated depolarization provided by POm. Thus, under certain conditions, PV interneurons could contribute to ‘priming’ striatal circuitry by adding to the early depolarization of SPNs.</p><p>The situation is different when the postsynaptic neuron is already depolarized above –60 mV (as in an up state). In this scenario, the effect of GABAergic input is hyperpolarizing, and PV-cell-mediated feedforward signals to SPNs would be inhibitory, in line with traditional views (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Gittis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Owen et al., 2018</xref>). In this case, instead of enhancing the initial depolarization of striatal neurons (as above), POm input would likely provide a temporally restricted depolarizing signal, followed by hyperpolarization. POm-mediated feedforward inhibition could, depending on the intricacies of local connectivity, act to prevent up-state transitions of specific SPN ensembles, effectively increasing the signal-to-noise of striatal population activity and therefore the recruitment of SPNs by subsequent cortical or thalamic inputs. Thus, it is possible that POm projections have dual effects on striatal circuits depending on ongoing striatal activity. GABAergic signaling, mediated by PV or other types of striatal interneurons, is likely critical in mediating such state-dependent effects on postsynaptic striatal circuitry.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>POm involvement in salience networks and behavioral state</title><p>Many extrinsic and intrinsic factors influence striatal function. For example, the striatum receives inputs from myriad subcortical regions including other thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Mandelbaum et al., 2019</xref>) and external globus pallidus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Mastro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Baker et al., 2023</xref>). A crucial factor in POm signal timing is its inhibitory gating by two GABAergic inputs, ventral zona incerta (vZI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lavallée et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Roger and Cadusseau, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Power et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Barthó et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib169">Watson et al., 2015</xref>) and anterior pretectal (APT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lavallée et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Giber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bokor et al., 2005</xref>). All three nuclei receive ascending spinal trigeminal (whisker-related sensory) inputs, but vZI and APT efficiently shunt incoming sensory information via feedforward inhibition onto POm neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Lavallée et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Trageser and Keller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib162">Trageser et al., 2006</xref>). This inhibitory gating is overcome by (1) arousal-related cholinergic suppression of presynaptic GABA release within POm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Masri et al., 2006</xref>) or (2) convergence of bottom-up and top-down signals within a specified temporal window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Groh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Miller-Hansen and Sherman, 2022</xref>). Both factors are likely at play during sensory-guided behavior. The involvement of cholinergic signaling is consistent with the POm-striatal ‘priming’ concept if cholinergic signaling prompts POm before a behaviorally relevant period of sensation, or immediately prior to sensory information becoming perceptible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib143">Sachidhanandam et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to cholinergic, cortical, and subcortical GABAergic afferents, POm also receives direct glutamatergic input from superior colliculus (SC) that enhances sensory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Roger and Cadusseau, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gharaei et al., 2020</xref>). SC, a region implicated in attentional orienting of either somatosensory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gharaei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Hemelt and Keller, 2008</xref>) or visually relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Schneider, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmadlou et al., 2018</xref>) stimuli, bidirectionally modulates POm, further ascribing a potential arousal-related functional role. It is yet to be resolved to what extent POm-striatal inputs are driven by ascending (feedforward) sensory information, descending cortical-POm feedback, or the convergence of both, but the interplay and integration of ascending and descending signals is likely to be an essential feature in POm activation and its involvement in behavioral salience.</p><p>It is difficult to differentiate movement- and arousal-related brain states. POm neuronal activity shows a close relationship with spontaneous (task-free) whisker movements, and pupil-indexed arousal in head-restrained mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petty et al., 2021</xref>) while in freely moving mice both VPM and POm activity correlate with head and whisker movements, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Oram et al., 2024</xref>) indicating that POm is generally coactive with exploratory head and whisker movements and behavioral arousal. During task performance, the situation may change with training and attentional effects. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Petty and Bruno, 2024</xref> showed that POm activity correlates more closely with task demands than tactile or visual stimulus modality. Our data indicate that POm-striatal axonal signals are increased at trial start during anticipation of tactile stimulus delivery and through the sensory discrimination period, then decrease to baseline levels during licking and water reward collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Petty and Bruno, 2024</xref> together with ours suggest that POm is particularly active during the context of behaviorally relevant task performance. Thus, we think that pupil dilation indexes general movement and arousal, which POm correlates with during spontaneous behaviors, but that POm activity becomes more specific and more prominent during the movement, anticipation, and arousal associated with learned sensorimotor behavioral tasks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Parallel thalamostriatal pathways, additional striatal cell types</title><p>Pf is the best studied thalamic nucleus projecting to the striatum. A major difference between POm and Pf striatal innervation is Pf innervation of cholinergic (ChAT; tonically active) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ding et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Johansson and Silberberg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Díaz-Hernández et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Klug et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Poppi et al., 2021</xref>). We did not determine whether POm innervates ChAT interneurons, but available evidence suggests it might only weakly. Retrograde tracing to map brain-wide inputs to striatal ChAT interneurons showed that Pf provides the majority of thalamic innervation of striatal ChAT neurons compared to other thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Klug et al., 2018</xref>). Many other thalamic nuclei, including POm, showed little or no labeling. However, it is possible that these thalamic nuclei, including POm, provide functional innervation of ChAT interneurons that is insufficiently assessed by anatomical methods alone.</p><p>Another difference between Pf and other thalamic nuclei innervation of striatum is the subcellular localization of their synaptic inputs. Pf synapses tend to localize to dendritic shafts of SPNs rather than dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Dubé et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib173">Wright et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Raju et al., 2008</xref>), whereas other thalamic nuclei form synapses onto SPN dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib149">Smith et al., 2014</xref>). These differences could affect postsynaptic signal processing, such that Pf shaft inputs may induce a longer temporal window for integration via dendritic filtering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Häusser, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Day et al., 2008</xref>), whereas POm spine inputs may cause a more restricted temporal window for signal integration. These properties could influence the behaviorally relevant time window of thalamostriatal and corticostriatal signal integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib144">Sanabria et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Johansson and Silberberg, 2020</xref>), for example, with POm requiring time-locked inputs onto the same or nearby spines for maximal postsynaptic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alloway et al., 2017</xref>). The occurrence and relevance of such mechanisms in different thalamostriatal pathways will require further investigation. Additionally, it will be important to understand the innervation patterns of POm-striatal projections beyond the three cell types we have studied here, including other interneurons responsive to thalamic stimulation such as tyrosine-hydroxylase (THIN) and neurogliaform (NGF) interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib160">Tepper et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Assous and Tepper, 2019</xref>).

POm input excites L5 pyramidal neurons (and L2/3 neurons) via L5 perisomatic synapses as well as distal dendritic synapses in L1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Audette et al., 2018</xref>). Synaptic plasticity of POm-cortical inputs and increased excitation of L2/3 and L5 neurons has been implicated in sensory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gambino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Audette et al., 2019</xref>). Given the capacity of POm-cortical synapses for learning-related plasticity, it will be important to determine whether POm-striatal synapses also undergo learning-related plasticity and how it may be distinct from POm-cortical plasticity. Remarkably, POm axonal branches, even from the same neuron, display synaptic terminals with distinct structure and functional properties in M1 compared to S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Rodriguez-Moreno et al., 2020</xref>); thus it is possible that the striatal synapses of POm neurons could undergo distinct changes with learning compared to their cortical counterparts.</p><p>How the divergent cortical and thalamic projections of POm neurons may be involved in coordinating thalamostriatal and corticostriatal signals is another important issue. Striatal neurons that receive POm input are likely also to receive cortical L5a input, because L5a neurons comprise the predominant S1-striatal projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Pan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib168">Wall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Hooks et al., 2018</xref>). Thus a disynaptic POm-S1-pDLS loop exists in addition to the monosynaptic POm-pDLS projection. During behavior, striatal circuitry may be initially engaged via the monosynaptic POm projection followed, in tens of milliseconds, by the disynaptic loop that recruits L5a cortical pyramidal neurons to provide input to already depolarized (‘primed’) striatal neurons. On the hundreds-of-milliseconds time scale of a behavioral trial, it is possible that these pathways are active multiple times, with L5b cortical feedback activating POm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Groh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib155">Sumser et al., 2017</xref>) after the initial feedforward volley of activity, initiating POm-driven signaling again. It is possible that an individual SPN receives both POm and L5a input, with the POm input providing the initial ‘priming’ depolarization, followed by further depolarizing input from a POm-driven L5a neuron. It is unclear whether thalamic ‘priming’ of striatum is necessary for corticostriatal activation of SPNs. Based on the recurrence and convergence of these pathways, it is possible that POm acts to synchronize thalamo- and corticostriatal signals under certain behaviorally relevant conditions. This would be a unique role for POm compared to Pf, since Pf strongly innervates striatum but only weakly innervates cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>POm-striatal recruitment during learning: unresolved mechanisms</title><p>Behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petty et al., 2021</xref>) influences the efficiency of sensorimotor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Qi et al., 2022</xref>). Overall, we observed a learning-related increase in POm-striatal axonal activity (as measured by photometry) that correlated with pupil dilation in many but not all phases of behavioral performance, and a necessity of these projections for efficient behavioral performance and learning, supporting a role in task-related behavioral arousal. Photometry signals and pupil dilation in expert mice were tightly correlated between trial onset and texture presentation, but decoupled when photometry signals decreased prior to licking and reward delivery. Sorting trials by presented texture (stimulus) or trial outcome (response), photometry signals remained elevated, while both licking and pupil dilation exhibited stimulus- or response-specific changes. This suggests that POm-striatal projections do not encode specific sensory- or outcome-related information, but rather arousal or salience during anticipatory states of a learned behavior. The effects of photoinactivation of PO-striatal projections included delayed RTs on individual trials and more sessions required to achieve expert performance. These effects suggest that POm serves to enhance striatal signaling during increased behavioral states associated with performance of learned sensorimotor behavior. POm activation early during behavioral trials may set the stage for other important inputs, such as corticostriatal inputs, to influence action selection. The increased amplitude of POm-striatal signals with learning suggests an increased influence of POm on striatum, and thereby on goal-driven sensorimotor behaviors. POm likely becomes increasingly tuned to task-specific behavioral arousal and anticipation than to general movement-related arousal.</p><p>An important unresolved issue is how POm-striatal signals increase with learning. Inherent in our measures of POm-striatal axons is the limitation that photometry only captures a bulk axonal signal and lacks the ability to resolve individual axons. Therefore, we were unable to resolve whether the increased bulk signal that we observed was due to a uniform increase across all POm-striatal axons or a heterogeneous increase present only in specific axons. This is important because POm neurons exhibit heterogeneous responses to direct paralemniscal stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Mo et al., 2017</xref>), peripheral stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Chiaia et al., 1991a</xref>) and the suppression of vZI activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib161">Trageser and Keller, 2004</xref>) and also show functionally distinct anterior and posterior subpopulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">El-Boustani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib167">Viaene et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Casas-Torremocha et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Arai et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, we might expect heterogeneous learning-related changes in activity within the POm neuronal population, a mechanistic question that would be important to address in future studies.</p><p>Although we placed the optical fiber above pDLS to specifically record from axons, rather than somas, it is possible that POm-cortical axons of passage contributed to the recorded signal. However, even if signal contamination were present, we think the measures would be largely similar, as most POm-cortical projections bifurcate within striatum rather than projecting exclusively to either striatum or cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Ohno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Signal modification is more likely to occur at synapses via presynaptic or postsynaptic mechanisms than at the main axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Debanne, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Citri and Malenka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2008</xref>). In future work, it would be valuable to investigate the intriguing possibility that POm projections have discrete target-specific functions, such that POm-striatal signals may be involved in distinct aspects of sensorimotor behavior compared with POm-cortical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Qi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we show that POm-striatal projections encode a behaviorally relevant arousal-related signal that increases with learning. POm-striatal projections may constitute a ‘priming’ signal that combines with corticostriatal signals and contributes to inducing the up-state transition of SPN ensembles involved in action selection, by equally engaging D1- and D2-SPNs and PV interneurons. These finding suggest a previously unknown functional role of POm engagement of striatal microcircuitry. It will be important for future studies to investigate whether POm further innervates other striatal interneurons, to assess the timing between POm-striatal and corticostriatal inputs to SPNs, and to assess whether POm-striatal synapses undergo synaptic plasticity across learning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All work involving animals including housing, surgery, behavioral experimentation, and euthanasia was approved by the Rutgers Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol #: 999900197). Mice were group housed in a reverse light cycle room (lights on from 20:00 to 08:00) with food and water available ad libitum with the exception of mice undergoing water restriction during behavioral experiments. All handling and experiments were conducted within the dark phase of this light cycle. Regardless of their experimental designation, all experimental animals underwent a unilateral AAV injection or a simultaneous AAV injection and cannula implant between –5 and 65 days (average: 52.37 days, range: –7–61 days). Briefly, male and female double transgenic mice were used for electrophysiology experiments. To identify specific neuronal populations during electrophysiology, Ai14 mice (cre-dependent tdTomato; The Jackson Laboratory, #007914) were crossed with either (1) D1-SPN cre (B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(DrD1cre)EY262Gsat/Mmucd; MMRRC, #030989), (2) D2-SPN cre (B6.FVB(Cg)-Tg(Adora2a-cre)KG139Gsat/Mmucd; MMRRC, #036158), or (3) PV-cre (B6.129P2-Pvalb<sup>tm1(cre)Arbr</sup>/J; The Jackson Laboratory, #017320) mice. This permitted red fluorescence in the specific cell population for visual identification via epifluorescent illumination. Animals designated for electrophysiology were euthanized between –2 and 4.5 months. Both male and female wild-type mice (The Jackson Laboratory #000664) were used for fiber photometry and optogenetic experiments. To motivate behavioral performance, daily water intake was restricted to ~1.5 mL per mouse per day. Body weight was carefully controlled and never permitted to drop below 80% of a calculated baseline value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). The number of male and female mice were as follows, by experiment type: six male, four female (electrophysiology); three male, two female (fiber photometry); four male, five female (optogenetics). Data were not analyzed for sex differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Electrophysiology and adeno-associated viral (AAV) injection</title><p>Male and female double transgenic mice designated for electrophysiology experiments underwent a unilateral injection of channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2; pAAV-hSyn-hChR2(H134R)-EYFP; Addgene #26973; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Lee et al., 2010</xref>) targeting the left POm thalamic nucleus. Briefly, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (4% induction, 1–2% maintenance) and moved into a stereotaxic apparatus (Stoelting/Kopf Instruments) containing a feedback-controlled heating pad on the base (maintained between 35°C and 37°C; FHC). Ophthalmic ointment (Akorn) was applied to the eyes to prevent them from drying out. Ethiqa XR (3.25 mg/kg; Fidelis Animal Health) and Bupivacaine (0.25%, 0.1 mL, Fresenius Kabi) were injected subcutaneously into the right flank and scalp, respectively. After, the scalp was sterilized by three cycles of Betadine (Purdue Products) and 70% ethanol, a midline incision was made. The exposed skull was cleared of fascia and leveled by confirming that bregma and lambda coordinates were on the same dorsoventral plane. A craniotomy was drilled (coordinates with respect to bregma: anteroposterior (AP)=–2.05 mm, mediolateral (ML) = +1.35 mm, dorsoventral (DV)=–3.25 mm) and the micropipette containing ChR2 was slowly lowered to the appropriate depth and permitted to sit for 5 min. Following this, ~100 nL of ChR2 viral solution was injected over the course of ~15 min via the Nanoject III system (Drummond Scientific). After an additional delay of 12 min, the micropipette was slowly raised, the scalp was sutured and secured with tissue glue. Immediately following surgery, mice were transferred to a clean cage on top of a heating blanket until ambulation was observed. Mice were continually monitored for 72 hr post-surgery. After this observation period, mice were permitted to recover for at least 3 weeks before undergoing electrophysiological experiments, permitting ChR2 expression into POm axon terminals in the striatum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Whole cell patch clamp recordings</title><p>Mice were briefly induced (via 3% isoflurane), deeply anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine (300/30 mg/kg, respectively), and transcardially perfused with recovery artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF), which contains the following (in mM): NMDG 103, KCl 2.5, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 30, HEPES 20, Glucose 25, HCl (1 N) 101, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 10, Thiourea 2, Sodium Pyruvate 3, N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine 12, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5 (saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Assous and Tepper, 2019</xref>). Following decapitation, the brain was rapidly extracted and submerged in recovery ACSF before being mounted onto a VT-1200S vibratome (Leica). The vibratome chamber was filled with oxygenated recovery ACSF, and 300 µm slices were cut. Slices were immediately transferred to recovery ACSF that was heated to 35 °C for ~5 min. After, slices were transferred to RT external ACSF which contained (in mM): NaCl 124, KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 26, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, Glucose 10, Sodium Pyruvate 3, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, and CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2 (saturated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>), and slices were allowed to recover for at least ~45 min before recording. Once the hippocampus began to appear, vibratome sectioning was terminated, and the posterior tissue block containing the injection site was transferred into 10% neutral-buffered formalin for post-hoc confirmation.</p><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were acquired from slices that were constantly superfused (2–4 mL/min) with oxygenated external ACSF at ~34 °C. Slices and cells were visualized by infrared differential interference contrast (IR-DIC) microscopy using a CCD camera (Hamamatsu) mounted onto a BX-51WI upright microscope (Olympus) fitted with a swinging objective holder containing two switchable lenses: a 4 X air lens and a 40 X water-immersion lens. Patch pipettes (3–5 MΩ) were pulled from borosilicate glass micropipettes (2 mm O.D., Warner Instruments) using a P-1000 horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments).</p><p>Current-clamp recordings were obtained from unidentified and identified striatal neurons in mice expressing tdTomato in either D1-SPNs, D2-SPNs, or PV cells within pDLS (−0.34 to –1.22 mm relative to bregma), which is known to receive POm projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib148">Smith et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Alloway et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Alloway et al., 2014</xref>). The internal pipette solution for current-clamp experiments contained (in mM): K Methanesulfonate 130, KCl 10, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.4, at pH 7.25 and 285–290 mOsm/L. Further, 2% biocytin was freshly dissolved in the internal solution on the recording day. ChR2 in the POm axon terminals was stimulated via illumination with a 2.5ms, 470 nm LED light pulse (~0.6 mW measured after the objective; Thorlabs) delivered through the 40 X objective lens. The illumination spot size had a diameter of ~550 µm. After patching, the internal solution was permitted to dialyze for ~5 min. At this point, the resting membrane potential was recorded. All cells were held at –80±2 mV to ensure equal driving forces when studying synaptic strength and short-term synaptic plasticity. Baseline voltages that drifted outside of this range were excluded from analysis. Patched cells were held for ~25–35 min while being run through a standardized set of protocols: (1) hyperpolarizing/depolarizing current steps, (2) single pulse (SP), (3) paired pulse ratio (PPR), and (4) train stimulation. Occasionally, unidentified cells within the same FOV were sequentially patched following the initial identified cell patch to control for injection site volume and location. After breaking in, the cell was allowed to recover for ~5 min before being subjected to hyperpolarizing and depolarizing current steps (–300 pA to +400 pA, 50 pA steps, 500ms, 15 sweeps) for cell health and intrinsic parameter confirmation. For the SP protocol, a single 2.5ms blue light pulse was presented once every 15 s for 20 sweeps. For the PPR protocol, five 2.5ms pulses, separated by 50ms inter-pulse intervals (IPI), were presented once every 15 s for 20 sweeps. For the train protocol, thirty 2.5ms pulses, separated by 64.2ms IPI (15 Hz), were presented once every 30 s for five sweeps. While these protocols were being run, biocytin within the internal solution diffused into the cell for subsequent 3D morphological reconstructions. Data were acquired via a EPC10USB amplifier and digitized at 20 kHz in Patchmaster Next (HEKA). Liquid junction potential was not corrected in these traces.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analysis of patch clamp recordings</title><p>All data were analyzed offline using custom-written MATLAB and Python scripts. DAT files from Patchmaster Next (HEKA) were imported, organized, and saved as a mat variable. The mat variable data was imported into Python for post-processing using the electrophysiology feature extraction librarIFEL created by the Blue Brain Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Ranjan et al., 2023</xref>). All pertinent intrinsic value parameters were calculated at the +350 pA current step. Key values pertaining to every action potential in a sweep were calculatIia eFEL including the action potential threshold value and index, the peak value and index, and the corresponding minimum afterhyperpolarization (AHP) value and index. Each action potential threshold value and index were captured using a derivative threshold method (dV/dt ≥10 mV/s). Action potential properties were assessed for all spikes in a sweep and averaged together. The action potential peak was defined as the difference between the action potential threshold and its maximum positive peak. Half-height width (HHW) and rise time were both calculated via interpolation. HHW was measured at 50% of the action potential peak, while rise time was measured from 10% to 90% of the action potential peak. AHP amplitude was calculated as the difference between the action potential threshold value and the minimum AHP value. Maximum frequency.</p><p>For all optogenetically evoked PSPs, a baseline measure was calculated by averaging the first 10,000 sampling points for each individual sweep. This measured value was subtracted from every value in each individual sweep, setting the baseline equal to zero. The maximum PSP amplitude, relative to the zero baseline value, was calculated from the average of 20 sweeps during SP and PPR protocols, and 5 sweeps during Train protocols. The latency to maximum PSP amplitude was measured as the difference between photostimulation onset and the maximum PSP index. For PPR and Train protocols, an exponential function was fitted to the decay component of each PSP, and their amplitudes were extracted after subtracting the decay of preceding PSPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Simultaneous AAV injection and optical cannula implantation surgery</title><p>For male and female wild-type in the designated fiber photometry cohort, a 400 µm core optical cannula (ferrule OD = 2.5 mm, length = 2 mm, nA = 0.50; Thorlabs #CFM15L02) was implanted directly above the left pDLS along with a~100 nL unilateral injection of axon-jGCaMP8s (pAAV-hSynapsin-axon-jGCaMP8s-P2A-mRuby3; Addgene #172921; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Broussard et al., 2018</xref>) into the ipsilateral POm.

Further, an HHMI head plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Huber et al., 2012</xref>) was fitted to each mouse using methods previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lee and Margolis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Margolis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 0.8–1.5% maintenance) and mounted within a stereotaxic frame (Stoelting/Kopf Instruments) with a feedback-controlled heating pad (FHC) maintaining the body temperature between 35–37°C. Following administration of an analgesic (Ethiqa XR, 3.25 mg/kg; Fidelis Animal Health) to the left flank and a local anesthetic (0.25% Bupivacaine; Fresenius Kabi) under the scalp, the scalp was sterilized with a triple cycle of Betadine (Purdue Products) followed by 70% ethanol (Fisher). A midline incision was made, and a circular piece of scalp was removed to expose the skull. Both lateral muscles and the nuchal muscle were separated from the skull. The skull was cleaned by gently scraping away the periosteum. A dental etch bonding agent (iBond; Heraeus Kulzer) was applied to the clean skull and cured with blue light for 20 s twice. A ring of dental composite (Charisma; Heraeus Kulzer) was applied to the outer edge of the skull and cured with blue light. After ensuring that bregma and lambda coordinates were equal in the dorsoventral plane, two craniotomies were made: one above the left posterior striatum (AP = –0.80 mm, ML = +2.8 mm, DV = 1.8 mm) for cannula implantation and the other above left POm (AP = –2.05 mm, ML = +1.35 mm, DV = –3.25 mm) for the corresponding AAV injection. The AAV injection was always performed first. The micropipette containing axon-jGCaMP8s (fiber photometry cohort), ChR2 (No Stim cohort), or JAWS (JAWS cohort) was slowly lowered to the appropriate depth and permitted to sit for 5 min. ~100 nL of AAV solution was injected over the course of ~15 minutes via the Nanoject III system (Drummond Scientific). After an additional delay of 12 min, the micropipette was slowly raised. Once the optic cannula was secured in the stereotaxic frame and lowered to the appropriate DV coordinate, it was secured with dental composite (Tetric Evoflow; Heraeus Kulzer) that was cured with blue light. The HHMI headpost was delicately secured on the posterior area of the charisma ring with cyanoacrylate and dental composite. Finally, a single layer of dental composite was used to build and secure the rest of the headcap before being cured four times with blue light for 20 s each. The scalp was closed around the headcap by using cyanoacrylate.</p><p>Immediately after the optical implant and viral injection surgery, mice were placed in a sterile, clean cage that was half-on/half-off a heating pad until ambulation was observed. Mice were diligently monitored for 72 hr post-surgery. After this monitoring period, mice were transferred to a clean cage on a ventilated rack for at least 3 weeks prior to handling and water restriction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Handling and water restriction</title><p>After a 3-week waiting period, mice were placed under citric acid water restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib164">Urai et al., 2021</xref>) during which mice were handled twice daily for 1 week. The bitterness of citric acid naturally causes mice to reduce their water consumption and, consequently, their weight while still having access to water. Initially, mice were acclimated to handling as researchers placed their hands into the cage for increasing amounts of time (e.g. 5 min to 10 min to 15 min). After mice became comfortable, they were held for increasing amounts of time (e.g. 2 min to 5 min to 10 min). Additionally, mice were acclimated to head fixation by holding their HHMI headposts (e.g. 30 s to 1 min to 2 min), and they were allowed to freely explore the behavioral tube for 5 min per handling session. Finally, mice were headfixed for increasing amounts of time in the behavioral setup (e.g. 5 min to 10 min to 15 min). Water was provided via transfer pipette to comfortably acclimate mice to head fixation. The head-fix apparatus contained a tube (length = 15 cm; inner diameter = 4 cm) that was affixed to a custom metal platform (length = 17 cm; width = 12 cm). The platform also contained HHMI mounting arms and holders for head fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Huber et al., 2012</xref>). During the final day of handling, mice were transitioned to full water restriction as this permits greater control over motivation level. During behavioral testing, daily water intake was limited to ~1.5 mL per day to motivate performance on the Go/NoGo paradigm described below. The baseline body weight was measured daily during water restriction, and overall body weight was not permitted to drop below 80% of the baseline weight, consistent with levels of restriction used to motivate performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fiber photometry setup</title><p>Fiber photometry data were collected using a RZ10x lock-in amplifier within the Synapse suite (Tucker-Davis Technologies). This amplifier and accompanying Synapse software was used to control a custom-built optical benchtop through drivers (LEDD1B, Thorlabs) to modulate LED signals. Briefly, this optical benchtop consisted of a self-contained system of four 30 mm cage cubes with integrated filter mounts (CM1-DCH/M, Thorlabs). A 405 nm LED (M405L4, Thorlabs) and a 470 nm LED (M470L3, Thorlabs) were mounted onto the first 30 mm cage cube. The 405 nm LED was used to extract the calcium-independent isosbestic signal, and the 470 nm LED was used to acquire calcium-dependent axonal GCaMP signals during the Go/NoGo paradigm. The 405 nm isosbestic signal was modulated at 210 Hz, and the 470 nm GCaMP signal was modulated at 330 Hz. A 425 nm dichroic longpass filter (DMLP425R, Thorlabs) in the first cage cube reflected the 405 nm excitation light and permitted the 470 nm light to pass through. As the light entered the second cage cube, both excitation lights were reflected by a 495 nm dichroic longpass filter (495DCLP, 67–079, Edmund Optics) into the third cage cube. A 460/545 nm bandpass filter (69013xv2, Chroma) reflected both excitation wavelengths down to the subject via a low autofluorescence patch cable (MAF3L1, core = 400 µm, nA = 0.50, length = 1 m, Thorlabs). This cable was attached onto the implanted optical cannula (see above) by a ceramic mating sleeve (Thorlabs). Isosbestic and axon-jGCaMP8s emissions were collected via the optic cannula and passed through the 460/545 nm bandpass filter (69013xv2, Chroma)into the fourth. Finally, the emission fluorescence passed through the detection pathway to reach the RZ10x photosensors for online observation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Orofacial video recording</title><p>POm activity has been well correlated with whisking and pupil activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Petty et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>). To analyze these dynamics, an LED driver controlled an IR spotlight that illuminated the contralateral eye and mystacial pad, and facial recordings were captured through an autofocusing USB webcam (NexiGo N660P) at ~20 fps within the Synapse software. To limit light pollution from outside sources (e.g. LED illumination within the brain/eye), an IR filter was placed in front of the webcam. Also, a shortpass emission filter at 750 nm (Chroma #ET750sp-2p8) was placed between the third and fourth cage cubes to prevenI recorded IR light from overloading the photosensors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Synchronization of task-related components</title><p>The Synapse software suite (Tucker-Davis Technologies) permitted the synchronous recording of both emitted (isosbestic and calcium) signals and video frames. Furthermore, the LabVIEW system-controlled paradigm-related components (e.g. texture movement, lick thresholds, trial type, trial outcome, etc.) and recorded the resulting behavioral parameters (e.g. licking activity, trial type, and trial outcome). To synchronize these two data streams for post-hoc analysis, TTL pulses relating to the texture arrival at its endpoint (which indicates the start of the presentation time window) from the LabVIEW system were captured within the Synapse software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>In vivo optogenetics</title><p>For the JAWS cohort, a high-powered 617 nm LED (M617F2, Thorlabs) and current driver (LEDD1B, Thorlabs) were used for photoinactivation of POm axons in the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Huda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Mo et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>). LED stimulation was provided at a probability of 0.50 for every session from the start of the Learning phase until mice reached the Expert phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>). The light intensity was measured at ~7 mW at the tip of the fiber. Stimulation intensity was kept consistent between mice and days by measuring the intensity with an optical power meter (PMD-100D, Thorlabs) prior to the first session every day. Light was delivered to the thalamic afferents in pDLS through an optical fiber patchcord (M95L01, fiber core diameter: 200 µm, length: 1 m, nA: 0.50) connected to a 200 µm core optical cannula (described above) via a mating sleeve (Thorlabs). A small piece of black heat shrink tubing (Qualtek) was placed over the cannula during LED testing to prevent stray light from illuminating the presented texture during the task.

Note that no LED stimulation was provided during the Learning or Expert phase. Testing occurred during the first four sessions after the five initial Shaping sessions and the last four sessions after mice reached Expert status. Sessions consisted of 50 baseline trials followed by 10 alternating blocks of 10 OFF and 10 ON trials. The light intensity was measured at ~5 mW at the tip of the fiber and was kept consistent between mice and days by measuring the intensity with an optical power meter (PMD-100D, Thorlabs) prior to the first session on testing days. Light was delivered to the thalamic afferents in pDLS through an optical fiber patchcord (M73L01, fiber core diameter: 200 µm, length: 1 m, nA: 0.50, Thorlabs) connected to a 200 µm optical cannula (described above) via a mating sleeve (Thorlabs).

The LabVIEW system controlled a Pulse Pal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib145">Sanders and Kepecs, 2014</xref>) that activated the LED current driver to provide pulsed illumination for 2 s at 15 Hz (matching the electrophysiology train photostimulation paradigm), evenly split 1 s before and 1 s after texture presentation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Go/NoGo whisker-based discrimination paradigm</title><p>Headfixed, water restricted mice were trained to perform a whisker-based discrimination paradigm as two textures were presented unilaterally to the right whiskers in a randomized order based on a custom-written LabVIEW code (National instruments). This code used transistor-transistor logic (TTL) pulses to control all aspects of the paradigm including a water delivery spout connected to a piezo film sensor (MSP1006-ND; Measurement Specialties), and a motorized linear stage (T-LSM100A; Zaber) with a stepper motor (T-NM17A04; Zaber) containing two windmill arms holding two different sandpaper textures (Go texture = 100 grit sandpaper, P100; NoGo texture = 1200 grit sandpaper, P1200; 3 M) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Lee and Margolis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Margolis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Mice were trained to discriminate between these two textures by licking the piezo film sensor spout. Mechanical spout displacement resulted in transient voltage changes, and a lick was defined as voltage changes crossing either an upper or lower threshold once. After a lick was detected within the appropriate response window, the LabVIEW software immediately delivered the appropriate output: for Go trials, mice received a small water reward via a solenoid valve (0127; Buerkert) through the piezo spout, and, for NoGo trials, mice received a timeout period with co-occurring white noise. This paradigm occurred within a darkened room to minimize non-tactile related cues. Both textures and the headfix apparatus were cleaned with 70% ethanol between each mouse. If mice were not performing the task, sessions could be ended early. Water could be automatically delivered (AutoReward or AR) by the experimenter following 20 consecutive trials without a response. Finally, a session could be terminated if a mouse did not lick when water was present on the end of the spout after three ARs.</p><p>Trials began with a 1000ms pre-task interval followed by a brief cue tone (100ms, 2039 Hz) that accompanied windmill texture movement toward the mice. Once the windmill texture had reached a predetermined distance within the whisking field, mice had to respond within a 2000ms presentation time (PT) window. For the first 500ms of the PT window, a grace period was present where responses did not trigger appropriate outcomes to reduce impulsivity. If mice licked in response to the Go texture, the trial was considered a Hit and resulted in a water reward accompanied by a correct tone (2793 Hz). If mice licked in response to the NoGo texture, the trial was considered a False Alarm (FA) and resulted in punishment parameters including a time-out period (12,000ms) and an accompanying white noise during the time-out period. Air puffs were eschewed as a punishment parameter to permit continuous pupil dynamic recording. If mice did not lick to the Go or the NoGo texture, nothing occurred, and the trial was considered a Miss or a Correct Rejection (CR), respectively. Immediately after a lick was recorded or the 2000ms PT window had elapsed, the windmill texture retreated to its original position where the current texture either remained or the other texture was rotated into position. Finally, trials were separated by a 2000ms intertrial interval. Behavioral performance was tracked across texture discrimination sessions by computing multiple behaviorally-related parameters including Hit Rate, FA Rate, Sensitivity (d’) and Bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">McNicol, 1970</xref>). For the fiber photometry cohort, the 405 nm and 470 nm LEDs provided constant illumination throughout all trials. For the JAWS cohort, LED photoinactivation occurred at a trial probability of 0.50 for every session from the start of the Learning until the end of the Expert phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">La Terra et al., 2022</xref>). For the No Stim cohort, LED stimulation did not occur during training (i.e. during either the Learning or Expert phases). It only occurred for four sessions after the initial five shaping sessions, and four sessions after mice reached expert status.</p><p>This whisker-based discrimination paradigm lasted up to 3 weeks. The FP cohort were only tested once per day to limit photobleaching. The JAWS and No Stim cohorts were tested twice daily. Each session consisted of 150 trials. All cohorts progressed through three behavioral phases (Shaping, Learning, and Expert) that were segmented into five analytical time points (Shaping, Early Learning, Late Learning, and Expert). The Shaping time point was the same for all mice. For the first three sessions, mice were acclimated to reliably trigger water delivery by licking the water spout. During these sessions, neither texture was presented to the whiskers. After, mice proceeded to texture discrimination training still under the Shaping phase. For the last two sessions, both textures were presented simultaneously with a Go texture probability of 0.90 and 0.75, respectively. Go and NoGo trials were interleaved in a pseudorandom order determined by the LabVIEW software. After the 0.75 probability session, mice progressed into the Learning phase. For all following sessions, the Go texture probability was set to 0.50 with a maximum of three consecutive presentations of the same texture. Discrete behavioral time points were determined as follows. The Early Learning time point was considered the first two sessions of the Learning phase. The Late Learning time point was considered the last two sessions of the Learning phase before achieving expert status. This occurred when mice had a Hit Rate ≥0.80 and a FA Rate ≤0.30 for two consecutive sessions. A strict sensitivity threshold was not used due to artificially increased sensitivity (discrimination) values as Hit Rate and/or FA Rate approach their extremes (e.g. see FPOm-18 sessions 8–15 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After discrimination training (i.e. achieving expert status), mice in the fiber photometry cohort were subjected to a single Reward session to assess calcium, licking, and pupil activity in the absence of texture input and licking-related outcomes. During this session, the Go trial probability remained at 0.50, and the Zaber motor moved the windmill texture holder toward the whisker field, but the textures were rotated out of whisker range. Further, the upper and lower thresholds were set so that licking could not trigger outcomes before the end of the PT window. A water reward was automatically delivered at the end of the PT window during Go trials only. A whisker trim control session was performed in a subset of mice to confirm that mice used their whiskers to discriminate as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Histology</title><p>For electrophysiology experiments, the tissue block containing the injection site was stored overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin at 4 °C.

Briefly, a model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib174">Yamada and Toda, 2022</xref>) was created with eight markers circumscribing the pupil, permitting the estimation of the approximate pupil area for each frame. All videos were cropped to a smaller dimension (230x275 pixels) that focused on each mouse’s face. For each mouse, one video was selected at varying behavioral time points, and 30 frames were extracted and manually labeled with the eight markers. Each marker corresponded to a pupil location: top, top right, right, bottom right, bottom, bottom left, left, and top left. Additionally, another marker was placed on a static location (e.g. the water spout) to label frames when blinking occurred. Overall, the initial training dataset contained 150 labeled frames, and the model was trained on this dataset with a ResNet50-based neural network for 250,000 iterations. After, the initial training videos were analyzed to assess the performance of the model from its marker estimations. 25 outlier frames from the initial training videos were extracted, manually corrected, and merged with the initial dataset. The model was trained again on this 275 labeled frame dataset with a ResNet50-based neural network for 250,000 iterations. After evaluating the network, the train error was calculated at 1.24 pixels, and the test error was measured at 1.25 pixels. Once the model was successfully trained, all behavioral videos of the five mice were analyzed. To estimate pupil area, a python library (scikit-image; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib166">van der Walt et al., 2014</xref>) was used to fit an ellipse on the estimations of the eight markers generated by DeepLabCut. This ellipse model was used to predict the values of the vertices and co-vertices on the ellipse, permitting the calculation of the major and minor axes. Thus, these measurements were used to approximate the area of the pupil for each frame. To detect blinking behavior, the maximum pupil size in non-blinking conditions was calculated and used as a threshold to identify abnormally high pupil predictions. As such, pupil areas greater than 450 pixels were removed via interpolation. The pupil area data were saved as a csv file for importing into MATLAB.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Fiber photometry signal processing</title><p>Custom-written MATLAB scripts were used for post processing of the fluorescent signals.

Pupil data was resampled to align with GCaMP signal using rational fraction approximation. Furthermore, the length of each trial, as determined by the overall responding data, was recorded and used to capture the GCaMP and pupil data within each trial window. Licks were identified by setting upper and lower thresholds, and detecting when either was crossed. At this point, all parameters (e.g. GCaMP, pupil, and licking activity) were captured and aligned within the time window of each trial.

The authors first confirm that POm forms &quot;en passant&quot; synapses with some of the DLS neuronal subtypes. They then perform a go/no-go associative task that consists of the mouse learning to discriminate between two different textures and to associate one of them with an action. During this task they either record the activity of the POm to DLS axons using endoscopy or silence their activity. They report that POm axons in the DLS are activated around the sensory stimulus but that the activity is not modulated by the reward. Last, they showed that silencing the POm axons at the level of DLS slows down learning the task.</p><p>The authors show convincing evidence of projections from POm to DLS and that POm inputs to DLS code for whisking whatever the outcome of the task is. However, their results do not allow to conclude if more neurones are recruited during the learning process or if the already activated fibres get activated more strongly. Last, because POm fibres in the DLS are also projecting to S1, silencing the POm fibres in the DLS could have affected inputs in S1 as well and therefore, the slowdown in acquiring the task is not necessarily specific to the POm to DLS pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>One of the main strengths of the paper is to go from slice electrophysiology to behaviour to get an in-depth characterization of one pathway. The authors did a comprehensive description of the POm projections to the DLS using transgenic mice to unambiguously identify the DLS neuronal population.

The authors first confirm that POm forms &quot;en passant&quot; synapses with some of the DLS neuronal subtypes. They then perform a go/no-go associative task that consists of the mouse learning to discriminate between two different textures and to associate one of them with an action. During this task, they either record the activity of the POm to DLS axons using endoscopy or silence their activity. They report that POm axons in the DLS are activated around the sensory stimulus but that the activity is not modulated by the reward. Last, they showed that silencing the POm axons at the level of DLS slows down learning the task.</p><p>The authors show convincing evidence of projections from POm to DLS and that POm inputs to DLS code for whisking whatever the outcome of the task is. However, their results do not allow us to conclude if more neurons are recruited during the learning process or if the already activated fibres get activated more strongly. Last, because POm fibres in the DLS are also projecting to S1, silencing the POm fibres in the DLS could have affected inputs in S1 as well and therefore, the slowdown in acquiring the task is not necessarily specific to the POm to DLS pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these constructive comments.

However, there is much less known about the striatal projections of other thalamic nuclei, including POm, and their inputs to cholinergic neurons. Anatomical tracing evidence from Klug et al. (2018), which mapped brain-wide inputs to striatal cholinergic (ChAT) interneurons, suggests that Pf provides the majority of thalamic innervation of striatal ChAT neurons compared to other thalamic nuclei. Many other thalamic nuclei, including POm, showed very little of no labeling, suggesting weak innervation of ChAT interneurons. However, it is possible that these thalamic nuclei, including POm, do provide functional innervation of ChAT interneurons that is not sufficiently assessed by anatomical tracing.

(2012) indicated that POm axons form a branched collateral that innervates striatum, while the main axon continues in the rostral-dorsal direction to innervate cortex. We think it is reasonable, based on the morphology, that our optogenetic suppression experiment restricted the suppression of glutamate release to this branch and avoided the other branches of the axon that project to cortex. However, testing this would require monitoring S1 activity during the POm-striatal axon suppression, which we did not do in this study.</p><p>It is a very interesting question whether there could be different axon activity behavior in striatum versus S1. There is surprising evidence that POm synaptic terminals are different sizes in S1 and M1 and show different synaptic physiological properties depending on these cortical projection targets (Casas-Torremocha et al., 2022). Based on this, it is possible that POm-striatal synapses show distinct properties compared to cortex; however, this will need to be tested in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used endoscopy to measure the POm axons in the DLS activity, which makes it impossible to know if the progressive increase of POm response is due to an increase of activity from each individual neuron or if new neurons are progressively recruited in the process.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. It would be necessary to perform chronic two-photon imaging of POm neurons (or chronic electrophysiological recordings) to determine whether the activity of individual neurons increased versus whether individual neuron activity levels remained similar but new neurons became active with learning. Even under baseline conditions, it is not known in detail what fraction of the population of POm neurons is active during sensory processing or behavior, highlighting how much is still to be discovered in this exciting area of neuroscience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The picture presented in Figure 4 of the stimulation site is slightly concerning as there are hardly any fibres in neocortical layer 1 while there seems to be quite a lot of them in layer 4, suggesting that the animal here was injected in the VB.

In some cases, there was expression slightly outside the border of POm (see Fig. 1B, right), which might explain the cortical innervation pattern in this figure. While cortically bound VPM axons pass through the striatum, they do not form synaptic terminals until reaching the cortex (Hunnicutt et al., 2016). If, as may be the case, inhibitory opsins suppress release of neurotransmitter at synaptic terminals more effectively than action potential propagation in axons, it may be likely that optogenetic suppression of POm-striatal terminals is more effective than suppression of action potentials in off-target-labelled VPM axons of passage. Ideally, we could compare effects of suppression of POm-striatal synapses with POm-cortical synapses and VPM-cortical synapses, but this was outside the bandwidth of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Yonk and colleagues show that the posterior medial thalamus (POm), which is interconnected with sensory and motor systems, projects directly to major categories of neurons in the striatum, including direct and indirect pathway MSNs, and PV interneurons.

The connection between the PF thalamus and CINs is mentioned in a couple of places - one question is how unique are the input patterns for the POm versus adjacent sensorimotor thalamic regions, including the PF? This isn't a weakness per se but knowing the answer to that question would help in forming a more complete picture of how these different thalamostriatal circuits do or do not contribute uniquely to learning and action selection.</p></disp-quote><p>Anatomical tracing evidence from Klug et al.

However, it is possible that these thalamic nuclei, including POm, do provide functional innervation of ChAT interneurons that is not sufficiently assessed by anatomical tracing.</p><p>Another difference between Pf and other thalamic nuclei (likely including POm) comes from anatomical tracing evidence (Smith et al., 2014; PMID: 24523677) which indicates that Pf inputs form the majority of their synapses onto dendritic shafts of SPNs, while other thalamic nuclei form synapses onto dendritic spines. Understanding the innervation patterns of POm-striatal projections beyond the three cell types we have studied here, including ChAT neurons and subcellular localization, would be an important area of further study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to know to what extent these POm-striatum neurons are activated generally during movement, versus this discrimination task specifically.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that distinguishing general movement-related activity from task-specific activity would be very useful. Earlier work (Petty et al., 2021) showed a close relationship between POm neuron activity, spontaneous (task-free) whisker movements, and pupil-indexed arousal in head-restrained mice. Oram et al. (2024; PMID: 39003286) recently recorded VPM and POm in freely moving mice during natural movements, finding that activity of both nuclei correlated with head and whisker movements. These studies indicate that POm is generally coactive with exploratory head and whisker movements.</p><p>During task performance, the situation may change with training and attentional effects. For example, Petty and Bruno (2024) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/97188">https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/97188</ext-link>) showed that POm activity correlates more closely with task demands than tactile or visual stimulus modality. Our data indicate that POm axonal signals are increased at trial start during anticipation of tactile stimulus delivery and through the sensory discrimination period, then decrease to baseline levels during licking and water reward collection (Fig. 3). Results of Petty and Bruno (2024) together with ours suggest that POm is particularly active during the context of behaviorally relevant task performance. Thus, we think it is likely that, while pupil dilation indexes general movement and arousal, POm activity is more specific to movement and arousal associated with task engagement and behavioral performance. We have strengthened this point in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many of the data panels and text for legends/axes are quite small, and the stroke on line art is quite faint - overall figures could be improved from a readability standpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful attention to the figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Major</p><p>(1) Page 4, the Results regarding PSP and distance from injection site. The r-squared is the wrong thing to look at to test for a relationship. One should look at the p-value on the coefficient corresponding to the slope. The p-value is probably significant given the figures, in which case there may be a relationship contrary to what is stated. All the low r-squared value says is that, if there is a relationship, it does not explain a lot of the PSP variability.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for alerting us this oversight. We have included the p value (p = 0.0293) in the figure and legend, and indicated that the relationship is “small but significant”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1B suggests that the virus injections extend beyond POm and into other thalamic structures. Do any of the results change if the injections contaminating other nuclei are excluded from the analysis? I am not suggesting the authors change the figures/analyses. I am simply suggesting they double-check.</p></disp-quote><p>We selected for injections that were predominantly expressing in POm as determined by post-hoc histological analysis (see Fig. 1, right). As above, we think that axons of passage that do not form striatal synapses are less likely to be suppressed than axons with terminals; however, this would need to be determined in further experiments. Because the preponderance of expression is within POm, we think the results would be similar even with a stricter selection criterion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors conclude that POm and licking are not correlated (bottom of page 6 pertaining to Figures 3A-F). The danger of these analyses is that they assume that GCaMP8 is a perfect linear reporter of POm spikes. The reliability of GCaMP8 has been quantified in some cell types, but not thalamic neurons, which have relatively higher firing rates.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the relationship between GCaMP8 fluorescence changes and spiking has not been sufficiently characterized in thalamic neurons, and that this would be important to do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What if the indicator is simply saturated late into the trial (after the average reaction time)? It would look like there is no response and one would conclude no correlation, but there could be a very strong correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>While saturation is worthy of concern, the signal dynamics here argue against this possibility. The reason is that the signal increased in the early part of the trial and decreased by the end. If saturation was an issue, this would have been apparent during the initial increase. When the signal decreased in amplitude at the end of the trial, this indicates that the signal is not saturated because it is returning from a point closer to its maximum (and is becoming less saturated).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, what happens between trials? Are the correlations the same, stronger, weaker? Ideally, the authors would analyze the data during and between trials.</p></disp-quote><p>Between trials the signal did not show further changes in baseline beyond what was displayed at the start and end of behavioral trials. There were no consistent increases or decreases in signals between trials, except perhaps during strong whisking bouts. This is anecdotal because we did not analyze between-trial data. However, it is interesting and important to note that signals increased dramatically in amplitude from naïve, early learning to expert behavioral performance (Fig. 3), highlighting that POm-axonal signals relate to behavioral engagement and performance rather than spontaneous behaviors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Axonal activity could also appear more correlated with the pupil than licking because pupil dynamics are slow like the dynamics of calcium indicators. These kernels could artificially inflate the correlation. Ideally, the authors could consider these temporal effects. Perhaps they could deconvolve the temporal profiles of calcium and pupil before correlating? Or equivalently incorporate the profiles into their analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the lick probability histograms, which had a temporal profile similar to the calcium signals (Fig. 3D,E), ruling out concerns about effects of temporal effects on correlations. It is also worth noting that we observed changes in correlations between calcium signals and pupil with learning stage (Fig. 3I), even though the temporal profiles (signal dynamics) are not changing. Thus, temporal effects of the signals themselves are not the driver of correlations, but rather the changes in relative timing between calcium signals and pupil, as occur with learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors conclude that PO provides a &quot;behaviorally relevant arousal-related signal&quot; and that this signal &quot;primes&quot; striatal circuitry for sensory processing. The data here support the first part. It is not clear that the data support the second part, largely because it is vague what &quot;priming&quot; of sensory processing or &quot;a key role in the initial stages of action selection (p.9) even means here. Why would such circuitry even be necessary? Why is a sensory signal from the cortex insufficient? Why should the animal more slowly learn the task? How does this fit with existing ideas of striatal plasticity? Some conceptual proposals from the authors, even if speculative and not offered as a conclusion, would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these good points and have added further consideration and revision of the concept of priming and potential roles in an extensively revised Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The photometry shows that PO turns on about 2 seconds before the texture presentation. PO's activity seems locked to the auditory cue, not the texture (Figure 2). This means that the attempt to suppress the thalamostriatal pathway with JAWS (Figure 4) is rather late, isn't it? Some PO signals surely go through. This seems to contradict the idea of priming above. It would be good if the authors could factor this into their narrative. Perhaps labelling the time of the auditory cue in Figure 4C would also be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>The start of texture presentation (movement of the texture panel toward the mouse) and auditory cue occur at the same time. To clarify this, we added a label “start tone” in Figure 4C and also in Figure 2C.</p><p>For optogenetic (JAWS) suppression, we intentionally chose a time window between start tone onset and texture presentation, because our photometry experiments showed that this was when the preponderance of the signal occurred. However, the reviewer is correct that our chosen optogenetic suppression (JAWS) onset occurs shortly after the photometry signal has already started, potentially leaving the early photometry signal un-suppressed. Our motivation for choosing a restricted time window surrounding the texture presentation time was (1) to minimize illumination and potential heating of brain tissue; (2) to target a time window that avoids the auditory cue but covers stimulus presentation. We did not want to extend the duration of the suppression to before the trial started, because this could produce task-non-specific effects, such as distraction or loss of attention before the start of the trial.</p><p>Even if some signal were getting through before suppression, we don’t think this contradicts the possibility of ‘priming’, because the process underlying priming would still be disrupted even if not totally suppressed. This would alter the temporal relationship between POm-striatal inputs and further corticostriatal inputs (from S1 and M1 cortex, for example). We have included further consideration of these points and possible relation to the priming concept in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor</p><p>(1) Page 5, &quot;the sensitivity metric is artificially increased&quot;.

It is true that either a change in HR or FAR can cause the sensitivity metric to change, but there is nothing artificial or misleading about this.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the word artificial and clarified our definition of behaviorally Expert in this context:</p><p>“Mice were considered Expert once they had reached ≥ 0.80 Hit Rate and ≤ 0.30 FA Rate for two consecutive sessions in lieu of a strict sensitivity (d’) threshold; we found this definition more intuitive because d’ is enhanced as Hit Rate and FA Rate approach their extremes (0 or 1)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Page 7, &quot;Upon segmentation (Figure S4G-J)&quot;.

Would POm-cortical inputs not also be sensorimotor? The somatosensory cortex contains a lot of corticostriatal cells. It also has various direct and indirect links to the motor cortex as well.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the wording here to convey the possibility that POm signals could be received and processed differently by striatal versus cortical circuitry, and have moved this statement to later in the discussion for better elaboration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The Methods state that male and female mice were used.
