machinery. In bacteria, this is usually achieved when the SecY-complex engages the cytosolic ATPase SecA (secretion) or translating ribosomes (insertion). Great strides have been made towards understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. Yet, important questions remain – notably, the nature of the individual steps that constitute transport, and how the proton-motive force (PMF) across the plasma membrane contributes. Here, we apply a recently developed high-resolution protein transport assay to explore these questions. We find that pre-protein transport is limited primarily by the diffusion of arginine residues across the membrane, particularly in the context of bulky hydrophobic sequences. This specific effect of arginine, caused by its positive charge, is mitigated for lysine which can be deprotonated and transported across the membrane in its neutral form. These observations have interesting implications for the mechanism of protein secretion, suggesting a simple mechanism through which the PMF can aid transport by enabling a 'proton ratchet', wherein re-protonation of exiting lysine residues prevents channel re-entry, biasing transport in the outward direction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein secretion</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>SecYEG</kwd><kwd>SecA</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S008349/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Daniel W</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/N015126/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watkins</surname><given-names>Daniel W</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M003604/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corey</surname><given-names>Robin A</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I008675/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>William J</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Secretory and membrane proteins are recognised by factors for delivery, usually in an unfolded state, to bespoke protein translocation machineries (translocons) for carriage across or into cellular membranes. Amongst these, and responsible for the majority both of protein secretion and membrane protein insertion, is the universally conserved Sec system: at its core the heterotrimer SecYEG/β in plasma membrane of bacteria and Archaea or Sec61αβγ in the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. The Sec system transports unfolded proteins, either immediately as they emerge from the ribosome (co-translationally) or following their release (post-translationally; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arkowitz et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>In bacteria, membrane protein insertion is generally co-translational, whereas almost all secretion is post-translational, mediated by the cytosolic ATPase SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lill et al., 1990</xref>). Prior to passage across the membrane, pre-proteins with a SS are recognised by SecA, either directly or with the assistance of chaperones such as SecB, and brought to SecYEG in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartl et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumamoto and Beckwith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oliver and Beckwith, 1982</xref>). The SS unlocks the translocon and initiates transport by inserting as a hairpin through the channel (step <italic>i</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corey et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2019</xref>), using ATP hydrolysis by SecA as an energy source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Economou and Wickner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lill et al., 1990</xref>). Transport of the rest of the of the polypeptide substrate proceeds stepwise (steps <italic>ii-v</italic>, elaborated below), with cycles of ATP turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>), aided in vivo by the electrochemical gradient of protons across the membrane – the proton-motive force (PMF; positive and acidic outside; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schiebel et al., 1991</xref>). Once the pre-protein has crossed the membrane, the SS is cleaved off by signal peptidase and the transported protein released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Josefsson and Randall, 1981</xref>); this release step appears to require additional factors – most likely the periplasmic chaperone PpiD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonoaea et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>) – as it is very slow when measured in vitro using ex vivo or purified and reconstituted components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Brownian ratchet model.</title><p>Mechanism of pre-protein transport, based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>.

Adding a non-hydrolysable ATP analogue to the system, which emulates the effect of nucleotide exchange (step <italic>ii</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) has two major observable effects: it widens the channel through SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>) while tightening the clamp around pre-protein in SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahdash et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catipovic et al., 2019</xref>). Nucleotide exchange itself is promoted by perturbation of the two-helix finger (2HF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>) of SecA caused by the presence of pre-protein at the entrance to the channel through SecYEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these observations led us to propose a model in which pre-protein moves through the channel primarily by diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). Sequences that cannot diffuse across the membrane in the ADP-bound state (blocks, purple in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) trigger nucleotide exchange (step <italic>ii</italic>), opening the SecYEG channel to allow them to slide through (step <italic>iii</italic>) and simultaneously clamping SecA shut to prevent them slipping backwards. ATP hydrolysis resets the channel (step <italic>iv</italic>), trapping block sequences that have diffused across on the outside of the membrane, thus providing directionality. This process (steps <italic>ii-iv</italic>) is repeated for each remaining block (step <italic>v</italic>) until the entire pre-protein has crossed the membrane.</p><p>A major prediction of the above model is that not every ATP turnover will give rise to a transport event, as step <italic>ii</italic> is reversible. Recent high-resolution protein transport data, collected using a new assay based on split NanoLuc luciferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dixon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>), lent support to this notion. In this assay, the large fragment of NanoLuc (11S) is encapsulated within proteoliposomes (PLs) or inverted membane vesicles (IMVs) containing SecYEG, while a high-affinity complementary small fragment (pep86) is incorporated into the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As soon as pep86 enters the vesicle it combines with 11S, producing a luminescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>). Using detailed kinetic modelling, we showed that transport occurs in about five steps for the model 161 amino acid pre-protein pSpy, and that each step requires many ATP turnovers to resolve (an estimated 120 for pSpy in vitro, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>). However, we were unable to show exactly what these steps – presumably the blocks in the above model – physically correspond to. It also remains unclear how the PMF contributes.</p><p>To answer these questions, we have now generated a range of different pSpy variants with different physical and chemical properties. Employing the NanoLuc assay to measure their transport both in the presence and absence of proton-motive force (PMF), we show that transporting positively charged residues across the membrane is the slowest step of transport, with bulkier residues also increasing secretion time. This strong barrier to positive charges is partially overcome by deprotonating lysines at the cytosolic face of the membrane; for this reason, arginines, which have a much higher p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> than lysine, are by far the hardest amino acid to transport. Surprisingly, however, charged residues seem unaffected by the electrical component of PMF (∆ψ) in our experimental setup – even though electrophoresis ought to be favourable, given that deprotonation of lysines confers a net negative charge to the polypeptide as it passes though the channel towards the positive exterior.</p><p>We also find that removing all arginine residues from the pre-protein hugely increases the number of kinetic transport steps, despite speeding up transport overall. Variable step size is characteristic of diffusion-based model such as the one presented above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For a power stroke mechanism, on the other hand, for example where an ATP-dependent piston movement of SecA pushes stretches of polypeptide across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catipovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catipovic and Rapoport, 2020</xref>) step size depends on SecA, and should thus be invariant. Taken together, our results provide important new mechanistic insights of the mechanism of protein secretion; both the insights and the experimental approaches are potentially applicable to other machineries that transport unfolded proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The chemical and physical properties of pre-protein affect its transport characteristics</title><p>We started by investigating which physical properties of a pre-protein determine how fast it is transported through SecYEG, by systematically varying the amino acid sequence of the model Sec substrate pSpy. It quickly became apparent that altering pSpy affects its solubility in transport buffer, potentially along with other properties such as affinity for SecA, and the rates of initiation and termination. We therefore created constructs consisting of the pSpy SS followed by three tandem mature (m)Spys, with a pep86 sequence after the second (pSpy<sub>XLX</sub>; XLX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) – and altered only the central one. The two flanking native Spy sequences ensure that the beginning and end of transport are always the same, and prevent the less stable Spy variants from precipitating upon dilution out of urea. As a control, we created the same construct but with pep86 after the first mSpy (pSpy<sub>LXX</sub>, LXX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The difference in transport time between these two proteins (measured from the lag before transport signal appears, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>) corresponds exactly to the time it takes to transport the central mSpy (pink in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>). The lags for these match perfectly with those for the pSpy<sub>4x</sub> series used previously (four tandem Spys; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a-b</xref>), confirming that lag is indeed a true and sensitive measure of transport time.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Transport of pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of pSpy<sub>LXX</sub> (LXX) and pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> (XLX). Transport occurs from the N- to C-terminus (left to right), and a luminescence signal appears as soon as pep86 (yellow) enters the lumen of the PL.

In this model, lag is the minimum time required for pre-protein transport, and corresponds to the sum of time constants for all transport steps (equal to 1<italic>/k</italic>, where <italic>k</italic> is the rate constant for that step). λ is a complicated variable, incorporating the transport rates but also the probability of transport pausing or failure and resetting (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref> for more details).

We chose four general amino acid properties: size (L→A, A→L; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), hydrophobicity (T→V, I→T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), negative charge (Q→E, E→Q; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), and positive charge (R→Q, Q→R, K→Q, Q→K, K→R, R→K; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). In the case of positive charge, we looked both at lysine – which can in some environments be deprotonated at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isom et al., 2011</xref>) – and arginine, which is generally considered to always retain its positive charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harms et al., 2011</xref> see also below). We find that transport is slower (longer lag than native pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> above that of pSpy<sub>LXX</sub>, 0.65 min) when more bulky, hydrophobic and positively charged residues are present, while negative charges have limited effect. By far, the strongest effect comes from changing the number of arginines: removing all eight (RQ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) reduces the transport time threefold (from 0.64 min to 0.26 min), while adding a further eight (QR in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>) slows transport over fourfold (to 3.1 min).</p><p>Leucine is more hydrophobic than alanine, while threonine is somewhat smaller than isoleucine or valine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), so these experiments do not distinguish particularly effectively between bulkiness and hydrophobicity. We therefore designed an additional variant in which all five phenylalanine residues were replaced with tryptophan (F→W; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This increases bulkiness while decreasing hydrophobicity according to most hydrophobicity scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a-d</xref>), in theory allowing the two effects to be disentangled. The results reveal that the F→W substitutions slow transport, which suggests that residue size is a more important factor than hydrophobicity. It should be noted, however, that tryptophan is more hydrophobic than phenylalanine according to the Wimley-White scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wimley and White, 1996</xref>); hence, this substitution is not an absolute confirmation of the importance of size over hydrophobicity.</p><p>We have previously shown that the ATP hydrolytic cycle of SecA can influence the formation of secondary structure (primarily α-helix) within the translocating pre-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2019</xref>), promoting its unfolding at the cytosolic entrance to SecYEG and formation on the periplasmic side. To explore the effect of this on transport kinetics, we designed pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants in which the helical propensity of one, two or three regions was reduced, without affecting the hydrophobic character of that region (∆h1, ∆h2 and ∆h3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>, purple). A converse set of mutations, in which the hydrophobic character is reduced without altering the helical propensity, was also generated (∆φ1, ∆φ2 and ∆φ3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>, green). The transport parameters with these variants show that if sufficient helical content is removed it somewhat slows transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>), supporting the notion that helix formation is part of the mechanism of transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2019</xref>). Removing hydrophobic patches, meanwhile, has marginal if any effect on transport rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>); taken together with the other results above, this suggests residue size is a bigger factor than hydrophobicity in determining transport rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Specific measurement of the transport steps for the pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants</title><p>The lag is a useful measure of overall transport time, but it cannot distinguish between a large number of fast steps and a small number of slow steps.

Starting the reaction with ATP allows transport to initiate (<italic>k</italic><sub>init</sub>, equal to <italic>k</italic><sub>step</sub>), followed by a number (<bold>n</bold>) of steps, each with the rate <italic>k</italic><sub>step</sub>. As soon as Pep86 enters the PL it binds to 11S, producing the luminescent signal. Because there are multiple sequential steps before NanoLuc formation, the transport signal begins to appear after a characteristic lag, equal to <italic>k</italic><sub>init</sub> + n × <italic>k</italic><sub>step</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>). Not every transport event that initiates goes on to produce a functional NanoLuc. At any point, transport can fail: either dissociating and requiring reinitiation (<italic>k</italic><sub>fail</sub>); or permanently, blocking the channel and preventing further transport (<italic>k</italic><sub>block</sub>). In the case of proSpy, each SecYEG appears only to transport a single pre-protein – so the total signal amplitude depends on the number of SecYEG import sites, and the relative rates of transport and <italic>k</italic><sub>block</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, simple analysis of the NanoLuc traces can provide estimates for the rate of transport and its success rate.

To explore this further, we carried out constant velocity steered molecular dynamics (SMD), to explore how easy it is for different side chains to pass through the channel.

The p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of lysine in solution is ~10, but it is readily deprotonated in hydrophobic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isom et al., 2011</xref>), whereas the delocalised positive charge of arginine’s guanidinium group (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ~13.8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fitch et al., 2015</xref>]) is much harder to remove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harms et al., 2011</xref>).

Indeed, a strong electrophoretic pulling force has been observed for negatively charged residues at the SecY channel entrance during co-translational membrane protein insertion, but no equivalent slowing of positively charged residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ismail et al., 2015</xref>). Deprotonation of lysines at the cytosolic face of SecYEG could neatly circumvent this problem, by imbuing essentially all pre-proteins with a net negative charge as they cross the membrane. To investigate this possibility, we therefore set out to measure the effect of PMF on transport.</p><p>To generate a continuous and stable PMF, we switched from PLs to IMVs purified from cells (over-)producing SecYEG and 11S (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>). IMVs derived from normally functioning <italic>E. coli</italic> strains contain F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, which works in reverse to produce a PMF upon addition of exogenous ATP. IMVs differ from PLs in that they contain other, native inner membrane proteins, albeit at much lower stoichiometry relative to SecYEG compared to native membranes. We started by comparing transport of pSpy-pep86 into PLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, pink) with transport into IMVs derived from a cell line lacking F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>o</sub>-ATP synthase, and therefore unable to generate PMF from ATP (HB1; green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). The results show that lag – which corresponds to transport time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>) – is identical for both, but IMV transport reaches completion faster, meaning a lower probability that transport stalls or fails. Presumably, this enhanced transport processivity is caused by differences between IMVs and PLs – either a specific effect of auxilliary Sec components, or non-specific differences in the membrane environment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>PMF stimulates transport primarily via ∆ψ.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Transport of pSpy-pep86 into PLs (pink), HB1 IMVs (lacking ATP synthase; green) and BL21 IMVs in the presence of valinomycin and nigericin (grey).

Together, these should eliminate PMF entirely; and indeed, as expected, when both ionophores are present transport into BL21 IMVs give a similar lag to PLs or HB1 IMVs (grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, see also inset). In the absence of ionophores (i.e. +PMF), transport (lag) is about about twice as fast as in their presence (orange vs grey in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Surprisingly, however, the total amplitude is slightly higher with the ionophores. As import is largely single turnover under the experimental conditions used (one pre-protein per SecYEG), an increase in amplitude suggests either that pre-proteins are less likely to become irrevocably stuck in the channel during transport, or that more of the SecYEG sites are active. Alternatively, the lowered pH inside the PL lumen in the presence of PMF might cause a reduction of NanoLuc signal – either by affecting NanoLuc directly or reducing the accessibility of pep86 – that is reversed by nigericin.</p><p>To separate the effects of ∆ψ and ∆pH, we next measured import with each of the two ionophores individually. Valinomycin alone (no ∆ψ, ∆pH increases to compensate) slows transport and produces a small reduction in amplitude (blue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), while nigericin (no ∆pH, increased ∆ψ) appears both to speed up transport and increase the maximum amplitude (green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). These effects are not caused by non-specific effects of the ionophores, as they are not observed for transport into HB1 IMVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). The faster import with nigericin most likely arises from an increase in ∆ψ caused by the dissipation of ∆pH; but this cannot explain the increase in amplitude, which is maintained even in the presence of valinomycin. A reasonable hypothesis is that nigericin is alleviating an effect on signal from the lowered pH in the energised IMV lumen.</p><p>While the effects of PMF and the individual ionophores are consistent and reproducible, they are relatively small – certainly not sufficient to bridge the difference in rate between ATP-only driven transport in vitro and the estimated two orders of magnitude faster transport rate in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cranford-Smith and Huber, 2018</xref>). We therefore measured the magnitude of PMF and its individual components in our purified IMVs, and compared them to the cells from which they are derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). The results suggest that the ∆ψ produced by the reverse action of ATP synthase in purified IMVs is comparable to that of intact, respiring <italic>E. coli</italic>, and that overexpression of SecYEG also makes little difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). However, the absolute measured value of ∆ψ is much lower than is generally reported for <italic>E. coli</italic> (~150 mV; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McMillan et al., 2007</xref>), and it is also possible that protein transport itself consumes PMF in vitro, as we have observed for mitochondrial protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ford et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the extent to which PMF contributes to pre-protein transport in the absence of auxilliary factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Stimulation of transport by PMF is pH-dependent</title><p>The IMV lumen volume is only a tiny fraction of the total reaction volume in the transport assay (&lt; 1/5000), so ∆pH presumably manifests as pH decrease inside the vesicle with negligible effect on the bulk pH outside. This contrasts with the situation in a living cell, where ∆pH primarily affects the pH on the cytosolic side of the membrane. Yet if deprotonation of lysines is part of the mechanism of PMF stimulation, then it is the pH experienced by the pre-protein before it is transported that matters – perhaps explaining why nigericin does not slow down transport in vitro.</p><p>To test the effect of topologically cytoplasmic pH, we prepared IMVs at three different pHs (6.0, 7.0, and 8.0) and measured import in the same buffer. In the absence of PMF, both the internal and external pH should be the same, and equal to the starting value; generating a PMF will acidify the vesicle lumen but leave the outside pH essentially unaffected. To test the effect of this on transport rate and PMF stimulation we used the pSpy<sub>4x</sub> series described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>). This comprises four proteins identical except for the number of copies of mSpy proteins that must pass through SecY before active pep86 becomes available to bind 11S; a plot of lag against active pep86 position therefore gives a straight line with a slope equal to the transport rate in Spy.min<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Just as observed for native pSpy (above), transport is considerably faster (~2 fold) with PMF (BL21 IMVs) than without (HB1 IMVs) at pH 8.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, blue data). However, as pH decreases, this difference vanishes: at pH 6.0, there is very little PMF effect on rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d–e</xref>). The same effect is observed when using ionophores, with the stimulatory effect of nigericin on amplitude also amplified at high pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2a-c</xref>). While this does not prove that it is specifically the pre-protein that is deprotonated, it is evidence that the mechanism of transport stimulation by ∆ψ is dependent on cytosolic pH.</p><p>It should also be noted that the overall import signal is much lower at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2d-e</xref>). This amplitude reflects the number of functional SecYEG import sites, the probability of transport blocking and the activity of the formed NanoLuc – so a number of things could be causing this reduction. These include faster deterioration of SecYEG during the IMV preparation or lower NanoLuc signal at low pH. Once total amplitude is accounted for, however, the rate at which pSpy<sub>4x</sub> becomes irreversibly trapped in the channel appears to be largely unaffected by pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2f-g</xref>), ruling this out as a cause.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PMF stimulation of transport is not measurably dependent on pre-protein charge</title><p>If the PMF primarily is acting on charged residues – promoting transport of negative changes and inhibiting diffusion of arginines – we would expect the magnitude of PMF stimulation to be dependent on the number of charged residues.

A more plausible explanation for this result is that the PMF effect in the IMV assay is confounded by some other factor. For example, there might be differences in folding behaviour that affect how the pre-protein interacts with the Sec system; a threshold effect of PMF that is not reached in our in vitro system (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>); or some contribution by other, unidentified components of IMVs. The exact relationship between PMF, the translocation machinery and pre-protein sequence therefore remains an open question.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The landmark solution of the first atomic structure of SecYEG in complex with SecA, over a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>), inspired multiple hypotheses for the underlying mechanism for the transport of pre-proteins across membranes. However, the difficulties obtaining quantitative data on transport itself have, until recently, prevented these from being properly tested. Here, we have applied the newly developed, high time-resolution NanoLuc transport assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>) to a set of model pre-proteins, designed to capture the rate of transport for amino acid sequences with different properties. Our results reveal a surprisingly simple set of rules for how fast pre-protein is transported through SecYEG: arginine is by far the slowest amino acid to transport, accounting for over 2/3 of the total transport time of the model pre-protein pSpy. Other residues that make a difference are lysines, and bulky residues such as tryptophan, with diffusion of bulky and positive patches probably accounting for the individual steps observed in transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, purple balls).</p><p>In our experiments, transport of arginines is slow and rate-limiting. In contrast, lysines behave much more like neutral residues, suggesting that they are at least partially deprotonated before passage across the membrane, a proposition supported by computational analysis of the SecYEG-A structure bound to various model pre-cursors. This deprotonation is presumably facilitated by SecA, with the energy required coming either from ∆pH – protons are more readily removed at the higher pH on the cytosolic side of the membrane – and/or the hydrolytic cycle of ATP, with nucleotide state-induced conformational changes affecting the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> of lysines in the channel. The fact that ∆pH does not appear to have a major effect on transport rate would suggest that the latter is more important, although we interpret these results with caution: the way ∆pH manifests in the assay (lower pH at the channel exit) is not necessarily exactly the same as in vivo (primarily elevated pH at the channel entrance), and our IMV preparations have a low total PMF compared to literature values for <italic>E. coli</italic> cells.</p><p>In addition to allowing easy passage of lysine through the SecY channel, which is strongly selective against cations, deprotonation could stimulate transport in two other ways. Firstly, it gives all translocating pre-proteins a net negative charge: as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, diffusion of negative charges (aspartic and glutamic acid) is likely to be promoted by ∆ψ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ismail et al., 2015</xref>), while only arginines (which are under-represented in secreted proteins, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) inhibit transport. Additionally, once deprotonated lysines emerge from SecY into the lower pH environment of the periplasm and absent the p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> perturbing properties of SecA, they will swiftly be reprotonated and thus unable to diffuse back. This 'proton ratchet' effect will prevent backsliding of transported lysines, and thereby contribute to the forward progression of translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of proposed PMF and ratcheting effects of pre-protein transport.</title><p>Closeup of step <italic>iii</italic> from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, where a negative amino acid (red, top left), arginine (blue, top right) or lysine (blue, bottom) is present at the entrance to SecY. ∆ψ is expected to promote the forward diffusion of negative charges, and inhibit their reverse movement. Movement of arginine is unfavourable in either direction, with export especially unfavourable when ∆ψ is present; hence transport of arginine is rate-limiting for the entire process. Lysine is deprotonated at the cytosolic face of SecY (by ∆pH and/or ATP hydrolysis by SecA), allowing its free diffusion across the membrane, and preventing backsliding once it is reprotonated on the other side.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-77586-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The computational results above were derived from peptides with no other charged residues nearby. Presumably, however, sequence context will have an effect in real life; for example a positive charge adjacent to a negative charge might be harder to deprotonate but easier to transport through the channel, as the two partially cancel each other out. Conversely, a long stretch of consecutive lysines might overwhelm the ability of the Sec machinery to strip and dissipate protons. Poly-lysine is not generally a feature of secreted proteins, but it has previously been used as evidence that positively charged residues are hard to transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nouwen et al., 2009</xref>); possibly this strong effect is conferred by the presence of multiple consecutive lysines, as opposed to ones spread evenly through the sequence. The importance of detailed sequence context, along with the compromised PMF in purified IMVs, might also explain the apparently contradictory results we obtain for PMF stimulation of charged pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants.</p><p>While arginine has by far the most striking effect of any amino acid, other substitutions also impact the rate of transport. Large amino acids are transported more slowly than smaller ones, most likely because there is more resistance to them diffusing though SecY. Knocking out stretches of α-helix also slows transport, consistent with the Sec system acting on these specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2019</xref>). The effect of hydrophobicity, however, is less clear cut: while more hydrophobic sequences are generally transported more slowly, the correlation is not absolute, and knocking out hydrophobic patches has little if any effect on transport. Furthermore, the assay does not allow us to distinguish between general mechanistic effects – for example hydrophobic sequences passing through the channel more slowly – and sequence-specific effects, such as specific hydrogen bonds inhibiting passage of a single part of the pre-protein. Nor are we able to measure the intrinsic structure of the pre-protein before it is transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Best, 2020</xref>), although this is likely to be affected by sequence and in turn affect the rate of diffusion through the channel. Resolving these issues will most likely require studying transport of very short protein sequences at the single molecule level.</p><p>In addition to the direct mechanistic insights that can be discerned from the above results, they also have more general implications for the nature of protein secretion. It has previously been shown that a lower propensity for folding and the presence of hydrophobic patches are hallmarks of bacterial secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chatzi et al., 2017</xref>); to this we can now add a reduction in the number of arginines. Intriguingly, it also seems that any alterations to the charged residues in Spy – either adding or removing positive or negative charges – reduces the magnitude of PMF stimulation. This perhaps indicates that the sequence of Spy is already well optimised for secretion in terms of charge distribution. These observations all imply that ’secretability' is an important evolutionary constraint on proteins that localise outside the cytosol, particularly very abundant proteins such as Spy (which can account for ~25% of periplasmic upon induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quan et al., 2011</xref>). This will have important ramifications for the rational design of secretion-competent proteins for biotechnology or synthetic biology applications. Our results further suggest that replacing arginines with lysines will be a simple but effective way to achieve higher secretability.</p><p>Above all, the identification of steps in the translocation process through SecYEG is important because their properties enable us to distinguish between diffusional (described above) and power-stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catipovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Catipovic and Rapoport, 2020</xref>) mechanisms of translocation. The steps of the translocation reaction we identify could in theory correspond either to average ratchet lengths during diffusion, or to individual piston motions of a power-stroke. But in the former case the steps would vary with the properties of the translocating pre-protein, as indeed they do; steps in a power stroke, meanwhile, would depend on the geometry of SecA and the conformational changes associated with ATP turnover, and thus be invariant. Ratcheting has the further benefit of allowing other factors to contribute to pre-protein transport, including the PMF; pre-protein folding on the outside over the inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2019</xref>); and the action of auxiliary Sec components such as SecDF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tsukazaki, 2018</xref>) and periplasmic chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fürst et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knyazev et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The observation that SecA is required to allow positively charged lysines through the SecY channel might plausibly also have implications for topogenesis of membrane proteins.

Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay (Thermo) using bovine serum albumin as a standard.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of pre-protein sequences used.</title><p>Differences from the native pSpy sequence are highlighted in bold. pSpy<sub>LXX</sub> is identical to pSpy<sub>XLX</sub>, but with Pep86 and its linker (yellow and pink) moved in front of the variable pSpy (black)</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-77586-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Berkeley Madonna models.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-77586-supp2-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Tables of best fits and p-values.</title><p><bold>a: p-values for the difference in lag between each variant and wt.</bold></p><p>Calculated using a two-tailed t-test (in Microsoft Excel).</p><p><bold>b: List of best fit parameters for all pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants</bold></p><p>Values and confidence intervals were estimated by fitting each experimental replicate individually (n = 12 for wt, n = 3 for all the others), and using the mean and SEM of the best fits values.</p><p><bold>c: p-values for bioinformatic analysis of arginine/lysine ratios.</bold></p><p>Analyses performed using a two-tailed t-test in Microsoft Excel.</p><p><bold>d: Comparison of the proton-motive force (PMF) generated by whole cells and inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs</bold>).</p><p>Error bars indicate the standard deviation from three biological replicates (for cells) or three technical replicates (for IMVs).</p><p>Raw data underlying the figures.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lejla Zubcevic as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: James N Blaza (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that the manuscript would benefit from having a more detailed explanation of the kinetic model in the manuscript. In particular, the kinetic model and fitting procedures are not clearly described. There are many terms that are not defined in the main text (such as the meanings of &quot;the number of steps&quot; [is it the number of kinetic steps described in Figure 1? or the number of amino acids that are transported upon ATP hydrolysis?], k_fail [the fail of which step in Figure 1?]), RMSD, &quot;amplitude of variants&quot; [is it the amplitude of the signal?], &quot;best fit&quot; [what is the criteria for the best fit?]).</p><p>In addition, the standard deviation (or error) of each fitted parameter is not reported. Also, the statistical significance of differences between different data (where it is relevant) is not reported either.</p><p>2) In p.5, &quot;Therefore, to avoid detrimental changes of pre-protein behavior, we created constructs consisting of the pSpy SS followed by three tandem mature (m) Spys, with a pep86 sequence after the second ….&quot;</p><p>This statement is not supported by experimental data. That is, how did this construct design help avoid detrimental changes of preprotein behavior?</p><p>3) The deceleration of protein transport by Arg, the deprotonation of Lys during transport, and the effects of helicity (i.e., the local protein structure) on the transport are convincing. However, it was not considered how the sequence modification influences the global conformation of preproteins. For example, incorporating ~8 bulky hydrophobic residues such as Leu or Trp in place of moderately hydrophobic residues may induce the collapse of the Spy polypeptide chain at least the variable region and decelerate the transport. Please comment.</p><p>4) Related to 1b), authors employ the Kyte-Doolitle hydrophobicity scale (1982) to modify the hydrophobicity of preprotein. Several experimentally determined hydrophobicity scales have been developed that might be more sensible to use (e.g., Wimley-White, Hessa-von Heijne, Moon-Fleming, etc.). Although those scales show a reasonably good correlation with one another, the hydrophobicity of several residues are noticeably different in different scales. Please comment.</p><p>5) &gt; p.6 lines 10-12: &quot;We find that transport is slower (longer lag than native pSpyXLX above that of pSpyLXX, 0.65 min) when more bulky, hydrophobic and positively charged residues are present, while negative charges have limited effect.&quot;</p><p>versus</p><p>&gt;p.6 lines 7-9: &quot;Removing hydrophobic patches, meanwhile, has marginal if any effect on transport rate (Figure 2j), reaffirming that residue size is a bigger factor than hydrophobicity.&quot;</p><p>I strongly agree with the authors on the effects of Arg and Lys, but am not fully convinced with the effects of other features.

In particular, the kinetic model and fitting procedures are not clearly described. There are many terms that are not defined in the main text (such as the meanings of &quot;the number of steps&quot; [is it the number of kinetic steps described in Figure 1? or the number of amino acids that are transported upon ATP hydrolysis?], k_fail [the fail of which step in Figure 1?]), RMSD, &quot;amplitude of variants&quot; [is it the amplitude of the signal?], &quot;best fit&quot; [what is the criteria for the best fit?]).</p></disp-quote><p>We have substantially expanded the description of the model in the main text, and defined all the terms in the model. Because of this all the absolute values have changed slightly, but all the conclusions remain the same.</p><p>These were originally omitted because they are defined extensively in a previous paper – but the reviewers are of course correct that this paper should be comprehensible on its own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the standard deviation (or error) of each fitted parameter is not reported. Also, the statistical significance of differences between different data (where it is relevant) is not reported either.</p></disp-quote><p>We have refitted each NanoLuc data set individually, and used the averages of the individual fits (± SEM) to provide error estimates.</p><p>We have also carried out two-tailed t-tests to estimate statistical significance (where relevant). In general, pretty much every difference is very statistically significant as the NanoLuc traces are extremely precise and reproducible. So to avoid cluttering the manuscript we have mostly included these in supplementary tables (Supplementary tables 2-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In p.5, &quot;Therefore, to avoid detrimental changes of pre-protein behavior, we created constructs consisting of the pSpy SS followed by three tandem mature (m) Spys, with a pep86 sequence after the second ….&quot;</p><p>This statement is not supported by experimental data. That is, how did this construct design help avoid detrimental changes of preprotein behavior?</p></disp-quote><p>We have reworded this section to make it clearer. Essentially, we used the pSpy<sub>XLX</sub> variants for two reasons: (1) to ensure that the initiation and end points of transport are identical for every variant, and (2) to avoid issues of solubility (and potentially affinity for SecA).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The deceleration of protein transport by Arg, the deprotonation of Lys during transport, and the effects of helicity (i.e., the local protein structure) on the transport are convincing. However, it was not considered how the sequence modification influences the global conformation of preproteins. For example, incorporating ~8 bulky hydrophobic residues such as Leu or Trp in place of moderately hydrophobic residues may induce the collapse of the Spy polypeptide chain at least the variable region and decelerate the transport. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Collapse of hydrophobic regions does seem likely; this is one reason we spread the altered residues as evenly as possible through the sequence. Although if this affects our model pre-proteins, presumably the same effect should also affect real proteins, and so be part of the mechanism.</p><p>Fully distinguishing global and local effects is probably not possible using this assay setup. We have added some additional discussion of this point to the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to 1b), authors employ the Kyte-Doolitle hydrophobicity scale (1982) to modify the hydrophobicity of preprotein. Several experimentally determined hydrophobicity scales have been developed that might be more sensible to use (e.g., Wimley-White, Hessa-von Heijne, Moon-Fleming, etc.). Although those scales show a reasonably good correlation with one another, the hydrophobicity of several residues are noticeably different in different scales. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose Kyte-Doolittle simply because it seemed to be the most commonly used hydrophobicity scale, and had not appreciated that the various scales were significantly different.</p><p>Plotting the Wimley-White, Hessa-von Heijne and Moon-Fleming scales against Kyte-Doolittle (see new panels b-d in Figure 2 —figure supplement 2), it seems the biggest differences between scales are for the aromatic residues. In most cases, the substitutions we chose have the desired effect in all four scales. The only exception is the F→W mutant, in that according to the Wimley-White scale (but not the others) tryptophan it is more hydrophobic than phenylalanine, not less.</p><p>We have updated the text accordingly, and to make it clear that we are not fully able to distinguish hydrophobic from bulky residues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &gt; p.6 lines 10-12: &quot;We find that transport is slower (longer lag than native pSpyXLX above that of pSpyLXX, 0.65 min) when more bulky, hydrophobic and positively charged residues are present, while negative charges have limited effect.&quot;</p><p>versus</p><p>&gt;p.6 lines 7-9: &quot;Removing hydrophobic patches, meanwhile, has marginal if any effect on transport rate (Figure 2j), reaffirming that residue size is a bigger factor than hydrophobicity.&quot;</p><p>I strongly agree with the authors on the effects of Arg and Lys, but am not fully convinced with the effects of other features.
