diagnostic and therapeutic targets. However, selective sampling of surface proteins for proteomics requires large samples (&gt;10e6 cells) and long labeling times. These limitations preclude analysis of material-limited biological samples or the capture of rapid surface proteomic changes. Here, we present two labeling approaches to tether exogenous peroxidases (APEX2 and HRP) directly to cells, enabling rapid, small-scale cell surface biotinylation without the need to engineer cells. We used a novel lipidated DNA-tethered APEX2 (DNA-APEX2), which upon addition to cells promoted cell agnostic membrane-proximal labeling. Alternatively, we employed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fused to the glycan-binding domain of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP). This approach yielded a rapid and commercially inexpensive means to directly label cells containing common N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid glycans on their surface. The facile WGA-HRP method permitted high surface coverage of cellular samples and enabled the first comparative surface proteome characterization of cells and cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs), leading to the robust quantification of 953 cell and EV surface annotated proteins. We identified a newly recognized subset of EV-enriched markers, as well as proteins that are uniquely upregulated on Myc oncogene-transformed prostate cancer EVs. These two cell-tethered enzyme surface biotinylation approaches are highly advantageous for rapidly and directly labeling surface proteins across a range of material-limited sample types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>extracellular vesicle</kwd><kwd>HRP</kwd><kwd>APEX2</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>surfaceomics</kwd><kwd>cell surface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F31CA247527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kirkemo</surname><given-names>Lisa L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1650113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elledge</surname><given-names>Susanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01CA244452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jiuling</given-names></name><name><surname>Blelloch</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122451</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA248323</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Biohub Investigator Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Harry and Dianna Hind Professorship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wells</surname><given-names>James A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enzyme tethering of promiscuous biotinylators to the cell surface allows for more rapid and efficient comparative surface proteomic analysis of cells and extracellular vesicles.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell surface proteome, termed the surfaceome, serves as the main communication hub between a cell and the extracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>). As such, this cellular compartment often reveals the first signs of cellular distress and disease, and is of substantial interest to the medical community for diagnostic and therapeutic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leth-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>). The precise and comprehensive profiling of the surfaceome, termed surfaceomics, provides critical insights for our overall understanding of human health and can inform drug development efforts. Several strategies have emerged for either selective or comprehensive surfaceomics, including biocytin hydrazide labeling of surface glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>), chemical biotinylation of lysines via NHS-ester labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang, 2012</xref>), and promiscuous biotinylator fusion proteins (APEX2, BioID, and SPPLAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rees et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sears et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Wollscheid et al., 2009</xref>). Membrane protein enrichment is a necessary step in surfaceomics, due to the inherent low abundance of membrane proteins compared to cytosolic proteins, and their identification can be overwhelmed by cytosolic contaminants. While each of these strategies robustly label surface proteins, they: (1) require large sample inputs (biocytin hydrazide), (2) require production of genetically engineered cells (APEX2 and BioID), (3) label only partner proteins by binding targeting antibodies fused to APEX2 or horseradish peroxidase (HRP; SPPLAT), (4) require extensive sample manipulation (biocytin hydrazide), or (5) exhibit increased nonspecific labeling (NHS-ester, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bausch-Fluck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elschenbroich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Griffin and Schnitzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuhlmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). Moreover, many of these methods are not able to capture short and transient changes that occur at the cell surface, such as binding, adhesion, assembly, and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kalxdorf et al., 2017</xref>). These current methods complicate the direct characterization of small clinical samples such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) in patient serum. As biological research increasingly depends on animal models and patient-derived samples, the requirement for simple and robust methods amenable to direct labeling of material-limited samples for proteomic analysis will become paramount.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Current methods available for cell surface biotinylation.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Method</th><th align="left" valign="top">Protocol length (time)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Selectivity</th><th align="left" valign="top">Sample size requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Biocytin hydrazide</td><td align="left" valign="top">+++</td><td align="left" valign="top">+++</td><td align="left" valign="top">+++</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin</td><td align="left" valign="top">++</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">APEX2/HRP</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td><td align="left" valign="top">+</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Exosomes and other small EVs are produced by both healthy and diseased cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>). In cancer, these small EVs contribute to tumor growth and metastasis, modulate the immune response, and mediate treatment resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Nedawi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Edgar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, these EVs are a focus of intense clinical investigation. Recent studies suggest that small EVs incorporate proteins and RNA from the parent tumor from which they originate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Soung et al., 2017</xref>), and certain proteins may be preferentially shuttled into EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poggio et al., 2019</xref>). There is also strong evidence that cancer-derived EVs are unique from the EVs derived from healthy surrounding tissues, and therefore represent a promising target for noninvasive, early detection diagnostics, or EV-focused therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Skog et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). However, strategies for the unbiased profiling of small EV membrane proteomes remain limited. Isolation of high-quality, enriched small EV populations is challenging, requiring numerous centrifugation steps and a final sucrose gradient isolation, precluding the use of current labeling methods for membrane proteome characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poggio et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shurtleff et al., 2018</xref>). Strategies to characterize the surface proteome of small EVs would propel biomarker discovery and enable the differential characterization of small EVs from that of the parent cell. These important studies could help illuminate mechanisms underlying preferential protein shuttling to different extracellular vesicle populations.</p><p>Here, we functionalize the promiscuous biotinylators, APEX2 and HRP, as noncellularly encoded exogenous membrane tethering reagents for small-scale surfaceomics, requiring &lt;5e5 cells. This method is 10- to 100-fold more rapid than other existing protocols and requires fewer wash steps with less sample loss. Likewise, due to its selectivity toward tyrosines, it is not hindered by variability in individual protein glycosylation status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leth-Larsen et al., 2010</xref>) or by impeding complete tryptic peptide cleavage through modification of lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hacker et al., 2017</xref>), like biocytin hydrazide or NHS-biotin methods, respectively. Using this robust new strategy, we performed surfaceomics on cells and corresponding small EVs from a cellular model of prostate cancer using the prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1 with or without oncogenic Myc induction. While certain proteins show increased expression in both parental cell and EV surfaces, a subset of proteins was found to be either pan-EV markers (ITIH4, MFGE8, TF, DSG1, TSPAN14, AZGP1, and IGSF8) or selectively enriched with Myc overexpression in cancer-derived EVs (ANPEP, SLC38A5, FN1, SFRP1, CDH13, THBS1, and CD44). These differentially regulated proteins pose interesting questions related to preferential protein shuttling, and the proteins upregulated in both cellular and EV contexts reveal candidates for early stage urine or serum-based detection without invasive surgical intervention. We believe these simple, rapid, and direct surfaceomic labeling tools may be broadly applied to small-scale surfaceomics on primary tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of promiscuous cell-surface tethered peroxidases for exogenous addition to cells</title><p>Both APEX2 and HRP are broadly used promiscuous proximity biotinylators that label nearby tyrosine residues in proteins through a radical intermediate mechanism using a biotin-tyramide reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martell et al., 2016</xref>).

The kinetics of coupling was monitored using LC-MS and the conjugate was purified by nickel column chromatography, yielding a single conjugated product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) that retained full enzymatic function relative to unlabeled APEX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

This result was recapitulated using flow cytometry, indicating that this approach results in surface tethering of APEX2, an important step toward the specific labeling of the cell surfaceome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>To avoid the need for bioconjugation, we also tested a commercially available reagent where the promiscuous biotinylator HRP is conjugated to the lectin wheat germ-agglutinin (WGA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right panel). WGA-HRP is used regularly in the glycobiology and neuroscience fields to label cell membranes for immuno-histochemistry and live-cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mathiasen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang and Miller, 2016</xref>). This is an inexpensive and widely available tool that only requires the presence of surface protein N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid glycans to localize HRP to the membrane. The successful and rapid colocalization of WGA-HRP to the plasma membrane (PM) compared to HRP alone was verified using immunocytochemistry, indicating this approach is a potential alternative for cell surface labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further testing showed that adding WGA-HRP to cells in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and biotin-tyramide led to robust surface labeling even with no preincubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell-tethered biotinylators more effectively label the surfaceome than nontethered biotinylators and are comparable to biocytin hydrazide</title><p>Next, we set out to optimize labeling conditions for small-scale sample characterization. As APEX2 is kinetically slower than HRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam et al., 2015</xref>), we used APEX2 to establish a suitable concentration range of enzyme for cell surface labeling. We found that 0.5 µM APEX2 produced maximal labeling of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and maintained equivalent labeling across a range of cell numbers (2.5e5–1e6 cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we compared the efficiency of DNA-APEX2, WGA-HRP, and their nontethered counterparts to biotinylate a small sample of 5e5 Expi293 cells. We found a 5- to 10-fold increase in biotin labeling for both tethered DNA-APEX2 and WGA-HRP relative to nontethered controls as assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, tethered DNA-APEX2 and WGA-HRP systems exhibited similar biotinylation efficiency, suggesting either system is suitable for small-scale surfaceomics. Having both systems is useful, as some cells may not widely express glycoproteins recognized by commercially available lectin-HRP conjugates—such as some prokaryotic species—and therefore could require the glycan-agnostic DNA-tethered APEX2 construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schäffer and Messner, 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Membrane-localized peroxidases increases membrane proteome biotinylation compared to nontethered counterparts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biotinylation of Expi293 cells treated with free enzyme (APEX2 or HRP) or cell-tethered enzyme (DNA-APEX2 or WGA-HRP) shown by flow cytometry.

As an initial efficacy comparison, cell surface labeling with DNA-labeled APEX2 or WGA-HRP was compared using 5e5 cells. In order to eliminate the possibility of suspension cell-specific results, we used a popular cell line model of pancreatic cancer, KP-4. We observed that the WGA-HRP identified slightly more PM annotated proteins in the Uniprot Gene Ontology Cellular Component Plasma Membrane (GOCC-PM) database (&gt;2 unique peptides, found in all replicates) relative to DNA-APEX2, totaling 501 and 467, respectively. Notably, the number of IDs for both cell-tethered enzymes was higher than their untethered counterparts, with HRP identifying 389 cell surface proteins and APEX2 identifying 247 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, in the upset plot shown, the group with the highest intersection includes all four enzyme contexts, showcasing the reproducibility of labeling through a similar free-radical-based mechanism. The cell-tethered biotinylators also showed heightened surface enrichment compared to their untethered counterparts, as illustrated by the higher overall intensities for proteins annotated to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). As equal amounts of total protein are injected on the LC-MS/MS instrument, the higher intensities for PM proteins suggest that localizing the enzyme to the membrane increases labeling of the membrane compartment, which we have previously observed with other enzymatic reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weeks et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>As the mode of tethering WGA-HRP involves GlcNAc and sialic acid glycans, we wanted to determine whether there was a bias toward Uniprot annotated ‘Glycoprotein’ versus ‘Non-Glycoprotein’ surface proteins identified across the WGA-HRP, APEX2-DNA, APEX2, and HRP labeling methods. We looked specifically at surface annotated proteins found in the SURFY database, which is the most stringent surface protein database and requires that proteins have a predicted transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bausch-Fluck et al., 2018</xref>). We performed this analysis by measuring the average MS1 intensity across the top three peptides (label-free quantification [LFQ] area) for SURFY glycoproteins and non-glycoproteins for each sample and dividing that by the total LFQ area found across all GOCC-PM annotated proteins detected in each sample. We found similar normalized areas of non-glycosylated surface proteins across all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). If a bias existed toward glycosylated proteins in the WGA-HRP compared to the glycan agnostic APEX2-DNA sample, then we would have seen a larger percentage of non-glycosylated surface proteins identified in APEX2-DNA over WGA-HRP. Due to the large labeling radius of the HRP enzyme, we find it unsurprising that the WGA-HRP method is able to capture non-glycosylated proteins on the surface to the same degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rees et al., 2015</xref>). There is a slight increase in the area percentage of glycoproteins detected in the WGA-HRP compared to the APEX2-DNA sample, but this is likely due to the fact that a greater number of surface proteins in general are detected with WGA-HRP. As HRP is known to have faster kinetics compared to APEX2, it was anticipated that WGA-HRP would outperform DNA-APEX2 in cell surface protein identifications. The heightened labeling of WGA-HRP was consistent with every cell line tested, including another pancreatic cancer model, PaTu8902, which resulted in more proteins identified in the WGA-HRP sample over DNA-APEX2 for both 1 and 2 min time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the improved labeling by WGA-HRP was due to the binding of sugar units on the cell surface, we performed a sugar-blocking experiment with WGA-HRP using N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) that would block the conjugate from binding to the cell. By preincubating WGA-HRP with excess GlcNAc, the ability of WGA-HRP to label the cell surface was markedly lower than WGA-HRP without GlcNAc as observed by microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A similar effect was also seen by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, we also tested an on-plate protocol for simpler cell surface labeling of adherent KP-4 cells. We showed that cell surface labeling in this manner was comparable to labeling when the cells were in suspension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>).</p><p>As WGA-HRP consistently outperformed DNA-APEX2 by proteomics and represents a more facile method amenable to broad application in the field, we chose to compare the proteomic labeling results of WGA-HRP to other standard cell surface labeling methods (sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin and biocytin hydrazide) on a prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1 with and without oncogenic c-Myc overexpression. Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin reacts with primary amines to form amide conjugates, but has notoriously high background contamination with intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weekes et al., 2010</xref>). Biocytin hydrazide labeling is a two-step process that first involves oxidizing vicinal diols on glycoproteins at the cell surface, then reacting the aldehyde byproducts with biocytin hydrazide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elschenbroich et al., 2010</xref>). Both WGA-HRP and biocytin hydrazide had similar levels of cell surface enrichment on the peptide and protein level when cross-referenced with the SURFY curated database for extracellular surface proteins with a predicted transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin and whole-cell lysis returned the lowest percentage of cell surface enrichment, suggesting that a larger portion of the total sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin protein identifications were of intracellular origin, despite the use of the cell-impermeable format. These same enrichment levels were seen when the datasets were searched with the curated GOCC-PM database, as well as Uniprot’s entire human proteome database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Of the proteins quantified across all four conditions, biocytin hydrazide and WGA-HRP returned higher overall intensity values for SURFY-specified proteins than either sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin or whole-cell lysis. Importantly, although biocytin hydrazide shows slightly higher cell surface enrichment compared to WGA-HRP, we were unable to perform the comparative analysis at 500,000 cells—instead requiring 1.5 million—as the biocytin hydrazide protocol yielded too few cells for analysis. All three methods were highly reproducible across replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Compared to existing methods, WGA-HRP not only labels cells efficiently with much lower input material requirements, but is also able to enrich cell surface proteins to a similar extent in a fraction of the time.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>WGA-HRP identifies surface markers of Myc-driven prostate cancer in both cells and small EVs</title><p>Prostate cancer remains one of the most common epithelial cancers in the elderly male population, especially in Western nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Litwin and Tan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rawla, 2019</xref>).

Importantly, by using an isogenic system, we are able to delineate specific Myc-driven protein expression changes, which could be helpful in the identification of noninvasive, early detection diagnostics for cancer driven by early Myc induction. In addition to having marked overexpression of c-Myc in the RWPE-1 Myc cells compared to Control, they also grow with a more mesenchymal and elongated morphology compared to their Control cell counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), which would suggest large cell surface changes upon oncogenic Myc induction.

While sucrose gradient centrifugation generally yields a mixture of vesicle populations, we wanted to confirm that our preparation enriched for vesicles originating from multiple vesicular bodies (MVBs), consistent with an exosome-enriched sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mathieu et al., 2021</xref>). To do so, we prepared EVs from both Control and Myc cells and carried out LFQ mass spectrometry on the whole EV lysates. Following normalization for cell number, we found the Myc cells produced nearly 40% more EVs than the corresponding control cells, which is consistent with previous work that has shown Myc overexpression yields higher quantities of EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kilinc et al., 2021</xref>). After averaging the intensities between Control and Myc derived EVs, many of the highest intensity proteins (CD9, SDCB1, CD81, LAMP1, LAMP2, ALIX, and CD63) are consistent with MVB-derived vesicle biogenesis, supporting that the sample was likely enriched in EVs rather than other sedimentable particles that can co-isolate during centrifugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Due to the complex process and extensive washing involved in small EV isolation, many standard labeling methods are not amenable for EV surface labeling. Using WGA-HRP, we are able to biotinylate the small EVs before the sucrose gradient purification and isolation steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This delineated an important subset of proteins that are differentially expressed under Myc induction, which could serve as interesting targets for early detection in patient urine or serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). All significantly upregulated SURFY and secreted proteins (&gt;1.5-fold) are listed with corresponding fold-change quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>).

A subset of these targets displays similar phenotypic changes to the parent cell, suggesting that they could be biomarker candidates for noninvasive indicators of disease progression. While certain proteins are shuttled to vesicle compartments largely based on the extent of expression in the parent cell (Control: IFITM3, BST2, and HLA-B, Myc: ANPEP, SLC38A5, and FN1), remarkably some proteins are singled out for small EV packaging, indicating a pronounced differential shuttling mechanism of the proteome between cells and EVs. This pattern was recapitulated in both the RWPE-1 Control cells and corresponding EVs, as well as the Myc cells and EVs, where the majority of markers were unique to either cellular or EV origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These protein targets are of extreme interest for not only biomarker discovery, but also understanding the role of small EVs in secondary disease roles, such as interfering with immune function or priming the metastatic niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>WGA-HRP identifies a number of enriched markers on Myc-driven prostate cancer EVs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for small EV isolation from cultured cells.

Prior proteomic EV analysis has involved whole EV preparations, which lacks a surface protein enrichment step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bandu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bilen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hosseini-Beheshti et al., 2012</xref>). Not only is whole EV lysate analysis less advantageous for the specific identification of cell surface proteins on EVs, but it makes it impossible to compare cellular and EV samples due to the inherent surface area-to-volume differences between cells and the vesicles they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Doyle and Wang, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santucci et al., 2019</xref>). Our WGA-HRP method allows us to compare surface proteins between small EV populations, as well as between small EV and cell samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By principle component analysis (PCA), each sample separates by oncogenic status and origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Indeed, when performing functional annotation for each gene cluster defined by the PCA, ‘extracellular exosome’ and ‘extracellular vesicle’ are the highest ranking annotation features differentiating the EVs from their parent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Through this comparison, we were able to delineate a host of proteins that were upregulated in EVs over their parent cells and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Notably, secreted proteins were more highly represented in the EV surface proteome compared to cells. A subset of proteins was highly upregulated in the small EVs compared to parent cell, including ITIH4, MFGE8, TF, DSG1, TSPAN14, AZGP1, and IGSF8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), and a subset of the findings was validated by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). All significantly (p&lt;0.05) upregulated SURFY and secreted proteins (&gt;2-fold) are listed with corresponding fold-change quantification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>). The samples showed good overlap between replicates across all four datasets, with cellular and EV samples clustering by origin and oncogenic status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the first experiment to wholistically characterize the surface proteome of both small EVs and parental cells. These data strongly suggest that protein triage into EVs is a controlled process, enabling only a subset of the cell surface proteome to be shuttled to this important compartment. Our data shows that there are a variety of pan-prostate-EV markers, notably lactadherin (MFGE8), serotransferrin (TF), inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITIH4), immunoglobulin superfamily 8 (IGSF8), desmoglein-1 (DSG1), tetraspanin-14 (TSPAN14), and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which do not seem to be Myc-specific. Some of the pan-prostate EV targets in our data have previously been linked to cancer-specific contexts, and we show here that they are also found on Control EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shimagaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tutanov et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Philley et al., 2017</xref>).

New, improved methodologies amenable to small-scale and rapid surface proteome characterization are essential for continued development in the areas of therapeutics, diagnostics, and basic research. We sought to develop a simple, rapid surface protein labeling approach that was compatible with small sample sizes, while remaining specific to the cell surface. We took advantage of fast peroxidase enzymes and either complementary lipidated DNA technology (DNA-APEX2) or the glycan-binding moiety wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP) and demonstrated that tethering was much more effective than soluble addition, with increases in protein identification of between 30% and 90%. Additionally, we compared WGA-HRP to the existing methods, sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin and biocytin hydrazide. While these alternative methods are robust, they are unable to capture time-sensitive changes and are either plagued by low selectivity/specificity (NHS-Biotin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weekes et al., 2010</xref>) or the requirement for large sample inputs (biocytin hydrazide).</p><p>There are many advantages of our new methods over the current cell surface labeling technologies. Compared to both sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin and biocytin hydrazide, WGA-HRP experiments require 2 min instead of 30 or 120 min, respectively. It is also able to enrich cell surface proteins much more efficiently than sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin labeling. Furthermore, NHS peptide isolation and preparation is complicated due to the reactivity of NHS chemistry toward free-amines, which blocks tryptic and LysC cleavages typically used in proteomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandler and Costello, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hacker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The hydrazide method is highly effective for enriching cell surface proteins, but it is challenging for small sample sizes, due to the two-step labeling process and cell loss from the oxidation step and extensive washing. Additionally, neither NHS-biotin nor biocytin hydrazide are able to capture short time points to encompass dynamic changes at the cell surface. Due to the fast kinetics of peroxidase enzymes (1–2 min), our approaches could enable kinetic experiments to capture rapid post-translational trafficking of surfaces proteins, such as response to insulin, certain drug treatments, T-cell activation and synapse formation, and GPCR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Valitutti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gupte et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Another disadvantage of the hydrazide method is that it can only enrich for proteins that are glycosylated at the cell surface, and it is estimated that 10%–15% of cell surface proteins are not glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apweiler et al., 1999</xref>). Glycosylation patterns also readily change during tumorigenesis, which can alter the quantification of glycan-based labeling methods, such as biocytin hydrazide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reily et al., 2019</xref>). While the WGA-HRP method requires glycosylated proteins to be present to bind, it is still able to label non-glycosylated proteins nearby due to its large labeling radius. It is a possibility that certain cells may have low or uneven levels of glycosylation on their surfaces. In these cases, the DNA-APEX2 method can be utilized to obtain effective labeling. However, both these peroxidase-based methods require the presence of tyrosine residues (natural abundance 3.3%) to react with the biotin-tyramide radical, which is not equally abundant in all proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dyer, 1971</xref>).</p><p>With the WGA-HRP method, we were able to compare the surfaceome of small EVs to parental cells for Myc-induced prostate cancer cells and identified proteins that were upregulated in Myc-induced cells and EVs, as well as proteins that were differentially shuttled between EVs and parental cells. We found a number of Myc-specific markers in our study, which were enriched in both Myc EV and Myc Cell samples. These include ANPEP, SLC38A5, FN1, CDH13, VIM, and CA12. ANPEP is a membrane-bound ectopeptidase that degrades N-termini with neutral amino acids and is found 140-fold upregulated in the Myc-induced cell compared to the Control cell and 49-fold upregulated in the Myc-induced EV compared to Control EV. This peptidase has been associated with angiogenesis and cancer growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guzman-Rojas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sorensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wickström et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies have shown ANPEP is systematically upregulated on isogenic cell lines expressing proliferative oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Leung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinko et al., 2018</xref> or in tubular sclerosis bladder cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wei et al., 2020</xref>, suggesting it is commonly upregulated in cancers. The second most differentially expressed protein between the Myc and Control samples was SLC38A5 (23- and 73-fold upregulated in cells and EVs, respectively). SLC38A5 is a glutamine co-transporter and has previously been shown to be a downstream target of c-Myc in glutamine-addicted cancers. Moreover, given that SLC38A5-based glutamine transport leads to proton flux and intracellular alkanization, overexpression of SLC38A5 has also been hypothesized to be a strategy for pH regulation in cancer cells that regularly experience intracellular acidification due to high glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhutia and Ganapathy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wise et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, Fibronectin-1 (FN1) was also found to be upregulated in Myc samples over Control samples (5- and 63-fold upregulated in cells and EVs, respectively) and has been shown to drive all stages of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Hielscher, 2017</xref>). Importantly, FN1 provides an extracellular scaffold by which other matrix proteins can be deposited. Through these interactions with matrix proteins and cell-associated integrins, FN1 regulates cellular fate decisions, proliferation, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Efthymiou et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>While some proteins were present in both the EV and cellular samples, others were only found enriched in Myc EVs. THBS1, also known as thrombospondin-1, was over ten-fold upregulated in Myc EVs over Control EVs. Interestingly, this relationship was not found in the parent cells, which suggests that THBS1 is differentially shuttled into oncogenic EVs. The role of this protein has newly been associated with the growth and metastasis of glioblastoma and a potential serum prognostic factor in myeloid leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daubon et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, using a model of THBS1 overexpressing breast cancer, recent work has shown that exosomes laden with THBS1 promote cancer cell migration via disruption of the endothelial barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another such target is CD44, which was over eight-fold upregulated in the Myc EVs over Control EVs. CD44 has long been known to drive cancer progression and aberrant cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, CD44 has also been found to be preferentially loaded into cancer-derived exosomes and has been implicated in driving chemoresistance in a model of doxorubicin-treated breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, it has been shown that exosome-mediated transfer of CD44 from cells with high metastatic potential promoted migratory behavior in neighboring cells with low metastatic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shen et al., 2021</xref>). These targets delineate an important subset of proteins that are triaged into EVs and could play long-range roles in promoting tumorigenesis and downstream metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoshino et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peinado et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As research shifts into analyzing native biological samples from EVs to xenograft models or patient biopsies, it will become increasingly important to develop sensitive, effective methods to label these small samples sizes. It is our hope that these tools will provide much needed avenues by which to pursue pressing biological questions in the areas of diagnostic and therapeutic development, as well as basic research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Briefly, APEX2 expression plasmid was transfected into competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and heat shocked for 45 s before being placed on ice. Cells were plated on LB/Carb plates and grown overnight at 37°C. A single colony was isolated and grown in a mixture of 30 ml of 2XYT+Carb overnight at 37°C while shaking. The overnight culture was combined with 3 L of 2XYT with Carb and placed in a 37°C shaking incubator. At an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.6, 100 µg/ml of IPTG was added and the temperature of the incubator was lowered to 30°C.

After the addition of 2 µg of total reconstituted Trypsin/LysC, the sample was incubated for 2 hr at RT. To activate the trypsin, mixture was diluted with 200 µl of 50 mM Tris pH 8.5 to a final Urea concentration of below 1.5 M. The mixture was covered and allowed to incubate overnight at RT. The mixture was isolated from the beads by centrifugation in a collection column (Pierce; 69725) before being acidified with 10% TFA until pH of 2.0 was reached. During this time, a Pierce C18 spin column (Pierce, 89873) was prepared as per manufacturing instructions. Briefly, C18 resin was washed twice with 200 µl of 50% LC-MS/MS grade ACN. The column was equilibrated with two 200 µl washes of 5% ACN/0.5% TFA. The pre-acidified sample was loaded into the C18 column and allowed to fully elute before washing two times with 200 µl washes of 5% ACN/0.5% TFA. One final wash of 200 µl 5% ACN/1% FA was done to remove any residual TFA from the elution. Samples were eluted in 70% ACN, dried, and dissolved in 0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. Peptides were quantified using Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric Peptide Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 23275).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>LC-MS/MS</title><p>Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Meier et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, approximately 200 ng of peptides were separate using a nanoElute UHPLC system (Bruker) with a pre-packed 25 cm × 75 µm Aurora Series UHPLC column+ CaptiveSpray insert (CSI) column (120 A pore size, IonOpticks, AUR2-25075C18A-CSI) and analyzed on a timsTOF Pro (Bruker) mass spectrometer. Peptides were separated using a linear gradient of 2%–34% solvent B (solvent A: 2% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid) over 100 min at 400 nl/min. Data-dependent acquisition was performed with parallel accumulation-serial fragmentation (PASEF) and trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) enabled with 10 PASEF scans per topN acquisition cycle. The TIMS analyzer was operated at a fixed duty cycle close to 100% using equal accumulation and ramp times of 100 ms each. Singly charged precursors were excluded by their position in the m/z–ion mobility plane, and precursors that reached a target value of 20,000 arbitrary units were dynamically excluded for 0.4 min. The quadrupole isolation width was set to 2 m/z for m/z &lt; 700 and to 3 m/z for m/z &gt; 700 and a mass scan range of 100–1700 m/z. TIMS elution voltages were calibrated linearly to obtain the reduced ion mobility coefficients (1/K0) using three Agilent ESI-L Tuning Mix ions (m/z 622, 922, and 1222).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><p>Briefly, for general database searching, peptides for each individual dataset were searched using PEAKS Online X version 1.5 against both the PM annotated human proteome (Swiss-prot GOCC database, August 3, 2017 release) and the entire Swiss-prot Human Proteome (Swiss-prot). We acknowledge the identification of a number of proteins not traditionally annotated to the PM, which were published in the final Swiss-prot GOCC-PM database used. Additionally, to not miss any key surface markers such as secreted proteins or anchored proteins without a transmembrane domain, we chose to initially avoid searching with a more stringent protein list, such as the curated SURFY database. However, following the analysis, we bolded proteins found in the SURFY database and italicized proteins known to be secreted (Uniprot). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin+ LysC with up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as the only fixed modification; acetylation (N-term) and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. The precursor mass error tolerance was set to 20 PPM and the fragment mass error tolerance was set to 0.05 Da. Data was filtered at 1% for both protein and peptide FDR and triaged by removing proteins with fewer than two unique peptides. All mass spectrometry database searching was based on two biological replicates. Biological replicates underwent washing, labeling, and downstream LC-MS/MS preparation separately.</p><p>For comparative LFQ of cellular and EV samples, datasets were searched using PEAKS Online X version 1.5 against the PM annotated human proteome (Swiss-prot GOCC database, August 3, 2017 release). Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin+ LysC with up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as the only fixed modification; acetylation (N-term) and methionine oxidation were set as variable modifications. The precursor mass error tolerance was set to 20 PPM and the fragment mass error tolerance was set to 0.05 Da. Data was filtered at 1% for both protein and peptide FDR and triaged by removing proteins with fewer than two unique peptides. Label-free quantification of protein was completed by taking the average intensity of the top three most intense peptides for each protein. Data was normalized by total area sum intensity for each sample. Using Perseus, all peak areas were log2(x) transformed and missing values were imputed separately for each sample using the standard settings (width of 0.3, downshift of 1.8). Significance was based on a standard unpaired Student t-test with unequal variances across all four replicates. Reported peak area values represent the averages of all four replicates—two biological and two technical replicates. For representation of the data in figures, a Z-score was computed and is defined as (LFQ Area−Mean LFQ Area)/Standard Deviation. Protein IDs that were not annotated to be secreted or expressed extracellularly were removed. Further, in the Cell versus EV graph, any proteins that showed a standard deviation (SD) greater than 1.5 between Control and Myc of each sample type (EV or Cell) were removed to avoid representation of oncogene-specific changes. Oncogene-specific changes are instead shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata4">Figure 4—source data 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata3">Figure 5—source data 3</xref>. EVs and cells from different biological replicates were cultured on different days. Desalting, quantification, and LC-MS/MS runs were performed together. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-Riverol et al., 2019</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD028523.</p><p>To compare replicates of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, a simple linear regression was performed on total area sum intensity normalized data.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy Schekman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David R Walt (Reviewer #2); Clotilde Thery (reviewer #3)</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that your use of the term exosome must be replaced by &quot;extracellular vesicles&quot; or EVs. The procedure you have used does not purify exosomes but instead a crude collection of sedimentable particles or possibly vesicles depending on whether you used sucrose flotation, which as discussed by reviewer #1 was not clear in your Methods section.</p><p>2) Reviewers #2 and 3 are quite critical of the proteomic analysis you have conducted. #2 argues that your proteome may well include proteins bound to the cell surface but secreted by other cells. #3 is more critical and argues that your analysis is not much of an improvement over other work that has already been published. The reviewer points out that some of the proteins you have identified are not actually exposed on the surface of the cell or of the EV. Further, #3 requests that you document the value of the technique for small-scale EV analysis, hence, to provide detailed technical info on the amount of EVs (number of source cells, and/or amount of proteins or particles) required to perform the surface proteome. If this amount does not really qualify as &quot;small-scale&quot;, the authors must revise their message (title).</p><p>3) Reviewer #1 is most critical of the description of and procedures you used to obtain the EV fraction. #1 suggests that you have missed an opportunity to distinguish the surface proteome of crude EVs in relation to purified exosomes.</p><p>We believe this work could be published in <italic>eLife</italic>, but not until you have completed a significant additional analysis of the proteome data to better justify your conclusions. Should these improvements, particularly those noted by reviewer #3, not be possible to complete, you may wish to consider the approach recommended by reviewer #1 where you resolve exosomes from the crude EV fraction to identify proteins that sort selectively into one vesicle sub-type.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The techniques and results of this manuscript appear novel and likely an improvement over other, non-adherent, labeling cell surface labeling methods. The results extend to extracellular vesicles and suggest that some proteins are highly enriched and may be diagnostic of a tumor cell origin. As such, the work represents a useful advance in the field and may merit publication as a technical report.</p><p>I was less convinced by the approach taken to characterize what the authors refer to as exosomes. According to their methods section, the particulate material they collect is the result of an simple enrichment by differential centrifugation. If so, the material is a crude mixture of various vesicles and sedimentable particles, not necessarily all of membrane origin. To add confusion to this method, the authors use a diagram in Figure 4A that refers to membranes that are floated on a sucrose gradient and reference the work of Poggio et al. (2019) who reported the use of a 20-60% sucrose gradient to isolate exosomes. However, in that report, the gradient is not shown and the relevant fraction is referred to as a sucrose light fraction containing the exosome marker CD63. It is not clear from the Poggio et al. work if they have resolved exosomes from other buoyant membrane vesicles such as those that are shed by budding from the cell surface. The current work is even less clear on that distinction. In work published since the Poggio et al. paper, two labs have described the use of an Optiprep buoyant density gradient to resolve membranes into two subtypes with a higher buoyant density fraction likely representing authentic exosomes (Jeppesen et al., 2019, Cell 177, 428-445 April 4, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.029 ;Temoche-Diaz et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.47544.001). As an example, in the current work, the authors describe MFGE8 as a &quot;pan exosomal marker&quot; whereas in Temoche-Diaz et al., this protein is seen to be nearly exclusively in a light buoyant density fraction likely corresponding to cell surface budded vesicles and not exosomes.</p><p>There are two remedies to the problem of use of the term exosomes in this manuscript. The simplest would be to tighten up the description of the isolation method and switch the term to extracellular vesicles. And even then, it will be important to know if the procedure is as described by Poggio et al. with the use of a buoyant density centrifugation step. However, if this work really did rely on crude differential centrifugation, then there should be some additional experimental effort to demonstrate that the biotinylated proteins are from a membrane as opposed to a sedimentable particle. The two publications cited above demonstrate that not all sediments along with extracellular vesicles is actually a membrane.</p><p>Another remedy to the misuse of the term exosomes would be to conduct a more refined fractionation and then to compare the surface proteomes of EV sub-fractions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Explain how one would deal with non-specifically bound proteins.</p><p>2. Explain how one would use the method for time-sensitive changes.</p><p>3. Verify that exosomes is correct terminology or replace with extracellular vesicles.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Of note, the authors should replace the term &quot;exosomes&quot; by the generic term &quot;extracellular vesicles&quot; throughout their article (title, abstract, text), since their method of EV isolation, even if it includes a density gradient step, co-isolates EVs originating from the plasma membrane and from endosomes which display the same density (see Witwer and Thery, J Extracell Vesicles 2019 # 31489144 for explanation on nomenclature). Consequently, the abbreviation &quot;EV&quot; for the control RWPE1 cells should be changed.</p><p>Experimental details are missing, for instance for the Western blots: what does &quot;equal amounts of samples&quot; mean? Quantified by protein content, or by number of cells or of EV-producing cells, or by biotinylation level? For the density gradient: are the EV pellets after biotinylation loaded at the bottom or on top of the gradient and in which fractions are the EVs collected? Are the other fractions also analysed at least for presence of biotinylated proteins by global Western blot? In general, what amount of EVs and from how many cells must be used to obtain interpretable surface proteomic results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Cell-surface tethered promiscuous biotinylators enable comparative small-scale surface proteomic analysis of human extracellular vesicles and cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Randy Schekman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David R Walt (Reviewer #2); Clotilde Thery (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>This report describes a new technique to detect the surface proteome of normal and myc-transformed cells in relation to extracellular vesicles from the same cells. The data obtained from this comparison may be useful in evaluating cell surface and extracellular vesicle marker proteins that may be of diagnostic value. The article could possibly be more useful with some small additional modifications to the text.</p><p>Reviewers #1 and 2 are fine with this version of the manuscript however #2 has some more recommended changes. Please consider these additional changes and return a final version of the manuscript which I will review without further consultation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors responded appropriately to my main concerns. They changed the nomenclature to refer to their vesicles as EVs rather than exosomes, and clarified the use of buoyant density centrifugation of EVs to ensure their preparation is bona fide membrane material rather than just sedimentable particles. They chose not to perform the additional separation needed to examine exosomes as well as total EVs.

The procedure you have used does not purify exosomes but instead a crude collection of sedimentable particles or possibly vesicles depending on whether you used sucrose flotation, which as discussed by reviewer #1 was not clear in your Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers for bringing this distinction to our attention. We have revised our manuscript and replaced all mentions of “exosome” with “small extracellular vesicles” (EVs). We have additionally updated our Methods section with the text below to clarify that we did perform a sucrose flotation that would remove sedimentable particles.</p><p>“RWPE-1 Control and Myc cells were plated at 7 million and 4 million cells per plate, respectively, across 16 x 15 cm<sup>2</sup> plates and allowed to grow in normal keratinocyte-SFM media with provided supplements. Small EVs were isolated as previously described. Briefly, two days prior to EV isolation, media was replaced with 15 milliliters BPE-free keratinocyte-SFM media. For vesicle enrichment, media was isolated after two days in BPE-free media and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 minutes at RT, followed by 2,000 x g for 20 minutes at 4°C. Large debris was cleared by a 12,000 x g spin for 40 minutes at 4°C. The pre-cleared supernatant was spun a final time at 100,000 x g at 4°C for 1 hr to pellet extracellular vesicles. Isolated extracellular vesicles were brought up in 50 µl of PBS with 0.5 µM of WGA-HRP and the mixture was allowed to bind on ice for 5 minutes. WGA-HRP bound vesicles were placed on a shaker (500 rpm) at 37°C before the addition of biotin tyramide (0.5 mM final concentration) and H2O2 (1 mM final concentration). Vesicles underwent labeling for 2 minutes before being quenched with 5 mM Trolox /10 mM Sodium Ascorbate /1 mM Sodium Pyruvate. Biotinylated small EVs were purified from other sedimentable particles by further centrifugation on a sucrose gradient (20-60%) for 16 hours at 4°C at 100,000xg. Precisely, the gradient was loaded using 0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% sucrose fractions from top to bottom. The sample was loaded at the bottom in 60% sucrose and the purified small EVs were isolated in the 20-40% sucrose fractions. Differential sucrose centrifugation generally yielded between 3-5 µg of small EVs from both RWPE-1 Control and Myc samples.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers #2 and 3 are quite critical of the proteomic analysis you have conducted. #2 argues that your proteome may well include proteins bound to the cell surface but secreted by other cells. #3 is more critical and argues that your analysis is not much of an improvement over other work that has already been published. The reviewer points out that some of the proteins you have identified are not actually exposed on the surface of the cell or of the EV. Further, #3 requests that you document the value of the technique for small-scale EV analysis, hence, to provide detailed technical info on the amount of EVs (number of source cells, and/or amount of proteins or particles) required to perform the surface proteome. If this amount does not really qualify as &quot;small-scale&quot;, the authors must revise their message (title).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments to strengthen our proteomic analysis. We believe that any low affinity, non-specific binding proteins are likely removed in the multiple wash/centrifugation steps on cells or the multiple centrifugation steps and sucrose gradient purification on EVs. As such, we believe that the secreted proteins identified are likely high affinity interactions and their differential expression on either cells or EVs play an important part in the downstream biology of both sample types. Proteins identified in our LC-MS/MS analysis are all annotated surface associated proteins or secreted proteins found in the Uniprot GOCC (Gene Ontology Cellular Component) Plasma Membrane database (5,746 annotated surface proteins in the database). The GOCC database is the most inclusive list of membrane proteins, only requiring they contain either a signal sequence, transmembrane domain, GPI anchor or other membrane associated motifs yielding a total of 5,746 proteins. This will include organelle membrane proteins. It is known that proteins can traffic from intracellular organelles to the cell surface, so these can be bonified cell surface proteins too. However, to increase stringency in our analysis, we have updated our figures to exclude intracellular membrane localized proteins, which are included in the Uniprot GOCC database. For further clarity in the data presentation (Figure 3D, 4D, 5D and corresponding supplementary lists), we have presented only proteins either found in the SURFY database (shown in bolded text) that only includes surface annotated proteins with a predicted transmembrane domain (Bausch-Fluck et al., The in silico human surfaceome. <italic>PNAS</italic>. 2018) or proteins that are annotated to be secreted from the cell to the extracellular space (Uniprot classification, shown in <italic>italic</italic> text).</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to describe the amount of EV sample prepared to demonstrate small-scale analysis. While we had to use 16x15cm<sup>2</sup> plates (240 milliliters of total media) to isolate EVs—due to the low production rate of EVs from the RWPE cell line—the total amount of isolated material post-sucrose gradient was 3-5 µg of material, which we believe to be small-scale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewer #1 is most critical of the description of and procedures you used to obtain the EV fraction. #1 suggests that you have missed an opportunity to distinguish the surface proteome of crude EVs in relation to purified exosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and agree that this distinction would be an interesting application of this method. While we are interested in performing this experiment, the goal of our initial proof-of-concept study was to focus on the comparative analysis of extracellular vesicle surface proteins to parent cell surface proteins. Therefore, we believe the suggested experiment would be better suited for a follow up paper on this method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We believe this work could be published in eLife, but not until you have completed a significant additional analysis of the proteome data to better justify your conclusions. Should these improvements, particularly those noted by reviewer #3, not be possible to complete, you may wish to consider the approach recommended by reviewer #1 where you resolve exosomes from the crude EV fraction to identify proteins that sort selectively into one vesicle sub-type.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The techniques and results of this manuscript appear novel and likely an improvement over other, non-adherent, labeling cell surface labeling methods. The results extend to extracellular vesicles and suggest that some proteins are highly enriched and may be diagnostic of a tumor cell origin. As such, the work represents a useful advance in the field and may merit publication as a technical report.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s summary and for recognizing the merit and important advance of this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I was less convinced by the approach taken to characterize what the authors refer to as exosomes. According to their methods section, the particulate material they collect is the result of an simple enrichment by differential centrifugation. If so, the material is a crude mixture of various vesicles and sedimentable particles, not necessarily all of membrane origin. To add confusion to this method, the authors use a diagram in Figure 4A that refers to membranes that are floated on a sucrose gradient and reference the work of Poggio et al. (2019) who reported the use of a 20-60% sucrose gradient to isolate exosomes. However, in that report, the gradient is not shown and the relevant fraction is referred to as a sucrose light fraction containing the exosome marker CD63. It is not clear from the Poggio et al. work if they have resolved exosomes from other buoyant membrane vesicles such as those that are shed by budding from the cell surface. The current work is even less clear on that distinction. In work published since the Poggio et al. paper, two labs have described the use of an Optiprep buoyant density gradient to resolve membranes into two subtypes with a higher buoyant density fraction likely representing authentic exosomes (Jeppesen et al., 2019, Cell 177, 428-445 April 4, 2019. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.02.029 ;Temoche-Diaz et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.47544.001). As an example, in the current work, the authors describe MFGE8 as a &quot;pan exosomal marker&quot; whereas in Temoche-Diaz et al., this protein is seen to be nearly exclusively in a light buoyant density fraction likely corresponding to cell surface budded vesicles and not exosomes.</p><p>There are two remedies to the problem of use of the term exosomes in this manuscript. The simplest would be to tighten up the description of the isolation method and switch the term to extracellular vesicles. And even then, it will be important to know if the procedure is as described by Poggio et al. with the use of a buoyant density centrifugation step. However, if this work really did rely on crude differential centrifugation, then there should be some additional experimental effort to demonstrate that the biotinylated proteins are from a membrane as opposed to a sedimentable particle. The two publications cited above demonstrate that not all sediments along with extracellular vesicles is actually a membrane.</p><p>Another remedy to the misuse of the term exosomes would be to conduct a more refined fractionation and then to compare the surface proteomes of EV sub-fractions.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. We did indeed use the same sucrose gradient approach for proteomic analysis as described in Poggio et al., which enriches for exosomes based on density. In the Poggio paper, there were several levels of characterization of the small EVs isolated by this method, including dependency on Rab27a and nSMase2, co-fractionation with exosome markers (CD63, HRS), and electron microscopy – (Figures 1 and 2 in Poggio et al). However, since we did not purify exosomes away from surface budded vesicles, we have changed all mentions of exosome to small extracellular vesicles. We have also edited the methods section to further clarify the use of the sucrose gradient. Furthermore, we have run an additional whole exosome lysate experiment to confirm that our purification approach strongly enriches for known markers of MVB-derived extracellular vesicles, such as CD63, CD81, CD9, SDCB1, LAMP1, LAMP2, and ALIX. This is shown in the waterfall plot, which has been added to the manuscript as Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Explain how one would deal with non-specifically bound proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We utilized the most rigorous informatics analysis available (Uniprot and SURFY) to annotate the proteins we find as having a signal sequence and/or TM domain. Data shown in heatmaps are based off of significance (p &lt; 0.05) across all four replicates, which supports that any secreted proteins present are likely due to actual biological differences between oncogenic status and/or sample origin (i.e. EV vs cell).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Explain how one would use the method for time-sensitive changes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and giving us an opportunity to elaborate on the types of experiments enabled by this new method. A previous study (Y, Li et al. Rapid Enzyme-Mediated Biotinylation for Cell Surface Proteome Profiling. <italic>Anal. Chem.</italic> 2021) showed that labeling the cell surface with soluble HRP allowed the researchers to detect immediate surface protein changes in response to insulin treatment. They demonstrated differential surfaceome profiling changes at 5 minutes vs 2 hours following treatment with insulin. Only methods utilizing these rapid labeling enzymes could allow for this type of resolution. A few other biological settings that experience rapid cell surface changes are: response to drug treatment, T-cell activation and synapse formation (S, Valitutti, et al. The space and time frames of T cell activation at the immunological synapse. <italic>FEBS Letters.</italic> 2010) and GPCR activation (T, Gupte et al. Minute-scale persistence of a GPCR conformation state triggered by non-cognate G protein interactions primes signaling. Nat. Commun. 2019). We also believe the method would be useful for post-translational processes where proteins are rapidly shuttling to the cell surface. We have updated the discussion to elaborate on these types of experiments.</p><p>“Due to the fast kinetics of peroxidase enzymes (1-2 min), our approaches could enable kinetic experiments to capture rapid post-translational trafficking of surfaces proteins, such as response to insulin, certain drug treatments, T-cell activation and synapse formation, and GPCR activation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Consequently, the abbreviation &quot;EV&quot; for the control RWPE1 cells should be changed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and have updated both the term exosomes to extracellular vesicles and the EV (empty vector) to control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental details are missing, for instance for the Western blots: what does &quot;equal amounts of samples&quot; mean?
