However, evidence for cell type-specific abnormalities of spermatogenesis disorders in NOA remains lacking. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) on testicular tissues from patients with obstructive azoospermia (OA) and NOA. HE staining confirmed the structural abnormalities of the seminiferous tubules in NOA patients. We identified 12 germ cell subtypes (spermatogonial stem cell-0 [SSC0], SSC1, SSC2, diffing-spermatogonia [Diffing-SPG], diffed-spermatogonia [Diffed-SPG], pre-leptotene [Pre-Lep], leptotene-zygotene [L-Z], pachytene [Pa], diplotene [Di], spermatids-1 [SPT1], SPT2, and SPT3) and 8 Sertoli cell subtypes (SC1-SC8). Among them, three novel Sertoli cell subtype phenotypes were identified, namely SC4/immature, SC7/mature, and SC8/further mature Sertoli cells. For each germ or Sertoli cell subtype, we identified unique new markers, among which immunofluorescence confirmed co-localization of ST3GAL4, A2M, ASB9, and TEX19 and DDX4 (classical marker of germ cell). PRAP1, BST2, and CCDC62 were co-expressed with SOX9 (classical marker of Sertoli cell) in testes tissues also confirmed by immunofluorescence. The interaction between germ cell subtypes and Sertoli cell subtypes exhibits stage-specific-matching pattern, as evidenced by SC1/2/5/7 involving in SSC0-2 development, SC3 participating in the whole process of spermiogenesis, SC4/6 participating in Diffing and Diffed-SPG development, and SC8 involving in the final stage of SPT3. This pattern of specific interactions between subtypes of germ cell and Sertoli cell was confirmed by immunofluorescence of novel markers in testes tissues. The interaction was mainly regulated by the Notch1/2/3 signaling. Our study profiled the single-cell transcriptome of human spermatogenesis and provided many potential molecular markers for developing testicular puncture-specific marker kits for NOA patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-obstructive azoospermia</kwd><kwd>single-cell RNA-sequencing</kwd><kwd>single cell ATAC-sequencing</kwd><kwd>germ cell</kwd><kwd>Sertoli cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ShenZhen Science and Technology Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JCYJ20230807111304010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Shimin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Futian Healthcare Research Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTWS2023021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Dong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The specific interaction between Sertoli cell subtypes and germ cell subpopulations mediates spermatogenesis disorders in non-obstructive azoospermia.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is a common disease affecting approximately 15% of couples, and 50% of cases in infertility is attributed to male factor infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2015</xref>). Male infertility is mainly associated with sexual dysfunction, endocrine, varicocele, and reproductive system infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Naz and Kamal, 2017</xref>). Azoospermia includes obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). NOA accounts for about 1% of adult males and 10–15% of infertile males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Fakhro et al., 2018</xref>). The etiology of NOA is varied, including cryptorchidism, post-pubertal mumps orchitis, and prior testicular torsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yao et al., 2022</xref>). At present, assisted reproductive technology, such as microdissection testicular sperm extraction and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, has made certain progress, providing help for patients to obtain biological offspring. At the same time, spermatogonial stem cell culture and transplantation technology and testicular tissue transplantation technology have also made some progress, but the clinical application is still not mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gassei and Orwig, 2016</xref>). At present, the etiology and mechanism of NOA patients are still unknown, which poses a challenge to treatment. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to further study the molecular mechanisms affecting spermatogenesis in NOA patients.</p><p>The formation of mature spermatozoa can be delineated into three stages: the proliferation of spermatogonial cells, meiotic division of spermatocytes, and the maturation of sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jégou, 1993</xref>). The seminiferous tubule comprises three distinct cell types: Sertoli cells, extending from the basal membrane to the tubular lumen; germ cells of various generations; and peritubular cells, surrounding Sertoli cells and germ cells, isolated from Sertoli cells by the extracellular matrix. In most mammals, germ cells undergo continuous renewal, while Sertoli cells cease division during the pubertal developmental period, forming the seminiferous epithelium. The lining of the seminiferous epithelium is uniquely intricate within a complex tissue structure. At any given point in a seminiferous tubule, several generations of germ cells develop simultaneously in the process of contacting Sertoli cells from the basal epithelium to the apex. The evolution of each generation of germ cells is strictly synchronized with others, resulting in the formation of specific cell associations or stages at a particular segment of the tubule. The complete temporal sequence of these cell associations or stages until the reappearance of the initial association in a defined region of the tubule is referred to as the seminiferous epithelial cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hess and Moore, 1993</xref>). Adult spermatogonial stem cells are distributed along the basal membrane at the base of the seminiferous tubule, necessitating a delicate balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Throughout this process, only Sertoli cells consistently maintain physical contact with sperm cells. Consequently, we posit that the entire process of spermatogenesis inevitably involves intense information exchange with the occurrence of Sertoli cells. However, the specifics of this interactive process remain incompletely understood at present.</p><p>Single-cell transcriptome sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology is used for high-throughput molecular detection of a single cell and exploring the whole-gene expression profiles of a single cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). It can delineate the existence of rare cell subsets and the degree of cellular heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tirumalasetty et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vértesy et al., 2018</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2019</xref> performed scRNA-seq analysis on mouse testicular germ cells at 5.5 days after birth, revealing the heterogeneity of gene expression in undifferentiated spermatogonial cells. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guo et al., 2018</xref> performed scRNA-seq of testicular cells from young adults and found that there were five different spermatogonial states accompanying human spermatogonial differentiation. In addition, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) is a widely used method to obtain a genome-wide snapshot of chromatin accessibility, signatures of active transcription and transcription factor (TF) binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mimitou et al., 2021</xref>). Cellular identity is strongly affected by the epigenetic wiring of the cell, which is measured by scATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pervolarakis et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq can be used to analyze spermatogenesis.</p><p>In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq in testicular tissues from two OA and three NOA patients. Cellular heterogeneity and marker gene identification results were analyzed, and the potential functional mechanism was inferred. Altogether, our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the maturation of the spermatogenic microenvironment and the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis, offering novel targets for NOA treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>scRNA-seq analysis of human testicular tissues</title><p>Testicular histology was examined by HE staining. In the OA1-P1 group, seminiferous tubules displayed normal structure with well-organized layers of germ cells at various stages of spermatogenesis, including mature spermatozoa. In the OA2-P2 group, germ cells and spermatozoa were present but show disorganized arrangement, with sloughed cells observed in the lumen. In the NOA1-P3 group, no spermatozoa were present, but a small number of spermatocytes and spermatogonia were visible, along with various stages of spermatogenesis. In the NOA2-P4 group, germ cells and spermatozoa were present but exhibit disordered arrangement, with sloughed cells in the lumen. In the NOA3-P5 group, only Sertoli cells were observed, indicating impaired spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To characterize the diversity of testicular cells, we performed scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq on testicular samples from three NOA patients and two OA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After removing low-quality cells, we obtained 23,889 cells for scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, the quantity of annotated germ cells in patients categorized as NOA1, NOA2, and NOA3 gradually decreased to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This observation is in complete accordance with the clinical features exhibited by the three patients, providing evidence for the reliability of our scRNA-seq data. UMAP analysis of scRNA-seq revealed 12 major cell types, including germ cells, Leydig cells, Sertoli cells, endothelial cells, peritubular myoid cells (PMCs), smooth muscle, Schwann cell, macrophage, mast cells, T cells, B cells, and plasma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A total of 41,708 high-quality cells were obtained from scATAC-seq analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and they were also annotated with B cells, endothelial cells, PMCs, Schwann cell, smooth muscle, T cells, germ cells, Leydig cells, macrophage, and Sertoli cells, which was similar to the scRNA-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Heatmap of marker genes in scRNA-seq data revealed that cell heterogeneity was obvious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The well-known cell-type markers were utilized to determine the cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). For instance, we observed that Sertoli cells, in addition to specifically expressing classical markers AMH and SOX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Fröjdman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lasala et al., 2011</xref>), also exhibited strong expression of APOA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we identified that the PMCs not only expressed the classical marker MYH11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lottrup et al., 2014</xref>), which is concurrently highly expressed in smooth muscle cells, displaying limited specificity, but also demonstrated higher specificity in the expression of DPEP1, suggesting its potential as a specific marker for PMCs. Similar to the scRNA-seq results, the activity of these markers was high in the corresponding cell subtypes in scATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> shows the chromatin accessibility of these markers within the cells. Integrating scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq analysis revealed substantial overlap between the cells profiled in the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, implying that for most cell populations shifts in chromatin accessibility were aligned with coordinated alterations in gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These findings indicate that the data from this study can serve for cellular classification.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of major cell types and cellular attributes of testes of obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of HE staining of testicular tissues of OA and NOA patients.

Integrating scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq analysis showed that the distributions between the same cell types were very alike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Heatmap of scRNA-seq results showed the markers successfully distinguished between different germ cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Violin plots showed germ cell subtype marker gene expression in different germ cell subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Heatmap of germ cell markers and motifs in scATAC-seq results is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>. Subsequently, we attempted to characterize the sequential developmental relationships among 12 germ cell subpopulations through pseudotime analysis, approaching this issue from a developmental perspective. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, germ cells could be divided into three states, which was in accordance with the biological sequence of continuous transition of spermatogenesis. States 2 and 3 primarily consist of SSC and Diffed SPG cells, and these cells are not completely segregated in terms of the cell states, particularly with SSC0-SSC2 positioned at two initial branches without complete separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests a potential cyclical and self-renewing state that is not entirely independent between SSC1 and SSC2. Cells from the Pre-L to SPT3 stages all belong to state 1, following the developmental chronological order of sperm generation. Therefore, the phenomenon of distinct subpopulations existing independently while sharing markers with other subpopulations suggests that germ cells from different subtypes may not have fully differentiated into mature states during the course of evolution, remaining in an intermediate state of continuous differentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of germ cell subtypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP analysis of 12 germ cell subsets in scRNA-seq results.

Among them, SPT1 cells can be clearly distinguished from SPT2-3 cells using FAM24A, but between SPT2 and SPT3 cells, there is no precise and specific marker that completely segregates these two cell types. We speculate that this lack of differentiation may be due to the intense morphological changes occurring in the sperm cells during this period, resulting in relatively minor differences in gene expression.</p><p>Finally, to further validate the reliability of the identified new potential markers of germ cells, we co-stained them with a classical marker DDX4 using immunofluorescence. We discovered that ST3GAL4, A2M, and DDX4 were co-expressed in testes tissues. ASB9 and TEX19 were also co-expressed with DDX4 in testes tissues. TSSK6 exhibited a similar expression pattern to that of DDX4 in testes tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In addition, closely resembling their expression patterns in different subpopulations, we found that the region transcription start/promoter site to A2M and ASB9 was accessible in the SSC0, SSC2, and Diffing_SPG but was not accessible in other cell subtypes, with much higher levels of openness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The region transcription start site to TEX19 was accessible in the Diffed_SPG but was not accessible in other cell subtypes, which also closely resembled the TEX19 expression pattern.

As aging or damaged cells undergo apoptosis, resident adult stem cells are activated to generate new cells. Within various tissues, a dichotomy exists between rapidly cycling (involved in tissue repair, EOMES<sup>－</sup>GFRA1<sup>+</sup>) and quiescent stem cells (reserve cells, EOMES<sup>+</sup>GFRA1<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the cellular developmental states of distinct sperm subpopulations, we conducted an analysis of the cell cycle in sperm cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, SSC0/1 and SSC2 are quiescent stem cells and rapidly cycling cells, respectively. Furthermore, to explore the biological function of germ cells, we used transcriptional dynamics to analyze the important events and time points in the whole transcriptional process of spermatogenesis. Maintenance of SSC pluripotency, whether in the G0/G1 phase and G2/M arrest SSC0/SSC1, or rapid cycling SSC2, is transcriptionally governed by the downregulation of ID4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The pivotal driving genes promoting the transition of SSC2 into differentiating Diffing SPG cells and progressing through mitosis are upregulated DMRT1 and PABPC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). As BEND2 takes the central regulatory position, germ cell development officially proceeds into meiosis, marking the transitioned cells (Diffed SPG) in a mixed transitional state concurrently undergoing both mitosis and meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Although most studies have categorized the development of Sertoli cells after birth into two stages, immature and mature, the existence of an intermediate or transitional state remains largely unknown.

Consequently, we defined state 1 and state 3 as immature and mature Sertoli cells, respectively. State 2, falling between immature and mature states, does not belong to either category.

For instance, some germ cells, due to their structural affinity with Sertoli cells, cannot be fully separated, and when cultured independently in vitro, these germ cells exhibit very short survival times; however, the addition of Sertoli cells or the use of Sertoli cells-conditioned medium significantly improves the survival of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">La et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mohammadi-Sardoo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Risley and Morse-Gaudio, 1992</xref>). To determine which subtype of Sertoli cells is more closely involved in spermatogenesis, we analyzed spermatogenesis and Sertoli cells distribution in the NOA (experimental group) and OA (control group) groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The number proportion of germ cell subsets in NOA1/2 and OA1/2 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. The number of germ cells in NOA3 patients was 0.

It can be seen that the number of Sertoli cells in three NOA samples was lower than that in OA samples, indicating that the number of Sertoli cells is somewhat correlated with spermatogenesis. Interestingly, we observed a complete absence of immature Sertoli cells, especially SC3, in the testicular tissue of patients with NOA3 who exhibited a total absence of sperm, with only a small population of mature SC7 cells present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>), suggesting that the absence of sperm in NOA3 patients may be associated with Sertoli cells SC3. For NOA2 samples, although the number of Sertoli cells was less than that of NOA3, SC3 was not missing in NOA2, so spermatogenesis was only partially affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref>). To further elucidate the role of SC3 in spermatogenesis, we analyzed DEGs in SC3 between the NOA and OA groups. Our results identified a total of eight DEGs, with seven being downregulated and one upregulated in the OA group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A dotplot was utilized to highlight the expression of DEGs in SC3 between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Interestingly, compared with the NOA group, HIST1H4C was upregulated, while TMEM158, TUBA3E, and VTN were downregulated in the OA group. GO analysis revealed that these DEGs were predominantly associated with positive regulation of monocyte differentiation and negative regulation of fibrinolysis, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>. KEGG analysis demonstrated that the DEGs were primarily involved in phagosome and ECM−receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

The single-cell analysis of GSE149512 further confirmed a positive correlation between SC3 and germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). These results suggested SC3 might be involved in spermatogenesis. Subsequently, to understand the association between the functions of Sertoli cells and germ cells, GO term enrichment analysis of germ cells and Sertoli cells was carried out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">4</xref>). We found that the functions could be divided into eight categories, namely, material energy metabolism, cell cycle activity, the final stage of sperm cell formation, chemical reaction, signal communication, cell adhesion and migration, stem cells and sex differentiation activity, and stress reaction. These different events were labeled with different colors in order to quickly capture the important events occurring in the cells at each stage. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, we discovered that SSC0/1/2 was involved in an SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane and cytoplasmic translation; Diffing SPG was involved in cell division and cell cycle; Diffied SPG was involved in cell cycle and RNA splicing; Pre-Leptotene was involved in cell cycle and meiotic cell cycle; Leptotene_Zygotene was involved in cell cycle and meiotic cell cycle; Pachytene was involved in cilium assembly and spermatogenesis; Diplotene was involved in spermatogenesis and cilium assembly; SPT1 was involved in cilium assembly and flagellated sperm motility; SPT2 was involved in spermatid development and flagellated sperm motility; and SPT3 was involved in spermatid development and spermatogenesis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>, SC1 were mainly involved in cell differentiation, cell adhesion, and cell communication; SC2 were involved in cell migration and cell adhesion; SC3 were involved in spermatogenesis and meiotic cell cycle; SC4 were involved in meiotic cell cycle and positive regulation of stem cell proliferation; SC5 were involved in cell cycle and cell division; SC6 were involved in obsolete oxidation−reduction process and glutathione derivative biosynthetic process; SC7 were involved in viral transcription and translational initiation; and SC8 were involved in spermatogenesis and sperm capacitation. The above analysis indicated that germ cells were primarily involved in biological processes related to sperm formation, and Sertoli cells were mainly involved in processes related to the formation of sperm cells, suggesting a functional correlation between Sertoli cells and germ cells.</p><p>To further verify that Sertoli cell subtypes have ‘stage specificity’ for each stage of sperm development, we first performed HE staining using testicular tissues from the OA3-P6, NOA4-P7, and NOA5-P8 samples. The results showed that the OA3-P6 group showed some sperm, with reduced spermatogenesis, thickened basement membranes, and a high number of Sertoli cells without spermatogenic cells. The NOA4-P7 group had no sperm initially, but a few malformed sperm were observed after sampling, leading to the removal of affected seminiferous tubules. The NOA5-P8 group showed no sperm in situ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> was performed using these tissues for validation. ASB9 (SSC2) was primarily expressed in a wreath-like pattern around the basement membrane of testicular tissue, particularly in the OA group, while ASB9 was barely detectable in the NOA group. SOX2 (SC2) was scattered around SSC2 (ASB9), with nuclear staining, while TF (SC1) expression was not prominent. In NOA patients, SPATS1 (SC3) expression was significantly reduced. C9orf57 (Pa) showed nuclear expression in testicular tissues, primarily extending along the basement membrane toward the spermatogenic center, and was positioned closer to the center than DDX4, suggesting its involvement in germ cell development or differentiation. BEND4, identified as a marker for SC5, showed a developmental trajectory from the basement membrane toward the spermatogenic center. ST3GAL4 was expressed in the nucleus, forming a circular pattern around the basement membrane, similar to A2M (SSC1), though A2M was more concentrated around the outer edge of the basement membrane, creating a more distinct wreath-like arrangement. In case of impaired spermatogenesis, this arrangement becomes disorganized and loses its original structure. SMCP (SC6) was concentrated in the midpiece region of the bright blue sperm cell tail. In the OA group, SSC1 (A2M) was sparsely arranged in a rosette pattern around the basement membrane, but in the NOA group, it appeared more scattered. SSC2 (ASB9) expression was not prominent. BST2 (SC7) was a transmembrane protein primarily localized on the cell membrane. In the OA group, A2M (SSC1) was distinctly arranged in a wreath-like pattern around the basement membrane, with expression levels significantly higher than ASB9 (SSC2). TSSK6 (SPT3) was primarily expressed in OA3-P6, while CCDC62 (SC8) was more abundantly expressed in NOA4-P7, with ASB9 (SCC2) showing minimal expression. Taken together, germ cells of a particular stage tended to co-localize with Sertoli cells of the corresponding stages. Germ cells and Sertoli cells at each differentiation stage were functionally heterogeneous and stage-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We speculate that each stage of sperm development requires the assistance of Sertoli cells to complete the corresponding stage of sperm development.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Co-localization of subpopulations of Sertoli cells and germ cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of HE staining of testicular tissues of obstructive azoospermia (OA) and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients.

Results showed that Notch1/2/3 signaling was involved in the interaction between Sertoli cells and germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Interestingly, a chromatin accessibility landscape in scATAC-seq data showed that promoter regions of Notch1 were only accessible in the SC1-SC3 subpopulations, not in the germ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5B</xref>). The openness of the promoter region of Notch2 was observed not only in Sertoli cells but also in SSC2 and Pachytene. Notch3 accessibility was only observed within the gene in different cell subtypes. Overall, Notch1/2/3 signaling might be involved in the interaction between Sertoli cells and germ cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>NOA is due to pretesticular factors or testicular factors, usually abnormal spermatogenesis, which cannot be cured by surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zarezadeh et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, it is particularly important to study the etiology of NOA. Spermatogenesis is a complex developmental process that requires coordinated differentiation of multiple cell lines. In the present study, we performed scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to assess the heterogeneity of germ cells and somatic cells. We identified 12 subtypes for germ cells, 8 subtypes for Sertoli cells, 12 subtypes for Leydig cells, 10 subtypes for PMCs, and 8 subtypes for macrophage and marker genes of specific cell type. The process of spermatogenesis was determined based on the cell trajectory analysis. Collectively, our results provide rich resources for exploring the potential mechanism of spermiogenesis.</p><p>In this study, some specific marker genes for germ cells were screened. We found that UTF1 and ID4 were specifically expressed in SSC1, and DMRT1 was specifically expressed in Diffing SPG. ID4 was a key regulator of SSC and ID4 also marked SSCs in the mouse testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). UTF1 was reported to be a marker for SSCs in stallions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jung et al., 2014</xref>). UTF1 was discovered to play an important part in germ cell development, spermatogenesis, and male fertility in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raina et al., 2021</xref>). DMRT1 is necessary for male sexual development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanism and expression pattern of these marker genes still need further research.</p><p>SSCs are adult stem cells in the testis of mammals that maintain spermatogenesis and are essential for male fertility, but the mechanisms remain elusive. UTF1 is a transcription factor expressed in SSC1, which plays a definite role in the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan and Wilkinson, 2019</xref>). Dmrt1 belongs to a family of conserved transcriptional regulators that control several key processes in mammalian testis, including germ cells and somatic cells. A recent discovery suggested that DMRT1 was essential for the formation of SSC and had gonadal-specific and amphoteric dimorphic expression patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sohni et al., 2019</xref>). NANOS3 is a member of the highly conservative NANOS family. The decrease in NANOS3 expression could result in a decrease in the number of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Julaton and Reijo Pera, 2011</xref>). In this study, UTF1 was specifically expressed in SSC1, and DMRT1 and NANOS3 were the main specifically expressed genes in SSC2. Therefore, UTF1, DMRT1, and NANOS3 might promote SSC proliferation and were necessary for SSC differentiation.</p><p>Spermatogenesis consists of three processes: mitosis of spermatogonia, meiosis of spermatocyte, and deformation of spermatocyte. Abnormalities in any of these stages can result in spermatogenesis disorders. During this process, the testicular microenvironment in which spermatogenic cells are located plays an important role. In addition to Sertoli cells, the testicular microenvironment also includes myoid cells and mesenchymal cells and their secreted factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we clustered four somatic cell types: Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, PMCs, and macrophages. Sertoli cells play an important role in normal spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zomer and Reddi, 2020</xref>). They provide the physical framework that supports the survival of germ cells and secretes unique growth factors and cytokines to assist in the development of germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">O’Donnell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In our study, the NOA3 group had the least number of sperm cells due to the lack of SC3/8, and the NOA2 group had a smaller number of SC3 cells than the normal OA group, so the number of sperm cells in the NOA2 group was between the NOA3 and OA groups. Although NOA2 did not have SC8 to participate in the formation of SPT3, this process was compensated by SC3, which was involved in cell formation throughout all stages of sperm development, and its function was particularly important. These data suggested that the association between germ cells and Sertoli cells was stage-specific, but this ‘specificity’ is not entirely isolated.</p><p>Notch receptors have been reported to play an important role in cell fate determination, maintenance, and differentiation of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Huang et al., 2013</xref>). Notch signaling components have been discovered to express in Sertoli and germ cells in the developing and mature testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Garcia et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, a breakdown of Notch signaling can lead to abnormal cell differentiation and early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McCright et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Swiatek et al., 1994</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Murta et al., 2014</xref> also found notch signaling disrupts results in abnormal spermatogenesis in the mouse. Notch signaling was reported to be a key pathway regulating Sertoli cell physiology, and its changes may disturb reaction of Sertoli cells to androgens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamińska et al., 2020</xref>). Notch signaling in Sertoli cells is indirectly associated with germ cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). The upregulation of notch signaling in Sertoli cells induced the transformation of the quiescence to differentiation and meiosis in germ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Garcia and Hofmann, 2013</xref>). In this study, we found that Notch signaling was involved in the interaction between germ cells and Sertoli cells. Therefore, Notch signaling might function in spermatogenesis.</p><p>This study has certain limitations. Firstly, the sample size is limited, which may not cover all subtypes of NOA, thereby affecting the universality of the conclusions. Additionally, this study primarily relies on scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq results, which are indirect evidence, and further experimental validation of the mechanisms is required. Finally, there are challenges in translating basic research into clinical applications, and individual differences may also affect the general applicability of treatment strategies. Therefore, future research needs to overcome these limitations to achieve a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the disease mechanisms and promote clinical applications.</p><p>In conclusion, our results revealed 12 germ cell subtypes and 8 Sertoli cell subtypes. We determined the process of spermatogenesis and found that SC3 subtypes (marked by SPATS1) of Sertoli cell played an important role in this process. The interaction between germ cells and Sertoli cells at each differentiation stage was stage-specific. The Notch1/2/3 signaling was discovered to be involved in germ cell–Sertoli cell interaction. Our results not only give us a comprehensive insight into human spermatogenesis, but also pave the way for determining molecules participated in the development of male germ cells, offering a powerful tool for further study on NOA.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human sample acquisition</title><p>Testicular tissues were obtained from three OA patients (OA1-P1, OA2-P2, OA3-P6) and five NOA patients (NOA1-P3, NOA2-P4, NOA3-P5, NOA4-P7, NOA5-P8) using micro-dissection of testicular sperm extraction separately.

The authors analyze this dataset to identify novel cellular populations, marker genes, and inter-population interactions that may contribute to proper spermatogenesis. Then they propose a role of specific Sertoli cell subtypes and their interactions via Notch signaling in germ cell development. However, I remain skeptical of their central argument (also highlighted in the title) that stage-specific interactions between Sertoli and germ cells are a key component in NOA development, as my initial concerns regarding potential data misrepresentation, lack of statistical testing, and the rationale behind some of the analyses have not been sufficiently addressed.</p><p>(1) As noted in my previous comments, the analysis of Sertoli cell subtypes is potentially misleading and lacks proper statistical support. The authors claim a significant loss of Sertoli subpopulations in NOA cases, and provide the absolute number of cells in Figure 6B. However, this observation could easily be driven by the total number of cells captured during the experiment and the anatomical location of the specimens. There is no statistical basis to make the claim that this loss is significant. Furthermore, the same analysis should be performed on scATAC-seq cells and presented alongside.</p><p>(2) As pointed out in my initial concerns, some parts of the analyses require additional explanation to clarify their logical flow. For example, the logic of using between-sample correlations to assess colocalization of Sertoli and germ cells is lost on me. How can this be used to infer the important role of specific Sertoli cell populations in spermatogenesis, other than the fact that some of the genes are more co-expressed in the sub-populations? And how is this related to the claim that these cell populations are actually co-localized in the tissue? The authors then dedicate nearly a page describing the pathways enriched in Sertoli and germ cells, but the relevance is unclear, and the argument that these subtypes are functionally related is not convincing enough.</p><p>(3) The statement regarding Notch signaling as a critical component in Sertoli and germ cell interaction is not supported by actual evidence. The inference based on CellphoneDB and an epigenome snapshot that shows not much difference are insufficient to justify this claim.</p><p>(4) The manuscript is overly wordy and descriptive, making it difficult to read and understand the points. The main text needs to be more concise and on point, with unnecessary details removed to sharpen the key points. Non-essential results (e.g. Figure S10 and S11) unrelated to the main argument should be removed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97958.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Shimin Wang et al. investigated the role of Sertoli cells in mediating spermatogenesis disorders in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) through stage-specific communications.

Their findings are mostly based on transcriptome and the authors do not make enough use of the scATAC-seq data in their analyses as they put forward in the title.

However, in transcriptomic research, limited sample sizes are a common issue due to the complexities involved in acquiring samples, particularly in studies about the reproductive system. Healthy testicular tissue samples are difficult to obtain, and studies (doi: 10.18632/aging.203675) have used obstructive azoospermia as a control group in which spermatogenesis and development are normal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Their argument about interactions between germ and Sertoli cells is not based on statistical testing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Due to limited funding, we have not yet fully and deeply conducted validation experiments, but we plan to carry out related experiments in the later stage. We hope that the publication of this study will help to obtain more financial support to further investigate the interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Rationale/logic of the study. This study, in its present form, seems to be more about the role of sub-Sertoli population interactions in sperm cell development and does not provide enough insights about NOA.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. In Figure 6, we conducted an in-depth analysis and comparison of the differences between the Sertoli cell subtypes and the germ cell subtypes involved in spermatogenesis in the OA and NOA groups. The results revealed that in the NOA group, especially in the NOA3 group, which has a lower sperm count compared to NOA2 and NOA1, there is a significant loss of Sertoli cell subtypes including SC3, SC4, SC5, SC6, and SC8. The NOA1 group, with a sperm count close to that of the OA group, also had a Sertoli cell profile similar to the OA group. The NOA2 group, with a sperm count between that of NOA1 and NOA3, also exhibited an intermediate profile of Sertoli cell subtypes. Therefore, we suggest that change in Sertoli cell subtypes is a key factor affecting sperm count, rather than just the total number of Sertoli cells. We believe that through these analyses, we can provide in-depth insights into NOA, and we hope that the publication of this study will help obtain more funding support to further validate and expand on these findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors do not make full use of the scATAC-seq data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.We have added analysis of the scATAC-seq data and shown in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Shimin Wang et al. investigated the role of Sertoli cells in mediating spermatogenesis disorders in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) through stage-specific communications.

Indeed, we have conducted immunofluorescence (IF) experiments to validate the data obtained from single-cell sequencing and have expanded the sample size to enhance the reliability of our results. To better present these validation experiments, we have reorganized and renamed the sample information, making it easier for you to understand which samples were used in the specific experiments.

We have added Table S2, which includes the metric for scATAC-seq.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A single sample from each OA and NOA group may not be enough to confirm colocalization. The authors should include results from all available samples and use quantitative measures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. I apologize that the sample size in this study was less than three and we could not conduct quantitative analysis. We will increase the sample size and conduct corresponding experiments in subsequent research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The Methods section does not include enough description to follow how the analyses were carried out, and is missing information on some of the key procedures such as velocity and cell cycle analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The method about velocity and cell cycle analyses was added in the revised manuscript. The description is as follows:</p><p>“Velocity analysis</p><p>RNA velocity analysis was conducted using scVelo's (version 0.2.1) generalized dynamical model. The spliced and unspliced mRNA was quantified by Velocity (version 0.17.17).”</p><p>“Cell cycle analysis</p><p>To quantify the cell cycle phases for individual cell, we employed the CellCycleScoring function from the Seurat package.

In Figure 1, we present the HE staining results paired with the single-cell data, covering all patients involved in the single-cell analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Saying &quot;identification of novel potential molecular markers for distinct cell types&quot; seems unsupported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. I'm sorry for the inaccuracy of my description. We have revised this sentence. The description is as follows: These findings indicate that the scRNA-seq data from this study can serve for cellular classification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The methods suggest an integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, but from the figures, it seems like separate analyses were performed. It's necessary to have data showing the integrated analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have added an integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. The results were shown in Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 does not seem to well cover the diversity of germ cell subtypes. The main content appears to be about the differentiation process, and it seems more focused on SSCs (stem cell types), but the intended message is not clearly conveyed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Figure S1 revealed the diversity of germ cell subtypes. The second part of the results described the integrated findings from Figures 2 and S1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 2B, pseudotime could be shown, and I wonder if the pseudotime in this analysis shows a similar pattern as in Figure 2D.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Figure 2B revealed the pseudotime analysis of 12 germ cell subpopulation. Figure 2D revealed RNA velocity of 12 germ cell subpopulation. The two methods are both used for cell trajectory analysis. The pseudotime in Figure 2B showed a similar pattern as in Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While staining occurs within one tissue, saying they are co-expressed seems inaccurate as the staining locations are clearly distinct. For example, the staining patterns of A2M and DDX4 (a classical marker) are quite different, so it's hard to claim A2M as a new potential marker just because it's expressed. Also, TSSK6 was separately described as having a similar expression pattern to DDX4, but from the IF results, it doesn't seem similar.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised the Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It was described that A2M (expressed in SSC0-1), and ASB9 (expressed in SSC2) have open promoter sites in SSC0, SSC2, and Diffing_SPG, but it doesn't seem like they are only open in the promoters of those cell types. For example, there doesn't seem to be a peak in Diffing for either gene. The promoter region of the tracks is not very clear, so overall figure modification seems necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised the Figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The ATAC signal scale for each genomic region should be included, and clear markings for the TSS location and direction of the genes are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised the figure and shown in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A mostly shows the SSC2 in the G2/M phase, so it seems questionable to call SSC0/1 quiescent. Also, I wonder if the expression of EOMES and GFRA1 is well distinguished in the SSC subtypes as expected.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We will validate in subsequent experiments whether the expression of EOMES and GFRA1 is clearly distinguished in the SSC subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- In Figure 3C, it would be good to have labels indicating what the x and y axes represent. The figure seems complex, and the description does not seem to fully support it.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have added labels indicating what the x and y axes represent in the Figure 3C. The x and y axes represent spliced and unspliced mRNA ratios, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While TFs are the central focus, it's disappointing that scATAC-seq was not used.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. TFs analysis using scATAC-seq will be carried out in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: It would be good to have a more detailed discussion of the differences between subtypes, such as through GO analysis. The track images need modification like marking the peaks of interest and focusing more on the promoter region, similar to the previous figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. GO analysis results were put in Figure S5. The description is as follows:</p><p>As shown in Figure S5, SC1 were mainly involved in cell differentiation, cell adhesion and cell communication; SC2 were involved in cell migration, and cell adhesion; SC3 were involved in spermatogenesis, and meiotic cell cycle; SC4 were involved in meiotic cell cycle, and positive regulation of stem cell proliferation; SC5 were involved in cell cycle, and cell division; SC6 were involved in obsolete oxidation−reduction process, and glutathione derivative biosynthetic process; SC7 were involved in viral transcription and translational initiation; SC8 were involved in spermatogenesis and sperm capacitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5, it would be good to have criteria for the novel Sertoli cell subtype presented. CCDC62 is presented as a representative marker for the SC8 cluster, but from Figure 4C, it seems to be quite expressed in the SC3 cluster as well. Therefore, in Figure 5E's protein-level check, it's unclear if this truly represents a novel SC8 subtype.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. CCDC62 expression was higher in SC8 cluster than in SC3. Since some molecular markers were not commercially available in the market, CCDC62 was selected as SC8 marker for immunofluorescence verification. Immunofluorescence results showed that CCDC62 is a novel SC8 marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It might have been more meaningful to use SOX9 as a control and show that markers in the same subtype are expressed in the same location.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. To determine PRAP1, BST2, and CCDC62 as new markers for the SC subtype, we co-stained them with SOX9 (a well-known SC marker).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figures 4 and 5 could potentially be combined into one figure.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Since combining Figures 4 and 5 into a single image would cause the image to be unclear, two images are used to show it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6, it would be good to support the results with more NOA patient data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. Patient clinical and laboratory characteristics has been presented in Table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Rather than claiming the importance of SC3 based on 3 single-cell patient data, it would be better to validate using public data with SC3 signature genes (e.g., showing the correlation between germ cell and SC3 ratios).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. I'm sorry I didn't find public data with SC3 signature genes. In the future, we will verify the importance of SC3 through in vivo and in vitro experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- 462: It seems to be referring to Figure 6G, not 6D.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have revised it. The description is as follows: As shown in Figure 6G, State 1 SC3/4/5 were tended to associated with PreLep, SSC0/1/2, and Diffing and Diffed-SPG sperm cells (R &gt; 0.72).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 7, the spermatogenesis process is basically well-known, so it would be better to emphasize what novel content is being conveyed here. Additionally, emphasizing the importance of SC3 in the overall process based on GO results leaves room for a better approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestions. Regarding Figure 7, we recognize that the spermatogenesis process is well-known, and we will focus on highlighting the novel content, particularly the role and significance of the SC3 subtype in spermatogenesis disorders. As for the importance of SC3 in the overall process based on GO results, we have validated this in Figure 8 through co-staining experiments between Sertoli cells and spermatogenic cells in OA and NOA groups. The results demonstrate a significant correlation between the number of SC3-positive cells and SPT3 spermatogenic cells, particularly in the NOA5-P8 group, where both SC3 and SPT3 cell counts are notably lower than in the NOA4-P7 group. This further supports the critical role of SC3 in the spermatogenesis process. Your suggestions have prompted us to refine our data presentation and more clearly emphasize the novel aspects of our research. We will continue to strive to ensure that every part of our research contributes meaningfully to the academic community. Thank you again for your guidance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 8, only the contents of the IF-stained proteins are listed, which seems slightly insufficient to constitute a subsection on its own. It might have been better to conclude by emphasizing some subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have combined this part of the results with other results into one section. The description is as follows:</p><p>“Co-localization of subpopulations of Sertoli cells and germ cells</p><p>To determine the interaction between Sertoli cells and spermatogenesis, we applied Cell-PhoneDB to infer cellular interactions according to ligand-receptor signalling database. As shown in Figure 6G, compared with other cell types, germ cells were mainly interacted with Sertoli cells. We futher performed Spearman correlation analysis to determine the relationship between Sertoli cells and germ cells. As shown in Figure 6H, State 1 SC3/4/5 were tended to be associated with PreLep, SSC0/1/2, and Diffing and Diffed-SPG sperm cells (R &gt; 0.72). Interestingly, SC3 was significantly positively correlated with all sperm subpopulations (R &gt; 0.5), suggesting an important role for SC3 in spermatogenesis and that SC3 is involved in the entire process of spermatogenesis. Subsequently, to understand whether the functions of germ cells and Sertoli cells correspond to each other, GO term enrichment analysis of germ cells and sertoli cells was carried out (Figure S3, S4). We found that the functions could be divided into 8 categories, namely, material energy metabolism, cell cycle activity, the final stage of sperm cell formation, chemical reaction, signal communication, cell adhesion and migration, stem cells and sex differentiation activity, and stress reaction. These different events were labeled with different colors in order to quickly capture the important events occurring in the cells at each stage. As shown in Figure S3, we discovered that SSC0/1/2 was involved in SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane, and cytoplasmic translation; Diffing SPG was involved in cell division and cell cycle; Diffied SPG was involved in cell cycle and RNA splicing; Pre-Leptotene was involved in cell cycle and meiotic cell cycle; Leptotene_Zygotene was involved in cell cycle and meiotic cell cycle; Pachytene was involved in cilium assembly and spermatogenesis; Diplotene was involved in spermatogenesis and cilium assembly; SPT1 was involved in cilium assembly and flagellated sperm motility; SPT2 was involved in spermatid development and flagellated sperm motility; SPT3 was involved in spermatid development and spermatogenesis. As shown in Figure S4, SC1 were mainly involved in cell differentiation, cell adhesion and cell communication; SC2 were involved in cell migration, and cell adhesion; SC3 were involved in spermatogenesis, and meiotic cell cycle; SC4 were involved in meiotic cell cycle, and positive regulation of stem cell proliferation; SC5 were involved in cell cycle, and cell division; SC6 were involved in obsolete oxidation−reduction process, and glutathione derivative biosynthetic process; SC7 were involved in viral transcription and translational initiation; SC8 were involved in spermatogenesis and sperm capacitation. The above analysis indicated that the functions of 8 Sertoli cell subtypes and 12 germ cell subtypes were closely related.</p><p>To further verify that Sertoli cell subtypes have &quot;stage specificity&quot; for each stage of sperm development, we firstly performed HE staining using testicular tissues from OA3-P6, NOA4-P7 and NOA5-P8 samples. The results showed that the OA3-P6 group showed some sperm, with reduced spermatogenesis, thickened basement membranes, and a high number of sertoli cells without spermatogenic cells. The NOA4-P7 group had no sperm initially, but a few malformed sperm were observed after sampling, leading to the removal of affected seminiferous tubules. The NOA5-P8 group showed no sperm in situ (Figure 7A). Immunofluorescence staining in Figure 7B was performed using these tissues for validation. ASB9 (SSC2) was primarily expressed in a wreath-like pattern around the basement membrane of testicular tissue, particularly in the OA group, while ASB9 was barely detectable in the NOA group. SOX2 (SC2) was scattered around SSC2 (ASB9), with nuclear staining, while TF (SC1) expression was not prominent. In NOA patients, SPATS1 (SC3) expression was significantly reduced. C9orf57 (Pa) showed nuclear expression in testicular tissues, primarily extending along the basement membrane toward the spermatogenic center, and was positioned closer to the center than DDX4, suggesting its involvement in germ cell development or differentiation. BEND4, identified as a marker fo SC5, showed a developmental trajectory from the basement membrane toward the spermatogenic center. ST3GAL4 was expressed in the nucleus, forming a circular pattern around the basement membrane, similar to A2M (SSC1), though A2M was more concentrated around the outer edge of the basement membrane, creating a more distinct wreath-like arrangement. In cases of impaired spermatogenesis, this arrangement becomes disorganized and loses its original structure. SMCP (SC6) was concentrated in the midpiece region of the bright blue sperm cell tail. In the OA group, SSC1 (A2M) was sparsely arranged in a rosette pattern around the basement membrane, but in the NOA group, it appeared more scattered. SSC2 (ASB9) expression was not prominent. BST2 (SC7) was a transmembrane protein primarily localized on the cell membrane. In the OA group, A2M (SSC1) was distinctly arranged in a wreath-like pattern around the basement membrane, with expression levels significantly higher than ASB9 (SSC2). TSSK6 (SPT3) was primarily expressed in OA3-P6, while CCDC62 (SC8) was more abundantly expressed in NOA4-P7, with ASB9 (SCC2) showing minimal expression. Taken together, germ cells of a particular stage tended to co-localize with Sertoli cells of the corresponding stages. Germ cells and sertoli cells at each differentiation stage were functionally heterogeneous and stage-specific (Figure 8). This suggests that each stage of sperm development requires the assistance of sertoli cells to complete the corresponding stage of sperm development.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors revealed 11 germ cell subtypes and 8 Sertoli cell subtypes through single-cell analysis of two OA patients and three NOA patients. And found that the Sertoli cell SC3 subtype (marked by SPATS1) plays an important role in spermatogenesis. It also suggests that Notch1/2/3 signaling and integrins are involved in germ cell-Stotoli cell interactions. This is an interesting and useful article that at least gives us a comprehensive understanding of human spermatogenesis. It provides a powerful tool for further research on NOA. However, there are still some issues and questions that need to be addressed.</p><p>(1) How to collect testicular tissue, please explain in detail. Extract which part of testicular tissue.

The process is as follows: Testicular tissues were obtained from two OA patients (OA1-P1 and OA2-P2) and three NOA patients (NOA1-P3, NOA2-P4, NOA3-P5) using micro-dissection of testicular sperm extraction separately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Whether the tissues of these patients are extracted simultaneously or separately, separated into single cells, and stored, and then single cell analysis is performed simultaneously.

The staining patterns of SOX9 (green) and SOX9 (red) are also different. (SOX9 (red) appears as dots, while the background for SOX9 (green) is too dark to tell whether its staining is also in the form of dots.) In summary, increasing the clarity of the staining makes it more convincing. Alternatively, use high magnification to display these results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments.
