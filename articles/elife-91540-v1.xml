Almost all the filtered blood glucose is reabsorbed by the kidneys. Loss of glucose in urine (glycosuria) is offset by an increase in endogenous glucose production to maintain normal energy supply in the body. How the body senses this glucose loss and consequently enhances glucose production is unclear. Using renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> (also known as <italic>Glut2</italic>) knockout mice, we demonstrate that elevated glycosuria activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn drives endogenous glucose production. This phenotype was attenuated by selective afferent renal denervation, indicating the involvement of the afferent nerves in promoting the compensatory increase in glucose production. In addition, through plasma proteomics analyses we observed that acute phase proteins - which are usually involved in the body’s defense mechanisms against a threat – were the top candidates which were either upregulated or downregulated in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> KO mice. Overall, afferent renal nerves contribute to promoting endogenous glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria and loss of glucose in urine is sensed as a biological threat in mice. These findings may be useful in improving the efficiency of drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors that are intended to treat hyperglycemia by enhancing glycosuria but are met with a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>diabetes</kwd><kwd>kidneys</kwd><kwd>hypothalamus</kwd><kwd>glycosuria</kwd><kwd>GLUT2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK124619</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chhabra</surname><given-names>Kavaljit H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA258261</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>Rachel J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL071158</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brookes</surname><given-names>Paul S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting the interaction between the kidneys and brain may increase the efficiency of SGLT2 inhibitors to better manage type 2 diabetes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The kidneys help conserve energy by reabsorbing nutrients and preventing their loss in urine. Almost all the filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the kidneys. The renal threshold for glucose reabsorption in humans is 180 mg/dl and in rodents is about 400 mg/dl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Noonan and Banks, 2000</xref>). In conditions such as overt hyperglycemia (beyond the renal glucose threshold), genetic loss of glucose transporters like GLUT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sakamoto et al., 2000</xref>) or SGLT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kleta et al., 2004</xref>), and/or renal dysfunction, glucose is excreted in the urine. Enhancing glycosuria, through SGLT2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Rossetti et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Oku et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Han et al., 2008</xref>), is now used to reduce blood glucose levels in humans with diabetes. However, the glucose loss is offset by a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production, consequently compromising the efficacy of this strategy in the treatment of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Solis-Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). We recently produced renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> (also known as <italic>Glut2</italic>) knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref>), which show massive glycosuria and are protected from diabetes and diet-induced obesity. Despite the loss of glucose in the urine, renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice maintain normal fasting blood glucose levels. Collectively, these observations indicate the presence of a fundamental mechanism involved in sensing glucose loss and triggering a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production in rodents and humans. This mechanism is also aligned with the established survival strategies that reduce utilization and increase the production of glucose (energy) during a flight or fight response against a threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Surwit et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Marik and Bellomo, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Understanding how the kidney senses glucose loss and consequently activates compensatory pathways to make up for this loss will enhance our knowledge about integrative mechanisms that regulate glucose homeostasis. Answering such research questions may also be useful in medicine to increase efficiency of drugs such as SGLT2 inhibitors that are used to reduce blood glucose levels in diabetes by elevating glycosuria.</p><p>In this study, we used renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice to identify mechanisms involved in activating a compensatory increase in glucose production in response to glucose loss in urine. We determined whether neural connections between the kidneys and the hypothalamus can explain the compensatory increase in glucose production. In addition, we performed plasma proteomics analyses to identify secreted proteins or endocrine factors that may provide insights into pathways involved in conserving energy and producing endogenous glucose in response to elevated glycosuria in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased hepatic and renal glucose production in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice</title><p>Renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice exhibit normal fasting blood glucose levels despite massive glycosuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref>). This observation suggests a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production, similar to that observed in humans following SGLT2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Solis-Herrera et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Daniele et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we measured hepatic and renal glucose production in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout and their littermate control mice. We observed that both tissues contribute to the compensatory increase in glucose production in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a–c</xref>). This was accompanied by a decrease in hepatic glucose 6-phosphate, glucose 1-phosphate, and fructose 6-phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>), suggesting a decline in glucose metabolism in favor of increasing glucose production.

Afferent denervation was confirmed by measuring renal pelvic CGRP (pg/mg protein) at the end of this study (Sham: 86.3±6.4 (control mice), 93.7±8.2 (renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice); Capsaicin: 4.7±0.06 (control mice), 6.4±0.7 (renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice), using ELISA kit, Cayman Chemical, 589001). Mice were allowed to recover for a week before we fasted them to measure their blood glucose levels. Because reinnervation may occur following the denervation, we completed this study within 14 days after the denervation procedure. We observed that fasting and fed (random) blood glucose levels were about 50% decreased in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice compared to their control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>) after the afferent renal denervation. In addition, the denervation reversed the activation of the HPA axis in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c and d</xref>). Fasting plasma insulin levels were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>) after the denervation. These observations suggest that renal nerves partly contribute to the compensatory increase in glucose production in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice.

These findings suggest that neuroendocrine mechanisms independent of changes in renal nerve activity may be involved in increasing glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice.

Altogether, the results indicate that afferent renal nerves partly contribute to the compensatory increase in glucose production to make up for glucose loss in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice. These findings support the data from humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Daniele et al., 2020</xref>) that renal nerves may be involved in mediating a compensatory increase in glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria by SGLT2 inhibition. In addition, the findings are aligned with the previous studies in rodents demonstrating the significance of renal nerves in regulating systemic glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chhabra et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jiman et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Changes in circulating acute phase proteins in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice</title><p>To further investigate underlying mechanisms compensating for glucose loss in <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice, we measured levels of secreted proteins that may explain the increase in endogenous glucose production. We performed 2D-DIGE followed by proteomic analyses with plasma samples collected from renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice and their littermate controls. We observed that acute-phase proteins like mannose-binding lectin, albumin, haptoglobin, and ferritin were either upregulated or downregulated in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Usually, levels of these proteins are changed in response to threat, infection, and/or injury to activate the body’s defense systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gabay and Kushner, 1999</xref>). Similarly, major urinary proteins (MUP) like MUP18, which belong to the lipocalin protein family, were elevated in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These proteins are involved in regulating inter-organ chemical signaling, pheromonal communication, and energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhou and Rui, 2010</xref>). We also observed that secreted glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3) was the most downregulated protein in plasma in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

Higher urine volume (polyuria) observed in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice may contribute to an increase in glucose production to some extent, however, that contribution would likely be minor based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hall et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Perry et al., 2019</xref>) about the role of diuretics (which increase urine volume) in glucose production. Additional research is necessary to determine the role of the altered secretory proteins – that were identified through the plasma proteomics analyses – in triggering an increase in glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria. It is possible that afferent renal denervation in the present study attenuated only hepatic glucose production through the hypothalamus axis without affecting the compensatory increase in renal (which is the local site of denervation in this study) glucose production. If validated, this would explain why the afferent denervation did not completely block the compensatory glucose production in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice. Although we didn’t observe sex differences in the phenotype related to glucose homeostasis in renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref>), some of the responses to elevated glycosuria reported here may be different between male and female mice.</p><p>In summary, we report that a kidney-hypothalamus axis contributes to triggering a compensatory increase in endogenous glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria in mice. Glucose loss in urine appears to be sensed as a biological threat and therefore activates the body’s defense systems including some of the acute phase proteins. These findings may explain why SGLT2 inhibitors do not achieve their full potential in lowering blood glucose levels during the treatment of diabetes mellitus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mouse husbandry</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Rochester (protocol number 2018–010), Yale University (protocol number 2019–20290), or University of Iowa (protocol number 1101549), and were performed according to the US Public Health Service guidelines for the humane care and use of experimental animals. Mice were housed in ventilated cages under controlled temperature (~23 °C) and photoperiod (12 hr light/dark cycle, lights on from 06:00 hr to 18:00 hr or 07:00 hr to 19:00 hr at Yale) conditions with free access to Hydropac water (Lab Products, USA) and regular laboratory chow (5010, LabDiet, USA or Global 2018, Harlan Teklad, USA). Although we included all male or all female mice in a given experiment here, we did not repeat all the experiments in both sexes because our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref> demonstrated that male and female renal <italic>Slc2a2</italic> knockout mice (which were produced in our laboratory as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Souza Cordeiro et al., 2022</xref>) exhibited a similar phenotype compared to their corresponding control groups in the context of glucose homeostasis.

Glucose production from pyruvate was directly measured in vivo in the liver and kidney (both freeze-clamped in situ within 30 s of euthanasia) using mass isotopomer distribution analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Qing et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, we measured the whole-body ratio of pyruvate carboxylase flux to total glucose production by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry. We compared the whole-body gluconeogenesis from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and all substrates upstream of PEP (i.e. pyruvate, lactate, amino acids) to that measured locally in the liver and kidney. As the whole-body fraction of gluconeogenesis from PEP represents an integrated contribution of both liver and kidney to whole-body glucose production from PEP, this allowed us to calculate the fractional contribution of the kidney to whole-body glucose production.</p><p>For measuring liver metabolites involved in glycolysis, the flash-frozen liver was homogenized to extract metabolites in 80% methanol, which was evaporated under liquid nitrogen followed by resuspension of metabolites in 50% methanol. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was performed with reverse-phase LC on a Synergi Fusion-RP column (Phenomenex, Torrence CA) at 35 °C. Samples were analyzed by single reaction monitoring on a Thermo Quantum triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Metabolites were identified against a library of validated standards based on retention time, intact mass, collision energy, and fragment masses. Data were collected and analyzed using Thermo XCaliber 4.0 software. Post-hoc data was analyzed using Metaboanalyst 5.0. Data were median-normalized (normalized to the median peak area per sample, which correlated well with the total protein concentration). 73 metabolites were measured, out of which nine were significantly (p&lt;0.05) different (1.5 fold-change thresholds, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Measurement of genes and hormones involved in regulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis</title><p>We measured the levels of <italic>Crh</italic> mRNA in the mouse paraventricular hypothalamus using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (<italic>Crh</italic> probe, 316091, ACD) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

For measuring adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone, we collected mouse tail blood at 10:00 hr on the day of measurements by nicking the tip of the tail with a sterile razor blade and then using heparinized capillary tubes (22–362566, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For measuring plasma insulin, mice were fasted for 6 hr (08:00–14:00 hr) before collecting their tail blood. The blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 × g and 4 °C. Plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ab263880, Abcam), corticosterone (80556, Crystal Chem), and insulin (90080, Crystal Chem) were measured using ELISA per the manufacturers’ instructions. The plasma was diluted 5 x before performing these assays and the results were adjusted according to the dilution factor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Ablation of afferent renal nerve</title><p>After anesthetizing mice using 1–5% isoflurane, a dorsal midline incision was made to access both the kidneys. We selectively ablated afferent renal nerves using capsaicin. Gauze, soaked in capsaicin (35 mM in 10% ethanol and 90% saline solution), was wrapped around the renal blood vessels for 15 min. Other surrounding tissues were covered with parafilm to avoid their exposure to capsaicin. After the surgery, muscle layers and skin were closed with nylon sutures. This procedure ablates afferent renal nerves without affecting the blood vessels or efferent renal nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Foss et al., 2015</xref>).

After anesthesia, the nerve innervating the left kidney was identified, dissected free, and placed on a bipolar 36-gauge platinum-iridium electrode (A-M Systems; Carlsborg, WA). The electrode was connected to a high-impedance probe (HIP-511; Grass Instruments Co., Quincy, MA), and the nerve signal was amplified 10<sup>5</sup> times with a Grass P5 AC pre-amplifier and filtered at low and high-frequency cutoffs of 100 Hz and 1000 Hz, respectively. This nerve signal was directed to a speaker system and to an oscilloscope (54501 A, Hewlett–Packard Co., Palo Alto, CA) for auditory and visual monitoring of the nerve activity. The signal was then directed to a resetting voltage integrator (B600C, University of Iowa Bioengineering) that sums the total voltage output in units of 1 V × s before resetting to zero and counting the number of spikes per second. The final neurograms were continuously routed to a MacLab analogue–digital converter (8 S, AD Instruments Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia) for permanent recording and data analysis on a Macintosh computer. Renal sympathetic nerve activity was measured for 30 min. To measure the afferent renal nerve activity, the nerve was cut distally and the signal was recorded for 30 min. Nerve activity was corrected for post-mortem background activity to eliminate background electrical noise in the measurements. At the end of the SNA recording, each mouse was euthanized with an overdose of anesthetic. Any remaining nerve activity after death was considered as background noise and subtracted from the SNA measurements.</p><p>In addition to the nerve activity, arterial pressure and heart rate were measured using a tapered MRE-040 tubing inserted into the left carotid artery and the other end connected to a transducer (BP-100; iWorks System, Inc, Dover, NH) that led to an ETH-250 Bridge/Bio Amplifier (CB Sciences; Milford, MA).

Most concerns relate to the interpretation of this study's findings. The authors state that loss of glucose in urine is sensed as a biological threat based on the HPA axis activation seen in this mouse model. This interpretation is understandable but speculative. Importantly, whether stress hormones mediate the increase in endogenous glucose production in this model and in humans with altered glucose transporter function remains to be demonstrated conclusively. For example, the paper found several other circulating and local factors that could be causal. This model is also unable to shed light on how elevated stress hormones might interact with insulin resistance, which is known to increase endogenous glucose production. That issue is of substantial clinical relevance for patients with T2D and metabolic disease. Finally, how these findings can contribute to improving the efficiency of drugs like SGLT2 inhibitors remains to be seen.</p></disp-quote><p>- We agree with the reviewer’s overall assessment of this manuscript.</p><p>- Confirming the contribution of each secreted protein shown in Fig. 4, whose levels were changed between the two groups of mice, toward causing a compensatory increase in glucose production in response to elevated glycosuria is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors previously generated renal Glut2 knockout mice, which have high levels of glycosuria but normal fasting glucose. They use this as an opportunity to investigate how compensatory mechanisms are engaged in response to glycosuria. They show that renal and hepatic glucose production, but not metabolism, is elevated in renal Glut2 male mice. They show that renal Glut2 male mice have elevated Crh mRNA in the hypothalamus, and elevated plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone. They also show that temporary denervation of renal nerves leads to a decrease in fasting and fed blood glucose levels in female renal Glut2 mice, but not control mice. Finally, they perform plasma proteomics in male mice to identify plasma proteins that are changed (up or down) between the knockouts and controls.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The question that is trying to be addressed is clinically important: enhancing glycosuria is a current treatment for diabetes, but is limited in efficacy because of compensatory increases in glucose production.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Although I appreciate that the initial characterization of the mice in another publication showed that both males and females have glycosuria, this does not mean that both sexes have the same mechanisms giving rise to glycosuria. There are many examples of sex differences in HPA activation in response to threat, for example. There is an unfounded assumption here that males and females have the same underlying mechanisms of glycosuria that undermines the significance of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>- We agree with the reviewer that although we didn’t observe sex differences in renal Glut2 KO mice in the context of glucose homeostasis, their response (or mechanisms) to elevated glycosuria in enhancing compensatory glucose production may be different between the sexes. Therefore, we have included this limitation in discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors state that they induced the Glut2 knockout with taxomifen as in their previous publication. The methods of that publication indicate that all experiments were completed within 14 days of inducing the Glut2 knockout. This means that the last dose of tamoxifen was delivered 14 days prior to the experimental endpoint of each experiment. This seems like an important experimental constraint that should be discussed in this manuscript. Is the glycosuria that follows Glut2 knockout only a temporary change? If so, then the long-term change in glycosuria that follows SGLT2 inhibition in humans might not be best modelled by this knockout. Please specify when the surgeries to implant a jugular catheter or ablate the renal nerves performed relative to the Glut2 knockout in the Methods.</p></disp-quote><p>- The reviewer’s statement ‘The methods of that publication indicate that all experiments were completed within 14 days of inducing the Glut2 knockout’ is incorrect. In the referred publication, we had explicitly mentioned in methods, ‘All of the experiments, except those using a diet-induced obesity mouse model or noted otherwise, were completed within 14 days of inducing the Glut2 deficiency.’ Please see figures 5h-l and 6 in the cited publication, which demonstrate that all the experiments were not completed within 14 days of inducing renal Glut2 deficiency. Per the reviewer’s advice, in the present manuscript we have include the timeline (which in some cases is 4 months beyond inducing glycosuria) in all the figure legends. In addition, for a separate project (which is unpublished) we have measured glycosuria up to 1 year after inducing renal Glut2 deficiency. Therefore, the glycosuria observed in the renal Glut2 KO mice is not temporary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I am still unclear what group was used for controls. Are these wild-type mice who receive tamoxifen? Are they KspCadCreERT2;Glut2loxP/loxP mice who do not receive tamoxifen? This is important and needs to be specified.</p></disp-quote><p>- In our previous response to the reviewer, we had already mentioned which control group was used in this study. Please see our response to the second reviewer’s point 3. As mentioned to the reviewer, we had used Glut2loxp/loxp mice as the control group, which is also described multiple times in the figure legends of our previous paper that reported the phenotype of renal Glut2 KO mice. Per the reviewer’s advice, we have provided the information again in a revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors should report some additional control measures for the renal denervation that could also impact blood glucose and perhaps some of their other measures. The control measures, which one would like to see unimpacted by renal denervation, include body weights, food consumption and water intake, and glycosuria itself.</p></disp-quote><p>- Please also see fig. 3 in the present manuscript that demonstrates renal afferent denervation doesn’t influence baseline blood glucose or plasma insulin levels. We have now also mentioned in the text that the denervation doesn’t affect food intake or bodyweight.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The graphical abstract shows a link between the hypothalamus and the liver that is completely unsupported by any of the current findings. That arrow should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>- Because we observed an increase in hepatic glucose production in renal Glut2 KO mice (Fig. 1) - which was reduced by 50% after selective afferent renal denervation (Fig. 3) - in the graphical abstract we are suggesting a neural connection between the kidney-brain-liver or an endocrine factor(s) to account for these changes in blood glucose levels as also described in the discussion section. We can include a question mark ‘?’ in the graphical abstract to show that further studies are need to validate these proposed mechanisms; however, we cannot just remove the arrow as advised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Though the authors have toned down their language implying a causal link between the HPA measures and compensatory elevation of blood glucose in the face of glycosuria, the title still implies this causal link. It is still the case that their data do not support causation. There are many potential ways to establish a causal link but those experiments are not performed here. The renal afferents are correlated with Crh content of the PVN, but nothing has been done to show that the Crh content is important for elevating blood glucose. In light of this, the title should be toned down. Perhaps something like &quot;Renal nerves maintain blood glucose production and elevated HPA activity in response to glycosuria&quot;. The link between HPA and glucose is not shown in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>- We request the reviewer to take a look at figure 1, showing an increase in glucose production in renal Glut2 KO mice and figure 3, which demonstrates that an afferent renal denervation reduces blood glucose levels by 50%. The afferent renal denervation (ablation of afferent renal nerves) does reduce blood glucose levels in renal Glut2 KO mice. Therefore, the use of the word ‘promote’ in the title is accurate and appropriate to reflect the role of the afferent renal nerves in contributing to about 50% increase in blood glucose levels in renal Glut2 KO mice.</p><p>- Regarding the reviewer's comment on changes in Crh gene expression, please look at figure 3. Ablation of renal afferent nerves decreases hypothalamic Crh gene expression and other mediators of the HPA axis by 50%. Therefore, the afferent renal nerves do contribute to regulating blood glucose levels, at least in part, by the HPA axis (which is widely known to change blood glucose levels). The use of words such as ‘required’ or ‘necessary’ in the title may have indicated causal role or could have been misleading here; therefore, we have purposely used ‘promote’ in the title to accurately reflect the findings of this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have only minor text corrections to add:</p><p>- line 223 &quot;A list&quot;</p><p>- line 253 &quot;independent&quot;</p><p>- line 271 &quot;the body's&quot;</p><p>- line 304 &quot;do not&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have corrected these errors in a revised version of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Please report the dilutions used, if any, for the ELISAs. If the samples were run neat, please report this. Many manufacturer's instructions say that the user must determine the correct dilution to use for the samples collected. Also, sometimes when small blood volumes are collected, samples must be diluted to achieve the minimum volume collected for the assay. It is not sufficient to indicate that a reader refers to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></disp-quote><p>- Per the reviewer’s advice, we have included the dilutions used for each assay in the methods.</p></body></sub-article></article>
