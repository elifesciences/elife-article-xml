hemispheres. Inspired by clinical observations, we ask if this bilateral representation differs for the left and right hemispheres. Electrocorticography was recorded in human participants during an instructed-delay reaching task, with movements produced with either the contralateral or ipsilateral arm. Using a cross-validated kinematic encoding model, we found stronger bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere, an effect that was present during preparation and was amplified during execution. Consistent with this asymmetry, we also observed better across-arm generalization in the left hemisphere, indicating similar neural representations for right and left arm movements. Notably, these left hemisphere electrodes were centered over premotor and parietal regions. The more extensive bilateral encoding in the left hemisphere adds a new perspective to the pervasive neuropsychological finding that the left hemisphere plays a dominant role in praxis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is split into two hemispheres, each playing the leading role in coordinating movement for the opposite side of the body: lesions on the left hemisphere therefore often result in difficulties moving the right arm or leg, and vice versa. In fact, very few anatomical connections exist between a given hemisphere and the body parts on the same (or ‘ipsilateral’) side. Yet, movements produced with only one limb still engage both sides of the brain, with the hemisphere which does not control the action production, still encoding the direction and speed of the movement. Previous evidence also indicate that the two hemispheres may not have equal roles when coordinating ipsilateral movements.</p><p>Merrick et al. aimed to shed light on these processes; to do so, they measured electrical activity from the surface of the brain of six patients as they moved their arms to reach a screen. The results revealed that, while the right hemisphere only encoded information about the opposite arm, the left hemisphere contained information about both arms. Finer analyses showed that, for both hemispheres, moving the opposite arm was strongly associated with activity in the primary motor cortex, a region which helps to execute movements. However, in the left hemisphere, movements from the ipsilateral arm were related to activity in brain areas involved in planning and integrating different types of sensory information.</p><p>These findings contribute to a better understanding of how the motor system works, which could ultimately help with the development of brain-machine interfaces for patients who need a neuroprosthetic limb.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>lateralization</kwd><kwd>left hemisphere</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>praxis</kwd><kwd>ipsilateral</kwd><kwd>electrocorticography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS097480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thomas Knight</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><name><surname>Ivry</surname><given-names>Richard B</given-names></name><name><surname>Carmena</surname><given-names>Jose</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An electrode-wise encoding model based on physiological recordings from the cortical surface revealed a striking hemispheric asymmetry where the encoding of ipsilateral movement was stronger in the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A primary tenet of neurology is the contralateral organization of movement. The vast majority of the fibers from the corticospinal tract cross to the opposite side of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nyberg-Hansen and Rinvik, 1963</xref>) and functionally, hemiparesis resulting from cortical stroke is manifest on the contralateral side of the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourbonnais and Vanden Noven, 1989</xref>). Although direct control of arm movements is primarily mediated through contralateral projections, unimanual arm movements elicit bilateral activity in the primary motor cortex (M1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babiloni et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghacibeh et al., 2007</xref>), indicating that neural activity in the ipsilateral hemisphere contains information relevant to ongoing movement. Correspondingly, kinematic and movement parameters of the ipsilateral limb can be decoded from ipsilateral hemisphere intracortical recordings in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames and Churchland, 2019</xref>) and from electrocorticography (ECoG) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bundy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wisneski et al., 2008</xref>). Ipsilateral signals represent an intriguing source of neural activity, both for understanding how activity across the two hemispheres results in coordinated movement and because this information might be exploited for rehabilitative purposes.</p><p>While it is established that information about unimanual movements is contained within the ipsilateral hemisphere, there remains considerable debate about what this signal represents. Previous studies have centered on the question of whether ipsilateral representations overlap or are independent of contralateral representations, leading to mixed results. Consistent with the overlap hypothesis, neural activity for the contralateral and ipsilateral limb movements shows several similarities, including shared target tuning preferences and the ability to cross predict kinematic features from a model trained on the opposite arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bundy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Steinberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Willett et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with the independence hypothesis, intracortical recordings in monkeys have revealed that the lower dimensional representations of the two arms lie in orthogonal subspaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames and Churchland, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heming et al., 2019</xref>). These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. For example, the degree of overlap or independence may depend on the gesture type (e.g., overlapping representations for grasping but not arm movement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Downey et al., 2020</xref>), or brain region (e.g., premotor cortex displays stronger preservation of tuning preferences across the two arms than primary motor cortex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>One factor that has received little attention in this literature is the recording hemisphere. This is surprising given the marked asymmetries between the two hemispheres in terms of praxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corballis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rothi et al., 1997</xref>). Tracing back to the early 20th century, marked hemispheric asymmetries have been defined by the behavioral deficits observed following unilateral brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaefer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liepmann, 1908</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>). Apraxia, an impairment in the production of coordinated, meaningful movement in the absence of muscle recruitment deficits, is much more common after left compared to right hemisphere insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haaland et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>). Moreover, left hemisphere stroke will frequently result in apraxic symptoms for gestures produced with either hand, as well as impairments in action comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>). Hemispheric asymmetries are also evident in neuroimaging activation patterns in healthy participants, with the left hemisphere having stronger activation during ipsilateral movement than the right hemisphere, especially with increasing task difficulty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chettouf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verstynen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verstynen and Ivry, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schäfer et al., 2012</xref>). These patterns raise the possibility that the ipsilateral cortical representation differs between the left and right hemispheres.</p><p>In the present study, we use intracranial recordings from the cortical surface (ECoG) to examine the degree of cortical overlap for ipsilateral and contralateral upper limb movement in the left and right hemispheres. The data were collected from six patients, three with left hemisphere implants and three with right hemisphere implants, while they engaged in an instructed-delay reaching task. We focus on predicting the temporal dynamics of high-frequency activity (HFA; 70–200 Hz), a surrogate for infragranular single-unit activity and supragranular dendritic potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leszczyński et al., 2020</xref>), which tracks local activation of the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muthukumaraswamy, 2010</xref>). Going beyond previous studies that use decoding models which combine multiple neural features from multiple electrodes to predict kinematics, we employed an encoding model which uses kinematic features to predict neural activity for each electrode, allowing us to retain the high spatial and temporal resolution of the ECoG signal. This approach allows us to create high-resolution topographic maps depicting encoding strength on the surface of the cortex for movements produced with the contralateral and ipsilateral arms. This is preferable to projecting the weights obtained from decoding models since these models have difficulty disambiguating between informative and uninformative electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2019</xref>). Moreover, our approach provides a way to map kinematics to neural activity in a time-resolved manner (rather than as single weights), allowing us to identify time ranges of representational overlap and divergence across the two arms for each electrode.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavior</title><p>We used a delayed response, out-and-back reaching task. On each trial, a cue indicating the target location was presented on a touchscreen followed, after a short delay, by an imperative signal. Participants were instructed to prepare to move to the target during the delay period. The participant was free to move at their own pace, with the instructions emphasizing that the participant should focus on touching the screen near the target and then returning to the start position.

The movements had roughly, bell-shaped velocity profiles for the outbound and the inbound segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>) and the outbound reaches were, on average, faster than inbound reaches.

The temporal profile of HFA is similar for electrodes that generalize well, showing a single peak in the movement phase. A cluster-based permutation test identified two periods where the HFA amplitude differed for contralateral and ipsilateral reaches, one during instruction and one well into the movement period. In contrast, the temporal profiles are radically different for those that generalize poorly. The lack of correspondence likely arises, at least in part, because of the weak modulation for these electrodes during ipsilateral reaches.</p><p>It is possible that similarity in temporal structure is obscured in the preceding analysis by the differences in HFA amplitude for the electrodes that showed poor generalization. To control for this, we standardized the time series data by dividing each sample by the overall standard deviation (insets: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Using the standardized traces, we calculated the linear correlation coefficient between the contralateral and ipsilateral traces, separately for instruction and movement. As expected, electrodes that generalized well across arms showed strong across-arm correlations for both task phases (inset: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left). In contrast, for electrodes that generalize poorly across arms, the correlation between arms was negative during instruction and then rose to a moderate positive correlation during movement (inset: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right). Thus, the poor generalization of these electrodes is due in part to the temporal divergence of the two arms during instruction, where the ipsilateral trace becomes inhibited compared to the contralateral trace. Interestingly, although the ipsilateral trace remains inhibited during movement, the temporal structure between the two arms reemerges.</p><p>We next examined the relationship between generalization, hemisphere and spatial position on the cortical surface. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, electrodes that generalize well were predominantly found in the left hemisphere (proportion of electrodes that generalize across patients: L1 = 22%, L2 = 39%, L3 = 29%, R1 = 0%, R2 = 5%, R3 = 4%; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 48813, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, electrodes showing poor generalization were observed in both hemispheres (proportion of electrodes that generalize poorly: L1 = 21%, L2 = 5%, L3 = 6%, R1 = 14%, R2 = 15%, R3 = 37%; <italic>χ</italic><sup>2</sup>(2) = 0.400, p = 0.818). Moreover, in both hemispheres, electrodes showing poor generalization were clustered near the dorsal portion of the central sulcus, a region corresponding to the arm area of motor cortex. Electrodes showing strong generalization (mostly limited to the left hemisphere) tended to be in dorsal and ventral premotor cortices (PMd and PMv), along with a few in superior parietal cortex. This pattern was also observed when we analyzed all electrodes, rather than restrict the analysis to those showing extreme values. Here we used a continuous measure, correlating the amount of across-arm generalization with the distance (absolute value) from the dorsal aspect of the central sulcus. The correlation was significant in the left hemisphere [<italic>r</italic><sub>left</sub> = 0.46, p<sub>left</sub> &lt; 0.001] but did not reach significance in the right hemisphere, although the trend was in the same direction [<italic>r</italic><sub>right</sub> = 0.22, p<sub>right</sub> = 0.068; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Target modulation and tuning similarity across arms</title><p>To examine the extent of target modulation for the contralateral and ipsilateral arms, we calculated the modulation depth (MD) of each electrode during the instruction and movement phases. The modulation index reflects the amount of variability in the signal captured by target tuning (or target specificity): A modulation index of 0.1 means 10% of the variance is captured by the difference between the response to the four target locations. The modulation values overall were relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, it should be noted that the reaches were all within the frontoparallel plane which comprise a considerably smaller range of movement compared to studies that use a center-out reaching task. For both electrode types (showing good or poor across-arm generalization), there was a main effect of arm, with ipsilateral modulation lower than contralateral modulation [permutation test: p<sub>Generalize_well</sub> <italic>&lt;</italic> 0.001; p<sub>Generalize_poorly</sub> &lt; 0.005]. Both subgroups of electrodes also displayed a main effect of task phase, with the depth of modulation greater during the movement phase compared to the instruction phase [permutation test: p<sub>Generalize_well</sub> <italic>&lt;</italic> 0.001; p<sub>Generalize_poorly</sub> &lt; 0.005]. No significant interactions were found for either group.</p><p>We also examined the representational overlap between the two arms in terms of their tuning profiles. We computed a tuning similarity index (SI), defined as the sum of squared errors (SSEs) for average HFA predictions to the same target between the contralateral and ipsilateral arms. An SI of 1 would correspond to identical tuning preferences for the arms whereas an SI of 0 would indicate completely disparate tuning preferences. The similarity data were analyzed with a mixed design permutation test, including the factors task phase and electrode type (good vs. poor generalizers). Electrodes that generalize well across the two arms (predominately found in the left hemisphere) showed more overlap of tuning preferences compared to electrodes that generalized poorly [main effect of generalizability: p &lt; 0.001]. While there was no effect of phase [p &gt; 0.70], the interaction was significant [p &lt; 0.005], with electrode types showing more comparable tuning similarity during instruction and tuning similarity diverging during movement. Simple effects analysis revealed that for electrodes that generalize poorly, tuning similarity was higher during the instruction phase compared to the movement phase [permutation test: p &lt; 0.001]. In contrast, for electrodes that generalize well, tuning similarity was higher during movement compared to instruction [permutation test: p &lt; 0.001].

This is in contrast with the smaller contribution of theta and phi, features which provide information about movement direction (relative contribution: contra = 32%, ipsi = 37%). This result is similar to that observed in single-unit and population activity recorded in premotor and motor cortex of nonhuman primates. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref> observed that the largest response component was associated with movement timing/initiation rather than features such as movement direction. Similarly, this direction-independent signal occurs twice during sequential movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimnik and Churchland, 2021</xref>); in our data, speed has two prominent peaks, one occurring before the reach and the second occurring before the return movement. We were surprised to see the markedly differential weighting for the vertical (theta) and horizontal (phi) directional features. We assume this is likely idiosyncratic to the layout of our targets.</p><p>We also examined the correspondence between HFA and the kinematic features as a function of whether electrodes generalize well or poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For electrodes that generalize well, position most closely corresponds to HFA for both contralateral and ipsilateral movements. The maximum cross-correlation for contralateral and ipsilateral movements was found at a lag of 200 and 150 ms, respectively, with HFA leading hand position. For electrodes that generalize poorly, the kinematic feature that most closely corresponds to HFA for both contralateral and ipsilateral movements is speed. For these electrodes, the maximum cross-correlation for contralateral and ipsilateral movements were both at a lag of 200 ms, with HFA again leading the kinematic feature. Although the ipsilateral HFA signals are considerably lower in amplitude, the pattern between HFA and speed is quite similar for both ipsilateral and contralateral movements. The fact that the neural activity from electrodes that generalize poorly (primarily located over M1) correlates well with speed provides additional evidence that a strong component of the HFA ECoG signal is related to timing and movement initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaufman et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Relationship of kinematic features to high-frequency activity (HFA) for electrodes that generalize well or poorly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HFA overlaid with kinematics.

Single-unit activity and local field potentials obtained from motor cortex in nonhuman primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames and Churchland, 2019</xref>), as well as ECoG activity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bundy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ganguly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wisneski et al., 2008</xref>) can be decoded to predict complex kinematic variables and EMG activity during arm movements of the ipsilateral arm.</p><p>Here, we report the results from ECoG data obtained from six patients, three with left hemisphere implants and three with right hemisphere implants, with each patient having at least 17 predictive electrodes. To examine how kinematic features are represented in each hemisphere, we built an electrode-wise encoding model. Such models allow prediction of the full time series for each electrode thus retaining the high spatial and temporal resolution of the intracranial signal. From these metrics we could compare kinematic encoding and across-arm generalization between the two hemispheres as well as the spatial distribution of the information-carrying electrodes within each hemisphere.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Hemispheric asymmetry in movement encoding</title><p>We observed a striking asymmetry between the two hemispheres for ipsilateral movement encoding. While contralateral movements were encoded similarly across the two hemispheres, ipsilateral encoding was much stronger in the left hemisphere, an effect that was especially pronounced during movement execution. In addition, there was greater overlap between the representation of contralateral and ipsilateral movement in the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere.</p><p>The bilateral encoding effect size is quite substantial (Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> = 1.34), exceeding the conventional criterion for a large effect (<italic>d</italic> = 0.80). Given the size of the hemispheric asymmetry effect, it is surprising that this asymmetry has not been described in previous reports. This may in part reflect the smaller sample size in ECoG studies. For example, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bundy et al., 2018</xref>, three of the four patients had left hemisphere grids, leaving a hemisphere analysis dependent on the data from a single right hemisphere patient. Studies with nonhuman primates tend to ignore hemispheric differences, perhaps because these animals do not show consistent patterns of hand dominance across individuals. One exception here is a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisek et al., 2003</xref> who reported no hemispheric differences in neural recordings obtained from M1 and PMd during ipsilateral and contralateral arm reaches.</p><p>In addition to examining hemispheric differences in the encoding of unimanual movement, we also asked if kinematic features were encoded differently for contralateral and ipsilateral movements by testing across-arm generalization. We categorized electrodes as showing either good across-arm generalization (decrease of up to 20% relative to within-arm performance) or poor across-arm generalization (decrease of more than 50%). This categorization scheme revealed a striking anatomical division, with electrodes showing good across-arm generalization clustering in the left premotor and superior parietal regions and electrodes that generalized poorly clustering in left and right M1. This result does not appear to reflect a sampling bias. There are more left hemisphere electrodes compared to right hemisphere electrodes because two of the left hemisphere patients had high density grid implants. However, the electrodes in our left and right hemisphere samples were similarly distributed over premotor, sensorimotor, and parietal regions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Examining the temporal profile of electrodes that generalize poorly, we found that the divergence between the two arms occurs during instruction, with the ipsilateral trace becoming inhibited relative to the contralateral trace. TMS studies have shown reduced corticospinal excitability of the nonselected hand during movement preparation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leocani et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liepert et al., 2001</xref>), an effect that has been hypothesized to reflect inhibition from prefrontal regions to facilitate response selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duque and Ivry, 2009</xref>).</p><p>We further examined the spatial tuning of the electrodes. Target tuning in the HFA band was found for both contralateral and ipsilateral movements, although ipsilateral tuning was significantly shallower. Interestingly, electrodes that generalized well across arms had similar spatial/target tuning for each arm. This suggests that for these electrodes, ipsilateral signals are not just encoding generic movement, but encoding movement direction in a similar manner to contralateral signals. A similar overlap in tuning has been observed in single-unit recordings from PMd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisek et al., 2003</xref>) and can be inferred from the across-arm generalization decoding results reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bundy et al., 2018</xref>. In contrast, electrodes that failed to generalize, located primarily in M1 in either left or right hemisphere, exhibited disparate tuning for contralateral and ipsilateral reaches.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional implications of hemispheric asymmetries in movement encoding</title><p>By using a delayed response task, we were able to segregate activity into an instruction phase during which the participant was presented with the target location for the forthcoming movement and a movement phase, defined at the onset of the reach. With this design, we found that the encoding model could predict neural activity during the instruction phase based on the kinematics of the forthcoming reach, evidence that the participants were indeed planning the upcoming movement.</p><p>This task phase analysis also revealed robust asymmetries between the two hemispheres. There was a main effect of hemisphere, with the left hemisphere displaying stronger bilateral encoding overall compared to the right hemisphere. However, there was also an interaction: In the left hemisphere bilateral encoding was stronger during the movement phase whereas in the right hemisphere bilateral encoding was stronger during the instruction phase. Surprisingly, in the left hemisphere the contralateral bias completely disappeared during the movement phase, with both the contralateral and ipsilateral arms being encoded to the same extent. Stronger bilateral encoding during movement (compared to instruction) is surprising given the spatial distribution of electrodes that encode ipsilateral movement was primarily outside of M1, regions typically associated more with planning than execution (e.g., premotor cortices and parietal cortex).</p><p>The asymmetry observed here is in accord with the long-standing recognition of hemispheric asymmetries in praxis. Starting with the classic observations of Liepmann at the turn of the 20th century on the association of the left hemisphere and apraxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liepmann, 1908</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schaefer et al., 2007</xref>) and continuing with functional imaging studies in neurotypical populations, a large body of evidence points to a dominant role for the left hemisphere in skilled movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corballis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Przybylski and Króliczak, 2017</xref>). This asymmetry is most pronounced in tasks involving functional object use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buxbaum et al., 2006</xref>), symbolic gestures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2009</xref>), and intransitive pantomimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bohlhalter et al., 2009</xref>). While the neuropsychological and neuroimaging work have highlighted the involvement of left premotor and parietal cortex in praxis, corresponding asymmetries have also been noted in subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia, cerebellum, and thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Swinnen et al., 2010</xref>). We note that for our patient population, we are limited to regions of the brain where we have sufficient electrode coverage.</p><p>Apraxia, following left hemisphere damage can be manifest in movements produced with either limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Renzi and Lucchelli, 1988</xref>), and are usually associated with lesions that encompass premotor and parietal cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haaland et al., 2000</xref>). While this asymmetry may be linked to hand dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ochipa et al., 1989</xref>), functional imagining studies with relatively large sample sizes have shown that handedness only influences the strength of the left hemisphere bias for skilled movement but does not produce a reversal in left handers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vingerhoets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Verstynen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chettouf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vingerhoets et al., 2013</xref>). Of the six patients tested in the current study, five are right handed and the remaining patient reported being ambidextrous with a slight preference for using the left hand. We note that the results from this patient (L3) did not qualitatively differ from the other two left hemisphere patients.</p><p>Ipsilateral encoding was most prominent in the premotor and parietal cortex of the left hemisphere, overlapping with the neural regions implicated in praxis. However, two features of our results do not map on readily to an interpretation that focuses on hemispheric asymmetries in praxis. First, our task involved simple reaching movements, whereas praxis generally encompasses more complex learned movements associated with tool use or symbolic gestures. Second, ipsilateral encoding became more pronounced during movement execution.</p><p>Assuming that ipsilateral encoding is indicative of bilateral motor representations, one might have expected, a priori, that hemispheric asymmetries in ipsilateral encoding would be more prevalent during movement planning. We recognize that, even with delayed response tasks, it is overly simplistic to assume that the activity cleanly separates into planning and execution phases. This is especially true with sequential movements where planning effects are observed both prior to and during movement execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ariani and Diedrichsen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimnik and Churchland, 2021</xref>). While the experimental task was to reach to a cued target, the participants made out-and-back movements, returning to the home position in a relatively smooth manner (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is reasonable to assume that some component of the activity during the primary outward movement was related to planning the return movement. As such, we are hesitant to draw strong inferences about the differences between ipsilateral encoding during action planning and movement execution.</p><p>To this point, we have focused on how ipsilateral activity may be reflective of control processes associated with movements of the ipsilateral arm. However, it is possible that this activity is related to postural stabilization of the body during reaching. Indeed, extrapyramidal pathways such as the reticulospinal track have a prominent ipsilateral projection associated with postural control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cleland and Madhavan, 2021</xref>), and these pathways receive cortical input. We aimed to reduce postural demands in our task by having the participants seated in an upright hospital bed with the back fully supported; nonetheless, there are surely postural shifts associated with the reaching movement. The clinical setting precluded the use of EMG or video, measurements that would allow a quantitative assessment of the relationship of ipsilateral activity to postural adjustments. We do note a few points that are at odds with a posture-based account of ipsilateral activity. First, we are unaware of evidence suggesting a left hemisphere specialization in postural control. In fact, the evidence suggests that postural instability is more frequently associated with right hemisphere lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bohannon et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spinazzola et al., 2003</xref>). Second, postural adjustments typically precede movement onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belenkii et al., 1967</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guiard, 1987</xref>), whereas ipsilateral encoding in our data increased with movement onset. Third, and perhaps most convincing, the encoding model shows that the ipsilateral signals predict reaching kinematics with relatively high precision.</p><p>The asymmetry of ipsilateral encoding may be reflective of a prominent role of the left hemisphere in bimanual coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jäncke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Toyokura et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maki et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Serrien et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujiyama et al., 2016</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schaffer et al., 2020</xref> observed greater impairments in bimanual coordination following left hemisphere stroke compared to right hemisphere stroke. Interestingly, the impairment was manifest prior to peak velocity, a finding interpreted as a disruption in predictive control. It may be that the left hemisphere makes an asymmetric contribution to interlimb coordination by tracking or predicting where both limbs are in space. As such, the encoding of ipsilateral arm movement might be a form of state representation, a means to keep track of the state of the ipsilateral arm given that many actions require the coordinated activity of the two limbs. This hypothesis, derived from the current data, is consistent with the increased ipsilateral encoding during the movement phase. The need to monitor the state of the other limb should hold for unimanual gestures performed with either limb.</p><p>An important question for future work is to examine how ipsilateral representations in the left hemisphere are affected during more complex movements, including those that involve both limbs. Using fMRI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diedrichsen et al., 2013</xref> compared ipsilateral movement representations during unimanual and bimanual movements. Within the primary motor cortex, ipsilateral representations could only be discerned during unimanual movement. However, caudal premotor and anterior parietal regions retained similar ipsilateral representation during uni- and bimanual movement. If the left hemisphere tracks both limbs to facilitate bimanual coordination, we would predict that ipsilateral representations in premotor cortex are retained more strongly in the left hemisphere compared to the right hemisphere when both arms are engaged in the task.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using a kinematic encoding model, we observed a striking hemispheric asymmetry, with the left hemisphere more strongly encoding the ipsilateral arm than the right hemisphere, a finding that was apparent during preparation and amplified during movement. This asymmetry was primarily driven by electrodes positioned over premotor and parietal cortices, with strong contralateral encoding for electrodes positioned over sensorimotor cortex. We propose that these networks monitor the state of each arm, a prerequisite for most skilled actions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Intracranial recordings were obtained from six patients (two female; five right handed; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) implanted with subdural grids as part of their treatment for intractable epilepsy.

All patients provided informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral task</title><p>Participant performed an instructed-delay reaching task while sitting upright in their hospital bed. The participant rested their arms on a horizontal platform (71 cm × 20 cm) that was placed over a standard hospital overbed table. The platform contained two custom-made buttons, each connected to a microswitch. At the far end of the platform (13 cm from the buttons, approximately 55 cm from the participant’s eyes), a touchscreen monitor was attached, oriented vertically. Visual targets could appear at one of six locations, four for each arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The two central locations were used as targets for reaches with either arm; the two eccentric targets varied depending on the arm used. Stimulus presentation was controlled with Matlab 2016a. A photodiode sensor was placed on the monitor to precisely track target presentation times. The analog signals from the photodiode and the two microswitches were fed into the ECoG recording system and were digitized into the same data file as the ECoG data with identical sampling frequency.</p><p>Testing of the contralateral and ipsilateral arms (relative to the ECoG electrodes) was conducted in separate experimental blocks that were counterbalanced. To start each trial, the participant placed their left and right index fingers on two custom buttons to depress the microswitches (this indicated they were in the correct position and ready to start the trial). If both microswitches remained depressed for 500 ms, a fixation stimulus was presented in the middle of the screen for 750 ms, followed by the target, a circle (1.25 cm diameter) which appeared in one of the four locations. Another hold period of 900 ms followed in which the participant was instructed to prepare the required movement while the target remained on the screen. If the microswitch was actuated during this hold period, an error message appeared on the screen and the program would advance to the next trial. If the start position was maintained, a compound imperative stimulus was presented at the end of the hold period. This consisted of an auditory tone and an increase in the size of the target (2.5 cm diameter). The participant was instructed that this was the signal to initiate and complete a continuous out-and-back movement, attempting to touch the screen at the target location before returning back to the platform. The target disappeared when the touchscreen was contacted. The imperative was withheld on 5% of the trials (‘catch’ trials) to ensure that the participant only responded after the onset of the imperative.</p><p>Once back at the home position, the screen displayed the word ‘HIT’ or ‘MISS’ for 750 ms to indicate if the touch had occurred within the target zone. The target zone included the 2.5 diameter circle as well as a 1 cm buffer around the target. After the feedback interval, the screen was blank for 250 ms before the reappearance of the fixation stimulus, signaling the start of the next trial. The participants were informed to release either of the buttons at any time they wished to take a break.</p><p>Each block consisted of 40 trials (10/target), all performed with a single limb. Blocks alternated between contralateral and ipsilateral arms (relative to the ECoG electrodes), with the order counterbalanced across participants. Each block took approximately 5–6 min to complete. All participants completed at least two blocks with each per arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Movement analysis and trajectory reconstruction</title><p>We used two methods to analyze the movements. For the first method, we recorded key events defined by the release of the microswitch at the start position, time and location of contact with the touchscreen, and return time to the home position, defined by the time at which they depressed the home position microswitch. For the second method, we used the Leap Motion 3D movement analysis system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weichert et al., 2013</xref>) to record continuous hand position and the full movement trajectory (sampling rate = 60 Hz). Although the Leap system is a lightweight video-based tracking device that is highly mobile, the unpredictable environment of the ICU led to erratic recordings from the Leap system. For example, patients frequently had intravenous lines in one or both hands which obstructed the visibility of the hand and interfered with the ability of the Leap system to track the hand using their built-in hand model. This resulted in lost samples and therefore satisfactory kinematic data were obtained from only a subset of conditions collected from patients using the Leap system.</p><p>Given the limitations with the Leap data, we opted to use a simple algorithm to reconstruct the time-resolved hand trajectory in each trial, estimating it from the event-based data obtained with the first method. We used a beta distribution to estimate the velocity profile of the forward and return reach based on reach times and the travel distance (sampling rate = 100 Hz). We opted to use a beta distribution because this best matched the velocity profiles of the data obtained with the Leap system.</p><p>For conditions that had clean kinematic traces (no lost samples) from the Leap system, we compared the estimated kinematic profiles with those obtained with the Leap system. There was a high correlation between the two datasets (<italic>r</italic> = 0.98 for position in the <italic>Z</italic> dimension; <italic>r</italic> = 0.93 for velocity in the <italic>Z</italic> dimension; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that our method of estimating the trajectories results in a smoothed version of the movement, one lacking any secondary or corrective movements that are sometimes observed when reaching to a visual target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suway and Schwartz, 2019</xref>). We believe this is still a reasonable estimation given the high correlation with the continuous Leap data, and the fact that participants had ample time to prepare the movements and were instructed and observed to make ballistic movements by the experimenter who was present for all recording sessions (CMM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrode localization</title><p>Grid and strip electrode spacing was 1 cm in four patients and 4 mm in the two other patients.

First, if the patient’s data were not sampled at 1000 Hz (UCI and UCSF recording sites), the signal from each electrode was low-pass filtered at 500 Hz using a Butterworth filter as an antialiasing measure before downsampling to 1000 Hz. Electrodes were referenced using a common average reference. Each electrode was notch filtered at 60, 120, and 180 Hz to remove line noise. The signals were then visually inspected and electrodes with sustained excessive noise were excluded from further analyses. The signals were also inspected by a neurologist (RTK) for epileptic activity and other artifacts. Electrodes that had pathological seizure activity were also excluded from the main analyses. Out of 752 electrodes, 82 were removed due to excessive noise and 5 were removed due to epileptic activity, resulting in a final dataset of 665 electrodes. Catch trials and unsuccessful reaches were not included in the analyses.</p><p>From the cleaned dataset, we extracted the HFA instantaneous amplitude using a Hilbert transform. To account for the 1/<italic>f</italic> power drop in the spectrum, we divided the broadband signal into five narrower bands that logarithmically increased from 70 to 200 Hz (i.e., 70–86, 86–107, 107–131, 131–162, and 162–200 Hz), and applied a band-pass filter within each of these ranges. We then took the absolute value of the Hilbert transform within each band-pass, performed a <italic>z</italic>-score transformation, and averaged the five values. <italic>z</italic>-Scoring was performed after concatenating all the blocks for each patient, ensuring that we did not obscure possible amplitude differences across the two arms. As a final step, the data were downsampled to 100 Hz to reduce computational load (e.g., number of parameters in the encoding model, see below). HFA amplitude fluctuations (envelope; are evident at lower frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Canolty et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pei et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Feature selection</title><p>Four estimated kinematic features were used to predict HFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). The first two features were position and speed in the <italic>Z</italic> dimension.

The second pair of features were spherical angles that define the specific target locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). Features were selected to reduce collinearity and redundancy in the encoding model. Because we include time lags for each kinematic feature, derivatives can emerge from the linear model (e.g., velocity and acceleration can be created from position); thus, velocity and acceleration were not included as additional features.

This wide range of lags serves two purposes. First, it provides a way to compensate for the anticipated asynchrony between neural data and movement kinematics. Second, it allowed us to evaluate HFA activity during the instructed-delay (beginning ~1.5 s before movement onset) period as well as during movement.

For each outer fold, we further partitioned our estimation set into five mutually exclusive inner folds to train the model (80% of estimation set) and predict neural responses across a range of regularization values on the validation set (20% of estimation set). For each inner fold, the regularization parameter value was selected that produced the best prediction as measured by the linear correlation of the predicted and actual HFA. The average of the selected regularization parameters across the five inner folds was computed and used to calculate the prediction of the HFA on the outer test set. This procedure was done at the outer level five times. Our primary measure is held-out prediction performance (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>), which we quantified as the squared linear correlation between the model prediction and the actual HFA time series, averaged across the five mutually exclusive test sets.</p><p>To be considered as predictive, we established a criterion that an electrode must account for at least 5% of the variability in the HFA signal (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.05) for either ipsilateral or contralateral reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Downey et al., 2020</xref>). Electrodes not meeting this criterion were not included in subsequent analyses.</p><p>For across-arm model fitting, the same procedure was used except the test set was partitioned from the total dataset of the other arm. We partitioned the data in this manner (80% estimation, 20% test) to make the fitting procedure for the across-arm model comparable to that employed in the within-arm model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Tuning modulation and similarity across arms</title><p>MD of target tuning was calculated as the standard deviation of the mean HFA predictions for each of the four target locations:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>x</italic> is the average HFA prediction, <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is the average HFA prediction for each of the four target positions. <italic>i</italic> iterates through the target locations and <italic>n</italic> is the total number of target locations.

These values were scaled from 0 to 1 based on the minimum and maximum values of SSE across all electrodes.

To compare model prediction performance during different phases of the task, the data were epoched into instruction and movement phases, using event markers recorded in the analog channel (i.e., cue onset and movement onset). Epochs of the same task phase were concatenated together, and prediction performance was operationalized as the square of the Pearson’s correlation between the predicted and actual HFA for each task phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Permutation-based linear mixed-effects model</title><p>Linear mixed-effects models were carried out in RStudio using software packages lme4 and permlmer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bates et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Braun, 2012</xref>). Each mixed-effects model used participant as a random effect and experimental variables (e.g., reaching arm, hemisphere) as fixed effects. The models were used to predict performance from the kinematic encoding model for all predictive electrodes. Nested models were created to assess the effect of the fixed factors, with the null model using patient as a random effect to predict encoding values. For the nesting, fixed factors were added to the model to assess if each new factor improved prediction above that obtained with the null model using a permutation-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Braak, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee and Braun, 2012</xref>). Interactions were tested by comparing a model in which the fixed effects were restricted to have additive effects to a model that could have both multiplicative and additive effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Assessing the contribution of kinematic features in the encoding model</title><p>Average weights for each patient were calculated for all predictive electrodes for each kinematic feature. Because each feature has 400 time lags, there are 400 weights per feature in the full model. To assess the relative contribution of each feature, we calculated the sum of the weights across time lags after taking the absolute value of each weight (since negative weights are as informative as positive weights). The sum of each feature was then plotted as a proportion against the total sum of all weights (after taking the absolute value) to assess the relative contribution. To capture the temporal profile of the weights, the average was taken for all predictive electrodes for all patents.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Assessing explainable variance in the encoding model</title><p>There are several methods to assess prediction performance for encoding models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lage-Castellanos et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nunez-Elizalde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoppe et al., 2016</xref>). A drawback with the Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient is that it does not distinguish between explainable variability and response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hsu et al., 2004</xref>). To better capture this distinction, we calculated CC<sub>norm</sub>, a measure which normalizes by signal power (SP) to account for response variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schoppe et al., 2016</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ5"><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:msqrt></mml:mfrac><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>y</italic> is neural activity and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are predictions from the model, and SP is:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is the neural time series for the <italic>n</italic>th trial and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of trials.</p><p>We plot the density estimates of all predictive electrodes for both the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (CC<sub>abs</sub>) and CC<sub>norm</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Andrew Pruszynski as the Reviewing Editor and Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephan Swinnen (Reviewer #1); Atsushi Yokoi (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide more details about the electrode positions and more specificity about the brain areas covered: asymmetries in number of electrodes in each hemisphere and their specific location, variability in electrode coverage, electrode coverage for each hemisphere group, subregions of premotor and parietal cortex being covered (if possible).</p><p>2. Importantly, clarify and address the impact of the variability in electrode placement on the statistical tests and ultimately on the conclusions being drawn.</p><p>3. Elaborate on the topic of bimanual control. Presently this topic is mentioned in the Discussion section but should be worked out in more detail. Some relevant references in this domain are proposed. In general, several relevant references as proposed in the reviews should be added and considered in more detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The authors refer to medical imaging research that has identified evidence for movement representations common to both upper limbs. In this respect, the authors may be interested in complementary fMRI research involving complex coordination skills performed with the left and right body side, pointing to the critical importance of shared activations in the left premotor-parietal complex for movements of the right and left body side. The findings of the latter study are consistent with the findings presented in the ECoG study in spite of the different imaging techniques. Nevertheless, in spite of the convergent findings, this fMRI study also points to additional candidate brain regions for shared movement representations by the left and right hand that cannot be revealed by ECoG (Swinnen et al., 2010).</p><p>2. It is a pity that a large amount of movement kinematic data was lost due to problems with the motion registration equipment in interaction with the patients. Nevertheless, the cross-validated kinematic encoding model is very helpful and provides a reasonable representation of these simple reaching movements.</p><p>3. Even though unimanual movements are studied, the participants are supposed to keep their finger on the resting switch for the nonmoving hand. Is it possible that this position serves a postural control function to support the movement of the contralateral arm that reaches for the target? If so, could this account for similarities in neural activity for controlling both hands?</p><p>4. Is it possible to provide more detailed information about the whole body position of the participants during performance of these reaching tasks. This information is interesting from the perspective of postural control mechanisms (via trunk and contralateral body side), as required for enabling these focal arm reaching movements.</p><p>5. In the Table on p. 4, remarkable differences in RT are evident among the 6 participants. Can the authors provide an explanation for the relatively long RTs in some of the patients? Can this still be considered normal behavior?</p><p>6. In the figure captions, all the (sub)graphs are explained in meticulous detail allowing the reader to understand the messages that the authors wish to convey. Overall, the manuscript is excellently written and directs the reader to the focal results in relation to the information provided in the figures.</p><p>7. On p. 12, it is stated that the poor generalization of some electrodes is generally due to the temporal divergence of the two arms during instruction, where the ipsilateral trace becomes inhibited compared to the contralateral trace. Do the authors refer to an active inhibition mechanism as evidenced from TMS research during movement preparation in which neural excitation is first suppressed and then followed by a phase in which the excitation level of the arm to the moved is increased while that for the nonmoving arm is further depressed prior to movement initiation (Duque and Ivry, 2009).</p><p>8. In the Discussion section, the authors reflect on research from bimanual movement control to identify potential accounts for the bilateral encoding architecture. However, the literature to which they refer leaves room for alternative interpretations. Perhaps, the authors may be interested in a neural model of bimanual control based on TMS interhemispheric connectivity research between PMd and M1 in which left PMd (and not right PMd) is hypothesized to be in charge of the division of labor assigned to the left and right hands during the preparation of bimanual movement (Fujiyama et al., 2016a,b). The latter bimanual work is generally consistent with the hemispheric asymmetry evidence provided in the present manuscript but also reflects on the specific function assigned to the left premotor cortex during bimanual control. This suggests potentially alternative reasons for the finding that electrodes that generalized well across arms were primarily located in premotor regions of the left hemisphere.</p><p>References:</p><p>Duque, J., Ivry, R.B.

However, the contralateral kinematic encoding was not explicitly tested in the current paper. It is entirely up to the authors, but I think 'ipsilateral kinematic encoding' would be less confusing than 'bilateral kinematic encoding.' The authors could otherwise compare the contralateral kinematic encoding between the hemispheres.</p><p>It was not clear from the text whether the electrodes were pooled over the three patients for each hemisphere group or the patients were still treated as a random effect. Please clarify this point. In either case, it would be informative to show the breakdown of these electrodes in terms of patients (e.g., page 5, line 25 &quot;665&quot; electrodes, page 7, line 11, &quot;141&quot;, &quot;75&quot;). A summary table of the electrodes indicating the participants and regions they belong to would be very helpful for readers. As the co-registration process of electrodes on the reconstructed cortical surface indicated by Stolk et al. (2018) uses the freesurfer, it would be relatively easy to find in which of the freesurfer-defined regions, such as Destrieux Atlas (Destrieux et al., Neuroimage, 2010), each of the electrodes covered. Please consider.</p><p>Please consider using different colors or marker types for different patients for the scatter plots displayed in Figures 2-5, as this is more informative to readers.</p><p>A recent line of studies (Ariani and Diedrichsen, J Neurophysiol, 2019; Ariani et al., J Neurophysiol, 2020) emphasizes the significant contribution of online planning in the production of sequential movement. In this context, the even stronger bilateral shared encoding observed during the movement phase might partially reflect the online planning of return movements. As this return movement is always to the same starting position (target), higher similarity could be explained in part by this component. Please discuss.</p><p>Please specify the reason why the authors excluded the peripheral targets for the cross-arm generalization analysis. These targets could provide further insight into under which coordinate frame (i.e., extrinsic or intrinsic) the contra- and ipsilateral encoding overlapped (e.g., Wiestler et al., J Neurosci, 2014; Haar et al., J Neurosci, 2017).</p><p>Although up to the authors, it would be recommended to report &quot;noise ceiling&quot; for each electrode (e.g., Schoppe et al., Front Comput Neurosci, 2016). The noise ceiling would also help interpret whether poor prediction accuracy is due to the low SN ratio or the inappropriate model in the across-arm generalization test.</p><p>Figure 5B: It would be more informative also to show all other electrodes (or areas covered by each electrode grid, for instance, by colored rectangles) to indicate the coverage for each hemisphere group.</p><p>Similarly, displaying the simple ipsilateral encoding strength (shown in Figure 2) in the same format of Figure 5B (categorized by generalization index) would also be informative for comparing the shared and unshared ipsilateral encoding.</p><p>Schaffer et al. (2020) was not found in the reference list (Schaffer and Sainburg, 2021 was listed instead). Please list the proper reference.</p><p>Please report the age data of the participants in the Methods.</p><p>Please provide more details about the statistical analyses in the Methods.</p><p>Page 20, line 1: Please specify what the MD, n, i, and x indicate.</p><p>Page 20, line 5: Please specify what the SSEe, n, i, contra<sub>i</sub>, and ipsi<sub>i</sub>, indicate.</p><p>Page 20, line 12: &quot;min&quot; is omitted before &quot;(SSEe)&quot; in the denominator.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I believe that the recording sites between hemispheres must be matched; this is the only way to ensure that the inter-hemispheric differences reported are not simply due to the intra-hemispheric differences reported in Supplementary Figures 1-2.</p><p>2. I'm a bit confused as to why the landmark used in Supplementary Figures 1-2 is the dorsal aspect of the central sulcus. I might expect that premotor electrodes would generalize better (and exhibit more bilateral encoding) than M1 electrodes, but your analysis seems to make the argument that face M1 electrodes also generalize better than arm M1 electrodes. Could you provide a bit more interpretation of this empirical result?</p><p>3. I don't quite get the relevance of Churchland 2012 results to the trace in Figure 5C. Churchland et al. used only outward reaches in the 2012 study, whereas your subjects are performing out-and-back movements. The trace in Figure 5C is more similar to the trigger signal reported in Kaufman, et al. In fact, in monkeys making movement sequences (comparable to your out-and-back movements), Zimnik and Churchland (2021) found a biphasic trigger signal that looks pretty similar to the trace shown in 5C. To that end, it might be useful to plot the across-subject hand speeds in 5C. If the ECoG signal plotted is related to the trigger signal, then it should have a time-course similar to the subjects' hand speed.</p><p>4. Related to 5C, wouldn't it make more sense to plot the actual HFA amplitude, rather than the predicted HFA amplitude? I understand that the two will likely be very similar, but 5C is making a point about the true neural activity.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Left Hemisphere Dominance for Bilateral Kinematic Encoding in the Human Brain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Tirin Moore as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and the original reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. All reviewers were very happy with the revisions and think the paper is strong. Please see the remaining comments of Reviewer #2 especially with respect to statistical support for some of the claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made a profound and detailed attempt to comply with the questions raised by the reviewers. Accordingly, as far as I am concerned, the paper is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This is important work in which data is obtained from a unique set of patients to reveal the control of ipsilateral and contralateral arm movement in a very detailed manner. It complements previous work collected from nonhuman primates.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors adequately addressed most of my previous concerns. I have one further recommendation and a comment related to the modification.</p><p>The authors need some statistical support for their claims regarding (i) hemispheric equality in regional distribution of electrodes (lines 226-228) and (ii) hemispheric difference in the number of electrodes with good/poor across-arm generalization (lines 412-414, 439-441, and 590-597).</p><p>(i) Hemispheric equality in regional distribution of electrodes (lines 226-228):</p><p>&quot;When the categorization data were pooled across the three left hemisphere and three right hemisphere patients, the proportion of electrodes was similar in premotor, sensorimotor motor, and parietal regions.&quot; (Lines 226-228)</p><p>This can be tested by using, for example, multinomial goodness-of-fit tests using expected frequency for each region estimated from the data from either hemisphere. Reporting the number or proportion (%) for these three regions in the main text, in addition to the bar graphs, would also be helpful.</p><p>(ii) Hemispheric difference in number of electrodes with good/poor across-arm generalization (lines 412-414, 439-441, and 590-597):</p><p>&quot;This categorization scheme revealed a striking anatomical division, with electrodes showing good across-arm generalization clustering in the left premotor and superior parietal regions and electrodes that generalized poorly clustering in left and right M1. This result does not appear to reflect a sampling bias. There are more left hemisphere electrodes compared to right hemisphere electrodes because two of the left hemisphere patients had high density grid implants. However, the electrodes in our left and right hemisphere samples were similarly distributed over premotor, sensorimotor and parietal regions (see Supplementary Figure 2).&quot; (Lines 590-597)</p><p>The fact that the electrodes in the left and right hemispheres have similar distribution over these regions does not automatically protect from the risk of finding more electrodes in the left hemisphere due to the hemispheric bias in electrode number, and need formal statistical tests. Similarly to the first point above, this can be tested by using goodness-of-fit tests (e.g., chi-squared test, likelihood-ratio G test, etc.) using the expected number of electrodes that should be found in the same region in the other hemisphere under the null-hypothesis of hemispheric symmetry (e.g., if 20 electrodes are found in the left hemisphere, 74*20/141 electrodes should also be found in the right).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Merrick et al. were admirably responsive to all reviewer comments, and the manuscript has been greatly improved as a result. I have no further critiques.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69977.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have added Supplementary Figure 2. This analysis is also addressed in the Results section (page 8, lines: 200-227).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Importantly, clarify and address the impact of the variability in electrode placement on the statistical tests and ultimately on the conclusions being drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>Given that there is comparable regional electrode coverage in the left and right hemisphere across patients, it is unlikely that the hemispheric differences are confounded by regional differences; as such, we do not think it essential to include subregion as a factor in our model. We also note that not all of the patients have electrodes over each subregion and thus, adding subregion as a fixed factor would reduce power. For these reasons, we focus on continuous measures such as the distance from the central sulcus rather than categorial measures, allowing us to include all task-relevant electrodes in these analyses. We also think this approach is more precise because the values are based on individual MR scans instead of parcellations that would be derived with respect to a reference MNI brain and then fit to each individual scan.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2, we agree that it is important to control for patient variability in our statistical tests. We now use a permutation-based mixed effects model which has fixed effects comprising our experimental factors (hemisphere, reaching arm, task-phase, generalization – depending on the specific statistical test) and a random effect of patient. This allows us to address the nested structure of our dataset (electrodes are nested within patient) and provides a way to consider the effect of patient variability. Including patient as a random effect did not change any of the results. We have revised the Results section to report these tests. We have also updated Figures 2-4, using color to indicate the electrodes for each patient, allowing the reader to readily see the variation across patients. We appreciate the prod from Reviewer # 2, with the changes adding more transparency about variability across patients, both in terms of the statistical tests and figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

This is likely a consequence of the task instructions: We did not emphasize speed, letting the patients work at their own pace and putting the emphasis on accuracy. The only constraint was that the message “Too Slow” appeared if the participant did not initiate the movement within 2.5 s. This was really there in case the patient’s attention lapsed (and rarely happened). Our experience is that RT demands should be minimized with ECoG patients given their clinical state. We also had our plan to fit the kinematics on an individual basis and did not anticipate wanting to average signals across patients. For this reason, we did not see RT variability as a major concern. We have modified the text in the results to note that participants were instructed to move at their own pace and focus on accuracy (page 4, lines: 141-143).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The noise ceiling would also help interpret whether poor prediction accuracy is due to the low SN ratio or the inappropriate model in the across-arm generalization test.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new Supplemental Figure, S3, to show the calculations for CCnorm (recommended by Schoppe et al., 2016) alongside our primary encoding metric (CCabs; average held-out correlation between the actual HFB and the predictions based on the model). CCnorm is normalized by signal power whereas our primary metric – Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficient is not. We find that CCnorm does not drastically differ from CCabs, suggesting that we have sufficient trials and signal power in our dataset such that the encoding model does a good job of capturing the majority of explainable variance. The text has been updated in the Method section (Page 26-27, lines 956-972).</p><p>With respect to our interpretation of electrodes that fail to generalize, we have also added a new panel to Figure 5 (Figure 5B) which is discussed in more detail in the next comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5B: It would be more informative also to show all other electrodes (or areas covered by each electrode grid, for instance, by colored rectangles) to indicate the coverage for each hemisphere group.</p><p>Similarly, displaying the simple ipsilateral encoding strength (shown in Figure 2) in the same format of Figure 5B (categorized by generalization index) would also be informative for comparing the shared and unshared ipsilateral encoding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an outline to the figure 5D (which used to be 5B in the previous version) to detail the extent of coverage across participants in each hemisphere. We considered outlining the coverage for each patient individually, but thought it made the figure too busy.</p><p>We have added a new panel to Figure 5 (5B in revised figure) to summarize ipsilateral encoding strength for electrodes that generalize well and electrodes that generalize poorly.

For electrodes that generalize poorly there is a divergence in temporal structure prior to movement onset, captured by the negative correlation between the HFA signal encoding ipsilateral or contralateral movements. Thus, electrodes that generalize poorly have lower ipsilateral signal strength and differ in terms of the temporal pattern for ipsilateral and contralateral movement.</p><p>We have revised the text and Figure 5 to clarify our arguments on this issue (pages 12-14, Results section: Temporal and spatial topography of across-arm generalization).

I'm a bit confused as to why the landmark used in Supplementary Figures 1-2 is the dorsal aspect of the central sulcus. I might expect that premotor electrodes would generalize better (and exhibit more bilateral encoding) than M1 electrodes, but your analysis seems to make the argument that face M1 electrodes also generalize better than arm M1 electrodes. Could you provide a bit more interpretation of this empirical result?</p></disp-quote><p>Part of the motivation here was empirical: We observed that only electrodes located close to the arm area of motor cortex failed to generalize across arms. A post-hoc explanation would be that electrodes over motor cortex are more closely tied to actual arm movement. However, we recognize that other areas (including within M1) might be encoding information about the contralateral arm, even if that information is more abstract (e.g., about the movement goal). Indeed, signals from microelectrode arrays in the human hand knob have been shown to be related to movements performed by the face, head, arm and leg (Willet et al., 2019), suggesting (yet again) the need to reconsider the notion of the motor homunculus. Similarly, we see encoding (strong levels of prediction performance) in other areas of M1 that are likely distant from the arm area of M1. For example, in more ventral aspects (corresponding to face area in the conventional maps), we see more similar encoding across the two arms suggesting that this information is more abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. I don't quite get the relevance of Churchland 2012 results to the trace in Figure 5C. Churchland et al. used only outward reaches in the 2012 study, whereas your subjects are performing out-and-back movements. The trace in Figure 5C is more similar to the trigger signal reported in Kaufman, et al. In fact, in monkeys making movement sequences (comparable to your out-and-back movements), Zimnik and Churchland (2021) found a biphasic trigger signal that looks pretty similar to the trace shown in 5C. To that end, it might be useful to plot the across-subject hand speeds in 5C. If the ECoG signal plotted is related to the trigger signal, then it should have a time-course similar to the subjects' hand speed.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon reflection, we agree that this reference was inappropriate. We have revised the Results section by citing two papers that are more relevant, Kaufman et al. (2016) and Zimnik and Churchland (2021). In addition, we have added a new section and figure (Figure 7) to the Results section to address whether the HFA is related to the condition-invariant trigger signal. Specifically, Figure 7 compares HFA to averaged kinematic activity for electrodes that generalize well or poorly. Two results stand out from this figure, the first is that for electrodes that generalize poorly (primarily located over M1), the HFA signal resembles speed, suggesting that this activity is related to the condition-invariant trigger signal. We find this relationship for both contralateral and ipsilateral reaches, despite the decreased amplitude of the HFA during ipsilateral movements. Second, for electrodes that generalize well we find that the HFA most closely resembles position. We note that the kinematics lag behind HFA by approximately ~200 ms for both speed and position, in line with Kaufman et al., (2016, see their Figure 6). This new section and figure are discussed in the Results section (page 16 lines: 523-537).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Related to 5C, wouldn't it make more sense to plot the actual HFA amplitude, rather than the predicted HFA amplitude? I understand that the two will likely be very similar, but 5C is making a point about the true neural activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for pointing this out. We have changed these panel from predictions to actual HFA amplitude. As the reviewer predicted, the two look quite similar but we agree it makes more sense to plot HFA given our aim is to interpret neural signals.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.
