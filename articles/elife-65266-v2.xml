by hospitalised neonates, there are few analgesics with proven efficacy. Testing analgesics in neonates is experimentally and ethically challenging and minimising the number of neonates required to demonstrate efficacy is essential. EEG (electroencephalography)-derived measures of noxious-evoked brain activity can be used to assess analgesic efficacy; however, as variability exists in neonate’s responses to painful procedures, large sample sizes are often required. Here, we present an experimental paradigm to account for individual differences in noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity which can be used to improve the design of analgesic trials in neonates. The paradigm is developed and tested across four observational studies using clinical, experimental, and simulated data (92 neonates). We provide evidence of the efficacy of gentle brushing and paracetamol, substantiating the need for randomised controlled trials of these interventions. This work provides an important step towards safe, cost-effective clinical trials of analgesics in neonates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hospitalized newborns often undergo medical procedures, like blood tests, without pain relief. This can cause the baby to experience short-term distress that may have negative consequences later in life. However, testing the effects of pain relief in newborns is challenging because, unlike adults, they cannot report how much pain they are experiencing.</p><p>One way to overcome this is to record the brain activity of newborns during a painful procedure and to see how these signals are modified following pain relief. Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for these kinds of medical assessments, but require a high number of participants to account for individual differences in how babies respond to pain. Finding ways to reduce the size of pain control studies could lead to faster development of pain relief methods.</p><p>Here, Cobo, Hartley et al. demonstrate a way to reduce the number of newborns needed to test potential pain-relieving interventions. In the experiments, the brain activity of nine babies was measured after a gentle poke and after a painful clinically required procedure. Cobo, Hartley et al. found that the babies’ response to the gentle poke correlated with their response to pain. Further data analysis revealed that this information can be used to predict the variability in pain experienced by different newborns, reducing the number of participants needed for pain relief trials.</p><p>Next, Cobo, Hartley et al. used this new approach in two pilot tests. One showed that gently stroking an infant’s leg before blood is drawn from their heel reduced their brains’ response to pain. The second showed that giving a baby the painkiller paracetamol lessened the brain’s response to immunisation.</p><p>The new approach identified by Cobo, Hartley et al. may enable smaller studies that can more quickly identify ways to reduce pain in babies. Furthermore, this work suggests that gentle brushing and paracetamol could provide pain relief for newborns undergoing hospital acute procedures. However, more formal clinical trials are needed to test the effectiveness of these two strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>baseline sensitivity</kwd><kwd>neonates</kwd><kwd>analgesic clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Fellowship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slater</surname><given-names>Rebeccah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>207457/Z/17/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slater</surname><given-names>Rebeccah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Measuring individual differences in noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity in neonates can substantially reduce sample sizes required in neonatal analgesic trials.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Considering the short-term stress and long-term neurodevelopmental impact associated with repeated pain exposure in early life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brummelte et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morison et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Vinall et al., 2014</xref>), effective pain relief is crucial in neonatal intensive care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hall and Anand, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lim and Godambe, 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, as a result of the implicit challenges of measuring pain in neonates, and the ethical and experimental challenges of conducting neonatal clinical trials, few analgesics have proven efficacy in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegaert, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moultrie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Slater et al., 2020</xref>). Participants in clinical trials risk exposure to potential adverse effects, and therefore every effort should be made to minimise the sample size necessary to demonstrate efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">European Medicines Agency, 2001</xref>). However, as factors such as age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fabrizi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Green et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartley et al., 2016</xref>), prior pain experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ozawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slater et al., 2010a</xref>), stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jones et al., 2017</xref>), sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartocci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Verriotis et al., 2018</xref>), illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ranger et al., 2013</xref>), and behavioural state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Slater et al., 2006</xref>) influence noxious-evoked responses, large sample sizes are often required to account for between-subject variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancora et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hartley et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kabataş et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sindhur et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Taddio et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In adult studies, cross-over trial designs are often used to minimise sample sizes by reducing between-subject variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper et al., 2016</xref>). However, this approach may not be appropriate when studying pain in neonates as painful medical procedures can only be performed when clinically necessary and within-subject variables that influence pain can change dramatically across sequential test occasions. One approach used to balance demographic characteristics or other prognostic factors across treatment groups in clinical trials is to stratify neonates across treatment arms and to adjust for these factors in the statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McEntegart, 2003</xref>). While this can improve comparability across groups for recognised factors, many unknown variables likely influence pain sensitivity, and a more nuanced approach to account for individual differences in noxious-evoked sensitivity could be more effective in reducing sample sizes. In analgesic studies performed in adults, individual pain thresholds can be identified by applying graded increments of experimental stimulus intensity until pain is reported by the participants. This can be used to stratify treatment groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Demant et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vollert et al., 2017</xref>) or statistically correct for variability in baseline pain thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lane et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sanga et al., 2013</xref>). In neonates, application of graded non-noxious stimuli such as von Frey hairs has previously been used to identify limb reflex withdrawal thresholds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andrews and Fitzgerald, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andrews and Fitzgerald, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andrews and Fitzgerald, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kühne et al., 2012</xref>), but these have not been used as a baseline measure in analgesic clinical trials.</p><p>In the absence of a validated objective biomarker of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Davis et al., 2020</xref>), electroencephalography (EEG)-derived measures of brain activity may provide a valuable surrogate marker of pain by measuring the noxious-evoked activation of the cortex. In adults, brain activity during painful procedures is strongly correlated with verbal reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coghill et al., 2017</xref>); and in neonates, a template of noxious-evoked brain activity that discriminates between noxious and non-noxious procedures has been previously characterised and validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we develop and test an experimental paradigm that assesses individual baseline sensitivity in neonates by measuring noxious-evoked brain activity in response to a low-intensity experimental noxious stimulus, and demonstrate that accounting for this measure of noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity substantially reduces the sample sizes required in neonatal studies of analgesic efficacy. The term ‘noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity’ is used to refer to individual neonate’s noxious-evoked baseline brain activity. This will be related to multiple neural and non-neural factors including nociceptive processing, arousal, attention, signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG recording, and differences in head size.</p><p>In contrast to studies in adults which have shown similar patterns of activity evoked by both painful and non-painful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mouraux et al., 2011</xref>), we have previously shown that the pattern of brain activity that we analyse here is not evoked by visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli which evoke similar levels of physiological arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>). In Study 1, we demonstrate that the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity in response to an experimental stimulus correlates with the magnitude of brain activity evoked by the clinical procedure and thus reflects baseline sensitivity. In Study 2, we use simulated data to demonstrate the increased statistical power that can be achieved by including baseline sensitivity as a covariate when analysing the effect of an intervention in small samples. In Study 3, we test this novel paradigm using a non-pharmacological pain-relieving intervention of known efficacy – gentle touch – prior to heel lancing. Finally, in Study 4 we investigate the analgesic efficacy of oral paracetamol given prior to immunisation in prematurely born neonates. Overall, we demonstrate that measuring and accounting for noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity could improve the design of analgesic efficacy investigations for this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study 1: Characterising individual noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity using brain activity in neonates</title><p>We hypothesised that a measure of neonatal noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity could be used to account for inter-individual variability in noxious-evoked brain activity in studies of analgesic efficacy (noxious-evoked sensitivity paradigm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and predicted that this would reduce the sample sizes needed in clinical trials. In order to use noxious-evoked brain activity in response to a mild experimental noxious stimulus as a measure of baseline sensitivity, it must be significantly and strongly correlated with the response to the clinically required procedure. In Study 1, we therefore assessed the feasibility and initial validity of the paradigm by investigating the relationship between individual responses of term neonates to experimental noxious stimuli and a subsequent clinically required heel lance. This was a retrospective study presenting previously unpublished data from term neonates studied between 2014 and 2015 who had received both a heel lance and experimental noxious stimuli on the same test occasion (n = 9). Whilst this sample size is small, this was a feasibility study and this relationship is retested in Study 3. The magnitudes of the noxious-evoked brain activity evoked by stimulating a neonate’s foot with a controlled mild experimental noxious stimulus (force = 64 mN; magnitude range 0.15–0.62, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) were strongly correlated with the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity generated by a clinically required heel lance (range −0.07 to 2.34) in the same neonates (p=0.0025, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.77, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Therefore, application of a mild experimental noxious stimulus prior to performing a clinically required painful procedure could provide a novel measure of neonatal baseline sensitivity, which could be used as a covariate in studies of analgesic efficacy to account for inter-individual variability in pain responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the following sections, we simulate and test the impact of applying this novel paradigm in studies investigating the efficacy of pain-relieving interventions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Noxious-evoked sensitivity paradigm explained.</title><p>Schematic representation of the noxious-evoked sensitivity paradigm components.

Here, we initially assume that an effective analgesic intervention results in a 40% reduction in noxious-evoked brain activity; this is clinically meaningful as a similar reduction in noxious-evoked brain activity is observed when adults report significantly lower verbal pain scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lorenz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">von Mohr et al., 2018</xref>). We simulated an Intervention Group and Control Group across a range of sample sizes, simulating both baseline sensitivity data and responses to heel lance, and assuming the relationship between these measures observed in Study 1.</p><p>The simulated Control Group and the Intervention Group responses were compared using a linear regression with and without baseline sensitivity as a covariate (see 'Materials and methods'). At a significance level of 0.05, the sample size to achieve a given power is substantially reduced when baseline sensitivity is accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The reduction in sample size that can be achieved by accounting for individual differences in baseline sensitivity is highly dependent on the anticipated effect size of the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). For example, at the extremes we considered, with an assumed intervention effect size of 95% (and power of 95%), a sample of 11 neonates per group would be required without accounting for baseline sensitivity compared with eight neonates per group when baseline sensitivity is accounted for, a 27% reduction in sample size. Whereas, by comparison, assuming an intervention effect size of 5%, the sample size required to achieve 95% power is 5458 neonates per group without accounting for individual baseline sensitivity, compared with 660 neonates per group when baseline sensitivity is accounted for – representing an 88% reduction in sample size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Assuming an intervention effect size of 40%, a sample size of 16 neonates per group (32 neonates in total) would be sufficient to observe a significant intervention effect with 95% power if individual differences in baseline sensitivity are accounted for. In contrast, a sample size of 66 neonates per group (132 neonates in total) is required to achieve the same power if neonatal baseline sensitivity is not accounted for (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>The percentage reduction in sample size which can be achieved by accounting for individual differences in baseline sensitivity is also dependent on the strength of the correlation between the brain responses evoked by the experimental stimuli and the acute clinical procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). When a weak correlation exists between the measures (calculated using the standard deviation of the correlation residuals), the reduction in sample size is low. Conversely, with a strong correlation between measures, a greater reduction in sample size is achieved. For example, with an assumed intervention effect of 40% and the low standard deviation of the residuals observed in Study 1 (SD of residuals = 0.37), accounting for baseline sensitivity results in a sample size reduction of approximately 76%, compared to a sample size reduction of 17% when a high noise level (SD of residuals = 1.7) is observed in the correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Study 3: Testing the paradigm: a non-pharmacological pain-relieving intervention study</title><p>In a previous study, we reported that a non-pharmacological gentle touch intervention (brushing a neonate’s leg at a rate of approximately 3 cm/s to optimally stimulate C-tactile fibres) prior to a clinically required heel lance caused a 40% reduction in noxious-evoked brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>). In Study 3, we used the same non-pharmacological intervention in an independent prospective cohort of healthy neonates that clinically required a heel lance for the purpose of blood sampling and tested the effect of incorporating the noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity paradigm and accounting for inter-individual differences in baseline sensitivity. Based on power calculations from simulated data in Study 2, assuming a 40% reduction in noxious-evoked brain activity from the intervention and 95% power, a total of 16 neonates were included in the Intervention Group and were gently brushed on the leg ipsilateral to the stimulus site at a rate of approximately 3 cm/s for 10 s prior to heel lancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>).

As this study was implemented opportunistically following changes in clinical guidelines, responses to experimental noxious stimuli were not recorded in all neonates. Nevertheless, the baseline sensitivity measures that were recorded in response to the experimental noxious stimuli applied prior to paracetamol administration had a range of values that were similar to Studies 1 and 3 (range: 0.09–0.77). Likewise, the magnitude of the brain activity evoked by the immunisations was similar to that evoked by heel lance in the previous studies for both the Intervention Group (Intervention Group [Study 3] range −0.06 to 1.48; Intervention Group [Study 4] range −0.08 to 1.22) and the Control Group (Control Group [Study 3] range 0.30–2.84; Control Group [Study 4] range −0.07 to 2.14). Although we did not record the baseline sensitivity in neonates in the Control Group, in the absence of a pain-relieving intervention, we would expect the response to be correlated with noxious-evoked brain activity evoked by immunisation. As the correlation between baseline sensitivity and response to immunisation was low in the Intervention Group (p=0.12, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.33, n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the relationship between these measures was likely disrupted by paracetamol. Similar to the gentle brush intervention, the neonates with high baseline sensitivity, represented by a high magnitude response to experimental noxious stimulation prior to paracetamol administration, had much lower magnitude responses to immunisation than would have been expected without an analgesic intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Similarly, the correlation between the baseline sensitivity (magnitude of the noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity prior to paracetamol administration) and the response to the experimental noxious stimuli 1 hr post-paracetamol administration was disrupted (p=0.83, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.006, n = 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Noxious-evoked brain activity in response to a low-intensity experimental noxious stimulus can be used in neonates as a marker of baseline sensitivity and is highly correlated with the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity produced by clinically required acute painful procedures. Using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrate that the sample size required to observe the effects of analgesic interventions (for a given power and significance level) can be significantly reduced when noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity is accounted for. Importantly, the percentage reduction in sample size is related to the expected effect size of the intervention and the degree of correlation between the baseline sensitivity measure and the brain activity evoked by the clinical procedure. By testing this novel paradigm in clinical studies, we re-confirm the efficacy of gentle touch as a non-pharmacological intervention that reduces brain activity evoked by heel lancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>) and we provide evidence to suggest that oral paracetamol is a candidate analgesic drug for procedural pain in neonates. Although these studies have a number of limitations (including lack of randomisation) and only investigate one aspect of the neonatal response to noxious input (namely an EEG-derived noxious-evoked potential), they provide strong evidence to suggest that randomised clinical trials investigating the efficacy of both gentle touch and paracetamol through multi-modal pain assessment measures are warranted.</p><p>Minimisation of sample sizes is imperative in clinical research, and particularly in neonatal studies given the inherent ethical, recruitment, and experimental challenges associated with studying this patient population. Considering that inter-individual variability drives increases in sample sizes required to demonstrate efficacy, addressing baseline variability is key. The paradigm we present here likely accounts for multiple factors affecting noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity in neonates including potential effects from prior pain exposure during hospitalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Grunau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnston and Stevens, 1996</xref>) and prematurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Slater et al., 2010a</xref>). This provides a robust approach to indirectly control for a vast array of known and unknown demographic and environmental factors that influence noxious-evoked brain activity and result in inter-individual variability in responses, as well as potential experimental confounds which differ between individuals (such as differences in signal-to-noise ratios, head circumference, and skull thickness). Responses to other modalities such as visual, auditory, or tactile stimuli could be used to obtain a measure of baseline sensitivity, and background resting state brain activity is also predictive of individual noxious-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baxter et al., 2021</xref>). However, the aim of this study was to develop an experimental paradigm that accounts for the maximum variability in responses to acute painful procedures, to maximise the power to detect a true effect of an intervention. Applying an experimental noxious stimulus to obtain a measure of baseline sensitivity optimises the model as it optimally matches the main characteristics of a response that would be evoked by a procedure of clinical interest (e.g. the stimulus can be applied to the same body location, evokes noxious activity as well as other sensory-related brain activity, and it is measured at the same electrode site). Given the study aim was to reduce sample size in studies investigating acute pain, it is most appropriate to adjust for inter-individual variability using measures of noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity. In contrast, if alternative studies considered other sensory modalities, for example, visual processing, then a better measure of inter-individual baseline variability would be achieved using a visual stimulus.</p><p>The experimental noxious stimulus used in these studies provides a practical and ethical paradigm for the assessment of baseline sensitivity in neonates. It is non-tissue damaging in both term and ex-premature neonates, activates A∂ and C fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van den Broeke et al., 2015</xref>), does not evoke changes in facial expression or signs of behavioural distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goksan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartley et al., 2015</xref>), and is acceptable to parents. The application of experimental noxious stimuli provides a reliable measure of baseline sensitivity as the mild stimuli can be repeated and trial averages calculated within individual neonates; an approach that substantially reduces the signal-to-noise ratio as compared with responses recorded in response to a single clinical procedure. Moreover, there is no evidence from our data that the experimental noxious stimuli increase the magnitude of the heel lance response given that the responses to heel lance reported here are similar to previous papers where the experimental noxious stimuli were not applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting it is appropriate for use in a clinical setting. Despite the advantage of using this approach, we cannot rule out the potential effects of selection bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bishop, 2020</xref>). A relatively high number of trials were rejected due to artefacts, which may be more pronounced when there are stimulus-related movements. If these movements are indicative of a more vigorous response to the noxious input, then it is plausible that we are unavoidably biased towards a subset of the population.</p><p>The applicability of the noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity paradigm was tested in the context of a pain-relieving intervention that we have previously shown to be effective in reducing noxious-evoked brain activity – gentle touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>). Neonates were gently brushed at a speed of 3 cm/s, which is approximately equivalent to the rate at which parents will naturally stroke their neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Croy et al., 2016</xref>) and optimises stimulation of C-tactile fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Löken et al., 2009</xref>). In an independent population of neonates, we re-confirmed that brushing the skin prior to a clinically required heel lance significantly reduces noxious-evoked brain activity. We used our noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity paradigm to indirectly account for many factors that influence the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity. In addition, we did not observe a significant difference in reflex withdrawal activity between the control neonates and the neonates who received gentle touch prior to the heel lance, which is consistent with our previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that either the magnitude of the reflex withdrawal is genuinely not modulated by the brush intervention or that a modulation in reflex activity would only be observed with a larger sample size. Importantly, a significant but weak correlation was observed between the reflex activity in response to the noxious stimuli and in response to heel lancing in the Control Group, suggesting that the paradigm presented here could be useful in future trials where reflex withdrawal activity is used as an outcome measure. As pain perception is a highly complex sensory and subjective emotional experience generated in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">IASP, 2020</xref>), quantifying noxious-evoked brain activity may represent a better proxy pain measure, and a more sensitive marker of analgesic efficacy, compared with reflex signals generated by the spinal cord.</p><p>In addition to minimising sample sizes, assessing baseline sensitivity may also allow for identification of neonates that would benefit most from analgesic interventions. Neonates with larger noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity had the greatest reduction in response following the intervention. In contrast, neonates with low baseline sensitivity were less likely to demonstrate a benefit of the intervention, as for this clinical procedure the potential reduction in their responses was minimal. This could be due to a floor effect whereby for some neonates noxious-evoked brain responses to heel lance is close to zero and cannot be reduced further. Improving our understanding of inter-individual variability in pain-related responses is pivotal to ensure that for each individual neonate potential adverse effects of analgesics are carefully weighed against potential benefits.</p><p>In our final study, we demonstrate that paracetamol significantly reduced the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity following immunisation compared with neonates who did not receive paracetamol prior to immunisation. Although this result is consistent with studies in adults, using both EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bromm et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pickering et al., 2013</xref>) and fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pickering et al., 2015</xref>), where paracetamol has been shown to reduce brain activity evoked by noxious procedures, previous studies in neonates have provided insufficient evidence to determine the analgesic efficacy of paracetamol for acute procedural pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohlsson et al., 2020</xref>). While several studies suggest an opioid-sparing effect of paracetamol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ceelie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Härmä et al., 2016</xref>) and reduced need for pain relieveing interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Höck et al., 2020</xref>), the majority of studies do not demonstrate a reduction in behavioural or physiological responses to commonly performed painful procedures, such as heel lancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Badiee and Torcan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bonetto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shah et al., 1998</xref>) and invasive eye examinations to screen for retinopathy of prematurity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seifi et al., 2013</xref>). The behavioural outcome measures used in these studies may fail to discriminate between pain and distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moultrie et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slater, 2019</xref>), which could limit conclusions related to analgesic efficacy. However, given the small sample size of the present study and that we are only characterising the immediate noxious-evoked brain activity following the needle insertion, rather than the activity associated with the injection of the fluid into the muscle for example, randomised clinical trials that also include other pain-related measures are warranted to assess the benefit of paracetamol administration prior to immunisation. Nonetheless, small studies in adults demonstrate that candidate drugs can modulate pain-related neural activity in the absence of verbally reported analgesia, and these brain-derived measures are recognised as a valuable approach to obtain objective evidence related to potential analgesic efficacy in early proof of concept studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wanigasekera et al., 2018</xref>). The noxious-evoked brain activity measure used here quantifies the evoked potential produced at the central vertex electrode site (Cz), which has been shown to have the greatest and most reproducible response size amplitude compared to other electrodes sites across the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verriotis et al., 2016</xref>). This measure does not represent all nociceptive activity across the brain and cannot be used to investigate the various aspects of pain perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>); a multi-modal approach to pain assessment is therefore important in follow-on studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van der Vaart et al., 2019</xref>). However, in the absence of verbalisation, neuroimaging methods provide an objective proxy approach which has been used to infer pain perception following noxious events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baxter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Duff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gursul et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Paracetamol is administered as an antipyretic for the meningitis B immunisations. An update to our local clinical guidelines was implemented, whereby the paracetamol was administered prior to rather than after immunisation. This meant we were able to opportunistically study whether paracetamol can reduce noxious-evoked brain activity following immunisation. Our study is significantly limited due to the restricted sample sizes, lack of randomisation and blinding, and because in the Control Group, where paracetamol was administered after immunisation, we did not record baseline sensitivity prior to immunisation. Therefore, we do not have data to confirm that the baseline sensitivity is correlated with the magnitude of the evoked brain activity following immunisation; although, given there is no discernible correlation between these measures in the Intervention Group, this strongly suggests that this relationship has been disrupted by paracetamol administration. Furthermore, for neonates with high baseline sensitivity, the brain responses evoked by the immunisation were much lower than would be expected in the absence of the analgesic intervention. To broaden the utility of this paradigm, it will be necessary to characterise the correlation between baseline sensitivity and a range of acute clinical procedures, including immunisation.</p><p>Although many factors that influence individual variability in responses are accounted for using our noxious-evoked sensitivity paradigm, it does not account for differences in rapidly fluctuating state effects such as differences in attention or sleep state that could vary between the baseline sensitivity testing and the implementation of the clinical procedure. Understanding how state differences influence variability in noxious-evoked responses will facilitate better estimation of the expected responses to clinically required painful procedures. A recent fMRI study demonstrated that noxious-evoked brain activity can be predicted from a neonate’s resting state brain activity as well as the structural integrity of key white matter pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baxter et al., 2021</xref>). Investigating the role of baseline EEG activity and exploring the neurological differences underlying variability in the noxious-evoked brain activity described here could further improve the utility of the paradigm. In addition, while our paradigm is applicable to many of the most common acute somatic painful procedures which neonates are exposed to including heel lancing, cannulation, and injections, this paradigm may not apply to many types of pain such as visceral pain, post-operative pain, longer procedures, such as retinopathy of prematurity screening, procedures with a slow-rising onset, or chronic pain.</p><p>In summary, the assessment of pain in non-verbal neonates is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Slater, 2019</xref>) and the wide variability in individual responses to painful procedures complicates the assessment of analgesics. Currently there is a paucity of evidence regarding the efficacy of pain-relieving interventions used in neonatal practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baarslag et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we present a paradigm that accounts for individual noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity and we demonstrate its utility in terms of sample size reduction. Using this paradigm in clinical trials could optimise resources, maximise the value of collected data, and ultimately expedite the discovery and validation of urgently needed analgesics for this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>A total of 92 neonates were included in four studies.

In Study 3, brain activity and reflex withdrawal responses from 38 neonates were recorded to test the paradigm with gentle touch as a pain-relief intervention.

The Intervention Group (n = 22) received gentle touch at an approximate rate of 3 cm/s for 10 s before heel lancing and the Control Group (n = 18) did not receive the gentle touch (all neonates received comfort measures including swaddling, non-nutritive sucking, or were held by parent). Gentle touch was not applied prior to the experimental stimuli. The gentle touch stimulus was provided by a brush stimulator (SENSELab Brush-05, Somedic) applied at a rate of approximately 3 cm/s for 10 s prior to heel lancing, across approximately 10 cm of the neonate’s lower leg ipsilateral to the heel receiving the lance. Current evidence suggests that this rate (3 cm/s) optimally activates C-tactile fibres involved in the detection of pleasant touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Essick et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Löken et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Triscoli et al., 2014</xref>) and our previous study demonstrated the efficacy of gentle touch to reduce brain-derived measures following a clinically required heel lance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gursul et al., 2018</xref>). The experimenter was cued to apply the brushing velocity and noxious stimuli by following a computer visualisation coded using PsychoPy. There was an inter-stimulus interval of approximately 1 s between the end of the brush stimulation and the heel lance.</p><p>The magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity and the reflex withdrawal was obtained for each individual trial. Each individual neonates’ baseline sensitivity was calculated as the mean response to the experimental noxious stimulus. EEG responses were rejected for gross movement artefacts. Following removal of neonates whose lances recording were rejected (n = 5), 118 out of 492 responses to experimental noxious stimuli were rejected from the EEG analysis. Individuals with seven or less responses to the experimental noxious stimuli were not included in the analysis (n = 4) as accurate estimates of baseline sensitivity could not be obtained. This left a total of 31 neonates (Control Group: n = 15; Intervention Group: n = 16) for the analysis. Similarly, EMG traces with noise and movement artefacts in the baseline period before the stimulus were rejected. Following removal of neonates whose lances recording were rejected (n = 7), 18 out of 459 responses to experimental noxious stimuli were rejected, leaving a total of 33 neonates (Control Group: n = 18; Intervention Group: n = 15) included in the EMG analysis. The individual baseline reflex sensitivity was calculated as the median reflex response to the experimental noxious stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Study 4: A pharmacological analgesic study</title><p>Premature-born neonates aged 33–43 weeks’ PMA and due to receive immunisations as inpatients in the neonatal unit were recruited for this study. Neonates received diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis, polio, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b, hepatitis B (DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB), meningococcal group B (MenB), and pneumococcal (PCV) intramuscular immunisations at 8 weeks’ postnatal age, DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB immunisations at 12 weeks’ postnatal age, or DTaP/IPV/Hib/HepB, MenB, and PCV at 16 weeks’ postnatal age. Thus, each neonate received one or three injections into one or both thighs. For the week 8 and 16 immunisations where MenB vaccine was due, oral paracetamol (15 mg/kg) was administered for the management of pyrexia, in line with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and British National Formulary for Children (BNFc) guidelines for neonates born at less than 4 kg.</p><p>A total of 16 neonates (Control Group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) were recruited to the study before the clinical practice guidelines were updated in our local neonatal unit to administer paracetamol 1 hr prior to the MenB vaccine. Following the guideline change, 16 neonates were recruited (Intervention Group), and a subset of 11 of the 16 neonates in the Intervention Group also received experimental noxious stimuli before and approximately 1 hr after paracetamol was administered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The average time between paracetamol administration and the second set of experimental noxious stimuli in neonates in the Intervention Group subset was 60 min (range: 52–70 min). The average time between paracetamol administration and immunisation in neonates in the Intervention Group was 79 min (range: 65–117 min). Comfort techniques including swaddling or non-nutritive sucking were used during the immunisation procedures for neonates in both groups.</p><p>EEG was recorded continuously for the duration of the clinical procedure (i.e. immunisation). Needle insertion was time-locked to the EEG recordings using a high-speed video camera (220 frames per second; Firefly MV, Point Grey Research Inc) that was linked to the recording at the time of acquisition. The time of each individual stimulus was identified retrospectively from the video recordings as the first point of contact of the needle with the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hartley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Verriotis et al., 2016</xref>). Due to technical difficulties (high-speed camera failure during set-up) and accidental deletion of a recording, two neonates were removed from the analysis. Recordings with poor video footage (for which the first point of contact of the needle with the skin was unidentifiable) were rejected from the analysis as well as traces with noise or movement artefact. A total of 29 neonates (Control Group: 15 neonates, 32 immunisations; Intervention Group: 14 neonates, 27 immunisations) were included in the final analysis, with nine neonates (18 immunisations) included in the Intervention Group subset. The magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity was identified in each individual trial, and for neonates in the subset of the Intervention Group baseline sensitivity was calculated as the neonate’s mean response to the experimental noxious stimuli prior to paracetamol administration. This was compared to the neonate’s mean response to the immunisations and mean response to the experimental noxious stimulus recorded 1 hr after paracetamol administration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Stimulation techniques/clinical procedures</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Experimental noxious stimuli</title><p>Experimental noxious stimuli (PinPrick, MRC Systems) of 64 mN intensity (Study 1) and 128 mN intensity (Studies 3 and 4) were applied to the plantar surface of the heel.

CURRYscan7 neuroimaging suite (Compumedics Neuroscan) was used to record activity, with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz. EEG was recorded from eight locations on the scalp (Cz, CPz, C3, C4, Oz, FCz, T3, T4), with reference at Fz and ground at Fpz (forehead) according to the modified international 10–20 system. Preparation gel (Nuprep gel, D.O. Weaver and Co.) was used to gently clean the scalp with a cotton bud before disposable Ag/AgCl cup electrodes (Ambu Neuroline) were placed with conductive paste (Elefix EEG paste, Nihon Kohden). In Study 3, surface EMG was recorded from the limb ipsilateral to the site of stimulation. Bipolar EMG electrodes (Ambu Neuroline 700 solid gel surface electrodes) were placed on the bicep femoris muscle.</p><p>EEG signals were filtered from 0.5 to 30 Hz with a notch filter at 50 Hz. Epochs were extracted 500 ms before the stimulus and 1000 ms after and were baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus mean. Epochs were rejected if they contained gross movement artefact. Noxious-evoked brain activity was analysed at the Cz electrode for all trials (as this is the electrode site at which the maximal evoked response is observed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>). The previously validated template of noxious-evoked brain activity was projected onto each individual trial in the time window of interest (400–700 ms after stimulation when the stimulus was applied to the foot, 300–600 ms after stimulation when the stimulus was applied to the thigh – see Methods to validate the template of noxious-evoked brain activity) providing a weight indicating the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>). Each individual trial was first Woody filtered in the time window of interest to achieve maximum correlation with the template, accounting for individual differences in the latency to the response. A maximum jitter of ±50 ms for the experimental noxious stimuli and ±100 ms for the heel lance and immunisations was used for the Woody filtering. In Study 4, additional variation in the latency of the response occurred from the use of the high-speed video camera. To account for this, responses were first Woody-filtered within a neonate to achieve maximum correlation with the within-subject average.</p><p>EMG signals were filtered 10–500 Hz, with a notch filter at 50 Hz and harmonics, and rectified. Epochs were extracted from 2 s prior to 4 s after the stimulus. Individual epochs were rejected due to movement artefact in the baseline period. The data was split into 250 ms windows and the root mean square (RMS) of the reflex signal was calculated in each window. The average RMS across the first four windows after the stimulus (first second after stimulation) was calculated as the magnitude of the reflex withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Methods to validate the template of noxious-evoked brain activity</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Accounting for latency differences when the stimuli is applied to different body sites</title><p>The template of noxious-evoked brain activity has previously been validated for experimental and clinical stimuli applied to the heel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>). As other clinical interventions like immunisations are injected into the neonate’s thigh, the latency to the brain activity response is expected to be shorter compared with stimuli applied to the foot. In an independent sample of 16 neonates aged 36–42 weeks’ PMA (demographic details given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), we investigated the latency of the noxious-evoked brain activity following experimental noxious stimuli applied to the foot, thigh, and hand. A total of 10–12 experimental noxious stimuli (128 mN, inter-stimulus interval of at least 10 s) were applied to the neonate’s hand (n = 16 neonates), foot (n = 16), and thigh (n = 10). The order of the stimulus location and the side were randomly selected by the research team before each test occasion (right = 7, left = 9). In seven studies, the EEG recordings were linked to a high-speed camera (Firefly MV, Point Grey Research Inc) to time-lock the experimental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartley et al., 2015</xref>). In the other nine studies, the stimuli were time-locked to the EEG recordings using a contact trigger device (MRC Systems).</p><p>The EEG signal was filtered 0.5–30 Hz with a notch filter at 50 Hz. Epochs were extracted 500 ms before the stimulus and 1000 ms after (total 1500 ms per epoch), and the traces were baseline-corrected to the pre-stimulus mean. Noxious-evoked brain activity was analysed at the Cz electrode for all the trials. Individual EEG epochs with artefacts were removed from the analysis and neonates with less than five trials on any individual locations were removed from the analysis for that location. The final foot, thigh, and hand analysis included 14, 8, and 14 neonates, respectively.</p><p>Data from all individual trials from all neonates were Woody-filtered in the 0–700 ms interval after the stimulus onset with a maximum shift of ±50 ms (aligning to the average of the data). The average response for each subject to the stimulus and the average background were calculated from the Woody-filtered data. Clusters of timepoints where the noxious stimulus was significantly different from background were identified using a nonparametric cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maris and Oostenveld, 2007</xref>). The cluster-based test statistic was calculated from 1000 random permutations of the data, and the threshold for cluster significance was set as the 97.5 percentile of the permuted data. The midpoint of the cluster was identified and the time window for the principal component analysis (PCA) was taken as the 300 ms window about this midpoint, rounding to the nearest 100 ms, for each of the responses to stimuli applied to the hand, foot, and thigh separately. PCA was performed to identify the principal components (PCs) of the activity in response to the stimuli compared with the background activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bromm and Scharein, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fabrizi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Slater et al., 2010b</xref>) and the PC weights compared between background and the stimulus response using a paired t-test. The first two PCs accounted for over 73% of the variance in the data across all stimulus conditions and were the only components tested. The PC in which the weights were significantly different in response to the noxious stimulus compared with background activity was selected as the noxious-evoked response. This PC and the previously described template of noxious-evoked brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>) were compared using correlation, to demonstrate the validity of using the template to identify noxious-evoked brain activity for stimuli applied to different body locations.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hartley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hartley et al., 2015</xref>), experimental noxious stimuli applied to the foot evoked a cluster of activity that was significantly different from background activity in the time window from 456 to 654 ms after the stimulus (p=0.014, cluster-corrected nonparametric test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Clusters of timepoints where the noxious stimulus was significantly different from background were identified using a nonparametric cluster analysis, with 1000 random permutations of the data, to check that significant noxious-evoked activity was observed in the same time window as that observed in response to experimental noxious stimuli applied to the thigh.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Markus Ploner as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Büchel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dick Tibboel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Absence of any information of individual patients with regards to whether the patients were naive for painful stimuli or not is striking and should be integrated both in the description of the patient groups as well as commented in the discussion part. Equally important is information about differences in post conceptual age of the different patient groups and the earlier experienced painful procedures.</p><p>2. The study claims that the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity elicited by a mild noxious stimulus is a novel measure of baseline nociceptive sensitivity. However, the reverse inference that neural activity observed during a clinically-painful procedure reflects nociceptive processing is not necessarily correct – given that previous studies have convincingly shown that virtually the same pattern of brain activity, both in EEG and fMRI, is observed when no pain (or nociception) is present. Thus, the nociceptive specificity of the findings should be critically discussed in light of recent literature and ongoing discussions of this topic. This discussion should also include a consideration of whether normalizing for amplitudes of brain responses to equally-intense stimuli of other modalities could be also effective to reduce sample sizes. Beyond, it should be explicitly stated that the present findings only refer to a particular type of phasic noxious stimuli but not necessarily to noxious stimuli of other types, e.g. slow-rising stimuli.</p><p>3. The study assumes that the inter-subject variability of the brain responses evoked by a noxious stimulus reflects pain <italic>sensitivity</italic>. However, this claim would require an assessment of the relationship between a gold standard measure of the inter-subject variability in pain reports or pain-related behavior and the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity. Thus, direct evidence that the brain responses to noxious stimuli reflect pain sensitivity is lacking. The more so as the gentle touch intervention in study 3 significantly reduced the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain responses but not of reflex withdrawal activity. This dissociation further questions the relationship between pain sensitivity and brain responses. Thus, the lack of a behavioral effect, the dissociation between behavioral effects and brain responses and the relationship between brain responses and pain should be critically discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting study evaluating the relative role of individualized nociceptive sensitivity in newborns under a variety of conditions used as an argument to decrease the numbers needed for clinical trials.

Taking into account individual nociceptive sensitivity is a long overlooked issue that refers to variability in pain thresholds which might blur the interpretation of the effect of both painfull stimuli as well as therapeutic effects in neonates admitted to ICU's. The four studies are a logical combination of a solid hypothesis generated approach which can be taken into account in future analgesic trials. There are a few comments that might enhance the quality of the manuscript which I like to see in a revised version. Absence of any information of individual patients with regards to whether the patients were naive for painful stimuli or not is striking and should be integrated both in the description of the patient groups as well as commented in the discussion part. Literature data are available on the change of pain thresholds in the course of NICU admission which might have an effect on the individual values that the authors obtained in their studies. Equally important is information about differences in post conceptual age of the different patient groups and the earlier experienced painfull procedures. We know from the literature that the number is closely to ten a day. I feel that this kind of information is essential to reach significant conclusions and the generalizability of their findings for other conditions such as an experimental approach in the near future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Cobo and colleagues address the issue of measuring individual pain sensitivity in infants, and use this measure to improve the design of studies investigating the efficacy of analgesic treatments. The general question of measuring sensory sensitivity is of great interest in fundamental research, and the specific issue of sensitivity in pain experience has potential clinical relevance. For this reason, I accepted the task of assessing this manuscript with enthusiasm. However, when reading the manuscript, a fundamental flaw in the assumptions made by the authors together with a number of other major issues were apparent, as detailed below.</p><p>1. A central argument of the study by Cobo et al. is the claim that the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity elicited by a mild noxious stimulus is a novel measure of baseline nociceptive sensitivity. This claim is based on the similarity between brain activity induced by a noxious stimulus and brain activity induced by a clinically painful procedure (&quot;In Study 1, we demonstrate that the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity in response to an experimental stimulus correlates with the magnitude of brain activity evoked by the clinical procedure and thus reflects baseline nociceptive sensitivity&quot;). The issue here is that the brain activity evoked by a clinically-painful procedure like an abrupt and short-lasting noxious stimulus (heel lance) is considered to reflect nociceptive processing. However, despite it is tempting to conclude that the brain activity observed during a clinically-painful procedure reflects the neural activity subserving nociceptive processing and the pain experience, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, there is a wealth of literature showing that the reverse inference consisting in concluding that the observed pattern of neural activity reflects nociceptive processing is incorrect – given that virtually the same pattern of brain activity, both in EEG and fMRI, is observed when no pain (or nociception) is present (for example, in response to equally salient, but never painful, auditory, tactile, and visual stimuli; see Iannetti and Hu Trends Neurosci 2016).

Most studies were conducted in neonates born at term within the first 6 days after birth and with little prior pain exposure (number of previous painful procedures: study 1: median = 4, study 3: median = 4). Study 4 was conducted in prematurely born neonates aged 56-129 days at the time of the study and who had received a greater number of painful procedures (median = 58). This is information is highly relevant because larger noxious evoked potentials have been observed in infants who are born prematurely compared to those born at term (Slater et al., 2010) and heightened behavioural and motor responses have been described during clustered care in premature infants (Holsti et al., 2006, 2005). In addition, there is evidence to suggest an association between a greater number of painful procedures and lower pain-related behavioural responses within the first month of life (Grunau et al., 2001; Johnston and Stevens, 1996).</p><p>We have edited the manuscript to include this additional information.</p><p>(the page and line numbers provided are in reference to the Merged PDF file)</p><p>• Table 1 has been updated to include gestational age, postnatal age, and postmenstrual age, and prior pain exposure.</p><p>• The following text has been added to the Discussion (page 23, lines 443-446):</p><p>“The paradigm we present here likely accounts for multiple factors affecting noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity in neonates including potential effects from prior pain exposure during hospitalisation (Grunau et al., 2001; Johnston and Stevens, 1996) and prematurity (Slater et al., 2010).”</p><p>• The following text has been added to the Methods to describe how assessment of prior pain exposure was conducted (pages 31-32, lines 627-633):</p><p>“The estimate of cumulative prior pain exposure was quantified from each neonate’s clinical records as the total number of acute skin-breaking procedures (including heel lances, venepuncture, and intravenous cannulations) and aspirations (oropharyngeal or endotracheal) from time of birth to time of study (Hartley et al., 2016).

The study claims that the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity elicited by a mild noxious stimulus is a novel measure of baseline nociceptive sensitivity. However, the reverse inference that neural activity observed during a clinically-painful procedure reflects nociceptive processing is not necessarily correct – given that previous studies have convincingly shown that virtually the same pattern of brain activity, both in EEG and fMRI, is observed when no pain (or nociception) is present. Thus, the nociceptive specificity of the findings should be critically discussed in light of recent literature and ongoing discussions of this topic. This discussion should also include a consideration of whether normalizing for amplitudes of brain responses to equally-intense stimuli of other modalities could be also effective to reduce sample sizes. Beyond, it should be explicitly stated that the present findings only refer to a particular type of phasic noxious stimuli but not necessarily to noxious stimuli of other types, e.g. slow-rising stimuli.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our terminology was unintentionally too specific as our measure of noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity will also account for other factors unrelated to nociceptive processing (such as differences in the signal-to-noise ratio as described in the Discussion). Moreover, while the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity is likely to be closely related to the magnitude of the nociceptive input (Hartley et al., 2015), we do not provide evidence that the signal reflects activity that is nociceptive-specific.</p><p>We have changed the terminology throughout the manuscript and now use the term ‘noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity’ instead of ‘baseline nociceptive sensitivity’.</p><p>• The Introduction has been updated to clarify this definition (page 6, lines 100-109):</p><p>“The term ‘noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity’ is used to refer to differences in individual neonate’s noxious-evoked brain activity. […] In contrast to studies in adults which have shown similar patterns of activity evoked by both painful and non-painful stimuli (Mouraux et al., 2011), we have previously shown that the pattern of brain activity that we analyse here is not evoked by visual, auditory and tactile stimuli which evoke similar levels of physiological arousal (Hartley et al., 2017).”</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that other modalities, such as visual, auditory and tactile stimuli could be used to obtain a measure of baseline sensitivity, and this would account for some variance in the data. This is further supported by recent evidence that background resting-state brain activity is also predictive of an individual’s responses to noxious stimuli (Baxter et al., 2020). However, our objective was to develop a paradigm to optimise studies of analgesic efficacy. Therefore, the most appropriate stimulus to assess baseline sensitivity (which will likely account for the maximum variance in the data) is one with sensory modality matched to the subsequent clinically-required procedure. By recording baseline noxious-evoked activity prior to the painful procedure it is possible to (i) apply the stimuli to the same body site, (ii) record activity that is maximally evoked at the same electrode site and (iii) account for individual differences in somatosensory arousal. While in pain-related studies we consider it most appropriate to use noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity to adjust for inter-individual variability, if we were instead to conduct a vision-related studies we would consider it most appropriate to adjust for inter-individual variability using a visual stimulus.</p><p>• We have added the following text to the Discussion (pages 23-24, lines 451-466) to address this point:</p><p>“Responses to other modalities such as visual, auditory or tactile stimuli could be used to obtain a measure of baseline sensitivity, and background resting state brain activity is also predictive of individual noxious-evoked responses (Baxter et al., 2020). […] In contrast, if alternative studies considered other sensory modalities, for example visual processing, then a better measure of inter-individual baseline variability would be achieved using a visual stimulus.”</p><p>•We agree with the reviewers that our paradigm does not apply to all painful stimuli. We have a dded the following text to the Discussion (page 29, lines 590-595):</p><p>“In addition, while our paradigm is applicable to many of the most common acute somatic painful procedures which neonates are exposed to including heel lancing, cannulation and injections, this paradigm may not apply to many types of pain such as visceral pain, post-operative pain, longer procedures, such as retinopathy of prematurity screening, procedures with a slow-rising onset, or chronic pain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The study assumes that the inter-subject variability of the brain responses evoked by a noxious stimulus reflects pain sensitivity. However, this claim would require an assessment of the relationship between a gold standard measure of the inter-subject variability in pain reports or pain-related behavior and the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity. Thus, direct evidence that the brain responses to noxious stimuli reflect pain sensitivity is lacking. The more so as the gentle touch intervention in study 3 significantly reduced the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain responses but not of reflex withdrawal activity. This dissociation further questions the relationship between pain sensitivity and brain responses. Thus, the lack of a behavioral effect, the dissociation between behavioral effects and brain responses and the relationship between brain responses and pain should be critically discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that our terminology was too specific. Our paradigm is likely to account for variability in signals in non-neural features such as EEG set-up, skull thickness and head size, as well as inter-subject variability in brain responses evoked by the same intensity noxious input. The purpose of the study is to establish a paradigm that adjusts for both these neural and non-neural sources of variance in order to increase statistical power – not to establish the nociceptive-specificity or pain-specificity of the noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity signal. In the absence of verbalisation and a gold standard measure of pain in the neonatal population, our measure cannot be interpreted as variation in the amount of pain experienced by the individual infants. We do not know how much pain a non-verbal infant experiences. While clinical pain scores based on behavioural and autonomic responses are commonly used in infant pain literature, these measures lack specificity to pain or nociception and in the context of the study aims would not represent the main effect of interest.</p><p>With regards to the observation that reflex activity was not modulated by the gentle touch intervention we present three possible explanations:</p><p>(1) It is possible that we are underpowered to observe an effect, given the large variance observed in the reflex withdrawal responses and the weak correlation between the reflex to the experimental stimulus and to the clinical procedure. As stated in the Results, power calculations from the simulations conducted in Study 2 suggest we had power of only 17% to observe a significant difference between the magnitude of reflex withdrawal with the current sample size.</p><p>(2) It is possible that by applying the gentle touch to the leg immediately prior to the noxious procedure the baseline muscle activity and motor reflexes are being affected by this mechanical input, resulting in the larger correlation residuals that are observed in the Intervention Group compared to the Control Group.</p><p>(3) The gentle touch intervention may modulate the noxious-evoked brain activity (similar to distraction or other cognitive manipulations) but does not modulate the signal transmission of the nociceptive signal leading to the brain and therefore does not modulate the motor reflex activity. This is consistent with previous data (Gursul et al., 2018).</p><p>The International Association for the Study of Pain defines analgesia in terms of ‘pain perception’ which is a highly complex sensory and subjective emotional experience generated in the brain (IASP, 2020).

Taking into account individual nociceptive sensitivity is a long overlooked issue that refers to variability in pain thresholds which might blur the interpretation of the effect of both painfull stimuli as well as therapeutic effects in neonates admitted to ICU's. The four studies are a logical combination of a solid hypothesis generated approach which can be taken into account in future analgesic trials. There are a few comments that might enhance the quality of the manuscript which I like to see in a revised version. Absence of any information of individual patients with regards to whether the patients were naive for painful stimuli or not is striking and should be integrated both in the description of the patient groups as well as commented in the discussion part.

The general question of measuring sensory sensitivity is of great interest in fundamental research, and the specific issue of sensitivity in pain experience has potential clinical relevance. For this reason, I accepted the task of assessing this manuscript with enthusiasm. However, when reading the manuscript, a fundamental flaw in the assumptions made by the authors together with a number of other major issues were apparent, as detailed below.</p><p>1. A central argument of the study by Cobo et al. is the claim that the magnitude of the noxious-evoked brain activity elicited by a mild noxious stimulus is a novel measure of baseline nociceptive sensitivity. This claim is based on the similarity between brain activity induced by a noxious stimulus and brain activity induced by a clinically painful procedure (&quot;In Study 1, we demonstrate that the magnitude of noxious-evoked brain activity in response to an experimental stimulus correlates with the magnitude of brain activity evoked by the clinical procedure and thus reflects baseline nociceptive sensitivity&quot;). The issue here is that the brain activity evoked by a clinically-painful procedure like an abrupt and short-lasting noxious stimulus (heel lance) is considered to reflect nociceptive processing. However, despite it is tempting to conclude that the brain activity observed during a clinically-painful procedure reflects the neural activity subserving nociceptive processing and the pain experience, this is not necessarily the case. In fact, there is a wealth of literature showing that the reverse inference consisting in concluding that the observed pattern of neural activity reflects nociceptive processing is incorrect – given that virtually the same pattern of brain activity, both in EEG and fMRI, is observed when no pain (or nociception) is present (for example, in response to equally salient, but never painful, auditory, tactile, and visual stimuli; see Iannetti and Hu Trends Neurosci 2016).

Important points are raised by the reviewer which we have addressed in the revised version of the manuscript. As discussed in our reply to the Essential Revisions, we agree that our original terminology ‘baseline nociceptive sensitivity’ is too specific to nociception. We have standardised the terminology throughout the manuscript and now refer to this activity as ‘noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity’, as the brain activity is evoked by noxious stimulation (Magerl et al., 2001).</p><p>We agree that it is important to have an appropriate control stimulus that can be matched to the noxious stimuli if the aim of the study is to isolate the nociceptive components of the observed activity. This approach has been an important aspect of our previous work in infants, and in contrast to adults where similar patterns of activity are evoked by both painful and non-painful events, in infants the pattern of brain activity that we analyse here is not evoked by other equally arousing sensory stimuli (equivalent in terms of the evoked increase in heart rate) such as visual, auditory and tactile stimulation (Hartley et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the focus of this study is not to isolate a nociceptive-specific component of the response but to record an overall pattern of noxious-evoked brain activity which is more appropriate for adjusting for signal variance to gain statistical power and reduce sample sizes in neonatal analgesic studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Noxious-evoked behavioural activity, reflex withdrawal activity, physiological responses (such as heart rate change) and brain activity do not directly measure neonatal pain. We agree with the reviewer that our measure does not reflect pain sensitivity. The inter-subject variability of brain responses evoked by the noxious stimulus will reflect differences in how the input signal is processed between participants due to both differences in their sensitivity to the stimuli and numerous other factors unrelated to pain and nociception, such as skull thickness. We have updated the terminology to refer to ‘noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity’ rather than ‘baseline nociceptive sensitivity’ throughout and have clarified in the Introduction exactly what we mean by this term. We have also clarified that the goal of the present study is not to establish the specificity of the noxious-evoked EEG signal to pain sensitivity or nociceptive sensitivity, but to describe a noxious-evoked baseline sensitivity signal that can be used to adjust for unwanted EEG signal variance ultimately reducing the sample size required for neonatal analgesia studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
