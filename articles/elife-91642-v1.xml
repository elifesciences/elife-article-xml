Rootlets are critical for the sensory and motile functions of cilia. However, the mechanisms underlying these functions remain unknown, in part due to a lack of structural information of rootlet organization. In this study, we obtain 3D reconstructions of membrane-associated and purified rootlets from mouse retina using cryo-electron tomography. We show that flexible protrusions on the rootlet surface, which emanate from the cross-striations, connect to intracellular membranes. In purified rootlets, the striations were classified into amorphous (A)-bands, associated with accumulations on the rootlet surface, and discrete (D)-bands corresponding to punctate lines of density that run through the rootlet. These striations connect a flexible network of longitudinal filaments. Subtomogram averaging suggests the filaments consist of two intertwined coiled coils. The rootlet’s filamentous architecture, with frequent membrane-connecting cross-striations, lends itself well for anchoring large membranes in the cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>photoreceptor cell</kwd><kwd>cilia</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd><kwd>ciliary rootlet</kwd><kwd>membrane anchoring</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005370</institution-id><institution>Gates Cambridge Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Hoorn</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/210711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_UP_A025_1011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Cilia are connected to centrioles (referred to as basal bodies) which are in turn connected to striated cytoskeletal fibers called rootlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engelmann, 1880</xref>). Rootlets are classified into protist and metazoan types which differ in striated repeat distance, protein composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 1991</xref>), and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Rootlets are essential for the proper functioning of both primary and motile cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). The first evidence for a role in primary cilia came from a partial knockout of the main constituent of rootlets, rootletin (CROCC), in mouse models. This resulted in late-onset blindness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2005</xref>) and increased fragility of the cytoskeleton inside the primary cilium that links the inner and outer segments of photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>). Subsequently, knockout of the rootletin homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (Root) abolished neuronal primary cilia responses such as chemosensing, and touch sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Rootlets are also implicated in mechanosensory signal relay following primary cilia bending in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilbert et al., 2021</xref>). In the case of motile cilia, studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> showed that disruption of a ciliary adhesion complex that tethers rootlets to cortical actin led to disorganized ciliary arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoniades et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yasunaga et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, rootlets appear to provide stability and correct anchorage for primary and motile cilia. Separately, rootlet-like structures are also found in non-ciliated cells where they tether centriole pairs together during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meraldi and Nigg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Rootlets are bundles of filaments with a total width of up to 300 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), being at their widest where they contact centrioles from which they taper into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>). They are characterized by regular cross-striations along their length as observed in resin-sectioning electron microscopy (EM) and immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsson, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagiwara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>). The spacing of striations varies between organisms, with a reported 60 nm repeat in guinea pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsson, 1962</xref>) and 80 nm in human photoreceptor cell rootlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>). Variations of striation repeat length can also occur within single rootlets. For example, in human oviduct cilia, a 1- to 2-µm segment closest to the centrioles contains a 150- to 200-nm repeat that abruptly transitions to a 75- to 100-nm repeat for the rest of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hagiwara et al., 2000</xref>). The functional relevance of the striations remains unknown, but they may be involved in cellular interactions. For instance, mitochondrial cristae have been observed to align with striations when mitochondria contact rootlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsson, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2021</xref>). Other membrane connections are suggested from EM cross-sections of resin-embedded rootlets which reveal they are surrounded by membrane saccules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>).</p><p>The filaments which make up rootlets are assumed to be comprised of rootletin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Surkont et al., 2015</xref>). This coiled-coil protein is predicted to have a length of &gt;200 nm and immunofluorescence shows its N- and C-termini align in repeating interdigitated bands along the rootlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>). Rootletin contains four predicted coiled-coil domains (CC1–4) of which CC2, 3, and 4 were shown to homodimerize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). There is currently disagreement as to whether CC1 is a coiled coil or a globular domain and whether it contributes directly to striation formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Studies on non-ciliated cell rootlets suggest the other main components are CEP68 and CCDC102B which immunoprecipitate with rootletin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). CEP68 is predicted to be mostly unstructured with an N-terminal three-helix spectrin-like fold. Immunofluorescence suggests it is found regularly spaced along the rootlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>). CCDC102B contains three coiled-coil stretches, with a total length of approximately 42 nm, separated by disordered regions. Depletion of either CEP68 or CCDC102B results in thinner splayed rootlets, suggesting they are required for bundling the rootlet filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). Additional components link rootlets to cellular structures. C-Nap1 (CEP250) is a long coiled-coil protein and paralog of rootletin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fry et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>) which connects rootlets to the base of centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahen, 2021</xref>). At the other end, the outer nuclear membrane protein Nesprin1α links the rootlet to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite our knowledge of rootlet components, our 3D understanding of how rootlets are formed is limited. A key question is what the individual rootlet filaments look like and how they pack within the rootlet network. Moreover, it is not known what features of the ultrastructure give rise to regular striations. To address these questions, we used a partially purified sample and further purified native rootlets from mouse photoreceptor cells and assessed their organization with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of mouse photoreceptor cell rootlets</title><p>The retinas of the eyes contain photoreceptor cells made up of inner and outer segments joined by a short primary cilium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

For improved contrast, we denoised the tomograms using Noise2Map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tegunov and Cramer, 2019</xref>), followed by deconvolution and isotropic reconstruction using IsoNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cross-striations contact membranes</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>), rootlet striation repeat and morphology appear unaltered by the purification method. Moreover, they are proposed to maintain aspects of their native interactions with cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>). To understand how the filaments and striations in rootlets connect to membranes, we turned to high-resolution cryo-ET.</p><p>In the two tomograms we analyzed in detail, we observed rootlets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) flanked by membranes, vesicles, and stretches of the plasma membrane. Although the tomograms were noisy we could identify longitudinal filaments (orange arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and some cross-striations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, yellow arrowheads). We realized that the cross-striations are faint in single slices and therefore performed a segmentation of the entire tomogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) by training the TomoSeg convolutional neural network of eman2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). This revealed many perpendicular densities that weave between the longitudinal filaments, forming an intricate network.</p><p>All the striations partially or fully spanned the width of the rootlet and extended beyond the outermost longitudinal filaments. These rootlet-protruding striation densities frequently contacted the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Close examination suggested some make a direct contact, whereas others contact a subset of globular membrane-associated densities that are a striking feature of the tomograms. These densities are ~7 nm in diameter and cover almost every membrane surface. Where membranes come into proximity, the intervening space is filled with two layers of these membrane-associated proteins, one layer associated with each membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, blue arrowheads). We trained a TomoSeg neural network to assign these densities and let this network compete with one that assigned striations. This resulted in a final segmentation with membrane-associated densities indicated in blue and striations in yellow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). The proteinaceous protrusions that extended from the rootlets were flexible and did not induce a regular spacing in the membrane-associated proteins they contacted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Thus, densities that contribute to the cross-striations protrude from the rootlet and appear able to flexibly tether it to its surrounding membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rootlets contain two types of cross-striations</title><p>Due to the ice-thickness and the presence of membranes, the tomograms had limited contrast.

A repeat pattern is immediately obvious, revealing features that have not been observed before. Each repeat consists of two types of bands: two discrete (D)-bands, which we named D1 and D2, and one wider, amorphous (A)-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The A-bands were frequently associated with tufts of material that extended away from the rootlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>We were also able to see these bands with cryo-ET. The striations in the purified rootlets appeared more ordered and clearer than in the cellular tomograms due to the improved contrast. In the cellular rootlets, we identified the bands in a tomogram projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), with an average distance of 79.52 ± 0.26 nm between each repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The repeat distance for the purified rootlets is 80.1 ± 0.03 nm based on a sine fit to A- and D-bands of 10 Fourier-filtered tomogram projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E–I</xref>).

The banding pattern is asymmetric within the 80.1 nm repeat. The D1- and D2-bands are 23.9 nm apart, followed by an 18.0-nm distance between D2- and the A-band. Between the A-band and D1 of the next repeat we measured a 38.1-nm distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H, J</xref>). We examined three rootlets in which either the centriole or rootlet tip was visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). In all three cases, the D1-band is closest to the centriole and the A-band to the tip. This polar arrangement of striations can be used as a marker for rootlet orientation and supports the previously proposed polar assembly of the rootlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahe et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The D-bands are punctate and connect filaments</title><p>The D-bands are clearly visible in tomogram slices through the center of purified rootlets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) revealing they span throughout the interior. We see them embedded within the array of longitudinal filaments that run along the rootlet’s length. Both D1 and D2 are made up of punctate densities directly associated with the longitudinal filaments (e.g. white arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The punctate densities laterally connect with each other via thin protrusions (yellow arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This suggests the D-bands form lateral connections that bundle the rootlet filaments.</p><p>In the example shown, the rootlet splays into two separate sub-fibers with the space in between them indicated by a black arrowhead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is consistent with observations of rootlets splaying and merging in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>). In this case, the D1-, D2-, and A-bands are aligned between the two sub-fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, we also observed rootlets where neighboring sub-fibers are offset in their banding pattern. In other words, their D1-bands line up with and connect to neighboring D2-bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). A more complicated example of merging sub-fibers is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>. Here, two sub-fibers (sf1 and sf2) merge with their D1-bands aligned. Sub-fiber 3 (sf3), which lies behind sf1, aligns its D2-band with the D1-band of sf1. In contrast, the fourth sub-fiber (sf4) does not align any D-bands with its neighboring sf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>).</p><p>From a set of 48 tomograms that show sub-fibers, we found D1 aligns with D1 in 22 cases, D1 aligns with D2 in 17 cases and the remainder of cases show no particular alignment between D-bands (9 cases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

However, these were both fuzzier and broader than the D-bands and not always picked up in the segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I</xref>). Occasionally, these connections appeared as two parallel lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>, green arrowheads), but more often their density was discontinuous.</p><p>In our tomograms, we see large amorphous accumulations of variable size on the rootlet surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F, H</xref>). These correspond to the tufts observed in negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When the internal part of the rootlet is masked out these amorphous densities are clearly heterogeneous, but overall follow a banding pattern with 80 nm spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G–I</xref>). The average position of these surface bands aligns with that of the interior A-band densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>). Additionally, the surface densities show evidence of connecting to the A-bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2J</xref>).</p><p>We did not identify amorphous densities on the surface of rootlets that were surrounded by membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>), which suggests these features accumulate during the purification.

Stitching the overlapping fragments together predicts that rootletin is ~265 nm long and would be expected to extend through three striated repeats of the rootlet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The width of the rootletin dimer did not exceed ~1.3 nm which suggests multiple copies of rootletin may be needed to form the ~5-nm-thick filaments we frequently observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Filament subtomogram average is consistent with two coiled-coil dimers</title><p>To characterize the nature of the individual filaments in our tomograms we performed subtomogram averaging. Based on the strong longitudinal regularity in the rootlet, we assumed that each 80.1 nm repeat contains the same features that can potentially be averaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The bands in these repeats approximate surfaces that section through the rootlet. Keeping in mind that the D1- and D2-bands may tether the filaments together, we expected a higher order of organization along this band. Since the D2-band is closer to the less regular A-band, we experienced difficulties obtaining consistent averages centered around this region. Thus, we extracted subtomograms centered around each D1-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) using tools developed for extracting objects from membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leneva et al., 2021</xref>). We manually defined the D1-bands as surfaces in Dynamo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castaño-Díez et al., 2017</xref>) and then approximated the number of filaments per surface area. We extracted 591,453 subtomograms from 14 tomograms, approximately four times as many subtomograms as the expected number of filaments. This initial set was rigorously cleaned to discard particles that did not have a filament in their center or had distorted striations, reducing it to 358,863 particles. Further cross-correlation and cluster cleaning yielded a final set of 180,252 particles.</p><p>In the initial subtomogram averages, we saw strong densities for the D-bands and longitudinal filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). A central longitudinal filament density was well defined, although the density for its neighboring filaments was not continuous and did not extend beyond the alignment mask (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We attempted to improve the average by using a narrower mask to include only the nearest neighbors of the central filament, but this only marginally improved features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). To ask if there were any recurring arrangements of neighboring filaments in the data that could allow us to average a homogeneous subset, we resorted to classification of the original set of 591,453 particles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The resulting classes described various filament arrangements with a distance between the filament centers ranging from 6.8 to 9.6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, none of the classes formed a regular grid that extended outside of the classification mask. Our data suggest neighboring longitudinal filaments are flexibly associated consistent with our observations in the tomogram segmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Since the filaments have a variable arrangement, high-resolution features of the individual filaments will be obscured in the alignment of a filament array. Therefore, we focused the alignment on single filaments to obtain structural information. To be able to average these filaments we avoided using a conventional low-pass filter step in order to preserve the coiled-coil features that are necessary for driving the alignment. We directly unbinned the data to a pixel size of 5.55 Å/pixel and used the rigorously cleaned set of 180,252 particles. To ensure unbiased alignment of any coiled-coil features we generated a smooth reference by randomizing the inplane rotational orientation of the particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Initial refinement of the data resulted in an anisotropic structure since the filaments did not have enough features to align to. Therefore, we performed classification with alignment in RELION 4.0 alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zivanov et al., 2022</xref>), and used a narrow 3.3-nm-wide mask with a smooth edge up to 7.7 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). This was the narrowest mask that still resulted in an isotropic structure and revealed features that were absent in the smooth reference. The resulting class averages contained a twist along the filament length in classes 2–4 and most prominently in class 5. These four classes contain 72.29% of the particles, highlighting the prevalence of the twist-feature (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Class 5 contained 19.27% of the data, that is 34,490 particles, and revealed the twist is formed by a filament of 2 nm thick by 5 nm wide with a helical groove along its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>The groove in the average suggests the filaments consist of two intertwined rods. To see if the density matches the dimensions of multiple coiled-coil dimers, we fitted two copies of the tropomyosin crystal structure into our density (from PDB: 2TMA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Phillips, 1986</xref>). This was not a perfect fit due to the curvature of the crystal structure, but it showed that our density is consistent with the dimensions of two intertwined coiled coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Other crystal structures of two coiled-coil dimers (lamin and rootletin CC3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>) equally fit well in parts of the density. This suggests the longitudinal filaments contain an oligomerization interface where coiled coils intertwine with each other. This interface extends along the 50 nm length of the average. Taken together, our subtomogram averaging and segmentations suggest that the network of rootlet filaments can be held together by lateral interactions between pairs of coiled-coil dimers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The metazoan rootlet is a cilium-associated fiber that is characterized by regular cross-striations.

It consists of four coiled-coil domains (CC1–4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Crystal structures of CC3 fragments showed them to be obligate homodimers, even stabilized by the presence of disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Initial work suggested the N-terminal region (CC1) may be a globular N-terminus that contributes to the cross-striation pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2017</xref>). Our AlphaFold predictions of dimeric rootletin fragments suggest rootletin forms an extended coiled coil for its entire length. Like other recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>), we suggest the N-terminus forms a coiled coil instead of a globular domain.</p><p>We propose that the thick filaments which run throughout the rootlet are parallel bundles of pairs of rootletin coiled coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed density consistent with this in our subtomogram averaging around the D1 striation. Segmentation of tomograms suggested the thick filaments are found throughout the rootlet 80 nm repeat suggesting the lateral interaction of pairs of coiled coils extends beyond the D1 striation. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>) and yeast-2-hybrid studies on rootletin suggest each of the CC2, CC3, and CC4 fragments, but not the N-terminal CC1 fragments, can interact with themselves. In our model, we have therefore shown rootletin coiled coils forming paired bundles between CC2 and CC4, but separating in their CC1 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Our segmentations show that thick filaments can separate into thin filaments, which are then able to merge with other thin filaments to reform thin filaments. We propose that this network formation is due to the ability of individual rootletin coil coils to separate and reform lateral, pairwise, interactions with the relevant part of other rootletin coiled coils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>In the crystal structure of the rootletin CC3 fragment, two pairs of coiled coils pack together in an antiparallel arrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Although we cannot rule out such an arrangement, in our model we propose that the rootletin coiled coils all run parallel to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This underlying polar arrangement of rootletin filaments most easily accounts for the asymmetric pattern of cross-striations we see in each repeat: where the A-band is closer to the D2-band than the neighboring D1-band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We assume the N-termini of rootletin are pointing away from the centriole as immunogold labeling of the rootletin N- and C-termini that showed the N-termini localized further away from the centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bahe et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, we expect that a parallel orientation of rootletin filaments is seeded at the centriole and persists throughout the rootlet filament network.</p><p>The 80.1 nm striated repeat in the rootlet is much shorter than the predicted length of rootletin (~265 nm). To allow for such a repeat with a much longer molecule, an individual rootletin may have an 80.1 nm longitudinal offset of its domains to the neighboring rootletin molecule, consistent with Immunofluorescence that found a ~76 nm distance between the N-termini along the rootlet length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>). This creates a model of staggered alignment of rootletin molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that CC2, CC3, and CC4 only weakly interact with the other coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ko et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we propose that there are only minor interactions between the offset rootletin coiled coils and instead they require intermediary proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Although cross-striations are a defining feature of rootlets, previous work did not identify the two distinct types. The D-bands we report most closely match the striations reported in a cellular cryo-ET study of intact human photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>). However, this previous study did not identify a third band. In contrast, our A-band appears similar to those found by resin-section EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>), due to their less regular and wider appearance.</p><p>The D-bands are formed of punctate densities attached to the longitudinal filaments and are laterally interconnected by elongated densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Due to the similar appearance and alignment of the D1- and D2-bands, we suggest they may have the same composition. The presence of two D-bands per repeat, in contrast to the rootletin N-terminus that appears once per repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>), suggests the D-bands are not composed of rootletin. Our combined findings lead us to propose that the D-bands are formed by a protein, other than rootletin, that bundles rootletin into oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Candidates for the D-bands are the CEP68 and CCDC102B, which were identified as critical components to assemble and bundle rootlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>). The depletion of CCDC102B and CEP68 independently resulted in splayed fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Vlijm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), and a lack of interaction between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>) suggests they form separate rootletin bundling connections. AlphaFold predictions of CEP68 show its C-terminal alpha helices form a three-helix spectrin repeat, while the majority of the protein (residues 1–615) is predicted to be unstructured. Centlein was found to be required for the recruitment of CEP68 to the rootlet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fang et al., 2014</xref>). However, this may be through an indirect interaction as our AlphaFold predictions do not find any interaction between CEP68 and any combination of centlein and rootletin fragments.</p><p>CCDC102B is a coiled-coil protein that, as a dimer, forms two confidently predicted coiled coils interspaced by a disordered region. It interacts with three different fragments of rootletin in co-immunoprecipitation experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2018</xref>), indicating a minimum of three separate interaction sites. The extended morphology of CCDC102B is incompatible with the punctate features we observe in the tomograms but would be consistent with the lateral connections between the D-band puncta. Thus, while the identity of the D-band densities remains unknown, we show that they laterally connect twice per 80.1 nm repeat to form a link between interspaced longitudinal filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>In our model, we propose that the rootletin N-terminus aligns with the A-band and contains putative membrane connection sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In striated fibers that formed upon rootletin overexpression, deletion of this N-terminal region removed the single prominent band per striation repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyama et al., 2017</xref>). On the rootlet surface, centered around the A-bands, we found amorphous densities, that were absent in the cellular rootlet tomograms. We propose these amorphous densities accumulated during the purification or are aggregates of the membrane-associated proteins onto major membrane interaction sites in the A-band. Furthermore, in some tomograms, we saw evidence of thin projections extending from the rootlet A-band to contact these amorphous densities.</p><p>A number of membrane interactions with the rootlet have been reported, including the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>), mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsson, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2021</xref>), and membrane saccules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>) which may be the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilliam et al., 2012</xref>). Potential candidates for making these links are Kinesin Light Chain 3 (KLC3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>) and Nesprin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>) which both interact with the rootletin N-terminus. KLC3 interacts with rootletin in CoIP experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang and Li, 2005</xref>) and its associated Kinesin heavy chain, Kif5, colocalized with the rootlet in immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yang and Li, 2005</xref>). A Nesprin1 isoform, Nesprin1α, connects the rootlet to the nucleus via its C-terminal KASH domain that interacts with the inner nuclear envelope protein SUN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>). Larger isoforms of Nesprin1 were detected along the length of the rootlet in ependymal and tracheal cell types that expressed both KASH-containing and KASH-less variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Potter et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Thin-sectioning EM of rootlet cross-sections previously showed a high variability of overall rootlet shape. They do not form a coherent round bundle but are often split, flattened, indented, or surrounded by mitochondria and membrane compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, rootlets can splay apart and rejoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hayes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spira and Milman, 1979</xref>), consistent with our observation of their branching into sub-fibers and heterogeneity in classification. This flexibility may provide rootlet fibers the capacity to extend between and tether organelles without restricting organelle shape.</p><p>In conclusion, our use of cryo-ET reveals the rootlet to be built of a highly flexible network of filaments connected by three types of cross-striation bands. Cross-striation bands protrude from the rootlet and connect to membranes. The combination of segmentation and subtomogram averaging has let us propose a new model for the rootlet’s ultrastructure and its membrane connections that will provide the basis for understanding its function and how it is assembled.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Retinal dissection</title><p>Eight to ten eyes from adult pigmented mice were freshly obtained from the in-house animal facility and kept in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline.

The corneas were pierced with sharp tweezers and removed by careful tearing along the corneoscleral junction, followed by the removal of the iris in a similar fashion.

The tomograms were then deconvolved and isotropically reconstructed with denoising using IsoNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>) with a cube size of 128 pixels. The tomograms were then preprocessed in EMAN2.2 for training of the TomoSeg CNN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Here, the features (filaments, D-bands, A-bands, gold fiducials, actin, membranes, membrane-associated densities, and ice contaminations) were individually trained for each tomogram. This involved manually tracing a training set of 10–20 positive and 100–150 negative boxed areas per feature. We iteratively expanded and curated the training set until the segmentations were accurate, as recommended in the software manuals. Segmented maps were allowed to compete for the assignment of pixels in the tomograms, cleaned up in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and converted to object files. The object files and corresponding tomograms were displayed in ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pettersen et al., 2021</xref>). Assignment of direct and indirect striation–membrane connections was done manually by assessing whether TomoSeg-segmented striations and membranes were connected directly or via membrane-associated densities.

Striations have been observed in rootlets, but their assembly, composition, and function remain unknown. While previous research has explored rootlet structure and organization, this study delivers an unprecedented level of resolution, valuable to the centrosome and cilia field. The authors isolated rootlets from mice's eyes. They apply EM to partially purified rootlets (first negative stain, then cryoET). From these micrographs, they observed striations along the membranes along the rootlet but no regular spacing was observed.</p><p>The thickness of the sample and membranes prevented good contrast in the tomograms. Thus they further purified the rootlets using detergent, which allowed them to obtain cryoET micrographs of the rootlets with greater details. The tomograms were segmented and further processed to improve the features of the rootlet structures. They proposed that a number of proteins, including rootletin, form parallel coiled coils that run along the rootlet longitudinally. They described how the cross-striations form 3 types of periodic structures -D1/D2/A bands- connected perpendicularly to filaments along the length of the rootlets and to membranes. Overall their data provide a detailed model for the molecular organization of the rootlet.</p><p>The major strength is that this high-quality study uses state-of-the-art cryo-electron tomography, sub-tomogram averaging, and image analysis to provide a model of the molecular organization of rootlets. The micrographs are exceptional, with excellent contrast and details, which also implies the sample preparation was well optimized to provide excellent samples for cryo-ET. The manuscript is also clear and accessible.</p><p>This research marks a significant step forward in our understanding of rootlets' molecular organization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91642.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Hoorn</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Carter</surname><given-names>Andrew P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>In the revision the authors addressed all the points from this reviewer and most from other reviewers. The method is now described practically and in detail. The only thing this reviewer still misses is number of subtomograms for each structure. How many subtomograms did the authors extract by Dynamo from how many rootlets? How many out of them were valid in K-mean classification and used for sub-averages? Was the subaverage used for training by TomoSeg or each subtomograms belonging to the class? By clarifying it, this work will be referred by those who would take the same approach for other biological structures.</p></disp-quote><p>We now added the particle numbers of all structures to the corresponding text, figure legends and methods and elaborate on this below. We also clarify how we trained the TomoSeg network.</p><p>Particle numbers:</p><p>We extracted 591,453 subtomograms from 14 tomograms. This initial set was rigorously cleaned with Zcleaning, reducing it to 358,863 particles. Further cross-correlation and cluster cleaning yielded a final set of 180,252 particles.</p><p>This refined set was used for the structures presented in Figures 3E, F and S5A, B, as well as for the classification shown in Figure S5C. Of the classified particles, 34,490 particles contributed to classaverage 5 in Figure 3G and S5D, E. The detailed particle distribution of this classification is added as a supplementary table:</p><p>We further clarified the numbers in the results, method, and supplementary material section:</p><p>Results:</p><p>Page 7: “Figure 3. … (E) The initial average after alignment of 180,252 particles with a wide spherical alignment mask. (F) The initial average of particles aligned with a narrower cylindrical mask. (G) A class average of 34,490 particles, aligned and classified with a narrow mask.”</p><p>Page 7/8: “We manually defined the D1-bands as surfaces in Dynamo (Castaño-Díez et al, 2017) and then approximated the number of filaments per surface area. We extracted 591,453 subtomograms from 14 tomograms, approximately four times as many subtomograms as the expected number of filaments. This initial set was rigorously cleaned to discard particles that did not have a filament in their center or had distorted striations, reducing it to 358,863 particles. Further cross-correlation and cluster cleaning yielded a final set of 180,252 particles.”</p><p>Page 8: “We directly unbinned the data to a pixel size of 5.55 Å/pixel and used the rigorously cleaned set of 180,252 particles.”</p><p>Page 8: “The resulting class averages contained a twist along the filament length in classes 2, 3 and 4 and most prominently in class 5. These four classes contain 72.29% of the particles, highlighting the prevalence of the twist-feature (Fig S5C, Table S2). Class 5 contained 19.27% of the data, i.e. 34,490 particles, and revealed the twist is formed by a filament of 2 nm thick by 5 nm wide with a helical groove along its length (Fig 3G).”</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Page 13: “Surface triangulation was set to result in 591,453 extraction coordinates approximately 4 times the number of expected filaments.”</p><p>Page 13: “Particles with no filament in their center, or particles that originated from regions in the rootlet with distorted striations (at the edge of a grid hole) were discarded, resulting in a particle set of 358,863 particles. Cluster- and careful per-tomogram cross-correlation cleaning were applied to remove particle duplicates, remaining particles with no filaments, and particles with disordered D-bands. This resulted in a final cleaned particle dataset of 180,252 particles.”</p><p>Page 13: “For the final subtomogram class-average that contained the twist, the cleaned particle dataset motl with 180,252 particles was converted to a STAR file compatible with RELION 4.0 Alpha (Zivanov et al, 2022).”</p><p>Supplementary material:</p><p>Page 17: “Table S1. Particle distribution of RELION 4.0 Alpha classification with alignment.”</p><p>Page 22: “Figure S5: (C) Class averages of a classification with alignment of particles from Fig S5A. Their particle distribution is shown in Table S2.”</p><p>For the initial classification, to identify a homogeneous subset, we used the original set of 591,453 picked particles (Fig S5A). The class distribution for this set is added as a supplementary table.</p><p>We further clarified this in the results, methods and supplementary material:</p><p>Results:</p><p>Page 8: “To ask if there were any recurring arrangements of neighboring filaments in the data that could allow us to average a homogeneous subset, we resorted to classification of the original set of 591,453 particles (Fig S5A, Table S1).”</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Page 13: “Prior to classification in subTOM, alignments with limited X/Y/Z shifts and increasingly finer in-plane rotations were performed on the original dataset with 591,453 particles.”</p><p>Supplementary material:</p><p>Page 17: “Table S2. Particle distribution of subTOM classification for particle heterogeneity.”</p><p>Page 22: “Figure S5: … The surfaces of a cross-section through the filament classes are shown in orange. The particle distribution is provided in Table S1.

TomoSeg training requires positive and negative sets of segmented 2D regions of interest within tomogram slices. These areas were selected and segmented within the Eman2 TomoSeg GUI, iteratively increasing the size of the training sets until satisfactory performance was achieved.</p><p>We have clarified the TomoSeg training process in the methods section to avoid confusion:</p><p>Methods:</p><p>Page 13: “The tomograms were then preprocessed in EMAN2.2 for training of the TomoSeg CNN (Chen et al, 2017). Here, the features (filaments, D-bands, A-bands, gold fiducials, actin, membranes, membrane-associated densities and ice contaminations) were individually trained for each tomogram. This involved manually tracing a training set of 10-20 positive and 100-150 negative boxed areas per feature. We iteratively expanded and curated the training set until the segmentations were accurate, as recommended in the software manuals. Segmented maps were allowed to compete for the assignment of pixels in the tomograms, cleaned up in Amira (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and converted to object files.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
