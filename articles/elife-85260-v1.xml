is a conserved process through which pain sensitivity threshold is adjusted based on past sensory experience and which may be dysregulated in human chronic pain conditions. Noxious heat habituation in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> involves the nuclear translocation of CaM kinase-1 (CMK-1) in the FLP thermo-nociceptors neurons, causing reduced animal heat sensitivity and avoidance responses. The phosphorylation of CMK-1 on T179 by CaM kinase kinase-1 (CKK-1) is required for nuclear entry. Recently, we identified a specific nuclear export sequence (NES) required to maintain CMK-1 in the cytoplasm at rest (20°C) and showed that Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding is sufficient to enhance CMK-1 affinity for IMA-3 via a specific nuclear localization signal (NLS) in order to promote nuclear entry after persistent heat stimulation (90 min at 28°C) (Ippolito et al., 2021). Here, we identified additional functional NES and NLS on CMK-1, whose activity can counteract previously identified elements. Furthermore, we clarify the relationship between the CaM-binding-dependent and T179-dependent effects. T179 phosphorylation can promote nuclear entry both downstream of CaM binding and as part of an independent/parallel pathway. Moreover, T179 phosphorylation can also produce the opposite effect by promoting nuclear export. Taken together, our studies suggest that multiple calcium-dependent regulatory mechanisms converge to bias the activity pattern across a network of NES/NLS elements, in order to control CMK-1 nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, and actuate stimulation-dependent nociceptive plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nociceptive plasticity</kwd><kwd>thermosensation</kwd><kwd>calcium signaling</kwd><kwd>protein subcellular localization</kwd><kwd>CaM kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BSSGI0_155764</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PP00P3_150681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_197607</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Glauser</surname><given-names>Dominique A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A refined analysis of the mechanisms controlling CaM kinase-1 subcellular localization in sensory neurons, a cell-autonomous process known to control nociceptive plasticity and to adjust avoidance behaviors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) are conserved effectors of the universal calcium second messenger, mediating important plasticity effects in the nervous system. In response to neuronal activation, these kinases phosphorylate diverse intracellular substrates in order to actuate changes in cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Soderling, 1999</xref>). CaMKI includes an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain, which inhibits its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Goldberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hook and Means, 2001</xref>). This auto-inhibition is released upon binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM in the regulatory domain and the kinase can be fully activated after phosphorylation of a specific threonine in the activation loop (T177 in human) by CaMK kinase I (CaMKKI). In mammals, CaM binding on CaMKI is a prerequisite prior to the phosphorylation of T177. The <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> CaMKI (named CMK-1) displays similar structural and functional properties, with a conserved activation loop threonine (T179 in the worm sequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Eto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kimura et al., 2002</xref>). CMK-1 mediates multiple plasticity mechanisms, including during salt aversive learning, habituation to repeated mechanical stimulations, and thermal adaptation to innocuous and noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardiel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Neal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Satterlee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). The subcellular localization of CMK-1 can be regulated in a stimulus-dependent manner in different contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Neal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The role and the mechanisms controlling CMK-1 subcellular localization have been so far best characterized in FLP thermo-nociceptor neurons where CMK-1 regulates nociceptive habituation. Previous experiments conducted in transgenic animals expressing different CMK-1 mutants in FLP with constitutive nuclear or cytoplasmic localization notably showed that CMK-1 activity in the cytoplasm promotes heat avoidance response, while its activity in the nucleus acts antagonistically to reduce heat avoidance response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). In wild type worms exposed to innocuous temperature (20°C), CMK-1 resides mostly in the FLP cytoplasm, where it promotes high sensitivity to heat and robust avoidance responses. Upon persistent noxious heat stimulation (90 min at 28°C) CMK-1 progressively translocates in the nucleus, where it acts to reduce the animal heat sensitivity and dampen avoidance responses. In our recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>), we identified two key intrinsic determinants of CMK-1 that control localization in FLP. First, the NES<sup>288-294</sup> canonical nuclear export sequence of CMK-1, located immediately adjacent to the CaM-binding domain in the regulatory domain and representing a major determinant of CMK-1 cytoplasmic localization at 20°C. Second, the NLS<sup>71-78</sup> canonical nuclear localization sequence, located on the N-terminal catalytic domain of CMK-1, and which can interact with IMA-3 importin in vitro. We furthermore showed that the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM on CMK-1 can strengthen its interaction with IMA-3 importin via NLS<sup>71-78</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>), constituting a calcium-dependent mechanism through which thermosensory activity causes CMK-1 nuclear accumulation. Previous studies also suggested a second calcium-dependent mechanism involving the <italic>C. elegans</italic> CaMKKI (named CKK-1) and CMK-1 phosphorylation on T179. Indeed, a T179A mutation on CMK-1 as well as a null mutation in the <italic>ckk-1</italic> gene can both decrease CMK-1 nuclear accumulation at 28°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanisms linking T179 phosphorylation to CMK-1 nuclear entry were still unclear. Furthermore, whereas the NES<sup>288-294</sup>/NLS<sup>71-78</sup> sequence pair plays a major role, several lines of evidence indicate that additional, uncharacterized elements are also involved. Here, we expand the characterization of the mechanisms controlling CMK-1 localization in FLP neurons to (i) identify remaining CMK-1 elements working as secondary NES and NLS and (ii) better understand the role played by T179 phosphorylation. Our results elucidate how the interplay between multiple, antagonistic pathways are integrated to control CMK-1 localization, and furthermore suggest new regulation opportunities that might be used in other neurons and contexts, in order for CMK-1 localization to integrate different signaling inputs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Additional elements antagonize NLS<sup>71-78</sup>/NES<sup>288-294</sup> -dependent regulation of CMK-1 localization</title><p>Our previous studies identified NES<sup>288-294</sup> as the major determinant of CMK-1 cytoplasmic localization at 20°C, and NLS<sup>71-78</sup> as the main drive for CMK-1 nuclear entry after calcium increase at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> schematic) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>). A series of previous observations also suggested that a layer of secondary localization determinants might also play a role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>). The presence of additional functional elements is most strikingly illustrated in an NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant lacking the two main regulatory regions. This double mutant is slightly enriched in the nucleus at 20°C and translocates in the cytoplasm at 28°C, corresponding to a reverted behavior as compared to wild type CMK-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The simplest explanation for this behavior would involve a secondary pair of antagonistic NES/NLS determinants, whose activity becomes predominant only when the major drives (NES<sup>288-294</sup>/NLS<sup>71-78</sup> -dependent pathways) are deactivated. In order to identify these secondary elements, we conducted further mutagenesis analyses in the CMK-1 NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant background.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Multiple nuclear export sequence (NES) and nuclear localization signal (NLS) elements work in concert to regulate CaM kinase-1 (CMK-1) localization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of CMK-1 with positions of the tested NES and NLS candidates and their sequence.

We previously identified NLS<sup>297-307</sup> as a secondary canonical NLS making a minor contribution to the heat stimulus-evoked nuclear accumulation of CMK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>). We thus wondered if NLS<sup>297-307</sup> could be responsible for the nuclear accumulation of the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant in FLP at 20°C. We found that impairing the NLS<sup>297-307</sup> element with a K307Q mutation in the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant background fully blocked its nuclear accumulation at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This mutation could also reinforce the cytoplasmic enrichment at 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that the NLS<sup>297-307</sup>-dependent nuclear entry pathway contributes to translocate CMK-1 in the nucleus, independently of the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>/NES<sup>288-294</sup> pair.</p><p>Our next goal was to identify the secondary element responsible for the heat stimulus-evoked cytoplasmic translocation of the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant. Our first candidate was the putative NES<sup>315-323</sup>. This candidate element was dispensable for cytoplasmic accumulation of wild type CMK-1, in which NES<sup>288-294</sup> is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>), but could potentially take over CMK-1 export when NES<sup>288-294</sup> is lacking. We found that the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup>; NES<sup>315-323</sup> triple mutant protein could still be exported from the nucleus, like the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Therefore, the candidate NES<sup>315-323</sup> sequence does not mediate CMK-1 nuclear export in any of the conditions examined so far across our studies. In silico analysis tools focusing on the canonical exportin recognition motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) did not predict additional candidate NESs. To delineate additional candidates, we focused on the C-terminal region of CMK-1. Indeed, a CMK-1 (1–304) mutant was previously shown to accumulate in the nucleus and proposed to lack some NES located in the 305–348 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). Since we can now exclude the NES<sup>315-323</sup> sequence as a functional canonical NES, we looked for additional candidate residues as part of a non-canonical cytoplasmic localization-promoting element in this region. The subcellular localization of protein is often regulated by their phosphorylation and there are precedents for this type of regulation among CaM kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shioda and Fukunaga, 2018</xref>). Among five S/T residues in the C-terminal region of CMK-1, we focused on S325 which is a strong predicted phosphorylation site as part of an unstructured region (NetPhos3.1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blom et al., 2004</xref>) and which matches the prevalent RXXS target substrate motif shared by multiple kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bradley and Beltrao, 2019</xref>). We found that an S325A mutation produced a partial yet significant reduction in heat stimulus-evoked nuclear export when introduced in the NLS<sup>71-78</sup>; NES<sup>288-294</sup> double mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, as compared to CMK-1(wt), the single S325A mutant displayed a significantly more nuclear localization at both 20°C and 28°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). A double mutant protein combining S325A and NES<sup>288-294</sup> mutations markedly accumulated in the nucleus at both temperatures, reaching nuclear/cytoplasmic signal ratio values significantly higher than that of any single mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, serine 325 is part of a functional element promoting CMK-1 cytoplasmic localization and regulating CMK-1 localization independently of NES<sup>288-294</sup>.</p><p>The S325A mutation that we examined so far is a ‘phosphorylation-dead’ mutation. If S325 can indeed be phosphorylated and if this modification regulates CMK-1 localization, then an S325D phosphomimic mutation should not have the same impact as the S325A mutation. Consistent with this view, the S325D mutant localization was the same as wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These observations suggest (i) that an intact S325 residue is necessary for the normal nuclear export of CMK-1(wt) and (ii) that S325 phosphorylation might be the default state of CMK-1 in FLP under our conditions. Our data also suggest that the post-translational modification of S325 could be used as a regulatory switch to control CMK-1 localization. Nevertheless, we have so far no evidence that this latter mechanism is engaged in heat stimulus-evoked CMK-1 localization in FLP. We know that S325 promotes CMK-1 cytoplasmic accumulation independently of NES<sup>288-294</sup> (as shown by the impact of the S325A mutation in a NES<sup>288-294</sup> mutant background <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), but how the S325-element works remains to be determined. In principle, it could either function by promoting a non-canonical nuclear export or a cytoplasmic retention pathway, for example, by anchoring CMK-1 to some cytoplasmic components. Furthermore, it seems that S325 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation modifications are not involved in the heat-evoked CMK-1 re-localization process in FLP. However, we speculate that this mechanism might be relevant in other contexts in FLP and/or in other neuron types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>An updated model of the functional NES and NLS elements of CMK-1</title><p>Together with the results of our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>), our data show that CMK-1 subcellular localization is regulated by multiple intrinsic elements:</p><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>NES<sup>288-294</sup>, working via the canonical exportin pathway as primary nuclear export drive at 20°C</p></list-item><list-item><p>NLS<sup>71-78</sup>, working via a canonical IMA-3-dependent pathway as primary cell stimulus-dependent nuclear import drive at 28°C</p></list-item><list-item><p>NLS<sup>297-307</sup>, as a secondary pathway working in partial redundancy with NLS<sup>71-78</sup>, most likely via a canonical importin pathway</p></list-item><list-item><p>the S325 phosphosite in the C-terminal portion of CMK-1, which is part of a cytoplasmic localization-promoting pathway presumably active when S325 is phosphorylated.</p></list-item></list><p>The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> presents a working model of the regulation of wild type CMK-1 localization with the relative contribution of each pathway at 20°C and 28°C.

Interestingly, our data also show that the W305S mutation produced a small cytoplasmic translocation effect in both wild type and T179D backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We considered two hypothetical explanations for this difference. On the one hand, the lack of CaM binding at 20°C might prevent a fully efficient nuclear entry despite the presence of the T179D mutation. On the other hand, the chronic phosphorylation-like state in the T179D mutant might also trigger an antagonist mechanism concomitantly promoting CMK-1 cytoplasmic translocation, and therefore tempering the nuclear accumulation of the T179D mutant protein. If the first model is true, one would predict the T179D mutant to further accumulate in the nucleus when the cell is activated at 28°C and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM available for CMK-1 binding. In strong contrast to this prediction, CMK-1(T179D) mutant protein at 28°C was not more nuclear than CMK-1(wt), but actually significantly more cytoplasmic with a ratio similar to that of CMK-1(T179D) at 20°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Therefore, the impact of T179D mutation is context-dependent, and, in addition to its nuclear entry promoting effect revealed at 20°C, might also include an antagonistic nuclear export drive, which becomes apparent at 28°C to counteract the nuclear accumulation. In order to determine if T179D favors nuclear export via the NES<sup>288-294</sup> element, we next examined the localization of double mutant proteins combining T179D with NES<sup>288-294</sup>-impairing mutations. We found that the T179D-evoked cytoplasmic drive was strongly reduced in the absence of an intact NES<sup>288-294</sup> element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

T179 phosphorylation would thus result in (i) an activated dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling and (ii) a shift in CMK-1 equilibrium toward the nucleus. The latter effect most likely results from a synergy between the direct impact of T179 phosphorylation and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-binding-evoked importin affinity increase, converging on NLS<sup>71-78</sup> in order for this pathway to dominate over the antagonistic pathways into play.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Both CKK-1 isoforms localize to the cytoplasm of FLP regardless of heat stimulation</title><p>Our next goal was to identify in which cellular compartment CMK-1 is most likely to be phosphorylated by CKK-1. In principle, T179 phosphorylation may take place in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus or in both compartments, depending on the localization of CKK-1. In rats, CaM kinase kinase alpha is expressed in the nucleus, whereas CaM kinase kinase beta is expressed in the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm depending on the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitani et al., 2003</xref>). The worm genome encodes two predicted CKK-1 isoforms (CKK-1a and CKK-1b), produced via alternative transcription start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which diverge in their N-terminal region.

To test this prediction empirically, we generated mNG protein fusion reporter for CKK-1a and -1b isoforms, respectively, and targeted their expression in FLP with the Q-system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schild and Glauser, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wei et al., 2012</xref>).

Furthermore, their localization was not altered upon heat stimulation at 28°C for 90 min.

Heat-evoked CMK-1 nuclear entry in FLP thermo-nociceptor neurons causes a decrease in the animal responsiveness to noxious thermal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>). As expected for an intracellular signaling event able to modify animal behavior and survival prospects, CMK-1 subcellular localization control is a tightly regulated process, which needs to take place only in a specific context and over an appropriate timescale. Our studies have identified multiple functional intrinsic elements, including NES, NLS, and phosphorylation sites, and provide a more complete picture of their interplay in FLP thermo-nociceptor neurons. These elements have antagonistic effects, favoring either export or import, and in the case of the T179 phosphorylation, favoring both export and import. We speculate that the dual regulatory role of T179 phosphorylation in promoting bidirectional CMK-1 translocation across the nuclear envelope could be at the origin of cell stimulation-dependent CMK-1 shuttling cycles. Importin/exportin-based transport is an energy-consuming process. Therefore, if a single phosphorylation event promotes the two antagonistic pathways, it must also come with some benefits. Considering the cytoplasmic localization of CKK-1, we propose that a dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling might contribute to ensure that the T179 phosphorylation status of CMK-1 is frequently ‘refreshed’, in order for the nuclear pool of CMK-1 to reflect the current activation status of CKK-1 in the cytoplasm. To test this hypothetical model, future studies will need to quantify the actual shuttling kinetics of wild type and mutant CMK-1 at different temperatures. Furthermore, the whole process is likely to be also influenced by the activity of phosphatase(s) responsible for CMK-1 dephosphorylation on T179. In order to obtain a full picture of the phosphorylation-dependent CMK-1 localization regulation, future studies will also need to identify these phosphatases and determine their subcellular locus of action in vivo.</p><p>Previous studies have reported transient, persistent, or sometimes no CMK-1 nuclear translocation in different neurons subjected to different stimulation regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moss et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schild et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). We propose that the network of intrinsic regulatory elements that we have identified might be the target of multiple intracellular signaling events in order to fine-tune CMK-1 localization in a variety of contexts. While CaM binding and T179 phosphorylation converging on NLS<sup>71-78</sup> and the antagonistic NES<sup>288-294</sup>-dependent export constitutes the primary mechanism explaining the CMK-1 equilibrium shift upon prolonged stimulation in FLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), the other elements could be more relevant in different contexts. The fact that NLS<sup>297-307</sup> overlaps with the CaM-binding site and the fact that S325 phosphorylation status affects its NES activity represent additional regulation opportunities, which could be engaged in different cells or situations. We speculate that, for example, this could be the case in cells with limited CKK-1 activity, like cells with little or no CKK-1 expression. Indeed, based on previous reporter analyses and single-cell RNA seq data, the expression of CMK-1 is much broader than that of CKK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kimura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). The activity of CaM kinase kinase in mammals was also shown to be regulated by post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Green et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakanishi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Takabatake et al., 2019</xref>) and this pathway may be silenced in specific situations.</p><p>Being downstream effectors of intracellular calcium signaling, CaM kinases can couple cell activation with physiological changes taking place over relatively long timescales. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that their kinase activity can be regulated by other signaling pathways (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Swulius and Waxham, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tokumitsu and Sakagami, 2022</xref> for reviews), placing them as a hub for integrating multiple inputs. Our study supports the notion that not only CaM kinase activity, but also the regulation of its subcellular localization are important targets of convergent regulatory inputs. Owing to the large conservation of calcium signaling during evolution and in particular of the CaM kinase structural and functional architectures, similar mechanisms might be relevant for their regulation in different species and for different sensory modalities beyond thermo-nociceptive functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG439</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domSi439[mec-3p::cmk-1 (1–348)::mNG::unc-54 3’UTR] II</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(wt)::mNG in FLP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG703-704-705</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domEx703-704-705[mec-3p::cmk-1(V292A/V294A)::mNG, unc-122p::RFP]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(V292A/V294A)::mNG in FLP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG1032</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domSi439[mec-3p::cmk-1::mNG::3xFlag::unc-54 3’UTR] II;[unc-68(dom13)] V</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(wt)::mNG in FLP in <italic>unc-68</italic> mutant background</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG900-901-902</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domEx900-901-902[mec-3p::cmk-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S/V292A/V294A)::mNG, unc-122p::RFP]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S/V292A/V294A)::mNG in FLP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG700-701-702</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domEx700-701-702[mec-3p::cmk-1(W305S)::mNG, unc-122p::RFP]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(W305S)::mNG in FLP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG706-707-708</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ippolito et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domEx706-707-708[mec-3p::cmk-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S)::mNG, unc-122p::RFP]</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expression of CMK-1(K71A/R74Q/R77S)::mNG in FLP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>C. elegans</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">DAG709-710-711-1134-1135-1136</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This study</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>domEx709-710-711-1134-1135-1136 [mec-3p::cmk-1(T179D)::mNeonGreen;

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Shawn Xu (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Overall, we are very excited about the work presented in this manuscript, but we think that a few revisions are needed to better support your major claims. We believe that the requested revisions are very feasible and can be addressed with some new experiments/data. Please address the points below and submit a point-by-point response alongside your revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) The authors identify a secondary NLS/NES structural element-pair that is, according to their claim, a basal, stimulation-independent structural modulator of CMK-1 subcellular distribution. The presented model suggests that this new NLS/NES pair regulates a basal shuttling rate of CMK-1 between the cytosol and the nucleus. However, this is not per se demonstrated in the current version of the manuscript. I suggest applying FLIP or iFRAP to demonstrate that these secondary elements are indeed regulating a basal nucleo-cytoplastic shuttling of CMK-1 in FLP neurons.</p><p>2) It is not clearly described how the authors ended up studying S325.

We have actually invested a lot of time and energy (and money) in attempting to establish in vivo FRAP in our lab over the last year, but we must admit we reached our limits. There are a lot of technical difficulties associated with the need to work with a moving whole animal preparation (and not immobile cells as used in the vast majority of FRAP studies). We tried to establish a micro-fluidic system, in order to avoid the need for interfering pharmacological agents, but we were never able to obtain sufficient stability of the head region. Furthermore, to obtain conclusive data in these tiny worm neurons with very limited signal area and relatively weak signal-to noise ratio, we would need to photobleach an entire compartment and measure its ‘replenishment’ kinetics over very long periods. But we were not so far able to achieve this with our current resources. Therefore, in the scope of the present revision, the suggested experiments are unfortunately out of our reach. To nevertheless address this concern, we revised the Result/Discussion to emphasize the need for quantitative kinetics analyses in future studies. The relevant text reads as follows:</p><p>“Our studies have identified multiple functional intrinsic elements, including NES, NLS and phosphorylation sites, and provide a more complete picture of their interplay in FLP thermo-nociceptor neurons. These elements have antagonistic effects, favoring either export or import, and in the case of the T179 phosphorylation, favoring both export and import. We speculate that the dual regulatory role of T179 phosphorylation in promoting bidirectional CMK-1 translocation across the nuclear envelope could be at the origin of cell stimulation-dependent CMK-1 shuttling cycles. Importin/exportin based transport is an energy consuming process. Therefore, if a single phosphorylation event promotes the two antagonistic pathways, it must also come with some benefits. Considering the cytoplasmic localization of CKK-1, we propose that a dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling might contribute to ensure that the T179 phosphorylation status of CMK-1 is frequently “refreshed”, in order for the nuclear pool of CMK-1 to reflect the current activation status of CKK-1 in the cytoplasm. In order to test this hypothetical model, future studies will need to quantify the actual shuttling kinetics of wild type and mutant CMK-1 at different temperature. Furthermore, the whole process is likely to be also influenced by the activity of phosphatase(s) responsible for CMK-1 dephosphorylation on T179. In order to obtain a full picture of the phosphorylation-dependent CMK-1 localization regulation, future studies will also need to identify these phosphatases and determine their subcellular locus of action in vivo.”</p><p>We also carefully scanned our manuscript to make sure we were very cautious in our statements about the kinetic aspect and the baseline shuttling aspect. We made some text adjustments in the abstract and in the Result/Discussion section.</p><p>While the question of the shuttling kinetics will unfortunately remain open, we believe that our manuscript now fairly addresses this aspect without overselling our speculations about the potential role of activating two opposite drives. In addition, we want to stress that, the absence of shuttling kinetic data do not affect our main conclusions about the multiplicity of the antagonist regulatory mechanisms controlling CMK-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clearly described how the authors ended up studying S325. Is this the only strongly predicted phosphorylation site in the whole CT part of the protein? Did the Authors specifically perform phosphorylation-site prediction to define candidate sites?</p></disp-quote><p>There are only 5 potential phosphosites in the considered C-terminal region of CMK-1. S325 and S327 received a high score (&gt;0.7) using NetPhos-3.1. S327 prediction is not associated with any particular kinase, whereas S325 is a potential target of kinases known to regulate neuronal function (including PKA and CaMkinase themselves), and is part of the prevalent RXXS motif. We chose to follow up on S325 only for these reasons. We didn’t make any claim about the other residues.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have revised the text to cite the NetPhos-3.1 prediction tool and the very interesting article by Bradley and colleagues supporting the prevalence of the RXXS motifs (Bradley <italic>et al.</italic> 2019 10.1371/journal.pbio.3000341). These were the only criteria that drove our initial intention and ultimately, we were lucky to follow this fortunate intuition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The axis of supplementary Figure 4 is clipped and some parts of the violin plots are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the X-axis range in the revised supplementary figure 4 to make sure all the datapoints are visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Figures 1-3 share some of the same control datasets.

There is substantial evidence it is the case. Indeed, previously published data demonstrated that the subcellular localization of CMK-1 is essential to adjust FLP-dependent heat avoidance. In our two previous studies (Schild et al. 2014 and Ippolito et al. 2021), we examined a series of mutants and exogenous chimeric proteins (e.g., with appending of dominant canonical NLS or NES) and clearly showed that CMK-1 nuclear localization is necessary and sufficient to reduce heat avoidance, whereas CMK-1 cytoplasmic localization is necessary and sufficient to promote heat avoidance. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that any new mechanisms that we show to be able to modulate CMK-1 localization is likely to be of potential physiological relevance. As for the new elements discovered here, it is unfortunately very difficult to design a clearly interpretable behavioral experiment that would add any further solidification on this aspect. First, regarding the new NES/NLS pair, it is a set of secondary elements, whose impact only becomes very salient when the primary NES/NLS pair is impaired. Performing behavioral experiments in a background combining three or more mutations would become tricky to interpret. Any result supporting our model would be a very weak support, whereas we could easily justify a result not fulfilling our expectations, because of a severe chronic miss-regulation of CMK-1. Second, regarding the T179 affecting mutations, they are even more challenging to work with. Indeed, while T179A and T179D produce major effects on CMK-1 localization on their own, they also create strong loss and gain of CMK-1 kinase activity, respectively. Regardless of the behavioral phenotypes we would obtain, we would not be able to disentangle the contribution of kinase activity versus localization.</p><p>To follow up on this comment, we modified the introduction to more explicitly refer to past experiments having demonstrated the functional importance of CMK-1 localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Line 106: In silico analysis tools first appearing in the manuscript should be briefly explained by a few sentences or a citation.
