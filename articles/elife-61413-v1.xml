rare neurovascular disease that is characterized by enlarged and irregular blood vessels that often lead to cerebral hemorrhage. Loss-of-function mutations to any of three genes results in CCM lesion formation; namely, <italic>KRIT1</italic>, <italic>CCM2</italic>, and <italic>PDCD10 (CCM3)</italic>. Here, we report for the first time in-depth single-cell RNA sequencing, combined with spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry, to comprehensively characterize subclasses of brain endothelial cells (ECs) under both normal conditions and after deletion of <italic>Pdcd10</italic> (<italic>Ccm3)</italic> in a mouse model of CCM. Integrated single-cell analysis identifies arterial ECs as refractory to CCM transformation. Conversely, a subset of angiogenic venous capillary ECs and respective resident endothelial progenitors appear to be at the origin of CCM lesions. These data are relevant for the understanding of the plasticity of the brain vascular system and provide novel insights into the molecular basis of CCM disease at the single cell level.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vascular biology</kwd><kwd>blood brain barrier</kwd><kwd>cerebral cavernous malformation</kwd><kwd>spatial

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells (ECs) are a particularly heterogenous cell population, as they have distinct structural, phenotypic, and functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalucka et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have shown that ECs of arteries, veins, and the lymphatic system show high degrees of specialization in their responses to specific hemodynamic and functional requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Augustin and Koh, 2017</xref>). Compared to large-vessel endothelia, this adaptation of microvascular ECs is seen by their expression of highly specialized properties, in terms of their responses to the specific requirements of different organs. Thus, an improved understanding of the molecular basis of this EC heterogeneity will help toward the definition of organ function under physiological and pathological conditions.</p><p>The cells that form the microcirculation of the brain represent a typical example of highly specialized microvascular ECs. The main important functions of these vessels relate to the regulation of cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery, and the supply of energy metabolites to the nerve cells. Dysfunction of the brain vascular system can cause major problems for brain connectivity, synaptic activity, and information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). The specialized function of the brain microcirculation requires coordinated and continuous cross-talk between ECs and the other cell types, to thus establish what is known as the ‘neurovascular unit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). ECs are surrounded and embraced by pericytes and they are in contact with the glia (i.e. astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia) and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armulik et al., 2010</xref>). The ECs in these neurovascular units form the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which strictly controls the entry of neurotoxic plasma components, circulating inflammatory cells, and pathogens into the brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iadecola, 2017</xref>).</p><p>As well as their control of general vascular permeability, the cells of the BBB promote the passage of nutrients and other essential molecules from the blood into the brain through their expression of multiple highly specialized transport systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the integrity of the BBB is regulated through coordinated and continuous interactions of the ECs with the surrounding neural cells, pericytes, and fibroblasts, which form a favorable environment for the ECs to develop and express their specialized properties.</p><p>Several genetic pathologies that can cause alterations in the development and function of the BBB arise as a result of inactivation of specific genes in the cells of the neurovascular units. While these diseases are relatively rare, they can help us to identify the key mechanisms that underlie the formation of the BBB and the acquisition of its specialized properties. A typical example here is the genetic disease known as cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clatterbuck, 2001</xref>). CCM vascular lesions, or cavernomas, mostly develop in the central nervous system and the retina. These can frequently bleed, which leads to epileptic seizures, focal neurological deficits, and other neurological problems, such as hemorrhagic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clatterbuck, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Labauge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rigamonti et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wong et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>CCMs occur in both familial and sporadic forms. The familial form of CCM has an overall prevalence of less than 1:10,000. It is characterized by multiple CCM lesions that increase in number and size through the life of the patient, which results in recurrent cerebral hemorrhage. Familial CCM is due to loss-of-function mutations in any one of the three genes known as <italic>KRIT1</italic> (or <italic>CCM1</italic>), <italic>CCM2</italic> (or <italic>OSM</italic>), and <italic>PDCD10</italic> (or <italic>CCM3</italic>). These three types of CCM loss-of-function mutations show comparable morphology and specific brain localization. Instead, the sporadic form of CCM has relatively high prevalence, of about 1:200, and in the majority of cases, it occurs as a single cavernoma. Sporadic CCM can also result in a relatively variable set of symptoms, which are similar to familial CCM and depend on the location of the cavernoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Labauge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cavalcanti et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>At present, to limit disease progression, there remains the need for an effective pharmacological treatment for patients with CCM, as to date, the only curative therapy is lesion eradication by surgical intervention or stereotactic radiosurgery. Open skull surgery is currently applied to selected symptomatic lesions only, as it is highly invasive, and it can result in significant complications, while being accompanied by unproven long-term benefit. Also, in familial CCM, neither surgery nor radiotherapy can cure multiple lesions throughout the brain and spinal cord. Therefore, despite many studies into CCM, an effective pharmacological therapy for this disease is still missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelilah-Seyfried et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An important step toward the understanding of CCM and any potential therapy is the identification of the EC populations that trigger and sustain the development of these vascular malformations. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the transcriptional diversity of ECs in vascular cavernomas, with specific focus on <italic>PDCD10</italic>. Using this system, we identified distinct EC clusters and we define their functional roles in the development and progression of CCM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endothelial cell heterogeneity across normal and CCM conditions</title><p>To study the EC subpopulation(s) that form lesions in CCM, we used <italic>Cdh5</italic>(PAC)-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup>/<italic>Ccm3<sup>f/f</sup></italic>/<italic>Cldn5</italic>(BAC)-GFP mice for EC-specific recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2010</xref>).

Here, we have shown that brain ECs represent a heterogeneous population that is distributed across 13 different clusters on the basis of their gene expression. These cells express highly specialized functions that help to form the vasculature that is most appropriate for the needs of brain vascularization and for the development of the BBB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8A</xref>). Remarkably, resident progenitor cells were detected in all of the <italic>Pdcd10-wt</italic> clusters, although in different proportions. This indicates that resident progenitor cells are heterogeneous and share several transcriptional features with the ECs of the vessels where they reside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). It can be speculated that this ‘mimicry’ behavior of endothelial-resident progenitors might be determined by the specificity of the different vascular microenvironments, and even that the ‘progenitor’ status might represent a transient and reversible response to microenvironmental signals, rather than a fate-committed, stable identity. In this study, we have further extended the concept of diversity through consideration of a pathological inherited condition (i.e. CCM) that is characterized by the development of cavernomas in the brain microcirculation.

These observations confirm our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malinverno et al., 2019</xref>), where we showed that the trigger in cavernoma formation is the recruitment of progenitor cells that attract mature ECs into the areas of the lesions. Interestingly, Goveia et al. recently described <italic>Bst1</italic>-positive cells as vein-resident endothelial stem cells that still have unexplored roles in lung tumor vascularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goveia et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The role of specific progenitors can be different in different pathological contexts. For example, in injury repairing of the infra-renal aorta, <italic>Bst1</italic> did not label highly proliferating cells with regenerating ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McDonald et al., 2018</xref>). On the contrary, during liver vascular damage, liver vascular homeostasis, and ischemic hindlimb muscle, <italic>Bst1</italic>-positive stem cells proliferate to reestablish new functional vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wakabayashi et al., 2018</xref>). Although a comprehensive definition and comparison of the transcriptional and functional specificity of the progenitors that express <italic>Bst1</italic>, <italic>Peg3</italic>, <italic>Cd200</italic>, and <italic>Procr</italic> in different organs at different developmental stages and in different pathological situations is of great interest, the details here remain very limited and deserve further investigation.</p><p>The present study confirms and extends our earlier observations, to show that <italic>Pdcd10</italic>-ko cells appear to form malformations due to increased cell growth and defective sprouting of abnormal tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). Another observation derived from the present study is that arterial ECs are resilient to <italic>Pdcd10</italic> deletion. This striking result shows that brain arterial ECs maintain their genetic and functional phenotype also under <italic>Pdcd10</italic> deletion. It is possible that the unique resistance of these cells is induced and maintained by up-regulation of a relatively large set of ‘putative defensive’ genes that could be modulated directly or indirectly by <italic>Pdcd10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). These data also allow us to conclude that the cells responsible for the formation of cavernomas are of venous and tip cell origin, while ECs of arterial origin are not responsive. Thus, the same mutation and inactivation of <italic>Pdcd10</italic> can result in strongly different responses in ECs of venous and arterial origin, and in the resident progenitor cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the absolute level and the relative increases in <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> in the <italic>Pdcd10</italic>-ko do not directly correlate with the level of response to <italic>Pdcd10</italic> deletion. Almost all of the clusters identified show up-regulation of both <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> in <italic>Pdcd10</italic>-ko cells, in comparison to the respective <italic>Pdcd10</italic>-wt. However, while <italic>Pdcd10</italic>- ko cells in all of the clusters are modified, only a few clusters are particularly responsive to the mutation. This indicates that while <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> are necessary for expression of the mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cuttano et al., 2016</xref>), they are not sufficient. A specific transcriptional landscape appears necessary to allow the full transformation. This is particularly evident in the arterial cluster that express the highest levels of <italic>Klf2</italic> and <italic>Klf4</italic> but does not develop the <italic>Pdcd10</italic> phenotype.</p><p>Overall, this study adds several new aspects to the evolution of CCM and identifies the venous EC clusters and their related progenitor cells as the main cell types responsible for cavernoma development. This study thus opens new perspectives in our understanding of the development of cavernous malformations, and it should thus help in the development of novel and better-targeted therapeutics.

This is the first report of such an analysis at single cell level of ECs in CCM lesions. This study is very timely since it has been shown only recently that the CCM pathology is caused by clones of CCM mutant ECs that can recruit neighboring wild-type cells into cavernoma.</p><p>The biology uncovered is extremely interesting, as it reveals that these cells might not be able to interpret flow signals adequately as they showed significant upregulation of Klf2 and 4. The link between interpretation of flow signals is further supported by the fact that in these mice arterial ECs are protected from <italic>Ccm3</italic> deletion. They finally identify <italic>Bst1</italic> as an important physiological marker of vein-resident progenitor cells that appears to &quot;supply&quot; cells in the cavernous malformations.</p><p>The substantial and impressive amount of data presented and the conclusions discussed in this manuscript are very interesting and relevant to the field of CCM research and beyond. The study is comprehensive, beautifully presented, well-controlled and the conclusions put forward with one two exceptions (see below) are supported by solid preliminary data. Here, some textual changes are required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present a major finding that mainly venous capillary and vessel-resident progenitor ECs are prone to cavernoma malformation. This finding provides a molecular correlate to the medical characterization of this pathology as a venous capillary malformation. Based on this finding, the authors also conclude that arterial cells are apparently &quot;protected&quot; from CCM transformation. However, the term &quot;protected&quot; implies some molecular mechanism of protection. Is it possible that there are more molecular changes among venous cells, when compared with arterial cells, simply because CCM transformations occur by definition mostly in venous beds?</p><p>The identification of &quot;protective&quot; genes in the C8 (arterial cluster) in relation to CCMs might be a stretch. These are DEG genes, it is unclear whether they convey a protective effect (functional). It is clear that the arteries are protected, but is this due to other factors (flow, distinct heterotypic cell interactions, etc) or due to these genes. The concern here is labeling protective. The data does not show that – at least not at this point. The use of the literature for this support is interesting, but does it really relate to CCM3? Thus, this reviewer does takes an objection with the solid conclusion that &quot;these arterial ECs express genes that can counteract the effects of <italic>Ccm3</italic> deletion, and thus prevent lesion formation&quot; – This has not been shown. In fact, in the Discussion the authors do say: &quot;It is possible that the unique resistance of these cells is induced and maintained by up-regulation of a relatively large set of &quot;defensive&quot; genes that are modulated directly or indirectly by <italic>Ccm3</italic>&quot;.</p><p>2) The potential mechanisms protecting arterial ECs against phenotypic transformation are interesting but remain hypothetical at this stage. The categorization of genes as protective or harmful may be somehow superficial and heavily context-dependent. Both points should be reflected in the Discussion.</p><p>Insights or discussion regarding the specificity of <italic>Bst1</italic> and <italic>Peg3</italic> as opposed to <italic>Procr</italic> and <italic>Cd200</italic> as markers of resident endothelial progenitors with pathogenic potential would be interesting.</p><p>Unfortunately, the identity of resident endothelial progenitors remains elusive, as these cells do not seem to represent a distinct population in the scRNA-seq results. Instead, the authors propose that progenitor cells are heterogenous and similar to other ECs in the surrounding vessel bed. In this context, it might be worthwhile to consider (and discuss) other possibilities. For example, could &quot;progenitor&quot; status represent a transient response to microenvironmental signals rather than a hard-wired, stable identity.</p><p>3) The analysis of the single-cell sequencing data is comprehensive, but becomes sometimes difficult to follow especially due to the large number of clusters that were identified. It is, for example, a bit surprising that the authors propose 3 different tip cell subpopulations. Apart from a number of differentially expressed genes, can this be attributed to regional, functional or other differences? Are the results reproducible using a resolution that would yield less clusters by grouping cells of a rather similar kind?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61413.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors present a major finding that mainly venous capillary and vessel-resident progenitor ECs are prone to cavernoma malformation.

Therefore, we have extensively reshaped the section around arterial C8 (subsection “Arterial differentiation prevents ECs from forming CCM lesions”) and we have strongly lightened the conclusion from this paragraph. In Figure 3, panel B is now presented as a speculative interpretation of the data shown in Figure 3A. We hypothesize ‘putative preventive or promotive functions’ for these genes considering, on one hand, their activity as reported in the literature (Supplementary file 6), and on the other, the known deregulation of functions and signalling after <italic>Ccm3</italic> deletion. Suggestively, many of these unique genes positively or negatively regulate functions that are altered in the <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko.</p><p>We have also tried to clarify some concepts that were obscure or implicit in the previous version. This includes the list of genes in Figure 3A referred to as ‘Unique markers genes’, which are genes that are highly expressed uniquely in C8 both in <italic>Ccm3</italic>-wt and <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko cells. Therefore, the genes in Figure 3A represent a hallmark of this cluster.</p><p>The unique marker genes of C8 might reasonably be part of the transcriptional response of arterial ECs to specific environmental stimuli, such as flow, heterotypic interactions, extracellular matrix, etc., that builds arterial refractoriness to develop the mutated phenotype.</p><p>There are only seven unique differentially expressed genes in the C8 <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko in comparison to <italic>Ccm3</italic>-wt, and these are discussed in the same section. Also for these genes, the annotation (using https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and http://www.informatics.jax.org/) suggests preventive functions. As these genes are up-regulated specifically in the <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko of C8 in comparison to the respective <italic>Ccm3</italic>-wt, they might also be part of the specific responses of arterial ECs to <italic>Ccm3</italic> deletion, and might contribute to the maintenance of the ‘normal’ phenotype of the <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko ECs of arterial C8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The potential mechanisms protecting arterial ECs against phenotypic transformation are interesting but remain hypothetical at this stage.

Therefore, we have extensively modified and lightened our comments and interpretation of the mechanisms of protection of the arterial ECs from expressing the <italic>Ccm3</italic>-ko phenotype. We describe these changes in the answer to point 1 (above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Insights or discussion regarding the specificity of Bst1 and Peg3 as opposed to Procr and Cd200 as markers of resident endothelial progenitors with pathogenic potential would be interesting.</p><p>Unfortunately, the identity of resident endothelial progenitors remains elusive, as these cells do not seem to represent a distinct population in the scRNA-seq results.

The issues of specific functions for progenitors expressing different progenitor markers, as well as that of the modulation of progenitor state by the microenvironment, are really challenging and deserve future experimental investigation.</p><p>To comment on these aspects:</p><p>– We now discuss some findings reported in the literature on the role of different types of progenitors under different experimental conditions that mimic pathologies (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</p><p>– We now discuss the concept that the specific microenvironment might shape the transcriptome of the progenitors to induce a sort of ‘mimicry’ with the ECs of the different vessels (Discussion, first paragraph).

Are the results reproducible using a resolution that would yield less clusters by grouping cells of a rather similar kind?</p></disp-quote><p>The choice of resolution for definition of the clusters was mentioned briefly in the Materials and methods of our manuscript. We agree with the reviewer that better clarification will be useful to help readers to follow our comprehensive analysis. Therefore, we have now added a specific section in the Materials and methods (subsection “Selection and evaluation of clustering resolution”) and two new/updated figures describing the criteria applied to select the resolution level.</p><p>When we performed clustering using Seurat, we varied the resolution parameter from 0.01 to 1 (see revised Figure 1—figure supplement 3B). Seurat applies a graph-based clustering approach, and a resolution parameter controls the partitioning of the cellular distance matrix into clusters; i.e. higher resolution results in more clusters. To explore and examine the impact of varying clustering resolution, we then used the cluster package to produce a clustering tree to visualize how the cells are positioned as the number of clusters in our dataset increases. The clustering tree covering resolutions 0.01 to 1 (revised Figure 1—figure supplement 3B) shows that most of the branching occurs in the branch starting with cluster 0, which consistently has subbranches split off to form new clusters as the resolution increases. There are two regions of stability in this tree: at resolution 0.09–0.1 and at resolution 0.4–0.5, where no additional sub-branching occurred in between, and the number of clusters stayed the same. At resolution 0.5, we begin to see lower in-proportion edges and new clusters that form from multiple parent clusters. These are signs of over-clustering; i.e. the algorithm is forced to produce more clusters than are likely to be truly present in this dataset.</p><p>After we assigned the prevalent cell type identities to the clusters at resolution 0.4, we overlaid the cluster identity information onto the cluster tree (new Figure 1—figure supplement 4). The aim was to check whether each cluster represent a true sub-endothelial cell population, and whether we have over-clustered our dataset at resolution 0.4. The new Figure 1—figure supplement 4 show that:</p><p>A) two of the four contaminant cell clusters (C10 and C15) are branched at the lowest resolution tested (0.01, black line).</p><p>B1) the two major tip cell clusters (C1 and C6) derive from two distinct lineages that are branched already at resolution 0.03 (red line). This suggests that C1 and C6 are not the result of over-clustering, but rather two distinct tip cell sub-populations. This was further confirmed by our trajectory analysis (see Figure 6A), where clusters 1 and 6 clearly differentiated into two separate lineages. As suggested by the reviewer, this might be attributed to regional or functional differences, but we believe that such investigation is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>B2) arterial and venous clusters (C8 and C9, respectively) also derive from two distinct lineages that are branched at 0.03 resolution (red line), which reflects the great differences between these two ECs sub-populations.</p><p>C) the remaining two contaminant cell clusters (C11 and C16) were instead separated from ECs at 0.05 and 0.2 resolution, respectively (dashed black lines).</p><p>D) the mitotic/venous capillary and the venous/venous capillary clusters (C7 and C9, respectively) branched out, from the same pool of cells at resolution 0.4 (dashed green line). This late separation suggests a high similarity between the cells in these two clusters, which turned out to be the most affected clusters in <italic>Ccm3</italic> ko.</p><p>In conclusion here, we have chosen the lowest resolution that combined good isolation of contaminant cells (i.e. ≥0.2), biologically meaningful clustering of ECs, and the need to avoid over-clustering. Considering all of the observations listed above, 0.4 turned out to be the optimal resolution for the purpose of this study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
