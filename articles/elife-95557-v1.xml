divisome. To date, the detailed mechanisms underlying the assembly and stabilization of the Z ring remain elusive. This study highlights the role of the FtsZ-associated protein (Zap) ZapD in the assembly and stabilization of Z-ring-like structures via filament crosslinking. Using cryo-electron tomography and biochemical analysis, we show that, at equimolar concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, ZapD induces the formation of toroidal structures composed of short, curved FtsZ filaments that are crosslinked vertically, but also laterally and diagonally. At higher concentrations of ZapD, regularly spaced ZapD dimers crosslink FtsZ filaments from above, resulting in the formation of straight bundles. Despite the simplicity of this reconstituted system, these findings provide valuable insights into the structural organization and stabilization of the Z ring by Zap proteins in bacterial cells, revealing the key role of optimal crosslinking density and geometry in enabling filament curvature and ring formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacterial division</kwd><kwd>FtsZ</kwd><kwd>ZapD</kwd><kwd>divisome</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>toroid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck-Bristol Centre for Minimal Biology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merino-Salomón</surname><given-names>Adrián</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwille</surname><given-names>Petra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JA-3038/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jasnin</surname><given-names>Marion</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017642</institution-id><institution>Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2019_104544GB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivas</surname><given-names>German</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100017642</institution-id><institution>Spanish National Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PID2022_136951NB-100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rivas</surname><given-names>German</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Social Fund Plus</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PTA2020-018219-I</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiménez</surname><given-names>Mercedes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Germany's Excellence Strategy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC-2094 – 390783311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krohn</surname><given-names>Jan-Hagen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Their components interact reversibly to form a division ring, which is essential for cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levin and Janakiraman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du and Lutkenhaus, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Attaibi and den Blaauwen, 2022</xref>). At the core of this process in most bacteria is FtsZ, a tubulin homolog that polymerizes in the presence of GTP beneath the inner membrane at the future division site, providing a scaffold for recruiting other division proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nogales et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Boer et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Addinall and Lutkenhaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). FtsZ undergoes treadmilling due to polymerization-dependent GTP hydrolysis, allowing the ring to exhibit its dynamic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wagstaff et al., 2017</xref>). Depending on environmental conditions, FtsZ filaments can assemble into various structures, including bundles, sheets, and toroids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mukherjee and Lutkenhaus, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Löwe and Amos, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">González et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Popp et al., 2009</xref>). Membrane-tethered FtsZ assemblies are arranged as loosely structured spirals in the midcell region, guided by spatial regulators. These structures eventually coalesce to form a cohesive Z ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Squyres et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The molecular components involved in cell division must be in the right place at the right time during the cell cycle. Several factors in this spatiotemporal regulation modulate FtsZ assembly.

Conversely, negative modulators inhibit FtsZ assembly at other sites, namely Min proteins at the polar regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Boer et al., 1989</xref>) and SlmA on the nucleoid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tonthat et al., 2011</xref>). Most of these modulators interact with FtsZ through its carboxy-terminal end (CCTP), which modulates division assembly as a central hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ortiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buske and Levin, 2012</xref>).

Upon GTP binding, FtsZ homopolymerizes directionally, assembling single-stranded filaments. ZapD is a robust dimer (magenta) that interacts directly with FtsZ, crosslinking filaments by promoting lateral interactions between them. Although the molecular mechanism is still unclear, the current hypothesis of interaction assumes dimers of ZapD crosslinking two FtsZ filaments through the CCTP of FtsZ, expecting at around 1:1 (FtsZ:ZapD) molar ratio in a homogeneous bundle (1 dimer of ZapD connected to 2 monomers of FtsZ). According to this model, the orientation of the FtsZ filaments could be parallel or antiparallel, allowing the growth and treadmilling of the filaments. However, the mechanism of assembly of dynamic high-order structures is still unknown.

The protein concentration used was 5 µM of ZapD and FtsZ with the addition of 1 mM GTP in the working buffer at different pH (6.5–8 pH).

They also facilitate the positioning of the Z ring at the replication terminus of the chromosome by interacting with MatP, which forms a scaffolding anchor known as Ter-linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bailey et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>ZapD is a symmetrical dimer consisting of an α-helical domain and a β-sheet domain containing a positively charged binding pocket required for crosslinking and bundling FtsZ filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roach et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schumacher et al., 2017</xref>).

ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments, promoting bundling and significantly reducing the GTPase activity of FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>). A model of how ZapD crosslinks neighboring FtsZ filaments has been proposed based on the structural analysis of ZapD-FtsZ interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schumacher et al., 2017</xref>). In this model, the ZapD dimer connects two FtsZ filaments through the CCTP, which could organize them in a parallel or antiparallel orientation due to the flexibility provided by the flexible linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). However, the experimental validation of this model is still missing.</p><p>Furthermore, the link between FtsZ bundling, promoted by ZapD, and the large-scale organization of FtsZ filaments remains unresolved. Therefore, investigating how ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying Z ring assembly. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gong et al., 2024</xref>, demonstrated that although the FtsZ crosslinking proteins are not individually essential, they collectively play a critical role in the condensation and stability of the Z ring in different organisms.

To independently verify these findings, we investigated the interaction between FtsZ-GDP and ZapD using analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). First, we confirmed that ZapD forms stable dimers, which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schumacher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1aI and b</xref>).

However, the precise molecular mechanism by which ZapD crosslinks the filaments remains unclear. To investigate the biochemical features underlying this bundling process, we examined how the formation of large FtsZ bundles or higher-order FtsZ polymer structures depends on the concentration of ZapD. For this analysis, we used turbidity measurements at 350 nm. When testing GTP-FtsZ filaments at 5 or 10 μM concentrations, we found negligible turbidity, similar to that of ZapD alone at concentrations ranging from 1 to 40 μM. However, when ZapD was added, the turbidity of the FtsZ polymers increased, reaching a maximum at approximately 5 μM of ZapD (with a ZapD-FtsZ molar ratio of around 1). This turbidity level did not change significantly even at higher ZapD concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of ZapD, FtsZ rapidly forms higher-order polymers upon addition of GTP, as indicated by turbidity assays. In contrast, the formation of single- or double-stranded FtsZ filaments without ZapD does not result in a significant increase in turbidity. Compared to FtsZ filaments observed in vitro, FtsZ bundles with ZapD exhibited reduced GTPase activity, reaching 20% at equimolar or higher concentrations of ZapD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), in agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>). The macrostructures formed by FtsZ in the presence of ZapD were disassembled more slowly than the FtsZ filaments upon GTP consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Replenishment of GTP allowed for a partial recovery of the turbidity signal, suggesting that the FtsZ bundles can be rapidly reassembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>). Previous studies have shown that high concentrations of macromolecular crowders (such as Ficoll or dextran) promote the formation of dynamic FtsZ polymer networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">González et al., 2003</xref>), observations that are consistent with our results. In these cases, the GTPase activity of FtsZ was significantly reduced compared to that of FtsZ filaments, leading to a decrease in GTPase turnover. Similar mechanisms may apply to assembly reactions involving ZapD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To understand the relationship between the concentration dependence of the turbidity signal – associated with the formation of FtsZ bundles or higher-order structures driven by ZapD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) – and the amount of ZapD bound to the FtsZ binding sites, we carried out analytical centrifugation sedimentation velocity assays, previously used to characterize the binding of ZapD to GDP-FtsZ. This method allowed us to separate ZapD-FtsZ bundles from free ZapD in solution and calculate the concentration of unbound ZapD from the interference signal of the slowly sedimenting protein behind the rapidly sedimenting heavy ZapD-FtsZ complexes. Using the measured concentration of free ZapD together with known input concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, we were able to calculate the concentration of bound ZapD and the binding stoichiometry of ZapD in the bundles (moles of bound ZapD in the bundles per mole of FtsZ in monomer molar units of both proteins) at different total concentrations of ZapD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Our results showed that in the 5–10 μM ZapD concentration range, the bundles exhibited an estimated ZapD binding stoichiometry of approximately 0.3–0.4, meaning that one ZapD dimer is associated with every four to six FtsZ monomers. In contrast, at higher ZapD concentrations (30–40 μM), the binding stoichiometry increased to 1.1±0.2, indicating one ZapD dimer for every two FtsZ monomers. These results are qualitatively consistent with parallel co-sedimentation assays and additional analysis by SDS-PAGE, showing an increase in the relative intensity of ZapD in the pellet containing the FtsZ bundles at elevated ZapD concentrations in the mixture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>These results suggest that the ZapD binding stoichiometry in the polymers increases with higher ZapD concentrations.

The high density of the toroids and the wide variety of conformations of these densities prevented the use of subtomogram averaging to resolve their structure and spatial arrangement within the toroids. Most connections exhibited a characteristic bi-spherical shape between the filaments, reminiscent of ZapD dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–d</xref>). We observed lateral connections between two parallel FtsZ filaments at the same height within the toroid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Furthermore, some filaments exhibited multiple crosslinks, leading to stronger attachments between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Estimation of the precise number of ZapD molecules per FtsZ or the number of bonds per filament is challenging due to their inherently heterogeneous organization.

At high concentrations of ZapD (typically 40–60 μM, representing a molar ratio of approximately one to four or six to FtsZ), we observed the formation of straight bundles with striated patterns between the FtsZ filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as the presence of some toroidal structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Here, the high concentration of ZapD molecules increased the number of links between the filaments and ultimately promoted the formation of straight bundles, indicating that the assembly of FtsZ-ZapD structures is a reversible process that strongly depends on the amount of ZapD proteins crosslinking the filaments. Toroids and curved bundles always coexist, but the predominance shifts from toroids to straight bundles at high ZapD concentrations. This shift suggests that the number of crosslinks between filaments can modulate the properties of the assembled higher-order structures, resulting in the reorganization of the toroidal structures into straight bundles upon ZapD saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). We then explored how higher densities of ZapD lead to the formation of straight bundles using cryo-ET.</p><p>Using the same approach to visualize the toroids, we collected tomograms of the straight bundles and extracted their isosurfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). The straight bundles are formed at high ZapD concentrations and consist of a highly organized stack of well-aligned FtsZ filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The connection of filaments by multiple putative ZapD proteins results in the straightening of the structure of the filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson and Osawa, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). Interestingly, ZapD crosslinks FtsZ filaments vertically, forming a row of ZapD proteins interacting with both filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Here too, structural analysis by subtomogram averaging was not possible due to the crowding, preferential orientation, and heterogeneity of the connections. The distance between ZapD proteins provided a mean value of 4.5±0.5 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>), consistent with the size of FtsZ proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huecas et al., 2007</xref>). This observation suggests that most FtsZ proteins interact with the ZapD dimers that crosslink the filaments, in agreement with the ZapD enrichment in the bundles observed by sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, we found that the presence of ZapD increased the distance between two FtsZ filaments connected by ZapD proteins compared with the spacing in the absence of ZapD, regardless of the amount of ZapD connections (from 5.9±0.8 to 7.88±2 nm in toroids and 7.6±1.5 nm in straight bundles; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>).

The bundles formed at the high ZapD concentrations tested (up to four molar excess of ZapD to FtsZ) correspond to a binding saturation regime in which a ZapD dimer binds two FtsZ molecules connecting two filaments, straightening their structure and arranging them into large, highly organized straight bundles. In contrast, fewer connections provide the freedom to form toroidal structures. This observation confirms that a certain number of ZapD-driven bonds are optimal for maintaining the preferential curvature of FtsZ filaments and allowing toroid assembly, establishing a structural dependence of assembled bundles on the number of ZapD-mediated bonds.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The amount of ZapD connections modulates the spatial organization of FtsZ filaments into higher-order structures.</title><p>(Top) Simplified scheme of the higher-order FtsZ structures formed in the presence of increasing concentrations of ZapD.

In the absence of ZapD, FtsZ filaments can interact laterally to form double filaments upon GTP binding. At low concentrations of ZapD, only a few ZapD-mediated bonds are formed, favoring the formation of small, curved bundles. At equimolar concentrations of ZapD and FtsZ, more ZapD-mediated bonds are formed, particularly from above the filaments, but also laterally and diagonally, allowing filament curvature and favoring the assembly of toroidal structures. At saturating ZapD concentrations, the filaments are straightened up by regular ZapD crosslinking vertically, resulting in the formation of straight bundles.

We therefore investigated whether the dimerization of ZapD was essential for assembling straight bundles and toroidal structures. To this end, we produced a ZapD mutant (‘mZapD’) by substituting three amino acids (R20, R116, and H140) involved in its dimerization by alanine, thus decreasing the stability of the dimerization interface. The dimerization of mZapD was tested by AUC analysis, which showed a percentage of monomeric protein that was not present in the wild-type ZapD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3a</xref>). mZapD can interact with unpolymerized FtsZ-GDP as evidenced by fluorescence anisotropy and FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3b and c</xref>). mZapD is still able to promote FtsZ bundle formation, showing an ~50% lower turbidity signal than for wild-type ZapD even at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3d</xref>).

Filament crosslinking by Zap proteins plays a crucial role in the assembly and stabilization of the Z ring. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process remain to be elucidated. To better understand these mechanisms, we investigated the interaction between FtsZ and ZapD, one of the stabilizers of the division ring.</p><p>Our results indicate that ZapD crosslinks FtsZ in solution to form 3D toroidal structures characterized by short, discontinuous FtsZ filaments that are vertically stacked and crosslinked, as well as diagonally and laterally crosslinked, as revealed by cryo-ET. The relative concentrations of FtsZ and ZapD dictate the assembly geometry. Remarkably, FtsZ toroids emerge as the dominant structure when both proteins are present in equimolar ratios, whereas straight bundles are assembled at high concentrations of ZapD. Our study highlights the importance of the balance between vertical and lateral or diagonal crosslinking to allow for the filament curvature observed in the toroids, which is absent in the straight bundles where vertical crosslinking is dominant.</p><p>The structural characterization of the toroids by cryo-ET allowed us to resolve the overall structure and identify putative ZapD dimers that crosslink the filaments. However, we were unable to obtain detailed structural information about the ZapD connectors due to the heterogeneity and density of the toroidal structures, which showed significant variability in the conformations of the connections between the filaments in all directions. These results are consistent with the observation that ZapD interacts with FtsZ through its central hub, which provides additional spatial freedom to connect other filaments in different conformations. This flexibility allows different filament organizations and contributes to structural heterogeneity. In addition, these results suggest that these crosslinkers can act as modulators of the dynamics of the ring structure, spacing filaments apart and allowing them to slide in an organized manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hörger et al., 2008</xref>).

Thus, Zap proteins can play a critical role in ensuring correct filament placement and stabilization, which is consistent with the toroidal structure formed by ZapD.</p><p>Our observation of toroidal FtsZ structures promoted by ZapD in solution is consistent with the observation of pre-curved FtsZ protofilaments in circular assemblies attached to model membranes in various in vitro systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Loose and Mitchison, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ramirez-Diaz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vélez, 2022</xref>). Additionally, FtsZ can form ring-shaped structures with diameters ranging from 100 to 200 nm on surfaces, becoming more pronounced when adsorbed to lipid, carbon, or mica surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huecas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mingorance et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">González et al., 2005</xref>), or in the presence of molecular crowders like methylcellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Popp et al., 2009</xref>). Cryo-EM of concentrated (50 μM) FtsZ from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> with GMPCPP revealed that these protofilaments often coalesce into spirals or toroids, forming large aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huecas et al., 2017</xref>). These toroidal structures correspond to the curved conformations of FtsZ polymers observed in various bacterial species, which are thought to contribute to the generation of constriction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson and Osawa, 2017</xref>). In <italic>E. coli,</italic> approximately 5000 FtsZ monomers (about one third of the intracellular concentration of FtsZ) could circle the cell six to eight times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stricker et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting a discontinuous toroidal assembly. ZapD, present at approximately 500 molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>), represents only a small fraction of the FtsZ molecules and favors the formation of toroidal structures in the absence of interactions with other FtsZ-associated proteins. Higher concentrations of ZapD would be required to form straight bundles.</p><p>The persistence length and curvature of FtsZ filaments are optimized to form bacterial-sized ring structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erickson and Osawa, 2017</xref>). ZapD helps to stabilize these toroids by crosslinking and increasing the spacing between FtsZ filaments from 5.9±0.8 to 7.9±2 nm in toroids and 7.6±1.5 nm in straight bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). This increased spacing promotes a more dynamic organization, providing functional flexibility in bacteria. The linker connecting ZapD to FtsZ can also modulate filament spacing and curvature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huecas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sundararajan and Goley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sundararajan et al., 2018</xref>). We observe a mixture of curvatures in the internal organization of the toroids. While FtsZ filaments have a preferred curvature, the density of ZapD connections forces the structure to adapt and align with neighboring filaments, thereby affecting FtsZ curvature. However, the precise molecular mechanism linking ZapD binding and polymer curvature remains to be elucidated.</p><p>One of the most significant findings of this study is that the amount of ZapD bound to FtsZ filaments greatly influences the structural organization of the resulting higher-order polymer. At lower concentrations of ZapD, which are necessary for bundling (equimolar mixtures of ZapD and FtsZ), toroids are the most prominent structures, with a binding stoichiometry of ZapD in the polymer of 0.3–0.4 moles of ZapD per mole of FtsZ (equivalent to one ZapD dimer for every four to six FtsZ molecules). As the concentration of ZapD increases, the binding stoichiometry of ZapD in the polymers increases to 1.1 moles of ZapD per mole of FtsZ (one ZapD dimer for every two FtsZ molecules). This leads to a reorganization of the polymer bundles, resulting in straight structures that predominantly crosslink the FtsZ filaments, a configuration not seen at lower ZapD concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The increase in the number of ZapD-FtsZ contacts likely reduces the flexibility needed to form toroidal structures, compelling the filaments to adopt a larger, straight bundle conformation. We observed slight differences in the spacing between filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>), with a broader range of distances between filaments in the toroids compared to the straight bundles. Thus, ZapD contributes to the variability of spacing based on the number of connections formed.</p><p>We therefore hypothesize that the assembly of functional, curved FtsZ macrostructures occurs only within a specific stoichiometric range of ZapD-FtsZ interactions. An increase in crosslinking at higher ZapD concentrations appears to cause the FtsZ polymer to form rigid, straight bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Additionally, only a robust ZapD dimer can form FtsZ toroids and straight filaments, indicating that a certain binding strength is necessary to bundle the filaments and maintain their structure. These observations, along with the high conformational variability found in ZapD connections, suggest that ZapD can modulate the behavior of the entire structure through a concentration-dependent mechanism. This structural reorganization highlights the polymorphic nature of the assemblies formed by FtsZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mateos-Gil et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monterroso et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We also demonstrated that ZapD-mediated FtsZ toroids replicate some of the structural features of the Z ring architecture observed in vivo. Based on super-resolution imaging and cryo-ET, the current model of the Z ring describes a somewhat discontinuous and heterogeneous structure composed of randomly overlapping filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rowlett and Margolin, 2014</xref>). These filaments arrange into a belt-like macromolecular entity, containing nodes with a higher density of dispersed filaments confined to a toroidal zone approximately 80–100 nm wide (toroidal height) and about 40–60 nm thick, located 13–16 nm below the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buss et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lyu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rowlett and Margolin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holden et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Szwedziak and Ghosal, 2017</xref>). The toroidal structures promoted by ZapD exhibit dimensions within this range. However, their thickness and multilayering are significantly greater, likely due to the absence of other cellular components competing for binding with FtsZ. The Z ring model also suggests that FtsZ filaments are weakly associated with one another through protein factors such as Zaps and weak FtsZ-FtsZ interactions, which may be crucial for their functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McQuillen and Xiao, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huecas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sundararajan and Goley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Haeusser et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings indicate that one of the Zap proteins can stabilize and enhance associations between neighboring FtsZ filaments. Studying macrostructures stabilized by natural crosslinkers is vital for understanding the molecular function of the division machinery.</p><p>We believe that the intrinsic features of the toroidal structures share commonalities with the bacterial division ring. Despite the differences and limitations that may arise from an in vitro approach, the structures observed following ZapD crosslinking of FtsZ filaments may reveal inherent features that occur in vivo. The current model of the division ring consists of an array of filaments loosely connected by crosslinkers at the center of the cell, forming a ring. This model is consistent with our findings, although many questions remain regarding the structural organization of the Z ring within the cell. ZapD binds to FtsZ vertically, allowing either ZapD or FtsZ to interact with the plasma membrane. In straight bundles, this facilitates the stacking of straight FtsZ filaments, while for toroids, ZapD can also bind FtsZ filaments diagonally. This less compact arrangement could allow bending of the FtsZ filaments and adjustment of the toroid size.</p><p>The binding of ZapA, a key member of the FtsZ-associated proteins family, to FtsZ in equimolar mixtures induces the effective alignment and straightening of FtsZ filaments tethered to lipid bilayers by FtsA protein, as demonstrated through high-resolution fluorescence microscopy and precise quantitative image analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caldas et al., 2019</xref>). This interaction reveals a structure comprising one ZapA tetramer for every four FtsZ molecules in the polymer, highlighting the organized nature of these interactions. It is noteworthy that these straight, parallel polymers – manifested when ZapA occupies all binding sites – bear striking resemblance to the straight bundles identified in this study at high concentrations of ZapD, indicative of binding saturation. Understanding how the associative states of ZapA (as tetramers) and ZapD (as dimers), together with membrane tethering, influence the predominant structures formed in both systems is essential. The complexity of the division system raises important questions about the interaction dynamics between FtsZ and the plasma membrane. The competitive nature of the division components to engage with FtsZ and modulate its functionality remains to be thoroughly elucidated. It is important to note that FtsA and ZipA have a greater affinity for the CCTP of FtsZ than ZapD. Our cryo-ET data on straight bundles provide new perspectives on how ZapD-FtsZ structures can effectively bind to the plasma membrane; in particular, the CCTP of parallel FtsZ filaments is oriented upward, allowing direct membrane binding or interaction with ZapDs that reinforce these filaments from above, rather than from the side, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schumacher et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, this study extends the understanding of the intricate structural organization and filament crosslinking of FtsZ polymers facilitated by ZapD, which is critical for the formation and maintenance of the division ring. The revelation that ring morphology depends on the binding stoichiometry between FtsZ and the crosslinking ZapD is invaluable, particularly as we integrate this knowledge into current reconstitution assays in membrane systems. This knowledge is central to unraveling the role of FtsZ-associated proteins in coordinating and maintaining division ring formation. In addition, our findings could greatly enhance the understanding of how polymeric cytoskeletal networks are remodeled during essential cellular processes such as cell motility and morphogenesis. Although conventional wisdom points to molecular motors as the primary drivers of filament remodeling through energy consumption, there is increasing evidence that there are alternative mechanisms that do not rely on such energy, instead harnessing entropic forces via diffusible crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2016</xref>). This approach may also be applicable to ZapD and FtsZ polymers, suggesting a promising avenue for optimizing conditions in the reverse engineering of the division ring to enhance force generation in minimally reconstituted systems aimed at achieving autonomous cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification</title><p>ZapD protein has been overproduced and purified following the procedure previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durand-Heredia et al., 2012</xref>, with some modifications.

Concentrations of inorganic phosphate were calculated from a phosphate standard curve, while the GTPase activity reaction rate (V, mol P/mol FtsZ/min) was determined from the slope of the linear part of phosphate accumulation curves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FtsZ sedimentation assay</title><p>Purified ZapD (1–30 μM) was added to purified FtsZ (5 μM) in the working buffer (50 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), and GDP or GTP (1 mM) was added last to trigger FtsZ polymerization. The reaction mixtures with a final volume of 100 μL were processed at RT and centrifuged at low speed (10,000 rcf) using a tabletop centrifuge. At that point, 90 μL of supernatant was carefully collected and loaded in clean tubes with 1x loading dye. The rest of the supernatant was discarded, and the pellets were resuspended in the original reaction volume buffer plus 1× loading dye (final concentration). The supernatants (10 μL) and pellets (10 μL) were resolved in a SDS-PAGE gel. The amount of FtsZ was estimated by image analysis using ImageJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Preparation of EM grids</title><p>Cryo-EM grids were plunge-frozen with a Vitrobot Mk.IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 3 µL of the samples applied to previously glow-discharged R 2/1 Holey Carbon Cu 200 mesh EM grids (Quantifoil). Samples were 10 µM FtsZ with or without ZapD or mZapD at different concentrations specified in each case (0–60 µM). Proteins were mixed in our working buffer containing 50 mM, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7. Samples were incubated for 2 min after the addition of 1 mM GTP to trigger polymerization. The Vitrobot was set to 4°C, 100% humidity, blot time 3 s, blot force 3. Whatman no. 1 filter paper was used for blotting, and liquid ethane kept at liquid nitrogen temperatures was used as a cryogen for vitrification.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cryo-EM and cryo-ET</title><p>Cryo-EM/ET data were acquired on two microscopes as follows. Cryo-EM micrographs were acquired within SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mastronarde, 2005</xref>) on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 200 kV, equipped with a Falcon III (Thermo Fisher Scientific) direct electron detector operated in integrating mode.

Micrographs were recorded at ×42,000 magnification (pixel size 2.154 Å) at –5 µm target defocus with an approximate total electron dose of 60 electrons/Å². Tilt series were recorded at ×42,000 magnification (pixel size 2.154 Å) at –5 µm target defocus with an approximate total electron dose of 100–140 electrons/Å². Acquisition was performed using a dose-symmetric tilt scheme, a tilt range of ±60°, an angular increment of 2°.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Tomogram reconstruction</title><p>Tilt series preprocessing was performed using the TOMOMAN package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wan-lab-vanderbilt/TOMOMAN">https://github.com/wan-lab-vanderbilt/TOMOMAN</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wan, 2024</xref>). In brief, MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) was used to align individual frames, followed by cumulative dose weighting using an exposure-dependent attenuation function, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Schur et al., 2016</xref>. Dose-weighted tilt series were aligned using IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>) either by employing gold fiducials (if available) or by patch tracking, and binned tomograms (pixel size 8.616 Å) were generated using weighted back projection. Stacks were split into odd and even frames to generate half-set tomograms which were used for training and subsequent denoising in cryoCARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buchholz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Denoised tomograms were used directly for segmentation of the toroids, straight bundles, and individual filaments by cropping an area of interest and displaying the volume as an isosurface in UCSF ChimeraX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goddard et al., 2018</xref>). Thresholds for volume extraction were 80–100 and the color used was #00AEEF (light blue) for FtsZ and #EC008C (magenta) for ZapD isosurfaces. Small particles were removed by using the ‘dust’ function with a size of 10. Different perspectives and zooms of the structures were manually adjusted for each figure in ChimeraX. To highlight connections between filaments, the corresponding parts with putative ZapD connections were manually cropped from the volume using the Volume Eraser tool in UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>). Both cropped and original isosurfaces were superimposed to show the colored putative ZapDs in the structure. The missing wedge effect induces an elongation by a factor of 2 along the Z-axis. This elongation is observed in the filaments of the 1:0 ratio toroids, whereas the elongation observed in the filaments of the 1:1 and 1:6 ratio toroids exceeds the missing wedge.</p><p>All micrographs and slices through tomograms were visualized using IMOD. Isosurface renderings of toroids, straight bundles, and individual filaments were displayed using UCSF ChimeraX and UCSF Chimera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Fluorescence anisotropy</title><p>Anisotropy measurements were performed using a TECAN plate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Mannedorf, Switzerland). Excitation and emission wavelengths were 625 and 680 nm, respectively. ZapD or mZapD labeled with ATTO 647 N were used as fluorescence tracer with a final concentration of 150 nM of ATTO-647N and supplemented with unlabeled ZapD reaching a concentration of 5 μM. FtsZ was added at increasing concentrations to analyze their interaction. Binding affinities (apparent <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>) were determined by fitting the Hill equation to the normalized anisotropy data. Each condition was measured in three independent samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy</title><p>FCS measurements were performed using a PicoQuant MicroTime200 system equipped with an Olympus 60x, NA1.2 UPlanApo water immersion objective. A pulsed 636 nm diode laser was used to excite fluorescence of Atto647N-labeled ZapD, mZapD, or free Atto647N carboxylate (for calibration). Three measurements of 60 s each were performed per sample at RT (21°C), and three samples per condition were measured. The repetition rate of the pulsed laser was 26.7 MHz, and the average power was 1 µW at the objective back pupil. Fluorescence was collected through the same objective, spatially filtered through a 50 µm diameter pinhole, and spectrally filtered through a 690/70 nm bandpass filter before being split by a neutral beam splitter onto two avalanche photodiodes (Excelitas SPCM-AQRH-14-TR). Photon count events were digitized using a PicoQuant TimeHarp 260 Nano TCSPC card. Time-correlated single photon counting information was used for monitoring data quality during measurements, but not in further analysis. Data was subjected to a burst removal algorithm similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Margineanu et al., 2007</xref>, and only ‘non-burst’ data was used in correlation analysis to obtain statistics representative of the large number of small oligomer particles, ignoring rare large ones.

The dimensions of the toroidal structures, FtsZ bundles, and distances between filaments were manually measured using ImageJ and IMOD. Distances were plotted as histograms using Origin (OriginPro, Version 2019b. OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA, USA). For each toroid analyzed (<italic>n</italic>=67), the inner and outer diameters were measured by collecting the major and minor distances in each case. The circularity of the toroid was the result of the division between the minor diameter divided by major diameter for each toroid. The height of the FtsZ toroid was manually measured from the tomograms, collecting four measurements per toroid to assure a correct representation of the size (<italic>n</italic>=17). For the spacing between filaments, the space in between the filaments was measured manually in the XY plane by using IMOD. Each measurement represents only one FtsZ double filament or one FtsZ-ZapD double filament; however, the same bundle could be measured more than once as they are composed of multiple filaments. The measurements were collected from &gt;3 independent samples. The distances between ZapDs connecting two FtsZ filaments were measured following the same methodology. The mean value and standard deviation of different datasets were calculated and added to the figures together with the <italic>n</italic> used for each case.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-95557-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw data used to make the graphs shown in figures.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-95557-data1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data sets for all experimental conditions and graphs generated in this study are shown in the manuscript or provided in the supplementary materials/source data file.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Daniel Bollschweiller (MPIB cryo-EM facility) and Rafael Nuñez (CIB-CSIC imaging facility) for their help with the cryo-EM experiments.

Toroids without ZapD have also been previously formed by treating FtsZ with crowding agents. The present study is the first to apply cryoEM tomography, which can resolve the structure of the toroids in 3D. This shows a complex mixture of filaments and sheets irregularly stacked in the Z direction and spaced radially. The most important interpretation would be to distinguish FtsZ filaments from ZapD crosslinks, This is less convincing.

The cross-linking ability of ZapD dimers result in bending of FtsZ filaments to a constant curvature. Many such short filaments are stitched together to form a toroid like structure. The geometry of assembly of filaments - whether they form straight bundles or toroid like structures - depends on the relative concentrations of FtsZ and ZapD.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In addition to a clear picture of the FtsZ assembly into ring-like structures, the authors have carried out basic biochemistry and biophysical techniques to assay the GTPase activity, the kinetics of assembly, and the ZapD to FtsZ ratio.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The discussion does not provide an overall perspective that correlates the cryoET structural organisation of filaments with the biophysical data. The current version has improved in terms of addressing this weakness and clearly states the lacuna in the model proposed based on the technical limitations.</p><p>Future scope of work includes the molecular basis of curvature generation and how molecular features of FtsZ and ZapD affect the membrane binding of the higher order assembly.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Previous studies have analyzed the binding of ZapD to FtsZ and provided images of negatively stained toroids and straight bundles, where FtsZ filaments are presumably crosslinked by ZapD dimers. Toroids without ZapD have also been previously formed by treating FtsZ with crowding agents. The present study is the first to apply cryoEM tomography, which can resolve the structure of the toroids in 3D. This shows a complex mixture of filaments and sheets irregularly stacked in the Z direction and spaced radially. The most important interpretation would be to distinguish FtsZ filaments from ZapD crosslinks, This is less convincing. The authors seem aware of the ambiguity: &quot;However, we were unable to obtain detailed structural information about the ZapD connectors due to the heterogeneity and density of the toroidal structures, which showed significant variability in the conformations of the connections between the filaments in all directions.&quot; Therefore, the reader may assume that the crosslinks identified and colored red are only suggestions, and look for their own structural interpretations. But readers should also note some inconsistencies in stoichiometry and crosslinking arrangements that are detailed under &quot;weaknesses.&quot;</p><p>Strengths.</p><p>This is the first cryoEM tomography to image toroids and straight bundles of FtsZ filaments bound to ZapD. A strength is the resolution, which. at least for the straight bundles. is sufficient to resolve the ~4.5 nm spacing of ZapD dimers attached to and projecting subunits of an FtsZ filament. Another strength is the pelleting assay to determine the stoichiometry of ZapD:FtsZ (although this also leads to weaknesses of interpretation).</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The stoichiometry presents some problems. Fig. S5 uses pelleting to convincingly establish the stoichiometry of ZapD:FtsZ. Although ZapD is a dimer, the concentration of ZapD is always expressed as that of its subunit monomers. Fig. S5 shows the stoichiometry of ZapD:FtsZ to be 1:1 or 2:1 at equimolar or high concentrations of ZapD. Thus at equimolar ZapD, each ZapD dimer should bridge two FtsZ's, likely forming crosslinks between filaments. At high ZapD, each FtsZ should have it's own ZapD dimer. However, this seems contradicted by later statements in Discussion and Results. (1) &quot;At lower concentrations of ZapD, .. toroids are the most prominent structures, containing one ZapD dimer for every four to six FtsZ molecules.&quot; Shouldn't it be one ZapD dimer for every two FtsZ? (2) &quot;at the high ZapD concentration...a ZapD dimer binds two FtsZ molecules connecting two filaments.&quot; Doesn't Fig. S5 show that each FtsZ subunit has its own ZapD dimer? And wouldn't this saturate the CTD sites with dimers and thus minimize crosslinking?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these insightful comments. The affinity of ZapD for FtsZ is relatively low and a higher concentration of ZapD is required in solution to effectively saturate the binding sites of all FtsZ molecules forming macrostructures. It is important to clarify that the concentrations mentioned in the text refer to the amounts and ratios of protein added to the total volume of the sample, rather than the proteins actively interacting and forming bundles or macrostructures.</p><p>To differentiate, two aspects can be considered: the ratio of added protein (as mentioned in the text) and the fraction of proteins that contribute to the formation of the macrostructures. Under polymerization conditions, FtsZ-GTP recruits additional monomers to form polymers. Therefore, more FtsZ than ZapD would be involved in forming filaments and bundles. Our results support this hypothesis and show that a higher amount of ZapD is required in the sample to pellet with FtsZ bundles.</p><p>We propose that starting with the same initial concentration of FtsZ and ZapD in solution, only a small fraction of ZapD will bind to the structures, favoring the formation of toroidal structures despite the initial 1:1 ratio of proteins added to the sample. When considering a higher FtsZ:ZapD ratio (1:6), the increased amount of ZapD in solution would facilitate the saturation of all FtsZ binding sites, consistent with the observation of straight bundles. Analytical sedimentation velocity data further supported this finding, indicating a binding ratio of approximately 0.3-0.4, suggesting that one ZapD dimer binds for every 4-6 FtsZ monomers. The binding ratio indicates that two FtsZ monomers will bind to a single dimer of ZapD, but this only occurs when there is a significant excess of ZapD over FtsZ in the solution mixture.</p><p>These findings align qualitatively with the relative intensities of the electrophoretic bands observed for FtsZ and ZapD in the pelleting assay with different FtsZ-ZapD mixtures, as shown in Suppl. Fig. 5 as % of FtsZ in the fractions. Without prior staining calibration of the gels, there is no simple quantitative relationship between gel band intensities after Coomassie staining and the amount of protein in a band (Darawshe et al. 1993 Anal Biochem - DOI: 10.1006/abio.1993.1581). This last point precludes a quantitative comparison between pelleting/SDS-PAGE data and analytical sedimentation measurements. For this reason, we have decided to present pelleting results as % of FtsZ in supernatant and pellet to avoid overestimations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major weakness is the interpretation of the cryoEM tomograms, specifically distinguishing ZapD from FtsZ. The distinction of crosslinks seems based primarily on structure: long continuous filaments (which often appear as sheets) are FtsZ, and small masses between filaments are ZapD. The density of crosslinks seems to vary substantially over different parts of the figures. More important, the density of ZapD's identified and colored red seem much lower than the stoichiometry detailed above. Since the mass of the ZapD monomer is half that of FtsZ, the 1:1 stoichiometry in toroids means that 1/3 of the mass should be ZapD and 2/3 FtsZ. However, the connections identified as ZapD seem much fewer than the expected 1/3 of the mass. The authors conclude that connections run horizontally, diagonally and vertically, which implies no regularity. This seems likely, but as I would suggest that readers need to consider for themselves what they would identify as a crosslink.</p></disp-quote><p>The amount of ZapD in the toroids will be significantly less than one third. Although the theoretical addition of protein to the samples is at a 1:1 ratio, the actual amount of protein in the macrostructures containing ZapD is much lower, as shown by sedimentation velocity pelleting assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In contrast to the toroids formed at equimolar FtsZ and ZapD, thin bundles of straight filaments are assembled in excess ZapD. Here the stoichiometry is 2:1, which would mean that every FtsZ should have a bound ZapD DIMER. The segmentation of a single filament in Fig. 5e seems to agree with this, showing an FtsZ filament with spikes emanating like a picket fence, with a 4.5 nm periodicity. This is consistent with each spike being a ZapD dimer, and every FtsZ subunit along the filament having a bound ZapD dimer. But if each FtsZ has its own dimer, this would seem to eliminate crosslinking. The interpretative diagram in Fig. 6, far right, which shows almost all ZapD dimers bridging two FtsZs on opposite filaments, would be inconsistent with this 2:1 stoichiometry.</p></disp-quote><p>Assessing the precise stoichiometry of FtsZ and ZapD within the macrostructures is challenging. We interpret the spikes as ZapD dimers bridging two FtsZ filaments, implying a theoretical 1:1 stoichiometry in the straight bundle. However, ZapD may be enriched in certain areas, indicating that a single FtsZ monomer is binding to one side of the dimer. In contrast, the other side remains available for additional connections, resulting in a potential 2:1 stoichiometry. A combination of both scenarios is likely, although our resolution does not allow further characterization. Considering these complexities, we assume these connections represent a dimer of ZapD binding to two FtsZ monomers.</p><p>Figure 6 shows a simplified scheme illustrating how the bundles could be assembled based on the Cryo-ET data. We acknowledge the limitations of this diagram; its purpose is to depict the mesh formed by the stabilization of ZapD. We have not included interactions that do not lead to filament crosslinking, such as dimers binding to only one FtsZ filament. This focus enhances the interpretation of the scheme and the FtsZ-ZapD interaction. A sentence has been added to the caption to highlight the possibility of other interactions not considered in the scheme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the original review I suggested a control that might help identify the structures of ZapD in the toroids. Popp et al (Biopolymers 2009) generated FtsZ toroids that were identical in size and shape to those here, but lacking ZapD. These toroids of pure FtsZ were generated by adding 8% polyvinyl chloride, a crowding agent. The filamentous substructure of these toroids in negative stain seemed very similar to that of the ZapD toroids here. CryoET of these toroids lacking ZapD might have been helpful in confirming the identification of ZapD crosslinks in the present toroids. However, the authors declined to explore this control.</p></disp-quote><p>The mechanisms by which methylcellulose (MC) promotes the assembly of FtsZ macrostructures reported by Popp et al. involve more than simple excluded volume effects, as the low concentration of MC (less than 1 mg/ml) falls below the typical crowding regime. The latter suggests the existence of poorly characterized additional interactions between MC and FtsZ. These complexities preclude the use of FtsZ polymers formed in the presence of MC as a true control for the FtsZ toroidal structures reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it should be noted that the CTD binding sites for ZapD should be on the outside of curved filaments, the side facing the membrane in the cell. All bound ZapD should project radially outward, and if it contacted the back side of the next filament, it should not bind (because the CTD is on the front side). The diagram second to right in Fig. 6 seems to incorporate this abortive contact.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of the flexible linker and its biological implications are still under debate in the field. The flexible linker allows ZapD-driven connections to be made in different directions. While these implications are not the primary focus of our manuscript, the flexible linker could allow connections between filaments in different orientations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Most of the concerns which I had raised in the earlier version have been taken care of, as detailed in the response.</p><p>A few minor points, mostly related to re-phrasing are listed below:</p><p>Page 2: line 21: The use of the term 'C-terminal domain' for the C-terminal unstructured region of FtsZ is confusing. The term C-terminal domain or CTD for FtsZ is commonly used to describe part of the globular domain, while C-terminal tail or CCTP will be a more apt usage for all the instances in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to the C-terminal domain as the carboxy-terminal region of the protein. This domain includes the C-terminal linker (CTL), which varies in length between species, followed by a conserved 11-residue sequence (CTC) and shorter, variable C-terminal sequences (CTV). We used the term &quot;C-terminal domain&quot; primarily to improve the readability of the manuscript, but we appreciate the reviewer's feedback. We have now adopted the term &quot;CCTP&quot; instead of &quot;C-terminal domain&quot; to improve the clarity of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On a related note, the schematic in Fig 1 shows the interaction with CCTP rather than the C-terminal domain of the globular FtsZ. Please provide an explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>We refer to the unstructured C-terminal domain of FtsZ as the C-terminal tail. To avoid confusion, we have introduced the term CCTP in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supple Fig 2: &quot;The FCS analysis demonstrated an increasing diffusion time of ZapD along with the FtsZ concentration as result of higher proportion of ZapD bound to FtsZ.</p><p>The increased diffusion time need not be interpreted as increased ZapD bound, it could also mean that FtsZ could polymerise in the presence of increasing ZapD, was this possibility ruled out? Including a comment on this aspect will be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>In these experiments, we monitored fluorescently labeled ZapD. Due to their interaction, we found that its diffusion time increased at high FtsZ concentrations. The data presented in Supplementary Figure 2 shows ZapD in the presence of FtsZ-GDP (i.e. under non-polymerization conditions).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Was it possible to get a molecular weight estimate based on the diffusion time?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible to estimate hydrodynamic volumes using the Stokes-Einstein equation if the diffusion coefficient of the diffusing particles is known, assuming that the particles are small and spherical. A molecular weight can then be estimated using a standard density of 1.35 g/cm3 (Fisher et all. Protein science 2009 DOI: 10.1110/ps.04688204). This estimate is heavily dependent on the shape of the diffusing particle, as we assume that our protein of interest here is far from a spherical shape due to the interaction through the flexible linker, the hydrodynamic volumes are overestimated. This overestimation then leads to a further overestimation of the molecular weight. In addition, for a more accurate estimation of the sizes and thus molecular weights for proteins, a modified model of the Stokes-Einstein equation is required (Tyn and Gusek Biotechnology and Bioengineering DOI: 10/1002/bit.260350402), where additional information about the shape of the diffusing particle is estimated by measuring the radius of gyration of the particle. These calculations are complex and beyond the scope of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supple Fig 4:</p><p>Does FtsZ GTPase activity (without ZapD) also vary with KCl concentrations?

We added a comment to the caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 6, line 42: short filament segments arranged nearly 'parallel' to each other Since FtsZ filaments are polar, it is better to rephrase as 'parallel or antiparallel'.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 7, line 41: cross linking of short 'FtsZ' filaments and not ZapD?</p></disp-quote><p>It was a typo.

Similarly labelling on a schematic figure on the use of vertical, diagonal/lateral will be useful for the readers.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions to improve the understanding of our data. We have simplified them by renaming these interactions as vertical.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 13, lines 6 -10</p><p>Rather than an orientation of top or from the side, just the presence of multiple crosslinks along coaxial filaments suffices for a straight bundle. The average spacing will be more uniform in such a straight bundle compared to a toroid where there might be regions without ZapD. I do not find the data on an upward orientation convincing. ZapD binding need not be above to have the C-terminal ends of FtsZ pointing towards the membrane. On the other hand, having ZapD bind above is likely to occlude membrane binding of FtsZ?</p></disp-quote><p>The flexibility of the FtsZ linker suggests that ZapD can bind filaments oriented in different directions. In a cellular environment, FtsZ molecules interact with other division proteins that compete with ZapD for binding sites. This competition could prevent the membrane from occluding and instead create binding sites between the filaments, stabilizing them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 11, lines 32 - 34: Please rephrase the sentence, with focus on the main point to be conveyed.
