From the antennal-lobe glomeruli, the information is conveyed to higher olfactory centers, including the lateral protocerebrum, via three main paths – of which the medial tract is the most prominent. In this study, we traced physiologically identified medial-tract projection neurons from each of the three male-specific glomeruli with the aim of mapping their terminal branches in the lateral protocerebrum. Our data suggest that the neurons’ widespread projections are organized according to behavioral significance, including a spatial separation of signals representing attraction versus inhibition – however, with a unique capacity of switching behavioral consequence based on the amount of the minor components.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Helicoverpa armigera</kwd><kwd>pheromone</kwd><kwd>interspecific signal</kwd><kwd>macroglomerular complex</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>neuronal morphology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005416</institution-id><institution>Norges Forskningsråd</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>287052</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>Bente G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31861133019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>GuiRong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Education Department of Henan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19HASTIT011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>XinCheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrophysiological and morphological identification of individual pheromone projection neurons in male moth reveals a coding system for optimizing mate search strategy, including computation of three female-produced signals in distinct protocerebral regions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Olfactory circuits serve a central role in encoding and modulating sensory input from the natural surroundings. Understanding how these chemosensory circuits translate signals with different hedonic valences into behavior is an essential issue in neuroscience. With a relatively simple brain and a restricted number of associated odors evoking opposite innate behaviors, that is, attraction and aversion, the insect pheromone pathway is an optimal system to address this question. In moth, pheromone-evoked behaviors are linked to a hardwired circuit in the lateral protocerebrum, including the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Insect Brain Name Working Group et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin et al., 2011</xref>). This brain region shares many neural principles with the mammalian cortical amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast to the semi-random neuronal connectivity in another higher-order olfactory center of the insect, the mushroom body calyx (mammalian piriform cortex analog; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Su et al., 2009</xref>), the neuronal wiring in the lateral protocerebrum is characterized by a form of spatial clustering relying on behavioral significance (for details, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Signals inducing different behaviors, such as pheromones versus food odors, are segregated in the lateral protocerebrum both in fruit fly and moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabe and Sachse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In the fruit fly, such spatial separation is shown to include even attractive versus repulsive odor signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grabe and Sachse, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Min et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, at the level of the lateral protocerebrum, it appears that odor cues are represented in different widespread sub-domains that display a form of spatial pattern according to behavioral significance, including valence.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the neurons in the insect olfactory system.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) All olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) that express the same odorant receptor project their axons to the same antennal-lobe (AL) glomerulus. AL projection neurons (PNs) passing along the most prominent tract, the medial AL tract (mALT) have dendrites in a single glomerulus and receive direct input from one OSN class. Neurons tuned to food odors versus pheromones are portrayed in <italic>green</italic> and <italic>red</italic>, respectively. The medial-tract PNs first project to the calyces of the mushroom body (Ca), where they contact Kenyon cells. The neuron connectivity in Ca has a semi-random topographical distribution, where signals are segregated according to the nature of sensory input, for example, pheromone and general odor PNs have their terminals located at the inner and outer part of calyces, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), but connections between the projection neurons and the Kenyon cells are random (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). Instead of encoding the identity of stimuli, the Kenyon cells process signals of positive versus negative valence into different terminal clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). After innervating the Ca, the medial-tract PNs project into distinct sub-regions in the lateral protocerebrum according to the behavioral significance of the relevant odor signal. The PNs in other antennal-lobe tracts (ALTs) are not shown in this panel.

Middle: Outline of the head capsule in dorsal view with the main olfactory organ (antenna) and AL along with OSNs and PNs tuned to the primary sex pheromone. The medial-tract PNs indicated here are uniglomerular neurons connecting the AL with the Ca and the lateral protocerebrum. The distinct protocerebral regions innervated by these medial-tract pheromone-sensitive PNs are undefined. Right: Schematic drawing of the main parallel ALTs: medial, mediolateral, and lateral ALT (mALT, mlALT, and lALT). Here, we followed the naming system used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Insect Brain Name Working Group et al., 2014</xref>. The mALT was previously named the inner antenno-prorocerebral tract. The mlALT, previously termed the middle antenno-protocerebral tract, is formed by multiglomerular PNs targeting the lateral protocerebrum directly. The lALT, previously named as outer antenno-protocerebral tract, is formed by both uni- and multi-glomerular PNs. In moths, some of the PNs confined to the lALT target the superior intermediate protocerebrum (SIP) and only a small part of them project into the Ca via lateral protocerebrum like the lALT PNs in honeybee/ant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galizia and Rössler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ian et al., 2016</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65683-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In the moth antennal lobe (AL; mammalian olfactory bulb analog), the male-specific macroglomerular complex (MGC) receives input from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The MGC glomeruli process input about a few female-produced signals, of which one primary constituent acts as an unambiguous attractant, while others often enhance attraction at low doses but serve as behavioral antagonists at higher doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gothilf et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Martin et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to composition of the pheromone blend, other aspects such as plume structure, duration, and concentration are also very relevant for the activity of MGC output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lei and Hansson, 1999</xref>). From the MGC, the pheromone signals are conveyed to higher brain centers, including the lateral protocerebrum, by male-specific projection neurons (PNs) following three main tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), that is, the medial, mediolateral, and lateral ALT (mALT, mlALT and lALT, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2019</xref>]). The most prominent is the mALT, resembling the mammalian olfactory tract by consisting of uniglomerular PN axons (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lledo et al., 2005</xref>). Although a considerable number of medial-tract MGC neurons have previously been reported in various moth species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christensen and Hildebrand, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansson et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansson et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jarriault et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kanzaki et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanzaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nirazawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vickers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhao and Berg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), the main focus has so far been odor coding within the MGC. Only a few studies have paid close attention to the protocerebral projections of these medial-tract PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanzaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Thereby, our two main questions are where in the lateral protocerebrum these neurons project to and how the pheromone neural circuit at this level processes information with opposite valences.</p><p>The male moth studied here, <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> (Lepidoptera, <italic>Noctuidae</italic>, <italic>Heliothinae</italic>), utilizes <italic>cis-</italic>11-hexadecenal (Z11-16:Al) as the primary pheromone component and <italic>cis-</italic>9-hexadecenal (Z9-16:Al) as a secondary component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>), in a species-specific ratio ranging from 100:2.5 to 100:4.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hillier and Baker, 2016</xref>). Notably, the secondary constituent is identical with the primary pheromone component of the coresidential and closely related species, <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>, in which Z11-16:Al and Z9-16:Al form the pheromone blend in a range of ratios from 5.7:100 to 6.7:100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hillier and Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), and could thus act as an aversive signal at high concentrations. Another female-produced minor component, <italic>cis</italic>-9-tetradecenal (Z9-14:Al), undoubtedly plays a dual role in <italic>H. armigera</italic>. At higher dosages, it acts as a behavioral antagonist inhibiting the pheromone attraction, that is, when more than five units of Z9-14:Al are added to 100 units of the specific binary pheromone blend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gothilf et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>). However, at lower dosages, it acts as an agonist, that is, when 0.3–5 units are added to 100 units of the specific binary pheromone blend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). This functional duality of a single molecular component indicates the complexity of the neural circuits processing pheromone information. The system must be capable of encoding attractive and aversive signals appropriately in order to elicit coordinated responses maximizing reproductive fitness.</p><p>In the study presented here, we characterized the male-specific PNs passing along the prominent mALT and the slightly thinner mlALT in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, focusing particularly on their projection patterns in the lateral protocerebrum. By applying the intracellular recording/staining technique, combined with calcium imaging experiments, we have mapped the projection patterns of physiologically identified MGC neurons. Based on the detailed neuronal architecture of individual PNs and their high-resolution spiking data we computed a descriptive framework reflecting the activity pattern dynamics within distinct protocerebral subregions induced by four behaviorally relevant female-produced odorants. The current study provides solid evidence for a spatial arrangement within the relevant protocerebral neuropils of the male moth demonstrating distinct regions receiving input about separate or intermixed female-released signals associated with attraction versus inhibition of attraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping odor-evoked responses of the MGC output neurons by means of calcium imaging</title><p>The projection pattern of the male-specific <italic>sensory</italic> neurons onto the MGC units was previously mapped via bath application calcium imaging studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuebler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). To measure the output signals from the same three MGC glomeruli, we performed calcium imaging measurements of odor-evoked responses in a group of PNs exclusively. By applying a calcium-sensitive dye (Fura-2) into the calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), we label primarily the population of medial-tract uniglomerular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kymre et al., 2021</xref>).

For simplicity, Z9-14:Al is mentioned as a behavioral antagonist in the subsequent text. The imaging data of mALT PNs connected to each of the three MGC units was obtained from dorsally oriented brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The average correlation between the cumulus medial-tract PNs responses (mean calcium signal during stimulation windows subtracted by that during the pre-stimulation period) across individuals was 0.45. The corresponding average correlations of PNs from the dma and dmp units were 0.55 and 0.24, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These paired-individual correlations were greater than the nonlinear relationship with a chance level of 0 (<italic>t</italic>-test, p<italic>'</italic>s&lt;0.002), confirming the general response consistency across different insects. We then profiled the pheromone responses in mALT PNs from each MGC unit in eight insects, by comparing the Fura signals evoked by each stimulus during the 2 s stimulation window with the control (hexane; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The average calcium traces and response amplitudes observed in these insects are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. As expected, the cumulus PN population showed a pronounced activation during stimulation with the primary pheromone and the pheromone blend. The dma output neuron population, in turn, responded not only to the behavioral antagonist but also to the primary pheromone and the pheromone blend. The dmp PNs responded to the secondary pheromone and the behavioral antagonist, as well as to the pheromone mixture. All these responses showed a phasic component that decayed over the course of the stimulation period. Taken together, each stimulus with different behavioral relevance evoked a unique activation pattern in the three MGC units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also analyzed the mean calcium traces of eight individuals across seven stimuli (see <italic>Odor stimulation</italic> section in Materials and methods). The across-stimuli correlation plot illustrates that, unlike the relatively defined responses of the PNs innervating the cumulus and the dmp unit, the population of dma PNs evoked a broad activation pattern including responses to all female-produced chemicals tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Based on the morphological and electrophysiological data from each individual MGC-PN, we generated a descriptive framework mapping the neural activity patterns within the relevant protocerebral areas. Here, the mean firing traces of recorded MGC-PNs with projections into the same individual output region were computed. The response amplitude of the simulated mean trace was used as the simulated value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The primary pheromone signals were processed within the SLP and SIP whereas the minor components were represented in the LH. It appeared that odor signals evoking attractive and aversive behaviors would excite different protocerebral subregions regardless of the neurons’ glomerular arborizations.

Except for uniglomerular cumulus mALT PNs, the response patterns of MGC output neurons appeared rather similar in both high and low concentrations. The cumulus PNs commonly responded with increased spiking frequency to both low and high concentrations of the primary pheromone and the pheromone mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). The phasic onset was most prominent for PNs in the low concentration protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>); these neurons also appeared to discriminate between odorants more precisely than PNs in the high concentration protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). This coincides with previous studies reporting that OSNs display less specific response profiles with increasing odor concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Malnic et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sato et al., 1994</xref>).

Therefore, these responses might be mediated by local computation involving local interneurons or multiglomerular MGC-PNs.</p><p>The responding profile of the uniglomerular dma PNs seemed somewhat complicated but were in line with their projection patterns: PNs having fine branches approaching the SLP in addition to the terminals in the VLP and LH, were excited by the behavioral antagonist and the secondary pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A–C</xref>), while PNs with restricted projections in the VLP and LH were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D–F</xref>). In addition, the multiglomerular PN arborizing in the dma and three posterior-complex glomeruli showed no response to any stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4G–K</xref>). The four uniglomerular mALT PNs innervating the dmp were stimulated with the high-concentration protocol only. Even though the dmp unit reportedly receives input about the secondary pheromone and the behavioral antagonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), only one of the dmp-PNs identified here was significantly excited by both of these components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Of the three remaining dmp-PNs, one was excited by the behavioral antagonist exclusively, whereas two displayed no responses during any stimulus application.</p><p>The AL innervations of the four multiglomerular medial-tract PNs innervating all MGC units varied considerably. To investigate a putative association between MGC innervation and response characteristics, we quantified the dendritic density of each PN by measuring the fluorescence intensities within the separate MGC units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>), as previously performed (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kc et al., 2020</xref>). Most of these PNs having terminal projections in the VLP and LH responded to the behavioral antagonist. This indicated that each PN’s responding profile did not correspond precisely with its dendritic architecture, but rather with its output region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The responses of mlALT PNs corresponded with OSN inputs</title><p>The three mediolateral-tract MGC-PNs consisted of two morphological sub-types displaying different response profiles. The singular PN constituting the first sub-type targeted the VLP, SLP, and SIP, while its dendrites filled the cumulus densely and the dma, dmp, and some posterior complex glomeruli sparsely. This neuron responded with a weak and early phasic excitation to most stimuli. Yet, the primary pheromone induced the only significant response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). The other sub-type, including two mlALT PNs, projecting to the VLP exclusively, covered the MGC units quite uniformly. These PNs were more broadly tuned by responding with excitation to all stimuli. However, their responses to the pheromone mixture and the primary pheromone lasted substantially longer than the phasic excitations elicited by the secondary component and the behavioral antagonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Representation of output signals from MGC-PNs</title><p>Based on the precise electrophysiological and morphological data obtained from the intracellular recordings, we took the mean response of MGC medial- and mediolateral-tract PN types, to provide a summary of odor-stimuli representation across the separate MGC units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We first categorized the neurons into four groups based on their dendritic arborization, that is, in the cumulus, dma, dmp, or in all MGC units. The mean responses within the different neuron groups showed that mALT PNs with dendrites in the cumulus deal with the primary pheromone, and those in the dmp unit with the secondary pheromone and the behavioral antagonist. This is consistent with the calcium imaging results on medial-tract PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), and with former reports on response properties of the corresponding OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). However, unlike previous reports on OSN input, both our individual PN recordings and calcium imaging tests indicated a role for the dma PNs in processing information not only about the behavioral antagonist, but also, surprisingly, about the primary pheromone and pheromone mixture. However, averaging the activity across the uniglomerular dma neurons demonstrated that the most potent stimuli for these PNs were the behavioral antagonist and the pheromone mixture, while the primary pheromone elicited only minor increases in mean firing rates. Here, the influence of multiglomerular MGC-PNs may affect the responses to the mixture and the primary pheromone. For the fourth group, which consisted of the multiglomerular mALT and mlALT PNs arborizing in the entire MGC, the averaged data demonstrated activation by all female-produced components. Next, we compared the electrophysiological data of individual PNs with the calcium imaging results of populations of PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As the calcium imaging experiment could not distinctly measure the responses from the subpopulation of uniglomerular PNs, the more broadly tuned responding patterns were probably a result of signals from both multi- and uniglomerular MGC-PNs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In moths, the sex pheromone is usually produced as a blend of several components in a species-specific ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Hansson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Christensen et al., 1995</xref>). Principally, the male is attracted by the major pheromone component released by a conspecific female. While minor components do not elicit upwind flight on their own, they may enhance attraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>), and can also serve as behavioral antagonists, since such components are often produced by heterospecific females (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2014</xref>) or immature conspecific females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2017</xref>). Despite these innate responses, the mate-searching activities, including an initial surge and zig-zag casting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardé and Willis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuenen and Cardé, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vickers and Baker, 1994</xref>), are not simple olfactory reflexes. The data presented here, comprising a large number of MGC medial-tract PNs mainly originating from one of three easily identifiable glomeruli, indicated that such behavioral responses are related not only to spatial representation of odor valence in the lateral protocerebrum, but also to the intensity of the relevant signals. Taken together, these results confirm our previous suggestions signifying that the lateral protocerebrum contributes to innate attraction/avoidance behavior based on composite odor input coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Pheromone signaling along parallel ALTs</title><p>Parallel processing of AL output neurons has been reported in many insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galizia and Rössler, 2010</xref>). Similar to the most studied insect model, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, the moth also has three main tracts connecting the lateral protocerebrum and the AL. Male-specific signals originating from the MGC of the moth is carried along these tracts. The findings presented here, comprising high-resolution morphological and physiological data on MGC-PNs passing along the medial and mediolateral ALT in <italic>H. armigera</italic>, complement newly reported and corresponding results on MGC-PNs confined to the third tract, the lateral ALT, in the same species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>). Interestingly, both medial- and lateral-tract MGC-PNs are mainly uniglomerular. However, the medial tract includes PNs originating from each of the three MGC-units whereas the lateral tract is reported to connect with the cumulus exclusively. Besides, their projection patterns are different; while medial-tract MGC-PNs extend widespread terminal branches into various protocerebral regions, including the SLP, posterior SIP, and VLP, the (unilateral) lateral-tract MGC-PNs converge within a restricted region anteriorly in the SIP called the column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>). To clarify how the pheromone-information is carried along not only the medial and the lateral ALT but also in the somewhat thinner mediolateral ALT, we integrated the morphological findings from the previous study with our current results, and constructed a comprehensive map displaying the neural connections between MGC/AL glomeruli and the protocerebral target areas for each tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>).

The mean firing traces of recorded MGC-PNs with projections into the same individual output region were computed. As pheromone-signaling appeared to be particularly fast in the lateral-tract MGC-PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>), we decided to plot the neurons’ mean firing traces within the stimulation window instead of their mean response amplitudes. The 42 MGC-PNs included in this analysis, consisted of 29 neurons in the mALT, three in the mlALT, and 10 in the lALT (including four unilateral PNs and six bilateral PNs). Interestingly, when including the data from lateral-tract MGC-PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>), we discovered a sequential and logic response pattern in the different protocerebral areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–C</xref>). Here, the excitatory response to the pheromone mixture arose first in the SIP, as a typical phasic response. After 20 ms, a phasic-tonic response to the binary mixture appeared in the SLP and VLP. Finally, about 120 ms later, a weak signal lasting for 10 ms could be seen in the LH. The primary pheromone evoked similar temporal response patterns in the SIP, SLP, and VLP, but barely any kind of signal could be observed in the LH. The secondary pheromone elicited weak and delayed excitation in the VLP and LH, corresponding in time with the tiny peak evoked by the binary mixture in the LH. Finally, the behavioral antagonist induced a clear and long-lasting response in the LH and a considerably weaker activation in the VLP.</p><p>To examine the content validity of our framework, we investigated whether the presented outline onto the protocerebral neuropils would be fundamentally altered if additional data points were included. We first carried out a simple computational experiment in which we shuffled the firing traces of individual PNs, selecting a different assembly of neurons by randomly recruiting two-thirds of the data points in the group. The data shuffling was repeated five times, and each time a different assembly of neurons was included. The cross correlations between each of the data assemblies showed that neuronal response profiles were unchanged in the neuropils associated with different behavioral valences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Then, to rule out the possibility that the high cross assemblies’ correlation was resulting from individual PNs having comparable firing profiles, we computed the correlations of the firing traces between every two PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). It appeared that the firing traces of individual PNs were clearly less correlated in comparison with that across different shuffling assemblies.</p><p>Notably, the very fast response in the SIP region, which occurred during stimulation with the pheromone blend and the primary constituent exclusively, involves the previously reported lateral-tract MGC-PNs terminating in the column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>). Comparing the response onset in the SIP with the other output regions, demonstrates that the lateral-tract PNs react prior to PNs in the other main tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This is particularly interesting as the MGC neurons confined to medial tract in this species have a much lower spontaneous firing rate as compared with the lateral-tract PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>). The ‘quieter’ background of the medial-tract PNs might facilitate registration of the pheromone signals. One possible explanation for this property could be that the medial-tract PNs to a large extent are wired with OSNs indirectly via local interneurons, while the lateral-tract PNs may have synaptic contact more directly with the OSNs. This coincides with the connectomical results shown for the sexually dimorphic glomerulus, VA1v, in the fruit fly, where the local interneurons have stronger connections with the mALT PNs than the lALT PNs. Besides, the number of presynaptic sites is much higher in the medial-tract PNs than in the lateral-tract PNs, and the dendritic arborizations are also denser in the medial-tract PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horne et al., 2018</xref>). As shown in the results, the MGC-PNs in the third and minor tract, the mediolateral ALT, had terminal projections partly overlapping with medial-tract MGC-PNs indicating that these tracts may be involved in activation of the same downstream neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This agrees with previous observations in <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Homberg et al., 1988</xref>). The lateral ALT, on the other hand, which innervates the column, seems to constitute a separate circuit. This reinforces our proposed concept implying that the mALT and mlALT are involved in fine-tuned odor coding, whereas the lALT plays a different role by initiating flight behavior evoked by the key component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ian et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Protocerebral output areas of MGC medial-tract neurons are organized according to behavioral valence</title><p>Despite the relatively widespread and partly overlapping terminal branches of the total assembly of medial-tract MGC-PNs, including 16 originating in the cumulus, four in the dmp, four in the dma, and five being multiglomerular, we discovered a pattern implying a spatial arrangement according to the cumulus-PNs versus the dma- and dmp-PNs. As discussed in detail below, this may correspond to the ‘lateral-medial’ representation of attraction- and aversion-related pheromone-signals previously reported in the protocerebrum of the closely related <italic>Helicoverpa</italic> species, <italic>H. assulta,</italic> and also in corresponding areas in the silk moth, <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kanzaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Seki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).

All data, including our calcium imaging measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and mean intracellular responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) confirm that the cumulus is devoted to process input about the primary pheromone. Notably, the multiglomerular mlALT PN innervating the SLP and SIP had its most dense innervations in the cumulus as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, third-order pheromone-processing neurons in the SLP and SIP should primarily be involved in computations related to attraction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>Anteroventral parts of the LH process dma and dmp input</title><p>In contrast to the SLP and SIP, being innervated by the medial-tract cumulus neurons, the anteroventral LH was the target for the PNs originating in one of the two smaller MGC units, the dma and dmp. Thereby, input about the primary pheromone is processed dorsomedially to input about the secondary component and the behavioral antagonist. This lateral-medial separation resembles the spatial pattern previously reported in the closely related species, <italic>H. assulta</italic>, where the primary pheromone is represented medially to the interspecific signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).

Summarizing the response patterns of the MGC-PNs innervating the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we found that the highest mean firing rate appeared during application of the behavioral antagonist. The secondary pheromone also induced increased spike frequency, but substantially weaker. As mentioned in the introduction, the behavioral antagonist, Z9-14:Al, reduces mating-associated behaviors as soon as its ratio vs. binary pheromone blend increases to 5:100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), while it enhances such behaviors when the ratio is between 0.3:100 and 5:100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

The secondary pheromone component, Z9-16:Al, resembles Z9-14:Al in that it may also include both enhancement and inhibition of attraction, dependent on the ratio. Concretely, Z9-16:Al is known to augment attraction when combined with the primary pheromone Z11-16:Al, but to reduce attraction when constituting a ratio to primary pheromone more than 11:100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kehat and Dunkelblum, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehat et al., 1980</xref>). Notably, high ratios of Z9-16:Al may serve as an interspecific signal, due to it being the primary pheromone of sympatric <italic>H. assulta</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cork et al., 1992</xref>). Altogether, in light of the complex behavioral functions of Z9-16:Al and Z9-14:Al, our data indicate that the anteroventral part of the LH is involved in inhibition of attraction when the moth encounters high ratios of the relevant components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A proposed interaction between the LH and the SLP/SIP</title><p>How can each of the two substances, Z9-14:Al and Z9-16:Al, serve opposite functions? During mate-searching behavior, the likelihood of encountering the primary pheromone is much larger than detecting the minor components, due to their proportion ratios in the natural female-released pheromone mixture. As such, the SLP and SIP, which receive information about the primary pheromone, is likely to be activated prior to the anteroventral LH. Notably, a prominent neural link between the LH and SLP in moths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Namiki and Kanzaki, 2019</xref>) appears to be a strong candidate for governing the ‘correct’ mate-searching behavior. A study in the fruit fly has demonstrated that the LH output projects primarily to SLP and secondly to the SIP, and about one-third of these neurons are GABAergic/glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). Since both neurotransmitters are inhibitory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu and Wilson, 2013</xref>), this indicates that LH input may block the activation of SLP and SIP output neurons and their downstream circuits. The interaction between the LH and SLP/SIP could act as a Boolean logic gate implementing the AND-NOT function, only passing information downstream when aversive signaling is minimally present in the anteroventral LH.</p><p>We propose that this form of Boolean logic represents a flexible interaction between the LH and SLP/SIP. The LH output is mainly modulated by the input from the AL PNs, and the activity of these neurons increases with increasing odor concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta and Stopfer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lerner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sachse and Galizia, 2003</xref>). When a moth encounters the primary pheromone and a very low amount of the secondary pheromone (released by conspecific female), the LH input is weak and the inhibition from the LH to SLP/SIP minimal, therefore, the output from the SLP/SIP to downstream targets remains strong. Should a big amount of the secondary pheromone or the behavioral antagonist (released by a heterospecific female) recruit vigorous MGC-PN output onto the LH, the GABAergic/glutamatergic LH neurons will inhibit the activity in SLP/SIP and the downstream signaling. This might be perceived as a loss of contact with the primary pheromone, leading the moth to quickly engage in a casting flight, that is, crosswind flight with no net upwind movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuenen and Cardé, 1994</xref>), and thereby promote an appropriate mate-searching strategy.</p><p>Given that the SLP/SIP is involved in processing pheromone information solely about attraction, while the LH represents ratio-dependent ambiguous signals, one question appearing is how the presence of a low dose of the minor components enhances attraction when added to the primary pheromone. Concerning Z9-16:Al, for example, our findings indicate that integration of the secondary and primary pheromone might occur at the level of MGC output PNs. Here, we first analyzed the physiological data of 11 uniglomerular medial-tract PNs with projections to SLP/SIP having excitatory responses to the primary pheromone and pheromone mixture. Their response amplitudes as well as response peaks were compared during stimulation with the primary pheromone alone and the binary mixture (ratio of secondary pheromone vs. primary pheromone ranged from 3:100 to 5:100). In both electrophysiological recording and calcium imaging experiments, the pheromone mixture showed a tendency of evoking a stronger response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We also found at least three cumulus-PNs with projections in the SLP that had a tonic and delayed excitation to the secondary pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3G</xref>) suggesting the existence of local computation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The pheromone-processing role of the VLP is complex</title><p>Unlike the neuropils discussed above, the VLP was innervated by all MGC-PNs labelled in this study. Specifically, they sent terminal projections into a compact sub-domain of the dorsoanterior VLP, which thereby gets intermingled signals about all female-relevant compounds. This suggests that the VLP is involved in combinatorial coding, possibly recognizing the optimal species-specific signal. In addition, combinatorial coding of pheromone signals seems to occur at an earlier level as well. The dendritic organization of the multiglomerular MGC-PNs prime these neurons for such signal processing. This was, perhaps, most clearly demonstrated by the broad response profiles of the mediolateral-tract PNs with evenly distributed dendrites across the MGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s7">Figure 5—figure supplement 7</xref>). These PNs responded to all female-produced components, but with distinct temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and may provide excitatory or inhibitory output since about half of the axons forming this tract are GABAergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, we demonstrated that these mlALT PNs had overlapping terminals with the medial-tract MGC-PNs in this neuropil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating the possibility of axo-axonic interaction. As the VLP is one known region with overlapping terminals of pheromone PNs across different tracts, this makes it a particularly interesting neuropil for future studies investigating parallel processing in the pheromone system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p>Male moths (2–3 days) of <italic>H. armigera</italic> were used in this study.

A glass electrode tip coated with Fura-2 dextran (potassium salt, 10,000 MW, Molecular Probes) was inserted into the calyces to selectively label the medial-tract PNs. The insects were then kept for 12 hr at 4°C before the experiment, to facilitate retrograde transportation.</p><p>In vivo calcium imaging recordings were obtained with an epifluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51WI) equipped with a 20x/1.00 water immersion objective (OlympusXLUMPlanFLN). Images were acquired by a 1344 × 1224 pixel CMOS camera (Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash4.0 V2 C11440-22CU). The preparation was excited with 340 and 380 nm monochromatic light, respectively (TILL Photonics Polychrome V), and data were acquired ratiometrically. A dichroic mirror (420 nm) and an emission filter (490–530 nm) were used to separate the excitation and emission light. Each recording consisted of 100 double frames at a sampling frequency of 10 Hz with 35 and 10 ms exposure times for the 340 and 380 nm lights, respectively. The duration of one recording trial was 10 s, including 4 s with spontaneous activity, 2 s odor stimulation, and a 4 s post-stimulus period. The odor stimulation was carried out by a stimulus controller (SYNTECH CS-55), via which humidified charcoal filtered air was delivered through a 150 mm glass Pasteur-pipette with a piece of filter paper containing the stimulus. Each odor stimulus was applied twice. The interval between trials was 60 s to avoid possible adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Intracellular recording and staining</title><p>Preparation of the insect has been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kc et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kymre et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the moth was restrained inside a plastic tube with the head exposed and then immobilized with dental wax (Kerr Corporation, Romulus, MI). The brain was exposed by opening the head capsule and removing the muscle tissue. The exposed brain was continuously supplied with Ringer's solution (in mM): 150 NaCl, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 3 KCl, 25 sucrose, and 10 N-tris (hydroxymethyl)-methyl-2-amino-ethanesulfonic acid, pH 6.9.</p><p>The procedure of intracellular recording/staining of neurons was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ian et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Sharp glass electrodes were made by pulling borosilicate glass capillaries (OD 1 mm, ID 0.5 mm, with hollow filament 0.13 mm; Hilgenberg GmbH, Germany) on a horizontal puller (P97; Sutter Instruments, Novarto, CA). The tip of the micro-pipette was filled with a fluorescent dye, that is, 4% biotinylated dextran-conjugated tetramethylrhodamine (3000 mw, micro-ruby, Molecular Probes; Invitrogen, Eugene, OR) in 0.2 M KAc. The glass capillary was back-filled with 0.2 M KAc. A chlorinated silver wire inserted into the muscle in the mouthpart served as the reference electrode. The recording electrode, having a resistance of 70–150 MΩ, was carefully inserted into the dorsolateral region of the AL via a micromanipulator (Leica). Neuronal spike activity was amplified (AxoClamp 1A, Axon Instruments, Union, CA) and monitored continuously by oscilloscope and loudspeaker. Spike2 6.02 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, England) was used as acquisition software. During recording, the moth was ventilated constantly with a steady stream of fresh air. During odor stimulation, a pulse of air from the continuous airstream was diverted via a solenoid-activated valve (General Valve Corp., Fairfield, NJ) through a glass cartridge bearing the odorant on a piece of filter paper. Up to six odors were tested in each recording experiment, while the number of trials were dependent on the stability of the neuronal contact. The duration of the odor stimulus was 400 ms. After testing all odor stimuli, the neuron was iontophoretically stained by applying 2–3 nA pulses with 200 ms duration at 1 Hz for about 5–10 min. In order to allow neuronal transportation of the dye, the preparation was kept overnight at 4°C. The brain was then dissected from the head capsule and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1–2 hr at room temperature, before it was dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90%, 96%, 2 × 100%; 10 min each). Finally, the brain was cleared and mounted in methylsalicylate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Odor stimulation</title><p>During intracellular recordings, the following stimuli were tested: (i) the primary sex pheromone of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, Z11-16:Al, (ii) the secondary sex pheromone, Z9-16:Al, (iii) the binary mixture of Z11-16:Al and Z9-16:Al, (iv) the behavioral antagonist of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, Z9-14:Al, (v) the head space of a host plant (sunflower leaves), and (vi) hexane as a vehicle control. The three insect-produced components were obtained from Pherobank (Wijk bij Duurstede, Netherlands). Each component was diluted in hexane (99%, Sigma) at different concentrations before being applied onto a filter paper that was placed inside a 120 mm glass cartridge. Stimuli i–iv were used in two distinct stimulation protocols, that is, either with low or high concentrations of the respective stimuli. For the low concentration protocol, 20 µl of the 0.5 ng/µl stimulus stock was applied onto the filter paper, making the final amount of 10 ng of the relevant stimulus. For the high concentration protocol, we applied 20 µl of the 5 ng/µl stimulus stock, resulting in a stimulus dosage of 100 ng per filter paper. In the low concentration protocol, the mixture of Z11-16:Al and Z9-16:Al were in a 100:5 proportion, while in the high concentration protocol it was in a 100:3 proportion, both resembling the natural blend emitted by conspecific females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hillier and Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehat et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccardi et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu et al., 1997</xref>). Note that the ID of PNs stimulated with the low concentration protocol were numbered (e.g., Cu-mALT1), while the PNs stimulated with the high stimulation protocol were named with letters (e.g., Cu-mALTa). To avoid adaptation, PNs in the high concentration protocol did not receive repeated trials, as large dosages of pheromones are associated with prolonged adaptation of the relevant OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dolzer et al., 2003</xref>). The same odor stimuli as listed above were used during the calcium imaging experiments, but at higher amounts (required to evoke responses in this technique), that is, 10 µg at the filter paper. To avoid adaptation, the interstimulus interval was 1 min. An additional stimulus containing a 50:50 mixture of host plant (20 µl) and pheromone mix (20 µl 100:5 mixture) was added in the calcium imaging measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Confocal microscopy</title><p>Whole brains were imaged by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 800 Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Plan-Neofluar 20x/0.5 objective and/or a 10x/0.45 water objective (C-achroplan). Micro-ruby staining was excited with a HeNe laser at 553 nm and the fluorescent emission passed through a 560 nm long-pass filter. In addition to the fluorescent dyes, the auto-fluorescence of endogenous fluorophores in the neural tissue was imaged to visualize relevant neuropil structures in the brain containing the stained neurons. Since many fluorophore molecules are excited at 493 nm, these auto-fluorescent images were obtained by using an argon laser in combination with a 505–550 nm band pass filter.

This work presents detailed functional evidence for the segregation of olfactory values in the moth brain, and will be of interest to neuroscientists investigating how sensory information is organized in the brain. Through a combination of technically challenging experiments, the study identifies the brain regions that differentially process attractive vs aversive olfactory pheromone signals. This foundational study provides compelling evidence for how the moth brain interprets complex pheromone olfactory odors.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct protocerebral neuropils associated with attractive and aversive female-produced odorants in the male moth brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have, for example, included an introductive figure (Figure 1) providing essential background information. In the result section, we profoundly reorganized the data presentation by highlighting the major findings both in the text and figure material. As suggested by the editor, a new figure is made, figure 3 (substituting the original Figure 2), visualizing the main neuron types in separate panels as well as in joint plots (confocal data and 3D-models), and presenting descriptive/predictive frameworks reflecting the stimulus‑evoked neuronal activity within the relevant output regions of the PNs. The discussion is also reshaped, for instance, by including the issue of parallel olfactory processing in the current species as well as across different species. Altogether, we believe the revision has made the article more relevant to a broad audience. We hope our study dealing with one of the numerous insect species that inhabit our planet will be of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

However, errors due to local distortions often occur when registering neurons into a common brain frame. In fact, we have previous experience from affine/elastic registration of neurons into standard brains of both <italic>H. assulta</italic> and <italic>H. virescens</italic> male (Zhao et al., 2014). Another reliable source for such comparison is raw image data including identifiable neurons simultaneously stained in the same brain. In Figure 3C, we demonstrate overlapping terminal projections in the LH of two uniglomerular MGC-PNs originating from each of the two smaller MGC-units, the dma and dmp. And in Figure 4, we show the terminal projections of MGC-PNs confined to each of the three main tracts, demonstrating overlapping terminal arbors for medial- and mediolateral-tract neurons whereas the lateral-tract neuron projects to a separate area.</p><p>In line with the suggestion from the editor and one of the reviewers, we have added AMIRA reconstructions in the revised manuscript, including not only the skeleton of individual PNs but also 3D‑reconstructions of the neuropil regions innervated by each neuron. These data, confirming the neurons’ morphological properties, are presented in the figure supplement. In addition, for visualization purposes, we plotted each traced skeleton onto the representative brain, based on the reconstructed data obtained by using the ‘transform editor’ function in AMIRA (Figure 3). In addition, we have also submitted all morphological data (confocal stacks and 3D-AMIRA reconstructions) of the main MGC-PN types to the newly established Insect brain database (InsectbrainDB, 2021) for cross comparison with other insect species.

As the reviewer pointed out, the recording data was collected from two stimulation protocols: the ratio of 100:3 was used in 100 ng pheromone mixture and the ratio of 100:5 in 10 ng pheromone mixture. Before we decided to include the PNs’ responding data to the pheromone mixtures from both protocols, the spike data during the stimulation window (ZIFR trace comprising 40 bins) from 10 cumulus‑PNs was carefully analyzed, among them, 5 PNs sorted within the 100 ng protocol and 5 within the 10 ng protocol (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). Repeated measures with one within factor (Bin) and one between factor (Protocol) were conducted on the spike data in 40 bins (binning size was 10 ms for 400ms) and between these two protocols. The analyses were then repeated in every 100 ms interval within the 400 ms stimulation window. The results showed there was no effect on the between-factor. Moreover, there was no interaction effect between the within-factor and the between-factor. The statistical data is listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>.
