Misfolding of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) results in aggregate formation, but how the aggregates are processed, especially during cell division is not well understood. Here, we induced proteostatic stress and protein aggregation using a proteostasis reporter, which is prone to misfolding and aggregation in the ER. Unexpectedly, we detected solid-like protein aggregates deposited mainly in the nucleus and surrounded by the ER membrane. The membrane-bound aggregates were then cleared as cells progressed through mitosis and cytokinesis. Aggregate clearance depended on Hsp70 family chaperones in the ER, particularly BiP, and proteasomal activity. The clearance culminated at mitotic exit and required cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) inactivation but was independent of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C). The ER reorganization that is active during mitosis and cytokinesis was required for the aggregate clearance. Thus, dividing cells reorganize the ER networks to allow BiP to clear the protein aggregates to maintain proteostasis in the newly divided cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>aggregates</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>ER reorganization</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32350610247)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Ting Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32270770)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chew</surname><given-names>Ting Gang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ER aggregates confined in the nucleus are cleared via ER reorganization when cells progress through mitosis and cytokinesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nascent polypeptides fold into three-dimensional structures to perform their biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hipp et al., 2019</xref>). Misfolded proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues exposed and result in aggregation of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>). Intramolecular beta-sheets in some proteins are also structural elements prone to protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Protein misfolding and aggregation not only disrupt the native function of the protein but also could interfere with other proteins’ functions by co-aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Woerner et al., 2016</xref>). This challenges proteome homeostasis (proteostasis) and causes proteostatic stress in cells, which is a main driver of cellular aging and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cells evolve several protein quality control (PQC) systems to maintain their proteostasis in which components of PQC systems facilitate refolding, degradation, and spatial deposition of misfolded protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jayaraj et al., 2020</xref>). Molecular chaperones are key players in the PQC system. They are involved to fold nascent polypeptides, target misfolded proteins for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system or autophagy, and promote solubilization of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tyedmers et al., 2010</xref>). Eukaryotic cells confine misfolded proteins and smaller aggregates into distinct cellular deposition sites, which reduce the reactivity of these harmful species to the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). These deposition sites include aggresomes or aggresome-like induced structures locating near centrosomes, INQ (intranuclear quality control compartment) residing in the nucleus, cytosolic CytoQ, and the perivacuolar IPOD (insoluble protein deposit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). Confinement of protein aggregates in a deposition site facilitates retention of aggregates in short-lived cells (mother cells) during asymmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilaniu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fuentealba et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Singhvi and Garriga, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The ER processes one-third of cellular proteome and possesses stronger ability to maintain aggregation-prone proteins in a non-toxic state than the cytosol owing to its specific molecular chaperone environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vincenz-Donnelly et al., 2018</xref>). Chaperones in the ER such as HSPA5/BiP regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR), which blocks instant protein synthesis and activates transcription of genes involved in PQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wiseman et al., 2022</xref>). In addition, the proteostatic stress in the ER triggers ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and ER-phagy to remove misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mochida and Nakatogawa, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Olzmann et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the high capacity of proteostatic stress response in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rousseau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Vincenz-Donnelly et al., 2018</xref>), excessive misfolded proteins still lead to formation of protein aggregates in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Miyata et al., 2020</xref>). In response to protein aggregation in the ER, BiP functions as a disaggregase to promote solubilization of these aggregates. In cells undergoing asymmetric cell division, such as in the budding yeast, the ER diffusion barrier and the ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway ensure ER protein aggregates are retained preferentially in the short-lived mother cells during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Piña and Niwa, 2015</xref>). How ER protein aggregates are regulated in dividing cells, especially those that do not undergo asymmetric cell division, is less well studied. We addressed the fate of ER protein aggregates in human cells undergoing cell division symmetrically and identified a clearance mechanism of protein aggregates when cells are progressing through mitosis and cytokinesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Targeting a proteostasis reporter to the ER results in protein aggregate formation in the nucleus</title><p>To investigate how cells maintain their proteostasis during cell division, we employed a proteostasis reporter consists of a firefly luciferase mutant prone for protein misfolding and protein aggregation fused to a green fluorescent protein (FlucDM-eGFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gupta et al., 2011</xref>). Next, we targeted the reporter to the ER by fusing an ER-targeting sequence at its N-terminus (ER-FlucDM-eGFP). Interestingly, we found that ER-FlucDM-eGFP assembled into visible protein aggregates in the nucleus when stably expressed in mammary epithelial MCF10A cells in the absence of any perturbation of the proteome stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The protein aggregates were below detection limit of our microscopy in the first 2 d after lentivirus transduction but progressively accumulated in cells and stabilized in the population several days after lentivirus transduction. This contrasted with a previous study in which the ER-FlucDM-eGFP was transiently expressed in cells and hence did not allow long-term tracking of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). ER-FlucDM-mCherry localized to the ER network indicated by the ER membrane protein Sec61β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since we detected aggregate formation in the nucleus in cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP, we tested if targeting FlucDM-eGFP to the nucleus (NLS-FlucDM-eGFP) would result in the formation of visible protein aggregates. Our data showed that NLS-FlucDM-eGFP did not form protein aggregates in the nucleus and was not co-localized with the ER-FlucDM-mCherry and accumulated lower protein abundance than ER-FlucDM-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ER-FlucDM-eGFP forms protein aggregates in the nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of ER-FlucDM-eGFP expressed in different cell lines.

These pathological mutants misfold and accumulate in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lukacs and Verkman, 2012</xref>). However, expression of CFTR-Δ508 and AAT S or Z variants did not result in the aggregate accumulation in the nucleus as observed in ER-FlucDM-eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Thus, a pathological mutant of ER proteins that are confined in the nucleus remains to be determined. Luciferase activity measurement showed that ER-FlucDM-eGFP has significantly reduced enzymatic activity and was not functional possibly due to misfolding and protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). ER-FlucDM-eGFP was also detected in the insoluble fraction after heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Moreover, we observed the colocalization of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates and thioflavin T (ThT), a universal dye to detect amyloid fibrils, further supporting these aggregates were misfolded protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Thus, expression of ER-FlucDM-eGFP results in proteostatic stress and allows us to study how protein aggregates are regulated in human cells.</p><p>Formation of protein aggregates in the nucleus by ER-FlucDM-eGFP was not limited to MCF10A cells. The protein aggregates were also detected in the nucleus when ER-FlucDM-eGFP was expressed in other cell lines such as A549, MDA-MB-231, and U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Similar observations were found when a different N-terminal signal peptide sequence was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). In addition, when ER-FlucDM was replaced by ER-HaloDM, which is a modified haloalkane dehalogenase prone to misfolding and aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melo et al., 2022</xref>), we observed similar protein aggregates in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). However, only a very low number of cells formed aggregates in the nucleus when intact GFP was targeted to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Thus, ER-FlucDM-eGFP formed protein aggregates in the nucleus independent of cell line, fluorescent protein types, specific ER targeting sequence, and FlucDM.</p><p>Despite localizing in the nucleus, we found that the protein aggregates were surrounded by the ER membrane as stained by the ER-tracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To further confirm this, we sectioned the cells and used electron microscopy to observe the protein aggregates.

ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates may derive from the invagination of the inner nuclear membrane. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Morris et al., 1997</xref> reported a similar aggregate formation in the nucleus upon BiP overexpression. This fluorescent-based live-cell imaging reporter enables us to study how protein aggregates are regulated in dividing cells, which are sensitive to genetic or environmental perturbations. Conventional methods that use proteasomal inhibitors to cause proteome imbalance are not ideal to investigate proteostasis in dividing cells given an essential role of proteasomes in driving mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghislain et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Glotzer et al., 1991</xref>). Additionally, methods such as heat shock also perturb mitotic progression, especially in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kakihana et al., 2019</xref>). By using ER-FlucDM-eGFP that does not perturb cell cycle progression significantly, we reveal an unexpected process of clearing protein aggregates in cells progressing through mitosis and cytokinesis. We found that ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates are confined in the nucleus within the ER membrane during interphase. When cells are progressing from mitosis to cytokinesis in which the Cdk1 activity is decreasing, the ER networks reorganize allowing BiP that has disaggregation ability to clear the ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates.</p><p>Previous studies showed that the proteome of mitotic cells has higher structural stability and is less aggregation-prone compared to that of in interphase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wirth et al., 2013</xref>). Post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation of mitotic proteins are suggested to be responsible for the protein stability during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becher et al., 2018</xref>). The aggregate clearance we identified in this study could represent an active mechanism that increases proteome stability in dividing cells. We found that aggregate clearance requires Cdk1 inactivation, which is a hallmark of mitotic exit, however, does not involve APC/C that is important in driving mitotic exit through protein degradation. It is possible that APC/C targets mostly cytosolic proteins whereas ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates are confined in a membrane during mitosis. Furthermore, the clearance of protein aggregates coincides with ER reorganization that happens throughout mitosis and cytokinesis, which may contribute to the aggregate clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schlaitz et al., 2013</xref>). A previous study showed that the size of protein aggregates is limited by the ER tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parashar et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, when the ER reorganization is perturbed by depleting ER membrane fusion proteins ATL2 and 3, clearance of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates is affected. Consistently, ER-FlucDM-eGFP proteins do not turn over significantly in cells progressing through mitosis and cytokinesis. Thus, it is less likely that ER-FlucDM-eGFP is ubiquitinated by APC/C and targeted for protein degradation.</p><p>Misfolded or damaged proteins form protein aggregates and are spatially organized into specific subcellular sites to sequester them from other cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). These aggregate deposition sites are localized in the cytosol or in the nucleus to confine misfolded proteins and aggregates for elimination from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, we identified confinement of ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregates in the nucleus and are surrounded by a single-layer membrane. These intranuclear membranous structures contain ER membranes and BiP, which is a key Hsp70 family chaperone in the ER and translocates into the nucleus under stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2023</xref>). How protein aggregates are targeted and assembled into the intranuclear membranous structure awaits future investigation. Interestingly, upon entry into mitosis, concomitant with the nuclear membrane breakdown, the membranous structure is released from the nucleus and the aggregates are cleared when cells progress through mitosis till early G1 phase of the daughter cells. The confinement and clearance of protein aggregates during cell division presumably protect dividing cells from harmful effects of protein misfolding and aggregation and ensure reliable inheritance of genetic materials. It has been reported that aggregates are asymmetrically retained in one of the daughter cells that are usually short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rujano et al., 2006</xref>). The aggregate clearance mechanism we report here may provide an additional cellular defense strategy to overcome proteostatic stress and to maintain proteome integrity during cell division. Proteomic analysis of cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP identified up-regulation of multiple proteins involved in ER stress response, indicating that cells experience significant proteostatic stress upon expression of ER-FlucDM-eGFP. Moreover, several proteins regulating cell cycle displayed higher abundance in the proteome, which together with proteostatic stress indicate a perturbed cellular health. It is possible that higher proteostatic stress renders cells more sensitive to perturbation of the protein expression at the proteome level. Changes in cell cycle protein levels may affect the cell cycle transition and result in longer or shorter timeframes in certain cell cycle phases. Future studies addressing these will reveal the physiological consequences of aggregate clearance.</p><p>Hsp70 chaperones regulate proteostasis by preventing protein aggregation, promoting disaggregation, and subjecting solubilized aggregates to degradation or refolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenzweig et al., 2019</xref>). Our proteomic analysis revealed significant expression of BiP (HSPA5) in cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP but not other Hsp70 family members. A recent study showed that BiP solubilizes aggregates and drives aggregate clearance in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Melo et al., 2022</xref>). Our study of mitotic aggregate clearance in dividing cells further extend the role of BiP in disaggregation. Consistently, we found that Cdk1 inactivation in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor could still lead to aggregate clearance, suggesting a partial role of the proteasome in clearing aggregates and the disaggregation breaks down the aggregates into smaller and possibly soluble species. The role of proteasome in regulating ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregate clearance appears indirect as ER-FlucDM-eGFP proteins are stable throughout cell division. It is possible that players involved in ER-FlucDM-eGFP aggregate clearance are regulated by proteasomal degradation, which are affected when proteasomes are inhibited. Interestingly, Melo et al. showed that aggregate clearance is promoted by treating ER-cells with ER stressors as the treatment triggers UPR, which in turn leads to higher activity of BiP to cope with the ER stress. We observed differential responses of aggregate clearance to ER stressors depending on the duration of the treatments. It is possible that acute treatment of the ER stressor on dividing cells does not provide sufficient time for cells to accumulate abundant amount of BiP given that mitotic cells are not very transcriptionally active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). Also, degradation of BiP could be accelerated upon the treatment of ER stressors, which in turn undermines the abundance of BiP in disaggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shim et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, short-term treatment of the ER stressor in cells exacerbates the ER stress and affects aggregate clearance during cell division, whereas longer treatment of the ER stressor promotes aggregate clearance.</p><p>While the molecular mechanism by which the ER-FlucDM-eGFP is cleared during mitosis and cytokinesis remains to be elucidated, we favor a model in which proteins involved in the ER reorganization are regulated through protein modifications or proteasomal degradation to promote aggregate clearance in cell division. Also, BiP might function as a disaggregase to disassemble the ER-FlucDM-eGFP when cells exit mitosis. Furthermore, the pathological aggregates that are formed and cleared in a similar manner as the ER-FlucDM-eGFP are yet to be identified. We believe that identification of the pathological targets and mechanistic understanding of aggregate clearance during cell division could offer new insights to understand disaggregation in proteostasis control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and culture</title><p>MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM F-12 (Sigma) supplemented with 1% Glutamax (Gibco), 5% horse serum (Biological Industries), 20 ng/ml EGF (Gibco), 0.5 mg/ml Hydrocortisone (MedChemExpress), 100 ng/ml Cholera toxin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml Insulin (Biological Industries), and 1% Pen/Strep (Biological Industries).

The solutions were then subjected to trypsin digestion and further analyzed using LC-MS/MS analysis. The MS/MS data were processed using DIA-NN (v1.8.1). The protein quantification of DIA-NN software is done by the MaxLFQ algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Luciferase activity test</title><p>Each well of 96-well plates (Biosharp, BS-MP-96W for luminescence, BS-MP-96B for fluorescence) was seeded with 10,000 cells in 100 μL of medium. After incubation for 18 hr, 5 μM MG132 was added to the MG132 +FlucDM eGFP group, while other untreated wells remained unchanged. Following an additional 6 hr, cells were washed once with PBS.</p><p>For luminescence detection, cell lysis was achieved by adding 50 μL of Steady-Glo Luciferase Assay System buffer (Promega, E2510) to the wells, followed by a 15 min incubation at room temperature. Luminescence in each well was then recorded three times over 5 min using the Spark Multimode Microplate Reader (Tecan, 1000ms exposure). Luminescence intensity in each well was calculated by normalizing these three measurements and subtracting the background signal from empty wells.</p><p>To determine abundance of luciferase in each treatment, 1×10<sup>5</sup> MCF10A cells were seeded in 12-well plates for 24 hr. The cells were lysed with 1 x LDS sample buffer (Beyotime) and protein immunoblotting using anti-β-actin and anti-GFP, respectively, was performed. β-actin was first used to normalize the GFP intensity, and the value was used to normalize the luminescence to calculate the luciferase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Mitotic cell preparation</title><p>To increase the quantity of dividing cells, cells were first seeded on imaging chambers (ibidi, 80826) and were synchronized to the G2/M boundary by treating cells with 7.5 μm RO-3306 (Selleckchem, S7747) for 16–20 hr. Cells were released to enter into mitosis synchronously by washing once with pre-warmed fresh medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Drug treatments</title><p>The following drugs were used in this study: Thapsigargin (Abcam, ab120286), Tunicamycin (GlpBio, GC16738), MG132 (CSN Pharm, CSN11436), YUM70 (Aladdin, Y413413), VER-155008 (CSN Pharm, CSN13116), Apcin (Sigma, SML1503), proTAME (Cayman Chemical, 25835), Cycloheximide (AbMole, M4879), Nocodazole (Beyotime, S1765), MLN-8237 (TargetMol, T2241).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>For HSPA5/BiP staining, MCF10A cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP were seeded in 8-well ibidi plates, fixed with 100% methanol for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. The fixed cells were blocked with 5% FBS in PBS for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were incubated with the mouse anti-BiP antibody (HuaBio, HA601076) at 1:200 dilution in 1% FBS overnight at 4 °C. The secondary antibody used was Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor 568, ab175472, Abcam) at 1:2000 dilution for 1 hr. For tubulin staining, cells were fixed using 4% PFA for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After blocking the fixed cells with 5% FBS in PBS for 30 min, cells were stained with the mouse anti-α-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, 66031–1-IG) at 1:200 dilution. The secondary antibody used was Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG H&amp;L (Alexa Fluor 568, ab175472, Abcam) at 1:2000 dilution for 1 hr. To stain DNA, DAPI Staining Solution (Sangon Biotech, E607303, 5 mg/L) was diluted in PBS to 50 ng/mL and applied to cells for 10 min. After the DAPI solution was removed, fixed cells were washed with PBS twice before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)</title><p>To prepare samples for TEM, MCF10A cells expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP were synchronized to the G2/M boundary by treating cells with RO-3306 for 16–20 hr and were released into mitosis by removing RO-3306. After 45 min released from the G2/M boundary, cells were trypsinized for 10 min before centrifugation. The cell pellet was fixed by 2.5% paraformaldehyde (in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature before overnight at 4 °C. Fixed pellet was further fixed by 1% osmium tetroxide and then 2% uranium acetate. Ethanol and acetone were used to dehydrate samples before embedding them into epoxy resin. Sectioned samples were observed by Tecnai G2 spirit 120 kV transmission electron microscopy (Thermo FEI).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Live-cell staining</title><p>The live-cell staining dyes used are as follows: 100 nM SiR-Tubulin (Cytoskeleton, CY-SC002), 1 μM ER-tracker Red (Beyotime, C1041S) or 10 μM Thioflavin T (ThT) in the medium to label cells for about 30 min in the incubator before imaging. For ThT staining, about 10% of aggregates could be stained by ThT in ER-FlucDM-mCherry cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Spinning-disk confocal microscopy imaging</title><p>The hardware configuration of the spinning-disk confocal microscopy system was as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2023</xref>). Imaging utilized a z-step size of 0.5 μm, with an x-y plane resolution of 183.3 nm/pixel for the 60x lens and 110 nm/pixel for the 100x lens. Fluorophores were excited using laser lines at wavelengths of 405, 488, 561, or 640 nm.</p><p>For FRAP analysis, images were acquired with 488 nm and 561 nm laser lines through the 100x lens. The procedure involved acquiring three pre-bleach images every 30 s, followed by bleaching the mCherry signal using the 561 nm laser. Subsequently, one image was acquired immediately post-bleaching, followed by ten images acquired every 30 s. In total, fourteen time-point images were acquired, and the total duration of each FRAP experiment was 6.5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Image analysis and processing</title><p>Fiji was used to process images. Z-stack images for quantification were first projected using max-intensity projection (Fiji/image/stacks/Z project). To quantify aggregates, projected images were classified by Trainable Weka Segmentation (Fiji/Plugins/Segmentation/Trainable Weka Segmentation). The segmented images were processed by using the ImageJ Macro commands: run(‘8-bit’); setOption(‘BlackBackground,’ true); run(‘Convert to Mask’); run(‘Watershed’) before using Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles). For time-lapse images except for images from FRAP, the segmented images were processed by using the ImageJ Macro commands: run(‘8-bit’); setThreshold(0, 120); run(‘Make Binary,’ ‘method = Default background = Light black’); run(‘Invert LUT’); run(‘Watershed,’ ‘stack’) before using Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles).</p><p>To quantify total GFP intensities in live cells, Z-stack images (24 μm) were acquired and projected using sum slices projection. Cell outlines were segmented using polygon selection in Fiji. To quantitate the background intensity, the mean intensity of a small dark region of the field of view was measured and multiplied by the area of the segmented cell. The background was subtracted from the GFP intensity of segmented cells.</p><p>For FRAP analysis of ER-eGFP and ER-HaloDM-eGFP, regions of interest (ROI) in projected images were manually selected and the average fluorescence intensity of ROIs was measured in Fiji. For FRAP analysis of aggregates in cells co-expressing ER-FlucDM-eGFP and ER-FlucDM-mCherry (both interphase and mitosis), the aggregates were first segmented by Weka Segmentation. The unsegmented images from the mCherry channel were processed by Analyze Particles (Fiji/Analyze/Analyze Particles) based on the corresponding segmented images from the GFP channel. For fluorescence intensity quantification, background in all FRAP experiments were subtracted by one hundred.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Datasets were analyzed by Student’s t-test or Mann-Whitney test.

Based on the differential expression of cell cycle proteins, how the authors interpret cellular health is unclear. Also, the physiological role of this mode of aggregate clearance remains unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added our interpretation of perturbed cellular health in cells expressing ERFlucDM-eGFP in the discussion (line 359).</p><p>It has been difficult to address the physiological relevance of aggregate clearance during cell division, as the inhibition of BiP or depletion of ATL2/3 that prevent aggregate clearance cause cellular consequences not specific to aggregate clearance.

Even though the number and area of the aggregates decrease significantly, the cytoplasmic GFP signal does not seem to increase. Considering new CHX chase experiments and total Fluorescence intensity calculations (Figure S7D), which indicate no difference, one would expect an increase in cytoplasmic signal upon the disassembly of aggregates. Therefore, the data from Figures 3A and 7D seem contradictory. Can the authors please explain?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologized for the confusion. The images in Figure 3A were derived from fixed cells. So, different cells were shown in every cell cycle phases and were not suitable for quantification. Fluorescence intensity changes could be better appreciated in Figure 3C or 4D as these were time-lapse microscopy images of live cells progressing through mitosis and cytokinesis. Data used in the quantification of fluorescence intensity in Figure S7D were derived from live cells taken from specific time points to avoid unwanted fluorescence bleaching during time-lapse microscopy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Do the authors expect a similar clearance of pathological aggregates such as mutant FUS or TDP43 condensates? Showing aggregate disassembly of disease-relevant aggregates would be an excellent addition to the manuscript, but it might be beyond the scope of the current version. However, the authors can comment/speculate how their study might extend to pathological condensates.</p></disp-quote><p>We tested three pathological mutants (CFTR-∆F508, AAT S and Z variants) that are known to mis-fold and accumulate in the ER. Unfortunately, expression of these mutants did not result in the confinement of aggregates in the nucleus. The data related to this have been added as Figure S1E and S1F (line 102) in this revised manuscript. We have commented that pathological targets are yet to be identified and could be a part of future work (line 392).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The presence of ER membrane around these aggregates is an interesting observation. This membrane is retained even after nuclear membrane breakdown. What could be the relevance of membrane-bound aggregates, especially since the membrane can limit the access of chaperones involved in disassembly? This observation becomes more important since the depletion of ER membrane fusion proteins also leads to the accumulation of aggregates. Are the membranes a beacon for disassembly? The authors may comment/ speculate. This could also be an important aspect of the mechanism of clearance.</p></disp-quote><p>We think that the ER membranes around the aggregates are disassembled when the ER networks reorganize during mitotic exit and this may allow accessibility of BiP to disaggregate the aggregates. We have added this in the discussion (line 316).</p></body></sub-article></article>
