Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. The molecular motions underlying spontaneous gating are unclear. Here we correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. We show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18164.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18164.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18164.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A protein pore called the CFTR channel allows chloride ions to move through the membrane of the cells that line the airways and some other parts of the human body. Mutations in the genes that encode CFTR may reduce the number of pores at the cell surface or stop them from working properly. When this happens, these cells cannot transport enough chloride, which causes the disease cystic fibrosis. CFTR contains two regions that lie inside the cell known as nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). These domains bind to the chemical energy molecule ATP, and when ATP does bind, two NBDs associate to form a dimer and the pore in CFTR opens.</p><p>The CFTR channel can occasionally open in a spontaneous way that does not require ATP. However, it was not clear whether NBDs also formed dimers when CFTR opened in this way. This is because spontaneous opening could reflect NBDs occasionally forming a dimer without ATP binding or it could occur when the pore occasionally opens without the NBDs forming a dimer.</p><p>To explore whether opening of the pore always requires NBD dimerization, Mihályi et al. studied the behaviour of single human CFTR channels produced in frog eggs. Normal channels and mutant ones (which show differences in spontaneous opening) were used, and the change in the way NBDs interacted when the channels spontaneously opened or closed was investigated. Mihályi et al. found that the NBD dimer forms when the pore spontaneously opens, demonstrating that this step happens both with and without ATP.</p><p>The result demonstrates that NBD dimer formation and pore movement are strictly coupled and that this is an inbuilt property of the CFTR protein. When ATP binds, this only changes how stable the open-pore and closed-pore structures of CFTR are but does not alter the fundamental architecture of the channel.</p><p>These new findings will be of interest to researchers studying a large group of transport proteins related to CFTR called ABC proteins. Furthermore, a drug called ivacaftor stimulates spontaneous opening of CFTR, and has recently been approved for clinical use to treat people with mutations in CFTR. As such, the new findings will be also useful to help researchers understand how ivacaftor stimulates the CFTR pore to open.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18164.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18164.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mutant cycle</kwd><kwd>thermodynamic coupling</kwd><kwd>ABC protein</kwd><kwd>structure</kwd><kwd>conformation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist Grant 55007416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lendület grant LP2012-39/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000897</institution-id><institution>Cystic Fibrosis Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant CSANAD15G0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Csanády</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Coupling of CFTR pore opening to nucleotide binding domain dimerization does not depend on ATP binding, but is an inherent property of the channel protein and likely other ABC transporters.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion channel which belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Riordan et al., 1989</xref>).

These two positions have co-evolved as a pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>), and in crystal structures of nucleotide-bound ABC NBD dimers the analogous side chains also form a hydrogen bond, the arginine serving as hydrogen donor and the threonine/serine side chain as acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2003</xref>).

The significance of this question goes beyond the scarcity of WT spontaneous openings. Indeed, the strictness of coupling between NBD and TMD movements is a strongly debated fundamental question, key for understanding the forces that drive the normal, ATP-dependent functional cycle of ABC proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirk and Wang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jih and Hwang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Okeyo et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, ivacaftor, the only potentiator drug to be approved so far for clinical use in CF patients, acts by promoting such spontaneous, ATP-independent, openings of G551D CFTR, the third most common disease mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bompadre et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jih et al., 2013</xref>).

Recently, mutations in the third intracellular loop (position 978, between TM helices 8 and 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2010</xref>), and at the cytosolic end of pore-lining TM helix 6 (position 355) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wei et al., 2014</xref>), were both found to strongly enhance spontaneous activity. Furthermore, these 'gain-of-function' effects proved additive in the double-mutant P355A–K978C, shifting spontaneous P<sub>o</sub> into a range where quantitative biophysical studies become tractable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wei et al., 2014</xref>).

Thus, the only plausible explanation is a stabilizing interaction, consistent with the formation of a hydrogen bond, in the spontaneous open state in WT channels that is lost in both single mutants, but is restored in the double mutant.

Here we show that spontaneous openings are also linked to tightening of the NBD interface around composite site 2, just as in the presence of bound ATP. Such strict coupling between NBD and pore movements – regardless of the absence or presence of ATP – strongly constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating, and understanding of the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins. It also helps explain modulatory effects of mutations, or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators. For example, the G551D CF mutation converts ATP at site 2 into an inhibitory ligand, due to electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP bound to the Walker motifs, and the introduced negative charge in the signature sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Such an effect would not be expected if the opposing NBD interfaces did not approach each other in the open-channel state, but is readily explained by openings being strictly linked to NBD dimer formation even in the G551D mutant. Furthermore, although reported low-probability ATP-independent pore openings of a CFTR construct lacking NBD2 (CFTR residues 1–1197; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Wang et al., 2007</xref>]) can clearly not be linked to NBD dimer formation, the present results argue that upon pore opening its remaining NBD-TMD coupling machinery undergoes movements similar to those that accompany NBD dimerization when neither 'limb' is truncated.</p><p>Because of the tightened NBD interface, the ATP binding sites of open CFTR channels are likely inaccessible to the bulk solution even in the absence of bound ATP, just as in its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chaves and Gadsby, 2015</xref>), suggesting that ATP binding/unbinding can take place only in the closed-channel state. Two immediate corollaries ensue. First, the ATP-free open-channel state is unlikely to be an integral component of the ATP-dependent gating cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Szollosi et al., 2010</xref>; but, cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jih et al., 2013</xref>). Second, despite suggested similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kirk et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Okeyo et al., 2013</xref>), the principles that drive gating of CFTR channels are fundamentally different from those of ligand-gated channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Ligand-gated channels obey cyclic equilibrium mechanisms in which ligand binding/unbinding can occur both in the closed- and the open-channel state, and the activating effect of the ligand is based on the thermodynamic principle of detailed balance which constrains the product of the equilibrium constants around a cycle to be unity: thus, opening ('isomerization') is driven by the concurrent conformational change of the ligand binding site which increases its affinity for the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grosman and Auerbach, 2001</xref>). But in CFTR the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, so that an open-state 'binding affinity' cannot be defined (the rates for both ATP binding and unbinding are zero). Thus, even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium, that gating follows a reversible linear sequence (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>), rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance.</p><p>Strong correlation between effects on unliganded and liganded channel activity, and energetic additivity of such effects, has been reported for a range of diverse 'allosteric modulators' acting on various regions of the channel.

Further, distinct mutations in intracellular loops increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wei et al., 2014</xref>) or decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) P<sub>o</sub><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf28"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow/></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> for both unliganded and liganded CFTR.

This is consistent with a similar finding for an NBD-TMD interface position during ATP-dependent opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, just as for ATP-bound channels, the pore is likely still closed in the high-energy evanescent transition state for spontaneous openings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <italic>center cartoon</italic>).</p><p>Finally, what can we infer about the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening? The presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations: rather ATP acts as a 'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state. Because ATP-induced openings are terminated by ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>), energetic interpretation of ATP-binding induced gating effects cannot be based on the comparison of WT gating in the presence and absence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, WT+ATP vs. WT). However, comparing gating parameters for spontaneous activity of WT CFTR and ATP-driven activity of hydrolysis-incompetent mutant CFTR channels offers some insight into the impact of ATP binding on gating energetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>, <italic>gray</italic> vs. <italic>orange</italic> free energy profiles). Mutations that disrupt ATP hydrolysis in site 2 all prolong τ<sub>b</sub> and reduce CFTR gating to an equilibrium, by forcing the channels to close back through the same high-energy transition state they had traversed upon opening (cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csanády et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>).

Thus, intriguingly, although the NBD interface is already tightened within site 2 in the ATP-bound transition state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vergani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Sorum et al., 2015</xref>), the 'molecular glue' effect of bound ATP is further strengthened when the channel reaches the stable open state. The implication is that some rearrangements must still occur within the dimer interface between the transition state and the open state. One possibility is that, in the transition state, site 1 has not yet reached its full open-channel-like conformation. Perhaps the site 2 'glue' bonds fully already in the transition state, whereas bonding of the site 1 'glue' is completed only in the open-channel state. Further work will be needed to address the precise timing of site 1 motions during channel opening, and their contributions to CFTR gating energetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>Mutations introduced (Stratagene, QuikChange) into pGEMHE-CFTR were confirmed by automated sequencing; cDNA was transcribed in vitro (Ambion, mMessage T7) and cRNA stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Isolation and injection of Xenopus oocytes</title><p>Oocytes were isolated from anaesthetized adult female <italic>Xenopus</italic> laevis frogs following Institutional Animal Care Committee guidelines, injected with 0.1–10 ng cRNA in a fixed 50 nl volume, and stored at 18°C as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Szollosi et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton J Swartz (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher Miller (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a clear, sharp, succinct manuscript aiming right at the heart of what might seem to be a minor issue in CFTR gating biophysics – the nature, in a gain-of-function mutant, of the very rare ATP-independent openings that the wildtype channel undergoes. But the issue is no longer a minor one, since the first successful CFTR drug – ivacaftor – works by enhancing these openings in certain CFTR mutant patients. The aim of this paper is in no way to find out how the drug actually works, but rather to understand the process that the drug works upon – the ATP-independent openings. Csanady's group applies their characteristically rigorous single-channel approaches to ask whether these spontaneous openings represent NBD conformational changes like the normal, well-studied changes occurring in wildtype ATP-driven gating, or if they behave differently. And the answer is clear, from the same sorts of double mutant cycle experiments used previously: the same kind of NBD closing – now without sandwiching ATP molecules – is coupled to channel opening. Moreover, the kinetics of the process reprise the NBD movements of wildtype, ATP-loaded, though understandably with less 'molecular glue' stabilization involved.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is well-written and the conclusions are firm and very pertinent to the current frenzy of CFTR drug discovery underway.</p><p>Issues to address:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

Could this possibly undermine the quantification of energies being used here?</italic></p><p>There are two features in the recordings that the Reviewers might have perceived as &quot;rundown&quot;.</p><p>First, the current decline upon ATP removal is typically biexponential, which is better appreciated by looking at the macroscopic current trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The rapid decline with a large fractional amplitude likely reflects immediate loss of ATP from low-affinity site 2, whereas the subsequent slower phase is due to slower loss of ATP from high-affinity site 1 (see Tsai et al., 2010; J Gen Physiol 135:399-414). The current typically settles to a quasi-steady level within ~1 min following ATP removal. To extract gating parameters of unliganded channels we therefore analyzed only the last ~4 min of the 5 min ATP-free segments, as indicated in Methods. Of course in single-channel recordings loss of ATP from site 1 is a discrete event and so the actual time required to reach this &quot;unliganded&quot; steady state is variable. Thus, in individual recordings the precise starting time point for the &quot;steady-state&quot; segment to be analyzed was chosen by eye. E.g., for the trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> only the last ~3 min were analyzed. We have added a corresponding statement to Materials and methods (subsection “Excised inside-out patch recording”, last paragraph).</p><p>Second, the currents in ATP appear slightly smaller in the rear bracketing segments, as apparent in the macroscopic recording in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. One reason for this is that following a prolonged exposure to an ATP-free solution not all channels recover instantaneously, giving rise to the slowly creeping phase of the current in the second bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This phenomenon is also well known, and much more pronounced for WT CFTR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but the underlying mechanism is unclear (see Tsai et al., 2010; J Gen Physiol 135:399-414). However, both in our background construct, and in the single- and double-mutants studied in this background, the open probability in the rear bracket, following full &quot;reactivation&quot;, was only slightly smaller than in the front brackets (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We do not think that small decline – probably due to dephosphorylation, and observed similarly for all four constructs in the mutant cycle – would have substantially distorted the extracted values of interaction energies.</p><p><italic>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> is somewhat confusing. At the bottom (just above -0.4 kT) there are to arrow pointing towards each other: why?</italic> </p><p>The three double-headed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> are used in the manner of dimension lines in technical drawings, to gauge distances between open-state and closed-state values for the three free energy profiles. The 0.4 kT distance for the gray profile is too small to fit both arrowheads into it. We have therefore used two arrowheads pointing in opposite directions, consistent with technical drawing guide lines. It is true that these two arrowheads should not have been connected to each other – we have removed the connecting line.</p><p><italic>The y axis contains a break, which makes it difficult to find all the numbers back that are calculated in the manuscript. For example, the 3.3 kT (Discussion, fourth paragraph).</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, a plot in which all the cited numbers are readily visible cannot be constructed. This is not due to the y-axis break (which is necessary in order to be able to draw at least all the changes in free energies to scale, given that the absolute heights of the barriers are disproportionately large (and also uncertain)), but to the fact that energy levels for three states (closed, transition, open) are compared to each other under three conditions (WT unliganded, BG unliganded, WT ATP-bound). For such comparisons to be made, one of the states must be arbitrarily chosen as a reference, and we have chosen state C as our reference state. This choice allows changes in △G<sup>o</sup><sub>(T-C)</sub> and △G<sup>o</sup><sub>(O-C)</sub> – caused by the BG mutations (downward black arrows) or by ATP binding (downward gray arrows) – to be directly visualized, whereas changes in △G<sup>o</sup><sub>(T-O)</sub> can be inferred as the difference between the former two numbers but cannot be simply illustrated. A similar limitation arises regardless of the choice of the reference state.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection “Mutant cycle analysis” it is stated that SEMs were calculated using the mean value for n. It is not clear why this was done. Also the justification is weird: there were &quot;similar numbers of observations&quot;. Looking through the manuscript, the number of observation is not explicitly presented for all experiments; in addition, it varies from 5-16.</italic></p><p>The numbers of observations were included in parentheses for all experiments, in the form &quot;0.11±0.04 (6)&quot;. We realize that these numbers might have been mistaken as citations to references, so we have now explicitly added &quot;<italic>n</italic>=&quot; throughout the text (e.g., &quot;0.11±0.04 (n=6)&quot; (subsection “Gain-of-function mutations allow quantitative characterization of spontaneous CFTR gating”).</p><p>The statement (subsection “Mutant cycle analysis”) on using the mean value of <italic>n</italic> for SEM calculations applies only for the △△G values calculated from the mutant cycles (but, cf. Statistics section for all other data). In fact, estimation of △△G standard errors is not trivial, so we have added a more detailed description of this mathematical procedure (in the aforementioned subsection). Of note, <italic>n</italic> values for the four corners of each mutant cycle were quite similar to each other: <italic>n</italic>=19-21 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, and <italic>n</italic>=15-19 for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2F and G</xref> (a few patches that were not sufficiently &quot;clean&quot; were analyzed for P<sub>o</sub>, but not for gating kinetics).</p><p><italic>4) In the subsection “The site-2 NBD interface is already tightened in the transition state for spontaneous pore opening”: 0.62 +/- 0.34 kT is not significantly different from zero. Why not?</italic></p><p>As stated in the Statistics section, differences were considered significant for p&lt;0.05. For the above parameter p=0.09 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, I, J</xref> would benefit from labels indicating what exactly was analyzed.</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>6) In the first sentence of the subsection “Gain-of-function mutations allow quantitative characterization of spontaneous CFTR gating”: Replace 'instantaneously' by 'rapidly' or some such adverb.</italic></p><p>Done.</p><p><italic>7) The manuscript is also generally well written, with the exception of the first sentence of the Abstract, which is full of commas.
