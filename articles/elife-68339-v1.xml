move horizontally between genomes, have profound effects on their host's fitness. The <italic>p</italic>hage-inducible chromosomal island-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>e</italic>lement (PLE) is a mobile element that integrates into the chromosome of <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and parasitizes the bacteriophage ICP1 to move between cells. This parasitism by PLE is such that it abolishes the production of ICP1 progeny and provides a defensive boon to the host cell population. In response to the severe parasitism imposed by PLE, ICP1 has acquired an adaptive CRISPR-Cas system that targets the PLE genome during infection. However, ICP1 isolates that naturally lack CRISPR-Cas are still able to overcome certain PLE variants, and the mechanism of this immunity against PLE has thus far remained unknown. Here, we show that ICP1 isolates that lack CRISPR-Cas encode an endonuclease in the same locus, and that the endonuclease provides ICP1 with immunity to a subset of PLEs. Further analysis shows that this endonuclease is of chimeric origin, incorporating a DNA-binding domain that is highly similar to some PLE replication origin-binding proteins. This similarity allows the endonuclease to bind and cleave PLE origins of replication. The endonuclease appears to exert considerable selective pressure on PLEs and may drive PLE replication module swapping and origin restructuring as mechanisms of escape. This work demonstrates that new genome defense systems can arise through domain shuffling and provides a greater understanding of the evolutionary forces driving genome modularity and temporal succession in mobile elements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd><kwd>mobile element</kwd><kwd>satellite</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI127652</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI153303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1019213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seed</surname><given-names>Kimberley D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Horizontal transfer of a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain allows a virus to destroy its subviral parasite and overcome parasite-mediated restriction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), genetic units capable of spreading within and between genomes, are key mediators of evolution. MGEs differ vastly in size and complexity. At one end of the spectrum are homing endonucleases (HEGs). These single-gene MGEs occur in diploid loci and cleave cognate alleles so that their coding sequences can serve as templates for recombinational repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoddard, 2011</xref>). At another extreme, integrative viruses are complex MGEs that can encode their own replication genes as well as structural components for their own dispersal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krupovic et al., 2019</xref>), and even cargo genes dedicated to boosting the fitness of their cellular hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harrison and Brockhurst, 2017</xref>). While the evolutionary importance of MGEs across domains of life is clear, apart from a handful of exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greenwood et al., 2018</xref>), it is not possible to study the spread of MGEs in real time in populations of multicellular organisms. In contrast, short generation times and low barriers to horizontal gene transfer make bacteria ideal organisms for studying how MGEs shape the evolution of their hosts.</p><p>Recent work has led to a deeper appreciation of the extensive entanglement between MGEs and genome defense functions. MGEs frequently encode defense modules to prevent infection by viruses or other nonvirus MGEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koonin et al., 2020</xref>). Such modules include toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, restriction modification (RM) systems, CRISPR-Cas, and numerous other systems recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Doron et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koonin and Makarova, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marraffini, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Millman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mruk and Kobayashi, 2014</xref>). Beyond their antiviral and anti-MGE functions, defense systems also serve the selfish needs of the MGEs that encode them, and the constituents of defense modules can be recruited to benefit viruses and nonvirus MGEs by serving counter-defense functions. Viruses may encode antitoxin or DNA modification genes as a means of escaping TA and RM systems endogenous to their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loenen and Raleigh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Otsuka and Yonesaki, 2012</xref>). While many defense modules eliminate invading viruses and MGEs through nucleolytic attack, many phages use nucleases to degrade the host genome, preventing further expression of host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Panayotatos and Fontaine, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parson and Snustad, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Souther et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Warner et al., 1975</xref>).</p><p>The flow of MGEs and their defense systems between viruses and hosts, as well as the retooling of genes for defense, counter-defense, and MGE maintenance or dispersal functions, has been described using the model ‘guns for hire’ to reflect the mercenary nature of these defense systems and the selfish MGEs that carry them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koonin et al., 2020</xref>). One of the most compelling examples of host-pathogen conflicts that conforms to the ‘guns for hire’ framework occurs in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> between the bacteriophage ICP1 and its own parasite, the <italic>p</italic>hage-inducible chromosomal island-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>e</italic>lement (PLE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seed et al., 2013</xref>). Upon infection by ICP1, PLE excises from the host chromosome, replicates to high copy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>), and is assembled into transducing particles to spread the PLE genome to new cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Netter et al., 2021</xref>). PLE excision and DNA replication both require ICP1-encoded gene products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>). Similarly, multiple lines of evidence including shared host cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>), PLE genome analysis, and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Netter et al., 2021</xref>) strongly suggest that PLE is packaged into remodeled ICP1 virions for mobilization. While infected PLE(+) cells still die, no ICP1 virions are produced when PLE activity is unimpeded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, PLE prevents further spread of ICP1 and protects the host cell population. In this way, PLE acts as both a selfish parasite of ICP1 and an effective abortive infection defense system for <italic>V. cholerae</italic>.</p><p>True to the ‘guns for hire’ model, ICP1 has co-opted a genome defense system to protect itself from PLE. Many ICP1 isolates encode a CRISPR-Cas system that can destroy PLE within the infected cell and restore ICP1 reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). CRISPR-Cas systems are typically adaptive immune systems that provide immunological memory against specific nucleic acid sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrangou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Marraffini, 2015</xref>). The memory function of CRISPR-Cas is achieved through the integration of ‘spacers,’ short DNA sequences derived from viruses or MGEs, that are integrated into an array of spacer repeats. The spacer can then be transcribed to serve as an RNA guide that directs nucleolytic machinery against complementary sequence. In this way, acquisition of a small portion of foreign DNA provides the specificity required for defense.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Some ICP1 isolates encode a free-standing nuclease in place of CRISPR-Cas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A model of ICP1 interference of <italic>p</italic>hage-inducible chromosomal island-<italic>l</italic>ike <italic>e</italic>lements (PLEs) via CRISPR. When ICP1 infects a PLE(+) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cell, ICP1 is able to overcome PLE restriction and reproduce if it possesses a CRISPR-Cas system with complementary spacers to the PLE.

Like cellular CRISPR-Cas systems, the ICP1 system can acquire new immunological memory, reflecting that PLE is not a single static genome but that a number of PLE variants exist. To date, five PLE variants, numbered 1–5, have been described, occurring in about ~15% of sequenced epidemic <italic>V. cholerae</italic> genomes. There is a pattern of temporal succession, where one PLE will dominate in sequenced genomes for a time before being supplanted by another PLE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>), but the reemergence of old PLE sequence in new PLE variants suggests that unsampled reservoirs exist in nature. Like PLEs, there is also diversity among ICP1 genomes. Not all ICP1 isolates encode CRISPR-Cas, but this does not mean that they are defenseless against PLEs. Previous work found that an ICP1 variant that naturally lacked CRISPR-Cas was able to reproduce on the two oldest PLE variants, PLE5 and PLE4, as well as the most recent variant PLE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Much like PLE variants, there appears to be some temporal succession in the presence or absence of ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas system. A minority of ICP1 isolates collected between 2001 and 2011 possessed CRISPR-Cas systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2018</xref>), while CRISPR-Cas encoding ICP1 predominated between 2011 and 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>). As PLE and ICP1 have coevolved specific mechanisms of parasitism and counter-defenses, it is worth exploring if the temporal succession of PLE and ICP1 variants could be in response to selective pressures that the two entities exert on each other.</p><p>Intrigued by CRISPR-independent interference of PLE and hoping to gain insight into patterns of ICP1 and PLE variant succession, we set out to identify the mechanism of PLE interference in ICP1 isolates that lack CRISPR-Cas. Surprisingly, we found that all natural ICP1 isolates that do not encode CRISPR-Cas instead encode an endonuclease in the same genomic locus that is necessary for propagation on <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains containing PLEs 1, 4, or 5. Lending further support to the ‘guns for hire’ model, we find that this anti-PLE nuclease is of chimeric origin, being partially derived from a PLE-encoded DNA-binding domain while its nucleolytic domain appears to be derived from an ICP1-encoded family of putative HEGs. Harnessing the rich evolutionary interplay of PLE and ICP1, this work shows that domain shuffling between hostile genomes can allow for new forms of antagonism, and that phage-encoded HEGs can be repurposed for antiparasite functions. Additionally, this work reveals key mediators of ICP1-PLE host range that inform observed patterns of PLE temporal succession and modularity, broadening our understanding of subcellular host-parasite coevolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A subset of ICP1 isolates deploy a stand-alone nuclease instead of CRISPR-Cas to counter PLE</title><p>We set out to identify which gene(s) determined host range in ICP1 isolates that lack CRISPR-Cas. It has long been recognized that phages are mosaic entities composed of functional gene neighborhoods, and syntenic neighborhoods of divergent sequence may fulfill analogous functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brüssow and Hendrix, 2002</xref>). Previous work suggests that ICP1 conforms to these general patterns of phage genome structure. Transcriptomics and bioinformatic predictions show that ICP1 genes with related biological functions are organized together in the genome and expressed at the same time, demonstrating the presence of gene neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barth et al., 2020a</xref>). Additionally, while the ICP1 genome is highly conserved between isolates and does not display large-scale rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angermeyer et al., 2018</xref>), there is indication that nonhomologous sequence can serve analogous functions. ICP1 isolates encode one of two alternative SF1B-type helicases thought to be of shared function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>), suggesting that ICP1 isolates can use alternative genes to fulfill the same adaptational requirement. We reasoned that such genome organization and mosaicism warranted a ‘guilt by location’ approach to investigating gene function, and that the locus syntenic to CRISPR-Cas in those ICP1 isolates that lack CRISPR might hold clues as to how they overcome PLEs.</p><p>In isolates without CRISPR-Cas, the locus is replaced with a single open reading frame, designated <italic>gp88</italic> for its location in ICP1<sup>2001</sup>, the original sequenced ICP1 isolate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The two coding sequences immediately upstream of the CRISPR-Cas system and oriented divergently from the system are also replaced in the phage with <italic>gp88</italic>. These genes generally covary with the presence of the CRISPR-Cas system or <italic>gp88</italic>. Most ICP1 CRISPR-Cas systems are adjacent to a phage regulatory protein Rha domain (pfam09669) encoding gene. A gene encoding a Bro-N domain (pfam02498) and a KilAC domain (pfam03374) occurs adjacent to <italic>gp88</italic>. Their positions and putative annotations suggest that these divergently transcribed genes may have a regulatory function. In one sequenced ICP1 isolate with a functional CRISPR-Cas system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>), the <italic>bro_N</italic> domain coding gene and its partner are found instead of the <italic>rha-</italic>like gene containing pair, suggesting that these pairs are redundant in function or not involved in CRISPR-Cas activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Further analysis of <italic>gp88</italic> revealed that it encodes a T5orf172 domain (pfam10544) containing protein. This domain is a member of the GIY-YIG endonuclease domain superfamily, suggesting that Gp88 may be a nuclease. We aligned the Gp88 T5orf172 domain with GIY-YIG domains from endonucleases that had been biochemically characterized and structurally resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swapna et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Truglio et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Roey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Unlike most identified GIY-YIG nucleases, Gp88 lacks a conserved histidine or tyrosine in the first alpha helix of the GIY-YIG domain. However, Gp88 retains conservation of the catalytic arginine and glutamate. The relatively high motif conservation found in Gp88 suggests that the protein possesses endonucleolytic activity. Given that nucleases are a particularly prominent class of proteins engaged in conflicts between hosts, mobile elements and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koonin et al., 2020</xref>), and <italic>gp88</italic>’s syntenic location to ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas system, we hypothesized that Gp88 interferes with PLE activity to protect ICP1 isolates that naturally lack CRISPR-Cas.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we generated ICP1<sup>2001</sup> mutants with either an in-frame deletion of <italic>gp88</italic> or harboring a single amino acid substitution (E180A) predicted to abolish Gp88’s nucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also used ICP1<sup>2006</sup> and a ∆CRISPR derivative to serve as controls for host susceptibility. As expected, the PLE (-) <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strain was susceptible to all ICP1 variants, and the ICP1<sup>2006</sup> ∆CRISPR variant was restricted by all PLEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). CRISPR(+) ICP1<sup>2006</sup> was able to propagate on all strains except the one containing PLE3 as ICP1<sup>2006</sup> does not have a matching spacer against PLE3. ICP1<sup>2001</sup> was able to propagate on PLEs 1, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), but it was restricted on PLEs 2 and 3.

Additionally, midiPLE replication did not occur without RepA, and the PLE integrase was shown to be dispensable for PLE replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>). These data suggest that the minimal components of the PLE replicon are the replication origin and RepA, the two components that covaried across PLEs.

Previously, it was shown that loss of replication partially attenuated PLE1-mediated restriction of ICP1 but nonreplicating PLE1 mutants were still broadly restrictive to ICP1 ∆CRISPR-Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>). We hypothesized that PLE could escape Gp88 targeting through deletion of the PLE origin and thus block propagation of Gp88 encoding phage. We tested this by deleting the entire conserved stretch of sequence that contained the origin of replication in PLEs 1, 4, and 5. In support of our hypothesis, these mutants regained restrictive activity against Gp88 encoding phage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Conversely, cloning a Gp88 recognized replication origin into PLEs that are insensitive to Gp88 should sensitize them to Gp88 activity. To test this, we infected our ‘ori-swapped’ PLE2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) with Gp88 encoding phage. We included a PLE2 <italic>∆ori</italic> strain to control for the possibility that loss of replication would abolish PLE2-mediated restriction of ICP1. The PLE2 ∆<italic>ori</italic> strain retained the ability to restrict all isolates of ICP1<sup>2001</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, the PLE2 strain bearing the PLE1 origin sequence was no longer restrictive to ICP1<sup>2001</sup>, but still restricted variants that lacked Gp88 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), confirming that the presence of the replication origin sequence mediated sensitivity to Gp88.</p><p>We wanted to confirm that Gp88-mediated interference manifested through nucleolytic cleavage of PLE. To determine if Gp88 was truly acting as a nuclease, we purified Gp88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) and performed in vitro nuclease activity assays. Consistent with the host range of ICP1 encoding Gp88, we found that the purified Gp88 protein cut PCR products amplified from the region containing the origin of replication from PLEs 1, 4, and 5, but did not cut those of PLEs 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming that Gp88 disrupts PLE through nuclease activity. Supporting this interpretation, the E180A Gp88* mutant that was inactive against PLEs 1, 4, and 5 in vivo, and predicted to be catalytically inert, did not cleave PCR products amplified from PLEs 1, 4, and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), further linking the in vivo activity of Gp88 to its capacity to cleave in vitro. Curiously, Gp88 produced only one cleavage product from the PLE4 probe. We reasoned that since the PLE noncoding regions are diverse and the PLE4 origin of replication was located near to the center of the PLE4 probe, Gp88 cleavage of the PLE4 probe might produce two bands of indistinguishable size. To check this, we produced a new PLE4 probe with the origin of replication offset from the middle and found that Gp88 produced two visible bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). In light of these results, we renamed Gp88 the origin-directed nuclease or Odn.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Odn requires iterons to cleave the PLE origin of replication</title><p>Our results so far suggested a model where Odn mimics the specificity of the PLE1, 4, and 5 RepA proteins to bind and cut at their cognate origins of replication.

If Odn specificity truly mimicked that of RepA, then it should require the iteron sequence for cutting. We tested this in vitro by titrating increasing concentrations of Odn in a nuclease assay with the WT PLE1 origin of replication, as well as the same substrate except with the iterons deleted. In support of our model, we found that Odn does require the iteron sequence for cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with iterons being necessary for Odn-mediated in vitro cleavage of the PLE origin, ICP1<sup>2001</sup> infection was restricted by a PLE1 strain harboring the same iteron deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Since swapping the PLE origin and cognate RepA_N domain could abolish Odn targeting of PLE, it appears likely that Odn selected for the multiple domain shuffling events in PLE RepA inferred by comparison of PLE genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because PLE replication is necessary for both PLE mobility and complete restriction of ICP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McKitterick et al., 2019a</xref>), simple deletions of the replication origin would not likely be favored as long-term solutions to evading recognition and subsequent cleavage by Odn.</p><p>While the swapping and diversification of certain sequences can be traced through the five PLEs, each PLE variant is remarkably conserved.

However, we found a single instance of diversity in PLE1 within a lineage of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolated from Pakistan.

In these five strains, we discovered variation in a 67 bp stretch covering the iterons that results in several nucleotide changes. Within the first iteron, there is an A to T transversion, and starting at that transversion, the next 42 bp are duplicated and replace the sequence that is normally downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This change maintains the presence of the three iterons, and even reverts a few variant bases to ones in the PLE4 and 5 iterons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Notably, these changes are the only sequence differences between these PLE variants and all other PLE1 isolates, aside from a 2 bp extension of an 11 bp polyA tract that also occurs in these atypical PLE1 variants.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Mutations in PLE1 present in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> isolates from Pakistan render the PLE1 ori resistant to Odn-mediated cleavage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> iteron region.

We generated a DNA probe covering this variant region (denoted PLE1<sup>Mut</sup>) and tested its sensitivity to Odn in comparison to the WT PLE1 ori sequence. The PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> sequence was notably less susceptible to cleavage by Odn than the WT allele, but some cutting of the PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> probe at the highest concentration of Odn was apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This raised the question of whether this PLE1 variant could resist attack by Odn in vivo. To investigate this possibility, we cloned the PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> origin of replication into our PLE1 strain and challenged this mutant with WT, ∆<italic>odn</italic> and <italic>odn</italic>* ICP1<sup>2001</sup>. The PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> origin of replication was able to drive replication to levels comparable to that of the WT origin, and robust replication was maintained even in the presence of Odn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). In agreement with our replication data, we also found that our PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> strain restricted production of WT ICP1<sup>2001</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These data demonstrate that PLE can escape Odn activity through subtle restructuring of the iterons, in addition to more extensive replication module exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and suggest that ICP1 counter-defenses like Odn may select for diversification of the PLE replication machinery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we have identified a new anti-PLE effector present in some ICP1 isolates and identified its mode of anti-PLE activity. The anti-PLE effector Odn possess two domains, an endonuclease domain and a DNA-binding domain, which has sequence similarity to the DNA-binding domain of the RepA initiation factor from PLEs 1, 4, and 5. Mimicking RepA’s specificity, Odn cuts the origin of replication in those PLEs. PLEs are able to escape Odn antagonism through mutation of their origin of replication, and there is compelling evidence suggesting that PLEs have exchanged replicon modules for an alternative replication origin and initiation factor origin-binding domain on at least two separate occasions. While sampling of ICP1 isolates and <italic>V. cholerae</italic> strains is far from complete, we do see the oldest ICP1 strains encode Odn and the oldest PLE variants encode the sensitive origin of replication. It is possible that Odn selected for alternative replicon modules, leading to the decline of PLE4 and succession of PLE2 that occurred in the early 2000s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). This may in turn have caused selection for the presence of CRISPR-Cas, a decrease in prominence of Odn, and the reemergence of the sensitive replicon module in PLE1 matching the trends of PLE and ICP1 occurrence observed thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). This model of PLE and ICP1 succession is consistent with an antagonistic frequency-dependent selection (aFDS) mechanism of host-pathogen coevolution where some level of genetic diversity is maintained among antagonistic genes and rare alleles are selected for, leading to oscillation of the dominant genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Papkou et al., 2019</xref>). In some experimental evolution studies using bacteriophages, aFDS dynamics are found to eventually develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gómez and Buckling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez Pascua et al., 2014</xref>). This seems a likely possibility for PLEs and ICP1 whose specific adaptations and counter adaptations suggest that the two genomes have been coevolving for a long period of time.</p><p>It is interesting to consider why a specialized anti-PLE mechanism might persist within some ICP1 isolates when adaptive CRISPR-Cas immunity exists as an alternative. An obvious benefit of Odn is its small size; <italic>odn</italic> is less than 700 bp and more than 10 times smaller than ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas system. Given that ICP1’s genome size is limited by what it can package into its capsid, the extra sequence taken up by CRISPR-Cas could be better spent on other auxiliary genes if it is not needed to overcome PLE. Additionally, Odn may provide more complete restriction of certain PLEs. While a single CRISPR spacer is sufficient to enable ICP1 plaque formation on PLE(+) cells, it was previously found that multiple spacers were needed to completely abolish PLE replication, and PLE transduction could still be detected from single-spacer ICP1 infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, different CRISPR spacers had different outcomes in terms of PLE transduction and ICP1 reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKitterick et al., 2019b</xref>), suggesting that where PLE is targeted may be important. Position-dependent outcomes for cleavage may explain why Odn is sufficient to provide robust interference against the PLEs it targets. By destroying the origin of replication, Odn-mediated PLE degradation might not have to compete with PLE replication and could head off pathways for PLE escape through recombinational repair. It should also be considered that certain environmental and physiological conditions as well as some genetic factors might render ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas system less effective. While no PLEs appear to encode anti-CRISPRs, numerous anti-CRISPRs have been found in Gammaproteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pawluk et al., 2016</xref>), and co-occurrence of these genes with PLE could neutralize ICP1’s CRISPR-Cas as an anti-PLE strategy. Overall, it appears that Odn lacks the flexibility provided by CRISPR adaptation but provides more reliable interference against a subset of PLE variants.</p><p>In addition to ICP1 and Odn, at least one other anti-PLE mechanism has evolved as some CRISPR(+) ICP1 isolates are able to plaque on PLE2 when CRISPR is deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Whatever this anti-PLE mechanism may be, it may have helped select against PLE2, leading to the emergence of PLE1 as another possible example of an aFDS dynamic in the ICP1-PLE arms race. It seems unlikely that this anti-PLE2 mechanism is specific to the alternative replicon module as PLE3, which has a similar replicon to PLE2, maintains restriction of those particular ICP1 isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). In any case, the co-occurrence of a separate anti-PLE mechanism in the same phage as a CRISPR-Cas system further suggests that CRISPR-Cas may have weak spots in terms of PLE inhibition.</p><p>It is somewhat surprising that the PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> variant is able to escape Odn activity, given that the new iteron sequences are largely similar to those that exist in PLEs 1, 4, and 5. The most notable differences are an extra T/A base between the inverted sub-repeats in both the second and third iterons, and a reduction of space between the second and third iterons (now 5 bp instead of 14 or 16 bp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These changes appear more consistent with some sort of steric effect on catalysis from improper spacing rather than a loss of sequence recognition; however, the molecular details of Odn binding and catalysis remain to be elucidated. The T4-encoded GIY-YIG HEG I-TevI is known to have two separate target specificities, one for DNA binding and one for cleavage, and cleavage is only efficient if the two recognition sites are properly spaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). It is possible that Odn nucleolytic activity also has some sequence specificity, and closer spacing of the iterons is sufficient to block binding and cleavage by Odn. Based on the data presented here, it is not possible to infer if Odn nucleolytic activity has sequence specificity, and what that specificity might be. For I-TevI, the sequence requirements for cleavage are somewhat loose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy et al., 2016</xref>), making cleavage sites harder to predict from sequence alone.</p><p>Alternatively, Odn cleavage might require recruitment of multiple Odn proteins, spaced a certain distance apart. RepA is thought to bind as dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>), but at least some GIY-YIG endonucleases, including I-TevI, function as monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Roey et al., 2002</xref>). It is conceivable that Odn could require cooperative binding for catalysis or alternatively bind and cut at multiple sub-repeats independently. While our results show robust double-stranded cleavage by Odn, this could be achieved through multiple single-strand nicks from appropriately spaced iterons. Odn and RepA provide an interesting example of proteins with overlapping sequence specificity. Working out the intricacies of their binding specificity and activity may prove fruitful for understanding how DNA-binding proteins evolve new targets and functions.</p><p>One of the most compelling aspects of Odn is its evolutionary relationship to a family of putative HEGs. HEGs are usually considered selfish genetic elements and are common in phage genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edgell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoddard, 2011</xref>). This adds a layer of symmetry to the <italic>V. cholerae</italic>-ICP1-PLE arms race. To defend itself against ICP1, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> makes use of the PLE, a selfish MGE. To protect against PLE, ICP1 has repurposed a nuclease domain from its own HEG parasites. While this recruitment of MGEs for antagonistic functions fits nicely within the ‘guns for hire’ model of MGE evolution, we see an interesting twist where it seems the horizontal gene transfer of DNA-binding domains is a central mediator of the PLE-ICP1 conflict. Recently, it was found that PLEs reduce ICP1 capsid gene expression through use of a regulator that resembles the DNA-binding domains of ICP1-encoded HEGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Netter et al., 2021</xref>), the very same family of genes from which Odn’s nuclease domain is derived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While viral ‘capture’ of host genes by genetic parasites for the purpose of manipulating gene expression is well described in both phage and eukaryotic viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alcami, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng and Chisholm, 2012</xref>), to our knowledge Odn is the first example of an anti-MGE gene where a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein has been ‘captured’ and fused to an endonuclease domain as a means of destroying the very genome that the sequence originated from. This highlights how horizontal gene transfer can serve as a shortcut to acquiring new sequence-specific antagonists during antagonistic coevolution and provides a slower evolving parallel to adaptive immunity through spacer acquisition.</p><p>It is striking that two examples of horizontal transfer between ICP1 and PLE relate to the same family of HEGs. Domain shuffling has been described for HEGs previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Landthaler and Shub, 2003</xref>) and is likely especially adaptive for HEGs, which are thought to amplify within host genomes by acquiring new sequence specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gogarten and Hilario, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roy et al., 2016</xref>). The domain architecture of some phage-encoded HEGs has been likened to ‘beads on a string’: with independent functional domains connected by linker sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Roey and Derbyshire, 2005</xref>). It is conceivable that proteins with this architecture might be more amenable to domain shuffling, and given the selfish nature of HEGs, they may have adaptations to tolerate or promote this shuffling as a means of diversification and dispersal. While HEG domestication has been much discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coughlan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stoddard, 2011</xref>) and the connection between genome antagonism and nucleases is well established in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Koonin et al., 2020</xref>), a specific link between HEGs and MGE antagonism had not been established prior to characterization of Odn. It is not clear if Odn has any intrinsic homing activity, but Odn may be able to cleave and replace CRISPR-Cas loci that have acquired spacers matching the Odn recognition sequence. This could layer a Odn vs. CRISPR-Cas genetic conflict on top of the ICP1-PLE arms race. Because of their selfish nature, ability to mobilize, nucleolytic activity, and enrichment within viral and mobile genomes, HEGs are poised to be at the forefront of antagonistic coevolution between viruses and other MGEs, and we anticipate that other putative HEGs have unrecognized antiparasite activities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>RepA<sup>PLE1</sup>(PLE1 ORF11)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref></td><td>WP_002040284.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>RepA<sup>PLE2</sup>(PLE2 ORF14)</td><td>This paper</td><td>AGG36643.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Bacteriophage ICP1)</td><td>Odn (ICP1_2001_Dha_0 <italic>gp88</italic>)</td><td>This paper</td><td>YP_004251029</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (Bacteriophage ICP1)</td><td>Odn* (ICP1_2001_Dha_0 <italic>gp88<sup>E</sup></italic><sup>180A</sup>)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>The E180A mutation is predicted to abolish catalytic activity</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>P<italic><sub>tac</sub>-repA</italic><sup>PLE1</sup>(plasmid)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref></td><td>pZKB129</td><td>Inducible RepA from PLE1</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>P<italic><sub>tac</sub>-repA</italic><sup>PLE2</sup>(plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td>pKS2159</td><td>Inducible RepA from PLE2</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pE-SUMO-Odn (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td>pKS2187</td><td>Vector to express 6xHisSumo-fusion protein, fused to N-terminus of Odn (Gp88)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pE-SUMO-Odn* (plasmid)</td><td>This paper</td><td>pKS2189</td><td>Vector to express 6xHisSumo-fusion protein, fused to N-terminus of Odn* (Gp88<sup>E180A</sup>)</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Levine et al., 1982</xref></td><td>KDS6</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE1 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE1 E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td>KDS36</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE2 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE2 E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td>KDS37</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE3 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE3 E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td>KDS38</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE4 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE4 E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td>KDS39</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE5 <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE5 E7946)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref></td><td>KDS40</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE1 ∆ori <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE1 E7946)</td><td>This paper</td><td>KDS297</td><td>Used for all spot assays</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE2 ∆ori <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE2 E7946)</td><td>This paper</td><td>KDS298</td><td><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE2 ∆repA <italic>V. cholerae</italic> <break/>(PLE2 E7946)</td><td>This paper</td><td>KDS299</td><td><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td>PLE1 ∆<italic>repA</italic> ∆ori::ori<sup>PLE2</sup>;

Bacteria were routinely grown on LB agar plates and in LB broth with aeration at 37°C. Antibiotics were supplemented as appropriate at the following concentrations: 75 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, 1.25 or 2.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol (<italic>V. cholerae</italic> for broth or plate conditions, respectively), 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>), and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. A detailed list of all strains used throughout this study can be found in the Key resources table.</p><p>Phage titers were determined using a soft agar overlay method wherein ICP1 was allowed to adsorb to <italic>V. cholerae</italic> for 10 minutes at room temperature before the mixture was added to molten LB soft agar (0.5%) and poured onto 100 mm × 15 mm LB agar plates. Plaques were counted after overnight incubation at 37°C. Prior to phage infection for purposes of quantification or qPCR or spot assay analysis, <italic>V. cholerae</italic> was grown on plates overnight and then inoculated into 2 ml LB liquid cultures. Liquid cultures were grown to an OD &gt; 1, then back diluted in fresh media to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.05, and then grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3, at which point they were infected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Generation of mutant strains and constructs</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> mutants were generated through natural transformation as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalia et al., 2014</xref>). For gene knockouts, splicing by overlap extension (SOE) PCR was used to generate deletion constructs with a spectinomycin resistance cassette flanked by frt recombination sites. Following selection of spectinomycin-resistant mutants, a plasmid bearing an isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible Flp recombinase was mated into transformants and Flp expression was induced to generate in-frame deletions. The plasmid was cured by growing mutants under inducing conditions with 300 μg/ml streptomycin. For unmarked replication origin-swapped constructs, mutants were generated through natural transformation by cotransformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalia et al., 2014</xref>). For plasmid expression constructs, a derivative of the pMMB67EH vector with a theophylline-inducible riboswitch was used as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McKitterick and Seed, 2018</xref>). All constructs were confirmed with DNA sequencing over the region of interest, and primer sequences and construct designs are available on DRYAD at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/share/HSB-bM3fCu3gSdF_yMQpCqyYuT4wW6_2IsZAkY0P5Ho">https://datadryad.org/stash/share/HSB-bM3fCu3gSdF_yMQpCqyYuT4wW6_2IsZAkY0P5Ho</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phage infection spot assays</title><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> was added to molten 0.5% LB top agar and poured over LB plates. Following solidification of the top agar, 3 μl of serially 10-fold diluted phage were spotted onto the plate. Once phage spots dried, plates were incubated for at 37°C for 2 hr and then overnight at room temperature before visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Real-time quantitative PCR</title><p>qPCR experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barth et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O'Hara et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, liquid cultures were infected with ICP1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2.5 at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3. Samples were taken at 0 and 20 minutes post infection and boiled before serving as templates for IQ SYBR (Bio-Rad) qPCR reactions. For assays involving induction of <italic>repA</italic>, 2 ml cultures were grown with 1.25 μg/ml chloramphenicol for plasmid maintenance and induced for 20 minutes prior to infection using a final concentration of 1.5 mM theophylline and 1 mM IPTG starting at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.17. All conditions were tested in biological triplicate, and each reported data point is the mean of two technical replicates. A single primer set (Key resources table) that amplifies a conserved region in all PLEs was used to detect PLE replication by qPCR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein purification</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> BL21 cells containing a His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO fusion to WT or E185A Gp88 were grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.5 at 37°C and induced with IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. The culture was grown for 2 hr and harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g for 20 minutes. The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM BME, 0.5% Triton-X 50 mM imidazole, 1 Pierce Protease Inhibitor Mini Tablet [Thermo Scientific]) and sonicated. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (29,097×g for 40 minutes). The lysate was applied to a HisTrap HP column (Cytiva). The column was washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM BME, 50 mM imidazole), and a high salt wash (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 2 M NaCl, 1 mM BME, 50 mM imidazole) was used to remove residual DNA. The protein was eluted using an elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM BME, 300 mM imidazole), and then the eluate was applied to a HiTrap Heparin HP column (Cytivia) for further purification. Following elution from the HiTrap Heparin column, the protein was dialyzed using a 10k Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis cassette (Thermo Fisher) in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Concomitant with dialysis, the His<sub>6</sub>-SUMO tag was cleaved using SUMO protease. The SUMO tag was removed using Dynabeads (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>All genomes were visualized and compared in CLC Main Workbench 7.

PLEs are short stretches of DNA found in ~15% of sequenced epidemic strains of V. cholerae which hijack the structural components of bacteriophage ICP1 to facilitate their own spread-through this process, PLEs promote survival of the bacteria by preventing the spread of an ICP1 infection. Therefore, the interplay between ICP1 and its PLEs have significant impacts on Vibrio pathogenesis, highlighting the importance of this work. Previous research from this group has shown that some ICP1 variants harbor a CRISPR-Cas immune system, which these bacteriophages use to target and degrade PLEs. However, not all ICP1 variants possess CRISPR-Cas systems, and yet retain resistance to some PLE variants, suggesting the presence of other anti-PLE immune systems encoded in the bacteriophage genome. In this study, the investigators seek to understand how an ICP1 variant devoid of a CRISPR-Cas system can still defend against a subset of PLEs.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>A rigorous set of genetics experiments were applied to reveal conserved functional aspects of PLE replication (Figure 3 and its supplements) as well as the genetic element in ICP1 required for anti-PLE activity, called gp88 (Figures 1, 2, and associated supplements). Based on sequence alignments and preliminary biochemical characterization, the gp88 gene product was shown to facilitate nuclease activity against PLE variants that are sensitive to ICP1 (Figure 4d). Genetics was also successfully applied to narrow down the region within the PLE which is targeted by the gp88 (Odn) nuclease (Figures 4a-c and 5). Finally, a natural variant of PLE1 that seems resistant to Odn activity was discovered within a V. cholerae isolate from Pakistan (Figure 6), providing a beautiful example of how the ongoing conflict between host and parasite drives genetic diversification of both parties. Overall, the major conclusions in the paper are well-supported by the data, the manuscript is clearly written, and the study gives important insights into this system.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The biochemical characterization of Odn is preliminary and needs more rigorous experimentation.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. An image of the purified proteins, both WT and mutant variants, (typically in the form of SDS-PAGE gels), should be displayed to demonstrate their purity and help support the conclusion that the Odn nuclease alone is responsible for cleavage of the PLE. The methods describe three separate chromatography steps, so it is assumed that the proteins are relatively pure, but a gel should be shown.</p><p>2. The mutant version of Odn should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as the WT to solidify the conclusion that Odn is alone responsible for PLE cleavage, at least in the beginning. For example similar assays could be performed with the mutant as with WT in Figures 4c and Figure 5a.</p><p>3. There seems to be some inconsistencies/variabilities in the biochemical assays. For example, Figure 4d shows PLEs 1, 4, and 5 are cleaved to completion by WT Odn, while in Figure 6c and its supplements, the WT shows very little cleavage activity against PLE1. Some quantification will help the reader to understand the extent of the variation in the nuclease activity. Along the same lines, different lengths of substrates were used in these assays, which will shift the molar ratio of enzyme:substrate and impact the nuclease activity. Some sort of normalization across the assays will allow the reader to compare the levels of nuclease activity from gel to gel and assess how each new variable affects the activity.</p><p>4. To come full-circle, sequencing of the cut products would go a long way to support the genetics evidence for Odn targeting within the PLE origin and map the precise location of the cut(s).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Barth et al. report the discovery of a novel endonuclease effector employed by certain lytic vibriophages (ICP1) to overcome viral satellites called PLEs present in ~15% of sequenced epidemic <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>. Past work from the Seed lab (Seed et al., 2013) had demonstrated that some ICP1 isolates (especially those from 2011-2017) encoded their own type I-F CRISPR-Cas system to target PLEs. However, they also previously observed (O'Hara et al., 2017) that older ICP1 isolates that lacked CRISPR-Cas (2001-2011) could still plaque on some of the strains containing PLEs. This work sought to elucidate the mechanisms by which a CRISPR-less ICP1 isolate from 2001 could successfully overcome certain PLE variants, but not others.</p><p>Through a set of simple yet elegant experiments that directly tested their hypotheses, the authors convincingly show that ICP12001 encodes an endonuclease (initially gp88, which they later term Odn, for origin-directed nuclease) that allows it to successfully infect V. cholerae containing certain PLEs. Interestingly, Odn contains two domains-the C-terminus resembling a homing endonuclease (HEG), and the N-terminus resembling the DNA-binding domain of the replication initiator RepA of PLEs 1, 4, and 5. The authors speculate that Odn might have arisen from domain shuffling between ICP1-encoded HEGs and PLE-encoded RepA, although how exactly this occurred is unknown.</p><p>The major strengths of this work are the novelty of the findings and its logical clarity. With a series of incisive experiments, the authors deduced how Odn works. By constructing ICP1 mutants that lacked Odn activity, the authors showed that Odn is necessary for plaque formation on V. cholerae containing PLEs 1, 4, or 5. Further, they show using qPCR that plaquing efficiency on PLE1 is correlated with Odn-mediated repression of PLE1 replication. In the future, it will be interesting to know if Odn alone is sufficient to overcome PLE, and whether the adjacent genes broN and gp90 play any regulatory or accessory role in Odn function.</p><p>Next, the authors compared the genomes of all five PLE variants and found that the ori and RepA sequences cluster into two distinct groups-PLEs 1/4/5 and PLEs 2/3. This potentially explained why ICP12001 can plaque on strains containing PLEs 1, 4, and 5, but not PLEs 2 or 3, leading the authors to hypothesize that Odn recognizes and binds to the origin of replication of PLEs 1/4/5, but not PLEs 2/3. The Seed lab previously showed that non-replicating PLE mutants lacking ori could still restrict ICP1 (Barth et al., 2020). Exploiting this experimental tool, they showed here that ICP12001 could no longer plaque on strains containing PLE mutants lacking ori. Finally, by re-constituting the ori of PLE1 into PLE2, the strain is now sensitized to Odn activity upon ICP12001 infection. This decisive result strongly suggests that recognition of ori sequences is required for Odn-mediated plaquing.</p><p>Finally, using an in vitro cleavage assay, the authors show that purified Odn cleaves PCR products amplified from the non-coding region containing the ori from PLEs 1/4/5, but not PLEs 2/3, consistent with the in silico prediction that the C-terminus of Odn resembles putative HEGs in ICP1. The authors further narrow down the region of specificity of Odn action to a set of iterons (a series of three ~30bp semi-palindromic repeats in the origin of replication) and demonstrate using a PLE1 mutant lacking these sequences that iterons are necessary for Odn-mediated cleavage and plaquing by ICP12001. Surprisingly, there is only a 2-bp difference between PLEs 4 and 5, yet the cleavage pattern looks different between the two, raising the question of whether a more complicated mechanism of recognition and cleavage is in place.</p><p>Finally, the authors address a crucial aspect of any host-parasite arms race-how can PLE escape from Odn-mediated restriction? They reason that simple deletions of the replication origin would not likely be selected for as a long-term solution, given its essentiality for PLE reproduction. Because of this, the authors speculate that Odn selected for domain shuffling events in PLE RepA, resulting in the two distinct clusters of PLEs 1/4/5 and PLEs 2/3. Although each PLE variant is remarkably conserved, the authors found an instance where PLE1 contained variation in its iteron sequences. They tested this variant and found that Odn was unable to cleave, suggesting that this variant PLE1 was likely resistant to infection by ICP12001, although they did not perform a plaque assay to confirm this.</p><p>In conclusion, the authors complete a thorough characterization of Odn as an anti-PLE effector in ICP1. This work presents a key advance in our understanding of ICP1-PLE dynamics and brings broader insight to the roles of lateral gene transfer in the acquisition of novel weaponry in the host-parasite arms-race.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>Figure 1: can Odn be re-constituted into a CRISPR-less ICP1 and restore plaquing against PLE1 to demonstrate sufficiency?</p><p>Figure 6: In addition to the cleavage assay, to complement the in vitro data with in vivo results, the authors should perform plaque assays on PLE1mut for ICP12001 (and the Odn deletion and catalytically inactive mutants). It would be expected for ICP12001 to no longer be able to plaque given that Odn cannot cleave.</p><p>Optional: it would be interesting to see if PLE escapers could arise naturally during an infection experiment and to determine what these mutations were. For example, you can infect a strain containing PLE1 with ICP12001 at very high MOI to lyse a whole plate. Are there any bacterial-insensitive mutants (BIMs) that form colonies? If so, are there any mutations in ori (and/or compensatory mutations in RepA), or perhaps even more strikingly, any restructuring of the iteron? This experimental evidence, together with the naturally occurring PLE1mut variant observed in Figure 6, would bolster the claim that Odn may be a driving force for the diversification of the PLE replication origin.</p><p>Text edits:</p><p>Title: the title, although descriptive, is a bit long and convoluted without having read the paper first. I would consider simplifying it to a single clause and remove jargon like &quot;laterally acquired specificity&quot;</p><p>Introduction: the description of MGE and HGT in multicellular organisms in the first paragraph is not necessary to understand this work and possibly too much information for the reader.</p><p>Figure 2: although this is beyond the focus of this work and does not need to be addressed in the text, it does not escape my attention that PLE3 is able to evade both CRISPR (no targeting spacer) and Odn (ori not recognized). Is there a contemporaneous ICP1 isolate that is able to plaque on PLE3, and if so, is there a different effector in the same genomic region between gp87 and gp91?</p><p>Figure 3: is there a working model for how PLEs recombine (if they even do) to form new variants?

Seed and colleagues have discovered and extensively characterised how a CRISPR-Cas system encoded by the phage can cleave the PLE element, leading to productive infections.</p><p>Here, the authors aimed to explain why an ICP1 genotype that naturally lacks CRISPR-Cas, and that used to be very common before CRISPR-carrying variants appeared, can infect Vibrio cells that certain PLE variants. Specifically, their previous work found that this ICP1 variant can infect cells that carry the two oldest PLE variants, PLE5 and PLE4, as well as the most recent variant PLE1 (O'Hara et al., 2017).</p><p>They found that this older ICP1 genotype carries an alternative nuclease (termed origin-directed nuclease, Odn) that cleaves the origin of replication of some PLE elements. This nuclease gene is located in the same locus as the CRISPR-Cas genes in more recent ICP1 genotypes. This newly discovered nuclease carries an N-terminal DNA binding domain that has high sequence similarity to RepA, which binds the origin of replication, and a C-terminal nuclease domain that is similar to a ICP1-encoded family of putative homing endonucleases (HEGs), and that is responsible for cleavage of the origin of replication. Different PLE variants (PLE1-5) vary with respect to their RepA and origin of replication sequences – specifically, the authors show that PLE1, 4 and 5 share RepN and Ori sequences, explaining why the ICP1 variant that carries Odn can infect cells that carry these PLE elements, but not cells that carry PLE2 or PLE3.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are well supported by comparative genomics, elegant reverse genetics analyses and biochemical assays. The authors generate all the relevant KO variants of ICP1 and PLE to demonstrate the genetic interaction between Odn of ICP1 and the Ori of PLE, including ori-swapped mutants of PLE, where PLE2 carries the ori of PLE1, leading to a lack of protection of the host from phage infection. Finally, the authors purified Odn and demonstrate that it can cleave the Ori sequences in vitro, but not random sequence, and a catalytic mutant is unable to cleave either (and the same mutation leads to PLE sensitivity in vivo). This binding and cleavage is specifically directed towards a set of semi-palindromic sequences, known as iterons.</p><p>All in all, this is a very thorough and complete study that provides novel and deep insight into the ongoing coevolutionary interaction between PLE and ICP1.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>This is a very nice study – I enjoyed reading the paper.

For example, Figure 4d shows PLEs 1, 4, and 5 are cleaved to completion by WT Odn, while in Figure 6c and its supplements, the WT shows very little cleavage activity against PLE1. Different lengths of the substrates will shift the molar ratio of enzyme to substrate, and this impact the nuclease activity. Cleavage efficiencies must be quantified and normalized.</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 6C we originally used a shorter substrate for both the WT PLE1 origin andthe mutant PLE1 origin because we had difficulty cloning the mutant origin sequence into the larger PLE1 context (since the mutant was identified in sequenced strains from other groups and not in our collection). We suspect you are correct that the loss of cutting was due to a decreased molar ratio of enzyme to substrate. We have now successfully generated the longer mutant PLE1 origin probe and have repeated the experiment using probes of the same length as in Figure 4D. These new data are shown in revised Figure 6C (replicate cleavage assays are shown in Figure 6 Figure supplement 1). With the longer probe we do see some cleavage of the PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> at high concentrations of Odn, however, together with additional in vivo evidence (discussed in response to point 4), our data indicate that the mutant ori is indeed resistant to Odn-mediated cleavage.</p><p>We also want to point out that we do not consistently see complete loss of the uncleaved substrate of even the same probe, for example, compare the three replicates of Figure 4C (Figure 4 supplement 3) – we only saw complete loss of the uncleaved substrate for the PLE1 probe in one replicate. We have therefore replaced the gel in the main figure with one of the (former) supplementary gels to reflect that complete cleavage is not the outcome the majority of the time. We are unfortunately not able to explain this minor inconsistency, and given that we make no claims regarding cleavage efficiency in vitro (and do not feel comfortable doing so), we did not quantify cleavage efficiency. We hope that the combination of in vivo and in vitro evidence, which together tell the same story regarding cleavage specificity, is satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Perform plaque assays for the ori mutant that renders this PLE resistant to Odn Figure 6c. This will be similar to the presentation of data in Figure 5a.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now completed these experiments, and the results are presented in Figure 6E. These data show that PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> is resistant to Odn(+) ICP1 as anticipated. To take this one step further, we also performed qPCR of the PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> strain during ICP1 infection and show that PLE1<sup>Mut</sup> replicates during infection and the copy increase is not impacted by Odn (Figure 6D). Collectively, we feel these new data provide more support for our conclusion that this mutation is adaptive in the face of Odn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please specify that the evidence for Odn activity driving evolutionary change in the PLE is anecdotal.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point: we have removed our original assertion that “These data</p><p>suggest that Odn imposes selective pressure on the origin of replication…” and substituted more cautious language, particularly with regard to the data in revised Figure 6: “These data demonstrate that PLE can escape Odn activity through subtle restructuring of the iterons, in addition to more extensive replication module exchange (Figure 3A), and suggest that ICP1 defenses like Odn may select for diversification of the PLE replication machinery.”</p><p>As well as in the discussion: “PLEs are able to escape Odn antagonism through mutation of their origin of replication and there is compelling evidence suggesting that PLEs have exchanged replicon modules for an alternative replication origin and initiation factor origin binding domain on at least two separate occasions.”</p><p>We feel that we were also appropriately cautious in the language we used in parts of the</p><p>original submission (these examples remain unchanged in the revised manuscript):</p><p>“The endonuclease appears to exert considerable selective pressure on PLEs</p><p>and may drive PLE replication module swapping”;</p><p>“It is possible that Odn selected for alternative replicon modules, leading to the</p><p>decline of PLE4 and succession of PLE2 that occurred in the early 2000s (O’Hara et al., 2017). […] This seems like a likely possibility for PLEs and ICP1 whose specific adaptations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Sequence Odn cleavage products and map the precise location of these cuts.</p></disp-quote><p>This was something we tried (several times) prior to the initial submission, and in response to reviewer comments made several more attempts. Using Sanger sequencing of Odn cleavage products we were unable to make a clear determination of where cutting was taking place. In most cases we saw uncleaved substrate in our sequencing results (see response to point 3), even when no uncleaved product was visible on the gel and after gel extracting smaller cleaved products. Using higher protein concentrations and longer incubation times did not resolve this issue.</p><p>In some of our attempts to address this point, chromatograms obtained by Sanger sequencing did suggest that Odn cleavage of PLE1 is occurring proximal to the poly-T centers of the first and second iterons, but these sequencing results were somewhat inconsistent, and we do not have a robust method of calling sub-sequence ends from the amplitudes of base signals. We therefore do not feel confident enough to include these results in the manuscript.</p><p>We also attempted subcloning of cleavage products via TA cloning and blunt end cloning, but were unable to recover cleaved products through these methods.</p><p>We have, however, taken additional steps requested by reviewer 1 – including cleavage assays with Odn* and other substrates (see below). Ultimately, although we do not know the precise location where cleavage is taking place, we feel that our in vivo and in vitro results are sufficient to demonstrate Odn targeting through the iterons. We agree that our biochemical characterization of Odn is preliminary and indeed include that this is an area that needs further study: “however the molecular details of Odn binding and catalysis remain to be elucidated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Comments for the authors:</p><p>1. An image of the purified proteins, both WT and mutant variants, (typically in the form of SDS-PAGE gels), should be displayed to demonstrate their purity and help support the conclusion that the Odn nuclease alone is responsible for cleavage of the PLE. The methods describe three separate chromatography steps, so it is assumed that the proteins are relatively pure, but a gel should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added images of the purified protein as Figure 4 —figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The mutant version of Odn should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as the WT to solidify the conclusion that Odn is alone responsible for PLE cleavage, at least in the beginning. For example similar assays could be performed with the mutant as with WT in Figures 4c and Figure 5a.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 5A, we include Odn* at our maximum concentration of 500nM and detect no cleavage of the PLE1 probe. In response to this comment we have now tested Odn* against other probes (PLE4 and PLE 5) which were cut by Odn in Figure 4D. These new data are presented in Figure 4E (replicate assays are found in Figure 4—figure supplement 4) and show that 500nM Odn* does not cleave probes cut by Odn, consistent with the in vivo data and our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There seems to be some inconsistencies/variabilities in the biochemical assays. For example, Figure 4d shows PLEs 1, 4, and 5 are cleaved to completion by WT Odn, while in Figure 6c and its supplements, the WT shows very little cleavage activity against PLE1. Some quantification will help the reader to understand the extent of the variation in the nuclease activity. Along the same lines, different lengths of substrates were used in these assays, which will shift the molar ratio of enzyme:substrate and impact the nuclease activity. Some sort of normalization across the assays will allow the reader to compare the levels of nuclease activity from gel to gel and assess how each new variable affects the activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Please see our response to essential revisions point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. To come full-circle, sequencing of the cut products would go a long way to support the genetics evidence for Odn targeting within the PLE origin and map the precise location of the cut(s).</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to essential revisions point 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Comments for the authors:</p><p>Experimental:</p><p>Figure 1: can Odn be re-constituted into a CRISPR-less ICP1 and restore plaquing against PLE1 to demonstrate sufficiency?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion, reconstitution of Odn restoring ICP1 ∆CRISPR plaquing on PLE1 would strongly support our model and was in fact something we tried quite early on.

We have now performed these experiments and the results are presented in Figure 6E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional: it would be interesting to see if PLE escapers could arise naturally during an infection experiment and to determine what these mutations were. For example, you can infect a strain containing PLE1 with ICP12001 at very high MOI to lyse a whole plate. Are there any bacterial-insensitive mutants (BIMs) that form colonies? If so, are there any mutations in ori (and/or compensatory mutations in RepA), or perhaps even more strikingly, any restructuring of the iteron? This experimental evidence, together with the naturally occurring PLE1mut variant observed in Figure 6, would bolster the claim that Odn may be a driving force for the diversification of the PLE replication origin.</p></disp-quote><p>This would indeed be very interesting. We did not attempt this; in our experience so far BIMs arising following infection of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with ICP1 are overwhelmingly receptor loss mutants (Seed et al. PLOS Pathogens 2012). Further, while a selection method for PLE escape would be highly useful, the outcome of either ICP1 ‘winning’ or PLE ‘winning’ is cell death, which makes a selection of this sorts extremely challenging: PLE induction ultimately culminates in cell lysis, so even if PLE escape mutants were present, the bacteria harboring those mutant PLEs cannot be recovered. It is possible that PLE escapes (in the form of transductants) could be isolated, though we have previously shown that this does not happen with CRISPR(+) ICP1 (McKitterick et al. 2019), so we did not attempt it for Odn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Text edits:</p><p>Title: the title, although descriptive, is a bit long and convoluted without having read the paper first.

While it is true that there is only a 2-bp difference in the iteron sequence between PLEs 4 and 5, the probes used for our cleavage assays encompass a larger sequence harboring the origin of replication and contain numerous differences between the PLEs (the differences can be visualized in Figure 3A). Much of these differences consist of gain or loss of novel sequence. We designed our probes without considerable attention to where the iterons fell within the probes, and the PLE4 probe happened to have the iterons directly in its center.
