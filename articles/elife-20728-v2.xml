Here, we describe a novel model of thyroid carcinoma in zebrafish that reveals temporal changes due to BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Through the use of real-time in vivo imaging, we observe disruption in thyroid follicle structure that occurs early in thyroid development. Combinatorial treatment using BRAF and MEK inhibitors reversed the developmental effects induced by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. Adult zebrafish expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes developed invasive carcinoma. We identified a gene expression signature from zebrafish thyroid cancer that is predictive of disease-free survival in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Gene expression studies nominated TWIST2 as a key effector downstream of BRAF. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to genetically inactivate a TWIST2 orthologue, we suppressed the effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and restored thyroid morphology and hormone synthesis. These data suggest that expression of TWIST2 plays a role in an early step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mediated transformation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20728.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20728.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protooncogenes</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>EMT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 CA202540 01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Houvras</surname><given-names>Yariv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Martinez-McFaline</surname><given-names>Raul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50-CA172012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Villefranc</surname><given-names>Jacques A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transformation mediated by oncogenic BRAF requires transcriptional activation of TWIST at the earliest stage of neoplastic transformation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Papillary and follicular thyroid cancers are highly prevalent malignancies arising from transformation of epithelial cells. Mutations in key signaling effectors of the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, including BRAF and RAS, are found in 70% of thyroid cancers. A recurrent activating mutation in <italic>BRAF, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>,</italic> is found in 45% of papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), the most common histologic subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xing, 2005</xref>). Although patients with PTC may be cured with surgery and radioiodine treatment, mutations in BRAF are associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xing et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms in thyrocytes that lead to malignant transformation by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</p><p>Mutations in BRAF have been linked to several mechanisms of malignant transformation. Expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> has been demonstrated to increase thyrocyte migration and invasion through induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baquero et al., 2013</xref>). Transgenic mouse models demonstrate that expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to aggressive papillary thyroid carcinomas that progresses to poorly differentiated cancers and demonstrate a loss of sodium iodide symporter expression and a failure to concentrate iodine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Knauf et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakravarty et al., 2011</xref>). Yet many human BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant PTCs are slow growing cancers, that may be clinically stable for years, and identifying these tumors is a key clinical challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Haser et al., 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2016b</xref>). While current animal models largely recapitulate aggressive thyroid cancers, there is a need to identify the molecular characteristics that differentiate indolent thyroid cancer from more aggressive subtypes and understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved in progression.</p><p>Understanding the temporal consequences of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression in thyrocytes and thyroid follicles is a key to deciphering the mechanism of malignant transformation. For this reason, we developed a zebrafish model to visualize the consequences of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression on thyrocyte follicle structure, hormone synthesis, and organ morphogenesis. Expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in zebrafish thyrocytes leads to profound disruption of follicle structure and thyroid hormone production, changes that precede an increase in proliferation. Transgenic zebrafish that express BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes develop thyroid carcinomas by one year of age with histopathologic hallmarks of human papillary thyroid cancer. Tumors from zebrafish harbor a gene expression signature that stratifies disease recurrence in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. We identify an orthologue of human TWIST2, <italic>twist3,</italic> as a key mediator of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induced EMT in thyrocytes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing we demonstrate that <italic>twist3</italic> loss of function suppresses the effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> on follicle morphogenesis and hormone production. These studies provide critical insight into the earliest effects of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of transgenic zebrafish expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes</title><p>In order to investigate the temporal consequences of oncogenic BRAF expression in thyrocytes, we created stable transgenic lines expressing either human BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and a TdTomato reporter gene (tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM) or TdTomato alone (tg-TOM), both under control of a thyroid-specific promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McMenamin et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

As expected, at 5 dpf tg-TOM larvae formed an average of five T4+ follicles along the ventral-medial axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and F</xref>). In contrast, tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM larvae displayed a significant decrease in the number and size of T4+ follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâG</xref>). To examine the effects on proliferation in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> thyrocytes, we stained tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM and tg-TOM with Sytox Green Nucleic Acid Stain and counted the total number thyrocytes at 5 dpf. Total thyrocyte number was comparable between tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM and tg-TOM control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Thyrocyte proliferation was further evaluated by BrdU incorporation into newly synthesized DNA. BrdU-positive TdTomato-positive cell number was not significantly different between tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM and tg-TOM control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1DâF</xref>). Additionally, the total area and volume encompassed by Td-Tomato positive thyroid cells was comparable between tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM and control larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G and H</xref>). These results reveal that expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in follicular cells disrupts follicle integrity, resulting in decreased number and size of follicles without altering cell number.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Combined inhibition of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> and MEK restores follicular morphology in thyrocytes expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></title><p>To investigate whether aberrant thyroid follicle morphogenesis in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> larvae could be suppressed by inhibition of MAPK signaling, we treated tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM and tg-TOM embryos with either dabrafenib, a specific inhibitor BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kainthla et al., 2014</xref>) or selumetinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kim and Patel, 2014</xref>), a MEK inhibitor, or the combination of both inhibitors and observed thyroid structure by live imaging. To limit defects caused by inhibition of MAPK signaling on early development, embryos were treated at doses compatible with normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Vehicle (DMSO) treated tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM larvae exhibited disorganized follicular structure in contrast to tg-TOM larvae at 5 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Treatment with either dabrafenib or selumetinib alone was not sufficient to restore normal thyroid morphogenesis in tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM larvae. By contrast, combined treatment with both dabrafenib and selumetinib restored normal thyroid follicular structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), T4 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and led to a significant increase in the number and size of follicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of MAPK signaling in tg-TOM larvae had no overt effects on embryo development or thyroid follicular structure, but was associated with a modest decrease in follicle number, consistent with a proliferative requirement in follicle morphogenesis. Taken together, these results suggest that combined inhibition of MEK and BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activity is required to restore normal follicular architecture and thyroid hormone (T4) production in tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM larvae.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20728.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors suppresses morphologic effects induced by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocytes and restores normal follicle structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of experimental scheme and treatment conditions of tg-TOM and tg-BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-TOM larvae.

We created a transgenic zebrafish expressing BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in fluorescently labeled thyrocytes. By following thyrocytes from the earliest stages of specification, we are able to examine the timeline of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600EÂ </sup>in vivo where we observe significant disruption of follicle structure and thyroid hormone production. However, thyrocyte number remains normal in larval development. RNAseq analysis from sorted thyrocytes confirms that genes associated with EMT and TGF-Î² are transcriptionally activated by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. These data suggest that BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activation of downstream signaling pathways converges on a gene expression program that results in loss of epithelial organization without affecting proliferation. Pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF/MEK suppresses the morphologic alterations and restores normal thyroid follicle structure. Prolonged expression of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to slow growing thyroid carcinoma with nuclear features similar to human PTC and gene expression changes conserved in human PTCs and predictive of improved disease free survival.</p><p>We have taken advantage of the optical clarity of zebrafish larvae to examine the earliest manifestations of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activity in vivo. Expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to a disruption of follicle structure and thyroid hormone synthesis in zebrafish. Our findings are consistent with prior studies performed in cell culture using rat thyrocytes that demonstrated increased invasion and expression of markers consistent with EMT after expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Riesco-Eizaguirre et al., 2009</xref>). In a mouse model of PTC expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> led to the development of poorly differentiated carcinomas associated with activation of EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Knauf et al., 2011</xref>). Studies in human thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro also demonstrate that expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces SNAIL, represses E-CADHERIN, and leads to increased invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baquero et al., 2013</xref>). Gene expression studies of human papillary thyroid cancer have identified increased expression of key EMT effectors in the invasive front of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Vasko et al., 2007</xref>). BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> has been found to physically interact and activate p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a serine/threonine kinase involved in promoting migration in human thyroid cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McCarty et al., 2014</xref>). Our data significantly extend these studies and reveal that epithelial organization and thyroid hormone production is disrupted in vivo after expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>. In contrast to a transgenic mouse models that develops aggressive poorly-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, our zebrafish model develops relatively slow growing thyroid cancer similar to the majority of human patients with PTC that grow slowly over many years. This has allowed us to dissect early vs. late effects of BRAF signaling on thyrocytes during malignant transformation. Future studies may take advantage of this latency to test candidate genes identified in cancer genomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Landa et al., 2016</xref>), and examine novel pathways that cooperate with BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> to accelerate tumor initiation and progression.</p><p>We tested the effects of small molecule kinase inhibitors, clinically used for treatment of patients with <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutant tumors, using chemical-genetic approaches in transgenic zebrafish larvae. We find that treatment with either dabrafenib (a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor) or selumetinib (a MEK inhibitor) alone is insufficient to suppress the morphologic phenotypes induced by oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in zebrafish thyrocytes, but combined therapy with both agents suppresses oncogenic signaling and restores normal morphology. Similarly, in a <italic>BRAF</italic>-mutant ATC mouse model, the combination of PLX4720, a BRAF inhibitor and PD0325901, a MAPK kinase inhibitor, was more potent in suppressing MAPK activation than either agent alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McFadden et al., 2014</xref>). Clinical studies with these agents in <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-</italic>mutant melanomas also confirm that combined therapy has greater anti-tumor efficacy in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Long et al., 2014</xref>). Multiple pathways that mediate resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been characterized in melanoma and colorectal carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pritchard and Hayward, 2013</xref>). Our findings lead us to speculate that combined therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors may be required for treatment of <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutant thyroid carcinoma. This hypothesis is being tested in an ongoing clinical trial examining BRAF inhibition alone versus the combination of BRAF inhibition and MEK inhibition (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01723202).</p><p>Prolonged expression of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to an invasive thyroid carcinoma with diagnostic features of human papillary thyroid carcinoma in adult zebrafish. Gene expression studies from tumors isolated from adult animals reveal signatures of proliferation and alterations in mTOR signaling during progression. In a mouse model of thyroid cancer genetic inactivation of TSH receptor attenuated tumor initiation suggesting that TSHR signaling cooperates with oncogenic BRAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Franco et al., 2011</xref>). We suggest that zebrafish thyroid carcinomas may arise slowly due to a relative euthyroid state that does not provoke elevated TSH levels, as seen in mouse models. Alternatively, it is possible that additional genetic alterations may be required for development of carcinoma. Thyroid cancers in zebrafish exhibit similar histologic features to human papillary thyroid cancer. These are relatively slow growing carcinomas that invade local tissues and exhibit a desmoplastic stromal reaction. Key diagnostic features of PTC, such as nuclear grooves and elongation, are observed, indicating conservation of these phenotypes across broad evolutionary distance. Interestingly tumor formation in zebrafish thyroid occurs on a tp53 wild-type background, in contrast to a zebrafish melanoma model in which tp53 loss of function is required for tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Patton et al., 2005</xref>). These results confirm the importance of cellular context in modulating tumor initiation, consistent with genetic studies from human patients, which demonstrate BRAF mutations in papillary microcarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2015</xref>), the earliest pathologic lesions identified.</p><p>By studying the gene expression changes induced by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>,Â we found enrichment of TGF-Î²/EMT signatures and a correlation with TWIST2 expression in human papillary thyroid carcinomas. TWIST proteins are over-expressed in a significant fraction of thyroid cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">WangÂ etÂ al., 2013</xref>) and knockdown of TWIST1 in thyroid cancer cell lines led to a reduction in proliferation and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Salerno et al., 2011</xref>). We find that <italic>twist3</italic>, an orthologue of <italic>TWIST2,</italic> is significantly upregulated in thyrocytes upon <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> expression. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing we find that genetic inactivation of <italic>twist3</italic> suppressed the effects of oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyrocyte follicle structure and hormone synthesis. To our knowledge, these are the first in vivo data demonstrating a genetic requirement for TWIST expression downstream of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in a thyroid cancer model.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of constructs</title><p>All vectors were created using Gateway recombination (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael R. Green as the Reviewing Editor and Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leonard I Zon, Craig Ceol.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Papillary Thyroid Cancers (PTC) can present as aggressive tumors (characterized by poorly differentiated cells) or indolent tumors (well-differentiated cells). Existing mouse models of PTCs depict the aggressive version of the disease. In this manuscript, the authors have developed a zebrafish model for PTC that closely mimics slow growing human PTCs. Zebrafish with thryocyte-specific expression of BRAFV600E have disrupted thyroid follicle structure and hormone synthesis during development. These transgenic zebrafish, upon adulthood, develop PTCs. The timing of tumor onset, histopathology and gene expression signature of these tumors recapitulate that of slow-growing human PTCs. The authors have demonstrated that the expression profile of these tumors is predictive of disease-free survival in patients with PTCs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of twist3 (ortholog of human TWIST2) in BRAFV600E-expressing zebrafish thyrocytes restored thyroid structure and hormone producing ability. The authors have identified twist3 as a key downstream effector of BRAFV600E induced EMT in thyrocytes and claim that this process is essential in the early oncogenic transformation that initiates these cancers.</p><p>The manuscript describes a new zebrafish model of PTC that may be the best existing representation of slow-growing human PTC. The zebrafish model of PTC may serve a useful tool for stratifying PTC patients based on disease recurrence. Experiments are performed in a logical order and the manuscript is nicely written.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Given that low degree of detected mutations (19%) and of these only 2 show loss of function (2/46 = 4%) in the cohort sequenced, it is surprising that the twist3 sgRNA causes such a dramatic reversal of phenotype. It is possible that the sequencing method used is underestimating the number of loss of function alleles. Please assess twist protein levels either through western or immunostaining at any time point to confirm significant loss of function of twist3. Alternatively, it the thyroid cells could be sorted at day 5 dpf after imaging and these cells could be sequenced via Next Generation Sequencing to assay the mutation rate. In addition, a negative control gRNA should be injected to ensure that injection of gRNA alone is not affecting the phenotype, especially given the discordance between the alleles predicted to be loss of function and the strong suppression of BRAF-related thyroid dysmorphic changes.</p><p>2) The authors have used tissue-specific knockout of twist3 to claim that it is necessary for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced morphological changes in thyroid structure. Embryos injected with twist3 sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) have morphological defects, notably cyclopia, that are reminiscent of general RNA toxicity. The authors should show that the rescue of thyroid structure is not due to non-specific morphological changes caused by RNA toxicity. A variety of control experiments can be performed to exclude this possibility.</p><p>3) The Abstract asserts that the data demonstrate a genetic requirement for TWIST2 in the earliest step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> transformation. Please rewrite this sentence with a more limited and specific conclusion. Alternatively, if data is already collected regarding whether twist3 CRISPR suppressed onset of BRAF-driven adult thyroid cancer in this model and if existing human sequencing data suggest this could be an early event in PTC development, please add these two lines of data.</p><p>4) There are instances where the authors should fortify the claims they are making. First, in the Abstract it is stated that there is a 'genetic requirement for TWIST2 in the earliest step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mediated transformation'. While twist3 might be important for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven changes in thyroid morphology, it is not clear that these morphological changes represent an early stage or step of oncogenic transformation. It would bolster their case if the authors show an effect of twist3 loss on BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven tumorigenesis. Can they show that animals with thyroid-specific loss of twist3 also have delayed tumor onset? If not, then the authors' claims should be rephrased. Second, the sentence 'We identify an orthologue of human TWIST2, twist3, as a key mediator of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induced EMT in thyrocytes' has similar issues. While an EMT signature (among others) is seen in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-expressing thyrocytes, the authors should do more before unequivocally stating this is EMT. Showing changes in expression of canonical EMT markers (e.g. E cadherin, N cadherin) is necessary.</p><p>5) All three reviewers also agree that the authors have not done the experiments to be able to conclude that there is a &quot;pivotal functional role for TWIST expression during the earliest stage of malignant transformation by oncogenic BRAF&quot;. The conclusions should be softened in the text. The work would form the basis of a nice new paper. To support this conclusion the authors would need to do a variety of human sequencing and cell culture work. We feel that all these experiments are clearly beyond the two-month time limit recommended by <italic>eLife</italic>. For example, sequencing of human PTCs for early events would be a whole other collaboration/project and cell culture work may not recapitulate the indolent nature of human PTC modeled in this paper and could take a long time, may up to a year. Given the time restraints suggested by <italic>eLife</italic>, we are comfortable instead having the authors remove the sentence at the end of the Discussion.</p><p>Non-essential revisions:</p><p>1) One deficiency of the current manuscript is lack of human disease equivalent for the presented results. If available, please add data using human samples of thyroid cancer or thyroid cancer cell lines that this pathway is important, conserved and relevant to human thyroid cancer driven by BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</p><p>2) The authors show that the effect of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> in thyroid morphogenesis can be rescued by combined treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors but not by either of them individually. The authors do not explain any further why this happens. Have the authors tried higher concentrations with individual inhibitors to see if they can show rescue?</p><p>3) This is not necessarily a 'concern', but could the authors determine whether their zebrafish PTC signature aligns more closely with human (or mouse) PTC versus PDTC. If the zebrafish signature is more similar to PTCs, then it would help their argument that they are modeling a more indolent form of the disease.</p><p>4) The western blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> should be quantified as the changes are subtle.</p><p>5) The histology images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are difficult to see. Zoomed in insets of certain important regions/features within the PTC will help in visualizing these.</p><p>6) The chromatograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1G</xref> show wide peaks in mutated regions of the twist3 gene. In the clonal analyses described, where only one copy of the gene is being sequenced, regular-width peaks along with a commensurate frameshift downstream of the indel would be expected. It is not clear why the chromatograms look like they do.</p><p>7) Please describe in the text how was the gene signature used in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> chosen. Did this gene signature predict improved OS for patients with PTC? If not, please hypothesize regarding any discrepancy.</p><p>8) Please comment in the text or Discussion why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> selemetinib decreases number of follicles significantly.</p><p>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and the text associated with them would be clarified by addressing the following items.</p><p>a) What is the significance if the pathologic features shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in human PTC if any?</p><p>b) Please describe in the text whether the one-year animals get metastases.</p><p>c) Were the animals with the desmoplastic reaction the same animals with the other pathologic features?</p><p>d) If the animals look different at 12m with the tumors as compared to 5 mpf, can a photo of 12mpf fish with thyroid cancer be included at the beginning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</p><p>e) Please also include more up close photos of the cytologic features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, especially of the nuclear grooves and elongated nuclei so these can be appreciated.</p><p>f) Please also annotate the structures being invaded in histologic structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to ensure non-zebrafish audience can appreciate the data.</p><p>10) The manuscript would benefit from several small edits in order to clarify the work.

We were not able to identify an antibody that recognizes zebrafish twist3 by immunohistochemistry. Therefore, we performed molecular studies using twist3 sgRNA and an assessment of mutation rate, as suggested.</p><p>We utilized a new synthetic sgRNA targeting <italic>twist3</italic> and compared this to a non- targeting sgRNA in embryos injected with rCas9. Utilizing a synthetic sgRNA we find no effect on early embryo development or morphogenesis, in contrast to our initial data using in vitrosynthesized sgRNA. This data prompted us to modify our approach and perform global CRISPR/Cas9 editing using recombinant Cas9, followed by analysis of follicle structure, T4 hormone production, and FACS of thyroid cells followed by a clonal analysis of editing in the <italic>twist3</italic> gene.</p><p>A clonal analysis of embryos injected with an sgRNA targeting twist3 shows that 16/21 (76%) clones harbor a range of indels at the targeted site, all predicted to lead to premature stop codon in twist3 (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We demonstrate that a non-targeting sgRNA produces no indels at the targeted site in 21 clones from 5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), and is also negative by T7 endonuclease assay. CRISPR/Cas9 editing of twist3 suppressed the thyroid phenotype in Tg-BRAF(V600E)-TOM embryos in 32% of larvae. Thus using new reagents we demonstrate that 1) CRISPR editing of twist3 suppresses the BRAF(V600E) phenotype on thyroid follicles, and restores T4 production, 2) the new molecular tools have high specificity for twist3, and 3) a non-targeting sgRNA does not produce molecular alterations in twist3 locus or revert the BRAF(V600E) phenotype. Finally, we performed FACS sorting of thyrocytes, as suggested, and a clonal analysis from these cells revealed indels in twist3 in 1/12 (8%) clones, confirming the presence of a twist3 loss of function mutation in thyrocytes. We acknowledge that the rate of indels in sorted thyrocytes (8%) is lower than observed in globally edited embryos (76%). It is possible that sorting low cell numbers and subsequent PCR amplification introduces bias and leads to an underestimate in the true rate of indels in sorted TOM+ cells. Nevertheless, we do confirm editing at a measurable rate in FACS sorted thyroid cells from embryos with a suppressed phenotype, and no edits were found in TOM+ cells sorted from non-target sgRNA injected animals, so we believe that the claim that we make is reasonable.</p><p><italic>2) The authors have used tissue-specific knockout of twist3 to claim that it is necessary for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-induced morphological changes in thyroid structure. Embryos injected with twist3 sgRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>) have morphological defects, notably cyclopia, that are reminiscent of general RNA toxicity. The authors should show that the rescue of thyroid structure is not due to non-specific morphological changes caused by RNA toxicity. A variety of control experiments can be performed to exclude this possibility.</italic> </p><p>This comment led us to examine alternative sgRNAs to determine if they may be less toxic. Using a synthetic twist3 sgRNA we see no evidence of developmental toxicity, representative embryos at 5dpf are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>. Based on this finding we shifted our strategy to perform a global edit of twist3 in the tg-BRAF- TOM transgenic larvae, followed by analysis of follicle structure, hormone production, and FACS isolation of TOM+ thyrocytes from twist3 sgRNA or non-targeting sgRNA injected embryos. These experiments form the basis of a revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The Abstract asserts that the data demonstrate a genetic requirement for TWIST2 in the earliest step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> transformation.

Alternatively, if data is already collected regarding whether twist3 CRISPR suppressed onset of BRAF-driven adult thyroid cancer in this model and if existing human sequencing data suggest this could be an early event in PTC development, please add these two lines of data.</italic> </p><p>We have edited the sentence in the Abstract to present a more limited and specific conclusion. The sentence now reads, âThese data suggest that expression of TWIST2 plays a role in an early step of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-mediated transformation.â</p><p><italic>4) There are instances where the authors should fortify the claims they are making.

We agree that the connection between the early morphologic phenotypes and long term effects on tumor development is an important topic for future study.</p><p>We present new data to demonstrate a loss of E-cadherin staining in BRAF(V600E) expressing thyrocytes, consistent with EMT.

A new chromatogram included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref> shows a 3 nucleotide indel, and the peak width is unchanged in the deleted region.</p><p><italic>7) Please describe in the text how was the gene signature used in the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> chosen. Did this gene signature predict improved OS for patients with PTC? If not, please hypothesize regarding any discrepancy.</italic> </p><p>As we described in the Materials and methods section and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> legend, we identified the top differentially expressed genes using standard metrics (FDR â¤ 1x10<sup>-6</sup>, FC â¤1.5). This resulted in a very stringent selection of 58 genes differentially regulated in BRAF thyroid tumors compared to normal thyroid tissue. In order to test whether these genes stratify a clinically meaningful outcome, such as disease free survival (DFS), we utilized RNAseq data from the TCGA papillary thyroid cancer cohort. As described in Materials and methods we calculated a rank per subject for the signature in the TCGA cohort. We then stratified subjects by median rank and performed an analysis of DFS. Almost no deaths occurred in the TCGA PTC cohort, which is typical for PTC, so an analysis of overall survival is not possible. We edited the Materials and methods section to improve clarity.</p><p><italic>8) Please comment in the text or Discussion why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> selemetinib decreases number of follicles significantly.</italic> </p><p>We have commented in the text that MAPK inhibition results in a modest decrease in follicle number, consistent with a proliferative requirement in follicle morphogenesis.</p><p><italic>9) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and the text associated with them would be clarified by addressing the following items.</italic> </p><p> <italic>a) What is the significance if the pathologic features shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in human PTC if any?</italic> </p><p>We have edited the text to note that the features highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are diagnostic of thyroid carcinoma.</p><p><italic>b) Please describe in the text whether the one-year animals get metastases.</italic> </p><p>We did not perform an exhaustive histologic study for distant metastatic disease instead focusing on local invasion. In fact, it is difficult to exclude metastasis as a mechanism for some of the disease we see in soft tissue and skeletal muscle.</p><p><italic>c) Were the animals with the desmoplastic reaction the same animals with the other pathologic features?</italic> </p><p>These animals were distinct.</p><p><italic>d) If the animals look different at 12m with the tumors as compared to 5 mpf, can a photo of 12mpf fish with thyroid cancer be included at the beginning of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>?</italic> </p><p>The animals have a similar external appearance at 5mpf and 12mpf.</p><p><italic>e) Please also include more up close photos of the cytologic features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, especially of the nuclear grooves and elongated nuclei so these can be appreciated.</italic> </p><p>We improved the resolution of this figure to allow better appreciation of these features.</p><p><italic>f) Please also annotate the structures being invaded in histologic structures in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> to ensure non-zebrafish audience can appreciate the data.</italic> </p><p>We have provided insets to highlight skeletal muscle invasion.</p><p><italic>10) The manuscript would benefit from several small edits in order to clarify the work. Most of these edits will help the work be more accessible to a non-zebrafish audience.</italic> </p><p><italic>Text edits:</italic> </p><p><italic>Abstract: Please clarify that developmental effects of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>-driven changes in thyroids were reversed with drug treatment.</italic> </p><p>We edited the Abstract to address this point.</p><p><italic>Introduction, second paragraph: Please define the acronym NIS.</italic> </p><p>We edited the text to address this point.</p><p><italic>Subsection âBRAF<sup>V600E</sup> expression leads to TGF-Î² and EMT gene expression changes in thyrocytesâ: Please name the tumors that the cell lines were derived from (thyroid?) and clarify how an ERK signature is derived by inhibiting MEK.

BRAF(V600E) mutations are the most common somatic alteration in papillary thyroid cancer. For this reason, we feel that the comparison to papillary microcarcinoma is reasonable.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> legend: positive is spelled incorrectly.</italic> </p><p>We corrected this misspelling.</p><p><italic>Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in the text, please comment/discuss that RNA-seq data could also be different due to other cell populations being present in the sequenced sample as sorting was not done in this experiment.</italic> </p><p>We feel that the manuscript contains sufficient methodologic detail as we state that Tomato+ tissue was microdissected.
