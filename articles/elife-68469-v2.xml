While much progress has been made in relating <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants to expression levels, the timing of gene activation and repression may also be important to the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences. We investigated allele-specific expression (ASE) dynamics within and between <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species during the diauxic shift and found appreciable <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. Within-species ASE is associated with intergenic variants, and ASE dynamics are more strongly associated with insertions and deletions than ASE levels. To refine these associations, we used a high-throughput reporter assay to test promoter regions and individual variants. Within the subset of regions that recapitulated endogenous expression, we identified and characterized <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants that affect expression dynamics. Between species, chimeric promoter regions generate novel patterns and indicate constraints on the evolution of gene expression dynamics. We conclude that changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences can tune gene expression dynamics and that the interplay between expression dynamics and other aspects of expression is relevant to the evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>yeast</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM080669</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fay</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allele differences in gene expression dynamics are associated with insertions and deletions and are caused in part by multiple variants within the same promoter region.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Noncoding <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences control gene expression and are thought to play a central role in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carroll, 2005</xref>). However, genetic analysis of phenotypic variation frequently uncovers changes in protein coding sequences rather than in regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stern and Orgogozo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fay, 2013</xref>). One explanation might be that genetic mapping and transgenic studies tend to identify large effect mutations. If evolution predominantly occurs through numerous changes of small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rockman, 2012</xref>), the role of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences is harder to discern. Even so, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes have been shown to be important in polygenic adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bullard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fraser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fraser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fraser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Naranjo et al., 2015</xref>), the accumulation of multiple changes at evolutionary hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Frankel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Engle and Fay, 2012</xref>, 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin and Orgogozo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li and Fay, 2019</xref>), and variation in fitness and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sharon et al., 2018</xref>). Regardless of the relative role of coding and noncoding sequences in phenotypic evolution, understanding how variation in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences generates variation in gene expression is important to understanding the evolution of gene regulation.</p><p>Across organisms, there is an abundance of <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequence variation that affects gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hill et al., 2021</xref>). The causes of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation are not as easily characterized. Transcription factor binding sites are often found to play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>). However, the number, identity, and position of binding sites can also vary without affecting expression. The flexibility of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences is shown by genes with similar expression patterns but different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berman et al., 2002</xref>). In the case of orthologous genes from different species, binding site turnover and transcription factor re-wiring explain substantial divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences without expression divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ludwig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dermitzakis and Clark, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hare et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tuch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Venkataram and Fay, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Swanson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergen et al., 2016</xref>). Consequently, predicting changes in gene expression based on variation in individual transcription factor binding sites has proven difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Doniger and Fay, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doniger et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite the flexibility of binding sites within <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences, sequences flanking binding sites evolve under constraints and can affect expression. For example, over a third of yeast intergenic sequences are estimated to be under selective constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doniger et al., 2005</xref>). This fraction is greater than that expected from either conserved or experimentally identified binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doniger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Venkataram and Fay, 2010</xref>). Sequences flanking binding sites have also been shown to affect expression, potentially related to DNA shape, nucleosome positioning, or weak binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tanay et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">White et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Levo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Inukai et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, conservation scores have proven important for predicting <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kircher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Renganaath et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory sequences can affect other aspects of gene regulation besides expression levels. Stochastic noise in gene expression provides a mechanism for bet-hedging strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raj and van Oudenaarden, 2008</xref>) and is encoded by and evolves through changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richard and Yvert, 2014</xref>). <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory variants that alter noise in expression levels have been shown to be under selection and can occur both within and outside of known binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Metzger et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duveau et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Gene expression dynamics, which include the timing and rate of gene activation and repression, are also important aspects of gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">LÃ³pez-Maury et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yosef and Regev, 2011</xref>). Gene expression dynamics can be altered by transcription factors and their interactions with promoters, but also depend on nucleosomes and their positions relative to binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lam et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hager et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dadiani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen and O'Shea, 2015</xref>). Notably, chromatin mutants slow gene activation without compromising final levels of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbaric et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Floer et al., 2010</xref>). Variation in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences can also affect gene expression dynamics, but these dynamics are only sometimes captured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Francesconi and Lehner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Strober et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the causes of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation in gene expression dynamics have neither been characterized nor related to variation in gene expression levels.</p><p>In this study, we investigate <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. We survey and find allele-specific differences in expression dynamics both within and between <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species during the diauxic shift when there is major transition from the expression of genes involved in fermentation to respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DeRisi et al., 1997</xref>). Using these data, we associated allele-specific expression (ASE) with promoter variation and individual variants using a high-throughput reporter assay. Our results inform our understanding of variation in gene expression dynamics and point towards an integrated view of gene expression and how it evolves.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory variation in gene expression levels and dynamics</title><p>To identify <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation in gene expression dynamics, we measured ASE in three intra-specific and two inter-specific diploid hybrids. Hybrids were generated by crossing a North American <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strain (Oak) to an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wine strain (Wine) and two strains from China (China I and China II), as well as to a strain of <italic>Saccharomyces paradoxus</italic> and <italic>Saccharomyces uvarum</italic> (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), enabling us to examine a range of divergence in gene regulation. To capture temporal differences in ASE that occur during the diauxic shift, we generated RNA-sequencing data from 19 timepoints for each hybrid, spanning the shift from fermentation to respiration as measured by glucose depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>ASE requires RNA-sequencing reads that can be distinguished as coming from one of the two parental strains. To measure ASE while avoiding mapping bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Degner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stevenson et al., 2013</xref>), we mapped reads to the combined parental genomes and enumerated allele-specific reads. The proportion of reads mapping to each parental genome was equivalent across all five hybrids, except for one arm of chromosome XIII in the China I hybrid consistent with aneuploidy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), which we removed from subsequent analysis.</p><p>Two statistical tests were used to separately identify genes exhibiting differences in ASE levels and changes in ASE dynamics over time. Genes with ASE dynamics were identified by testing for an autocorrelation in the ratio of allele-specific reads over time. Under the null model, the ratio of the two alleles is constant over time but not necessarily equal to 1. Genes with ASE levels were identified by testing for differences between the expression of the two alleles across all timepoints. Using these tests, we found thatÂ more genes showed ASE levels compared to ASE dynamics and the number of genes with either ASE levels or dynamics increased with divergence (false discovery rateÂ [FDR] &lt; 0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As expected, genes with ASE levels showed larger average allele differences across timepoints, and genes with ASE dynamics showed larger standard deviations in allele differences across timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Genes with ASE levels and genes with ASE dynamics were relatively evenly distributed across genes whose expression increased/decreased or showed a peak/trough during the diauxic shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Number of genes with allele-specific expression.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th colspan="3">Intra-specific hybrids<sup>â¡</sup></th><th colspan="2" valign="bottom">Inter-specific hybrids<sup>â¡</sup></th></tr><tr><th valign="bottom"/><th valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Oak Ã Wine)</th><th valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Oak Ã China II)</th><th valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Oak Ã China I)â </th><th valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ã <break/><italic>S. paradoxus</italic></th><th valign="bottom"><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ã <break/><italic>S. uvarum</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Group<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="bottom">YJF1460</td><td valign="bottom">YJF1455</td><td valign="bottom">YJF14542</td><td valign="bottom">YJF1453</td><td valign="bottom">YJF1484</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Dynamics</td><td valign="bottom">671</td><td valign="bottom">699</td><td valign="bottom">911</td><td valign="bottom">2055</td><td valign="bottom">1827</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Levels</td><td valign="bottom">1964</td><td valign="bottom">2088</td><td valign="bottom">2260</td><td valign="bottom">2930</td><td valign="bottom">3237</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Both</td><td valign="bottom">371</td><td valign="bottom">375</td><td valign="bottom">501</td><td valign="bottom">1260</td><td valign="bottom">1253</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p><sup>*</sup>Genes with significant (false discovery rate &lt; 0.01) allele-specific differences in dynamics, levels, or both dynamics and levels.</p><p><sup>â </sup>The total number of genes is 4703 except for 358 genes on chromosome 13R of the China I hybrid that were removed.</p></fn><fn><p><sup>â¡</sup>Oak is most closely related to the Wine strain, followed by China II, China I, <italic>S. paradoxus,</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Gene expression dynamics.</title><p>Each line shows the average expression of genes in each k-means cluster over timepoints.

ASE can be condition-specific due to an allele difference in the presence but not absence of glucose, or viceÂ versa. ASE can also differ specifically during the diauxic shift due to a difference in the timing or rate of gene activation that does not require ASE differences before or after the shift. To characterize ASE, we applied k-means clustering to ASE allele frequencies and found two types of patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Table S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

For the intra-specific hybrids, the frequency of ASE increases linearly with the number of variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that regulatory variants are rare enough to consistently increase the frequency of ASE at low divergence.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intra-specific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants</title><p>The associations between ASE and the number of upstream intergenic variants indicate that promoter polymorphism is a significant contributor to ASE.

Because the synthesized promoters were limited to 130 bp, we designed five overlapping CRE sequences per gene to test all variants within the 250 bp region upstream of the transcription start siteÂ (TSS). There were a total of 337 variants, an average of 4.2 SNPs and 0.72 InDels per gene. For any CRE sequences with more than a single difference between the Oak and ChII alleles, we also generated CREs for each ChII variant in the Oak allele and viceÂ versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

We measured CRE expression over 19 timepoints during the diauxic shift in the same hybrid background as RNA-seq.

CRE-seq regions correlated with RNA-seq tended to lie further away from the TSS, and in some cases showed a gradual increase in correspondence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also barcoded and measured expression from full-length promoters of three genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Much progress has been made in identifying <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants responsible for changes in gene expression levels. In this study, we identified and characterized <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. We find that while gene expression dynamics are interrelated to expression levels, they differ in the types and identities of variants perturbing them. Below we discuss the relationship between gene expression dynamics and other aspects of gene regulation and how this fits into our understanding of regulatory evolution.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Gene expression dynamics are an integrated component of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation</title><p>We find, as expected, abundant <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation in gene expression dynamics. Despite the potential importance of changes in gene expression dynamics, they are not easily disentangled from other aspects of gene expression such as levels and noise. In our data, roughly one-third of genes that exhibit ASE dynamics also exhibit ASE levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). This overlap is not unexpected as the tests for ASE dynamics and levels are not mutually exclusive. For example, genes that exhibit differences in expression levels after but not before the diauxic shift by definition also exhibit differences in expression dynamics during the diauxic shift. While less common, we do find genes where ASE differences are greatest during the diauxic shift, consistent with a change in the rate or timing of gene activation/repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). How can the rate or timing of expression be altered without affecting levels? Prior work has shown that chromatin mutants can slow gene activation without impacting levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barbaric et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Floer et al., 2010</xref>). While this does not exclude the possibility of changes in binding sites, it points to changes in nucleosome positioning sequences in mediating expression dynamics.</p><p>Gene expression dynamics may also be interrelated to stochastic noise in expression. During the diauxic shift, there is cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression and this leaky regulation can give the appearance of a slower rate of activation at the population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">New et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Venturelli et al., 2015</xref>). Put differently, an increase in noise is expected to blur a sharp transition between activated and repressed states. However, noise, levels, and dynamics are also not entirely dependent on one another. For example, gene expression often occurs in bursts with expression levels more dependent on burst size, noise more dependent on burst frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carey et al., 2013</xref>), and timing dependent on both changes in burst size and frequency. Thus, the covariation between expression levels, dynamics, and noise likely shapes how gene expression evolves within and between species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory variants underlying expression dynamics</title><p>Previous studies have characterized <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants underlying gene expression levels. We find a number of results from studies of gene expression levels also hold for expression dynamics: (i) a weak or no association between expression divergence and sequence divergence between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tirosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zeevi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li and Fay, 2017</xref>); (ii) 5' InDels are more strongly associated with expression differences than 5' SNPs within species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Massouras et al., 2012</xref>); and (iii) within species, the number of 5' variants is associated with ASE and multiple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants occur within the same promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Renganaath et al., 2020</xref>). One notable difference between ASE levels and dynamics is that 5' InDels show a stronger association with ASE. Below, we discuss these results and some of the limitations of our study.</p><p>Based on the genome-wide logistic regression, we found InDels have larger odds ratios than SNPs, indicating either larger effects or a higher proportion of variants affect expression. This result is consistent with a larger effect of InDels found in an eQTL mapping study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Massouras et al., 2012</xref>). However, a limitation of our genome-wide associations is comparing 5', coding and 3' regions. First, the number of SNPs and InDels is correlated among 5', coding and 3' regions, making it hard to quantify their relative contribution. Second, the low odds ratios for 5' compared to 3' region SNPs could be a consequence of the size of the region. The small (80 bp) 3' regions may have a higher proportion of functional variants than the larger 5' regions, which likely contain a mixture of large effect promoter variants diluted by more numerous non-functional variants outside of the promoter region. In a yeast eQTL study where direct comparison of 5' and 3' regions was possible, the strongest associations were for regions immediately upstream and downstream of the transcription start and termination sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kita et al., 2017</xref>). For the association with 3' variants, it is worth noting that ASE may be driven by variants that affect mRNA decay rather than transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We also found thatÂ 5' InDels have stronger associations with ASE dynamics compared to ASE levels. However, this difference was not present for genes with large allele differences, where both ASE levels and dynamics were strongly associated with 5' InDels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The strong and more equivalent associations could be a consequence of the higher coincidence of both ASE levels and dynamics for genes with large allele differences. We did not find an over-representation of InDels among causal variants identified in the CRE-seq assay. This difference may be a consequence of a small sample size (nÂ =Â 35). But it could also reflect our selection of genes with the largest differences in ASE dynamics to test, and promoters with multiple SNPs being more likely to cause large ASE differences than those with multiple InDels, which are more rare.</p><p>A previous study of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants that affect expression levels in yeast found multiple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants per gene, and that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants are more likely to disrupt conserved sequences and alter transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Renganaath et al., 2020</xref>). We found that nearly half of the genes (8/20) had more than one variant (2â5) associated with ASE dynamics, but <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants associated with ASE dynamics were not associated with conserved sequences or changes in predicted transcription factor binding sites. Beyond technical differences, the absence of association with conserved sequences and binding sites could be related to differences in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants underlying ASE levels versus dynamics, to the strains used in each study, or to our smaller sample size. Strain differences may be relevant since we used variants between two wild strains Oak and ChII, whereas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Renganaath et al., 2020</xref> used a wine and laboratory strain, the latter of which has evolved under relaxed selection and has more deleterious variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Doniger et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with a sample size explanation, we found that PhastCons conservation scores improved the odds ratios from genome-wide logistic regression of SNPs with ASE levels and dynamics (Table S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Although powerful in throughput, the CRE-seq reporter assay has a number of limitations relevant to our results. First, 130 bp CRE sequences do not capture the entire promoter and different regions of a promoter often generate different patterns of expression. For example, a variant that modulates expression may have little or no effect unless upstream activation sequences are also included in the CRE. However, it is also possible that a variant affects expression regardless of the presence or absence of other elements. The extent to which the effects of individual binding sites are dependent on other sites forms the basis for the difference between the enhanceosome and billboard models of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005</xref>). A second limitation of our study is that high-throughput reporter assays perform better with high levels of replication. Prior high-throughput reporter assays have used tens or hundreds of barcode replicates per allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tewhey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Renganaath et al., 2020</xref>). Our use of only four barcode replicates per allele likely limited our ability to detect variants that affect ASE levels. This limitation applies less to ASE dynamics that are unaffected by the mean expression of any single barcoded CRE. Given these limitations, not all <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants assayed by CRE-seq may have been detected.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences</title><p>Chimeric <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence from different species often shows loss of function and supports the binding site turnover model, whereby the chance gain of a redundant binding site enables loss of another site without adverse effects on expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ludwig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ludwig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2014</xref>). We find thatÂ chimeric promoter regions from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> often generate expression dynamics outside of the parental species' range. The chimeras thus provide evidence for constraints on gene expression dynamics. However, we also find that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants within <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are not greatly enriched at conserved sites. These two observations are consistent with a neutral model of expression divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fay and Wittkopp, 2008</xref>), whereby small changes in dynamics within species are neutral, but when neutral changes in different lineages are brought together they yield expression patterns that lie outside of the parent range and are unlikely to be tolerated within a species. It is also possible that constraints on expression dynamics depend on expression levels or noise. Indeed, the fitness effects of noise depend on expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Duveau et al., 2018</xref>). This emphasizes the importance of characterizing how fitness altering <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants affect all aspects of gene expression to understand the evolution of

Variant counts were obtained for all of the 4703 genes with expression data except for 11 genes that only had counts for the intra-specific hybrids.</p><p>For logistic regression, we predicted genes with differences in ASE levels and dynamics usingÂ <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>p</italic> indicates whether a gene shows significant ASE or not, <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> is the regression coefficient, <italic>x</italic> is the predictive variable, and <italic>e</italic> is the error. We used a Bonferroni cutoff for significance to correct for the 60 different regressions based on 6 predictive variables:Â number of SNPs and InDels within upstream, downstream, and coding regions, and 10 response variables: ASE dynamics and ASE levels in each of the five hybrids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CRE-seq</title><p>A high-throughput reporter assay (CRE-seq) was used to measure the activity of CREs by sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mogno et al., 2013</xref>). In this assay, a pool of synthetic <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences are cloned en masse, YFP is inserted between the CRE and the barcode, and the reporter library is then integrated into the genome. The activity of each CRE is measured by the ratio of barcode sequencing reads from an RNA relative to a DNA library of the pooled transformants. As described below, we used this reporter assay to measure expression of 7268 and 7232 synthetic CRE sequences, representing intra-specific and inter-specific allele differences upstream of 69 and 98 genes, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Synthesis</title><p>CREs were synthesized as part of a library of 200 bp oligos (Agilent). The synthetic oligos include a forward primer, RS1, CRE, RS2, RS3, RS4, BC, RS5, reverse primer, where CRE is the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element, RS1â5 are restriction sites, and BC is a barcode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The barcodes were random 10 bp sequences with a minimum of two differences and no restriction sites. The selected barcodes were checked to ensure no base composition bias. Target CRE sequences were defined by the 250 bp region upstream of the TSSÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Venters et al., 2011</xref>). For each target CRE, five 130 bp sliding windows of the sequence were generated using a 30 bp step size. Any 130 bp regions containing coding sequence of the next upstream gene were removed. Four replicates with different barcodes were generated for each CRE. CREs were generated separately for each strain allele unless the CRE window was identical between the strains. TSSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2009</xref>) were found by liftOver from the reference (S288c) genome to the coordinates in the strain of interest. In cases where the CREs contained InDels, extra sequence was added to the gapped allele between RS2 and RS4 to keep the oligo length constant. CREs were also synthesized for intra-specific variants between the Oak (YJF153) and China II strain (SX6). These CREs were designed by replacing a single Oak variant by the China II variant and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Inter-specific chimeric CREs were generated by recombining the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> allele with <italic>S. uvarum</italic> allele at the center of each CRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The intra-specific and inter-specific libraries respectively represented 334 and 452 regions upstream of 69 and 98 genes after removing regions that overlapped with upstream genes, and contained a total of 7268 and 7232 synthetic CRE sequences. Genes were chosen based on:the absence of restriction sites within the target CRE, an annotated TSS, significant ASE levels and/or ASE dynamics, and inspection of the ASE differences. For the 69 genes used for the intra-specific libraries, 19 showed ASE levels, 10 showed ASE dynamics, and 40 showed both. For the 98 genes used in the inter-specific library, 23 showed ASE level, 10 showed ASE dynamics, and 65 showed both.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cloning</title><p>CRE-seq libraries were amplified (eight separate reactions of 10-cycle amplification), digested, gel purified, and ligated into pIM202 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mogno et al., 2013</xref>). This differs from the original protocol that used higher-resolution acrylamide gel extraction since sequencing the amplified library showed only a small portion (&lt;1%) of sequences were outside of the 200+/â5 bp resolution of the acrylamide gel. Ligated products were transformed into bacteria using electroporation and 80â100k colonies were pooled and the plasmid library was extracted. YFP along with 69 bp of the <italic>TSA1</italic> core promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mogno et al., 2013</xref>) was inserted between the CRE and the barcode and then transformed back into bacteria by electroporation. At each step, PCR was used to ensure a low frequency of empty vector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Transformation into yeast</title><p>The reporter gene (YFP) with synthetic CREs and corresponding barcodes were integrated at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). BstBI-digested plasmids were transformed into the Oak strain (YJF186) using the LiAc method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gietz et al., 1995</xref>). We collected ~100k colonies on complete minimal plates without uracil, and integration was confirmed by PCR for 20/20 randomly selected colonies. The yeast strains transformed with intra-specific library were co-cultured with SX6 (YJF1375) in YPD at 30Â°C overnight to allow mating, and HygB and dsdA were used to select diploid cells. The pool of yeast strains transformed with inter-specific library was co-cultured with the <italic>S. uvarum</italic> strain (YJF1450) in YPD overnight at 30Â°C to allow mating. Double selection with nourseothricin and dsdA was used to select diploid cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Full-length promoters</title><p>Three genes, <italic>ALD5</italic>, <italic>GND2,</italic> and <italic>PHO3</italic>, were chosen to compare short- and full-length promoter constructs. Full-length promoters from the Oak (YJF186) and ChII (SX6) strains were amplified from the TSS to the next upstream coding sequence. Four barcodes per construct and restriction sites were incorporated into the primers used for PCR. Each full-length promoter with barcodes was cloned into the pIM202 plasmid and YFP was inserted between the full-length promoter and the barcode. BstBI-digested plasmids were transformed into the Oak strain at the <italic>URA3</italic> locus. Each of the transformed strains were mated with SX6 to form diploids.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>CRE-seq expression measurements</title><p>Pooled libraries were shaken at 250 rpm in 125 mL YPD at 30Â°C with an initial density of 3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Samples of 3Â ÃÂ 10<sup>8</sup> cells were taken for DNA and RNA extraction between 6 hr and 15 hr, which spans the switch from fermentation to respiration. A total of 19 samples were taken for RNA measurements for the intra-specific library, and a total of 27 samples were taken for the inter-specific library. For both libraries, sampling corresponded to the RNA-sequencing timepoints but with more dense sampling for the inter-specific library. For each library, samples were taken for DNA measurements at the first and last timepoints. Cells were centrifuged for 30 s at 1000 g, and the pellets were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen.</p><p>The abundance of each CRE in the library was measured by sequencing the barcodes from DNA, and the expression of each CRE was measured by sequencing the barcodes from RNA extracts. DNA was extracted from the first and the last timepoints using YeaStar Genomic DNA Kit (Zymo Research). RNA was extracted by YeaStar RNA Kit (Zymo Research) and residual DNA digested with DNase (Promega). mRNA was purified by oligo-dT (Invitrogen), and cDNA was made using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). mRNA was removed after first-strand DNA synthesized with RNase H (New England BioLabs). Combinations of indexed Ion Torrent primers were used to amplify barcodes in the library for each timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>) using Phusion High-Fidelity PCR (New England BioLabs). To avoid sampling bias during PCR amplification, each sample was amplified with 4 PCR reactions and 20 cycles and then pooled. PCR pools were gel-extracted and cleaned individually, then pooled together at equivalent concentrations. Libraries were sequenced on an Ion Torrent Proton machine at St. Louis University's Genomics Core Facility.</p><p>After demultiplexing the samples using the indexed Ion Torrent primer pairs, perfect matches to the CRE barcodes were found for 401 and 97 million reads from the intra- and inter-specific libraries. For one sample, three technical replicate libraries was generated (PCR and sequencing). The technical replicates showed an average correlation of 0.96 for barcode counts and were subsequently combined. We removed CREs that had either zero reads in more than a third of the RNA timepoint samples or those with less than 100 reads on average in either the RNA or DNA samples. This filter left 6820 intra-specific and 5013 intra-specific CREs with an average of 16.4 and 3.2 million reads per timepoint and a median of 1278 and 357 reads per barcode across all timepoints for the intra- and inter-specific libraries, respectively. The read count distribution of intra- and inter-specific libraries was normalized using DESeq2âs blind method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Expression of each CRE allele was measured by the ratio of RNA to DNA counts. Barcodes with zero counts were treated as missing data in statistical models.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Identification of significant expression differences</title><p>CRE-seq regions were tested for correlations (Pearson) with RNA-seq using the average expression of all barcodes for a given CRE region. For inter-specific CRE-seq, correlations were measured between the 19 timepoints closest to the RNA-seq timepoints. CREs with significant differences in expression levels and dynamics were tested using the weighted linear model and weighted DurbinâWatson test, respectively. When testing for differences in expression levels using the linear model, we used the average expression across all timepoints for each barcode rather than treating each timepoint as an independent measure of expression levels. We chose this more conservative test to avoid cases where one barcoded CRE had substantially higher or lower expression across all timepoints compared to the other replicate barcodes. Consequently, the power to detect differences in average CRE expression levels based on four barcode replicates was reduced. The test for expression dynamics was not affected by this problem since expression dynamics was measured by changes in the ratio of expression levels over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Identification of variant and chimera differences</title><p>For the intra-specific library, we tested individual variants for those CREs with more than one difference between the Oak and ChII alleles. We used the same weighted tests for differences in expression levels and dynamics, but tested each variant genotype separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). For the inter-specific library, we used the chimeric CREs to map differences to the proximal or distal part of each region showing significant differences between the parental <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic> alleles. The left (distal) and right (proximal) promoter regions were separately tested using the genotype of the left and right portions of the CRE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Parental differences were classified as mapping to the proximal region if the proximal but not the distal genotype was significant. Distal mapping was similarly classified. Chimeric CREs that showed significant differences from both parents were also identified, and subsequently classified as outside or inside the parental range if their average expression distance (Euclidean) to each parent was greater or less than the distance between the two parents, respectively. A flow diagram of the number of CREs tested along with genotypes tests for significant variants and chimeras is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Associations with variant annotations</title><p>Variants were annotated with PhastCons and transcription factor binding site scores. PhastCons scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>) were obtained for yeast from the USCS Genome Browser. Scores were extracted for each SNP, and the average score was obtained for InDels based on the two sites flanking the InDel and any scores within the InDel. Transcription factor binding motifs were obtained for 196 factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Spivak and Stormo, 2012</xref>). For each variant, we extracted 30 bp of sequence from the Oak and ChII genome on either side of the variant. We used Patser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hertz and Stormo, 1999</xref>) to scan each sequence with each motif model and the best hit was recorded. A background nucleotide frequency of 36% GC was used, and scores less than zero (equivalent likelihood between the motif and background model) were set to zero. The difference in score between the two alleles was calculated for each motif model, and the maximum difference across all motif models was used as the binding site annotation score for each variant. PhastCons scores and binding site scores were each tested for association with CRE variants that were positive (nÂ =Â 35), negative (nÂ =Â 35), and all other intergenic variants (nÂ =Â 44,514) by ANOVA.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Feng-Yan Bai for sharing yeast strains and members of the Fay lab for their suggestions and comments.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title><p>Table S1: strains used in this study.

What sets this study apart from previous work is that the authors use hybrids across different genetic distances, separate expression levels and dynamics by sampling across different time points during an environmental shift, and also investigate 3' sequences. The main conclusions confirm that SNPs and InDels both affect gene expression as well as dynamics, and that on average, InDels have larger effects compared to SNPs, especially on expression dynamics. Moreover, the results also reveal negative selection on expression levels, with the effect of some cis mutations compensated by other cis variation, which ultimately results in complex interactions between the different cis-acting polymorphisms. Together, the results further our understanding of how cis sequence variation supports divergence in gene expression levels and dynamics.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article <italic>Cis</italic>-regulatory variants affect gene expression dynamics in yeast&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In general, this is a solid and interesting study. None of the reviewers have suggested additional experiments, but each reviewer did suggest a few tweaks to the data analysis and discussion.</p><p>1. Please consider to also take the effect size into account (i.e. by how much a certain genetic variation affects transcription). This could be done in several ways, the easiest one perhaps by repeating some analysis only for alleles that have a strong influence and comparing the results to the complete dataset.</p><p>2. Reconsider the statistics as suggested by reviewer 3.</p><p>3. Please expand a few sections to improve clarity, as suggested by the different reviewers, including a better discussion of the results in the light of what was already known from previous studies (eg work by Naama Barkai's team) or generally expected (namely that cis variation affects gene expression).</p><p>The individual reviews are found below.

As far as I can tell, all variations are lumped together, irrespective of the magnitude of their effect.

We used the standard deviation rather than the maximum to avoid outlier time-points. From this we see that most differences are small, &lt;5%, but there is a long tail of larger effects.</p><p>To examine how the magnitude of ASE influences the odds ratios we split the data into three equal groups of genes based on the sum of squared deviations from a 0.5 allele frequency. We used this criteria rather than two separate measures for ASE levels and dynamics since the latter would have resulted in comparison of odds ratios from a different set of genes for ASE levels and dynamics. The results from genes with small, medium and large ASE are similar except that InDels are better predictors of dynamics compared to levels for genes with small ASE differences, but InDels have similar predictive ability for genes with large ASE differences. We have now added the analysis of effect size along with a figure (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). We also point out in the discussion that genes with large ASE difference are more likely to exhibit both ASE levels and ASE dynamics, thereby explaining the similar associations.</p><p>Within species there are some large effect genes with only a single upstream variant. However, because we couldn't exclude coding or 3' variants we didn't do any further analysis of these potentially large effect variants.</p><p>In examining the odds ratios for different effect sizes, we noticed subtle differences between the values in Figure 2 and the supporting tables. The original supporting tables have the correct numbers and we have updated Figure 2 accordingly. These differences don't affect our interpretations or conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not sure whether I get Figure 2.

The 3' region is small (80 bp) and may have a higher proportion of functional variants compared to the 5' region, which include all variants between the two genes. Thus, comparison between regions is problematic. We have removed such comparisons from the results and have added this point to the discussion: &quot;the low odds ratios for 5' compared to 3' region SNPs could be a consequence of the size of the region. The small (80 bp) 3' regions may have a higher proportion of functional variants than the larger 5' regions, which likely contain a mixture of large effect promoter variants diluted by more numerous non-functional variants outside of the promoter region.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>At first sight, the novel insight generated by this study might be quite limited?
