heterogeneous and the relative contribution of parasite and host in shaping disease severity remains unclear. We explored the interaction between inflammation and parasite variant surface antigen (VSA) expression, asking whether this relationship underpins the variation observed in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI). We uncovered marked heterogeneity in the host response to blood challenge; some volunteers remained quiescent, others triggered interferon-stimulated inflammation and some showed transcriptional evidence of myeloid cell suppression. Significantly, only inflammatory volunteers experienced hallmark symptoms of malaria. When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease rapidly expand in naive hosts, we found no transcriptional evidence to support this hypothesis. These data indicate that parasite variants that dominate severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, they presumably rely upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment for selection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>falciparum malaria</kwd><kwd>human immune variation</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>var gene switching</kwd><kwd>metabolomics</kwd><kwd>systems immunology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>P. falciparum</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G40270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Milne</surname><given-names>Kathryn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/M003906/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Adam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT206194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Adam J</given-names></name><name><surname>Lotkowska</surname><given-names>Magda E</given-names></name><name><surname>Sankaranarayanan</surname><given-names>Geetha</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanders</surname><given-names>Mandy J</given-names></name><name><surname>Berriman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203783/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Toole</surname><given-names>Aine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104111/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrett</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>106917/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Draper</surname><given-names>Simon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT084226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rowe</surname><given-names>Alexandra</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>107668/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spence</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parasite variants associated with severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage in vivo, which indicates that a change in host environment is required for their selection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There is enormous diversity in the human response to identical immune challenge. This variation is currently being interrogated in large cohorts of healthy volunteers to pinpoint the genetic and non-genetic factors that dictate human immune decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bakker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brodin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Patin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Piasecka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ter Horst et al., 2016</xref>). Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) provides a well-established challenge model in which to examine immune variation in vivo, and heterogeneity in the host response to <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is well-recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roestenberg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yap et al., 2020</xref>). Prior work suggests a dichotomy in immune decision-making with some individuals triggering an inflammatory response, which is characterised by high circulating levels of IFNγ, whilst others mount an alternative response distinguished by the early release of TGFβ and suppression of IFNγ signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">de Jong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harpaz et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Walther et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Walther et al., 2006</xref>). The precise mechanisms underpinning these divergent responses remain unknown.</p><p>Genome-wide transcriptional profiling has the potential to map immune decision-making in unprecedented detail and previous CHMI studies have revealed an upregulation of genes associated with pathogen detection, NFκB activation, and IFNγ signalling consistent with a systemic inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ockenhouse et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tran et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tran et al., 2016</xref>). A transcriptional signature of an alternative immune response has not been described in naive hosts. Nevertheless, these prior studies were primarily designed to measure shared or common signatures of infection, potentially masking variation between volunteers. Only one study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Burel et al., 2017</xref>) has specifically investigated transcriptional variation in CHMI and it reported two distinct outcomes based on host microRNA profiles; notably, the authors were able to correlate the induction of three specific miRNAs with a lower parasite burden suggesting that events early in infection may have important downstream consequences. Identifying the sources of immune variation may therefore reveal some of the factors that underpin the clinical heterogeneity of falciparum malaria. In this context, direct intravenous challenge with blood-stage parasites provides a unique opportunity to assess the contribution of host-intrinsic mechanisms of variation as it ensures all volunteers receive an identical immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Duncan and Draper, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The potential role of parasite factors in influencing immune variation has not yet been explored in CHMI. Expression of a subset of parasite variant surface antigens (VSA) known as group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes is associated with severe malaria in both children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Duffy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jespersen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kyriacou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lavstsen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tonkin-Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Warimwe et al., 2012</xref>). These virulence-associated genes encode PfEMP1 adhesion molecules that mediate sequestration of infected red cells in the microvasculature. Group A/DC8-expressing parasites are thought to be more pathogenic than those expressing other <italic>var</italic> types (groups B and C) and can bind the endothelium with high affinity in sensitive sites, such as brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jensen et al., 2020</xref>). It is unknown whether expression of these variants can influence the immune response, for example by causing dysregulated activation that leads to widespread collateral tissue damage. Or conversely, whether inflammation might preferentially support the survival and expansion of these variants by upregulating their binding sites on the endothelium.</p><p>It has been observed in previous CHMI studies that parasites transcribe a broad array of <italic>var</italic> genes in naive hosts, with predominant expression of group B variants and no marked differences between volunteers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we have shown that mosquitoes reset malaria parasites to ensure diverse expression of their VSA repertoire at the start of the blood cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spence et al., 2013</xref>). It therefore remains unclear how group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes come to dominate the PfEMP1 landscape in severe malaria. Antibody-mediated clearance of parasites expressing group B variants is a possible explanation, but is unlikely because severe malaria develops in hosts with low or absent immunity during their first few infections of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>). It has instead been suggested that parasites expressing group A/DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes rapidly and preferentially expand because they have an intrinsic growth and/or survival advantage in naive hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bull et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jensen et al., 2004</xref>). This may be a consequence of enhanced cytoadherence (reducing their mechanical clearance in the spleen), rosetting (increasing their re-invasion efficiency) or specificity for tissues that are better able to support their maturation (decreasing cycle length). This explanation is widely accepted but is not based on substantial evidence.</p><p>In this study, we have used a blood challenge model to investigate host-intrinsic variation in the immune response to falciparum malaria and examined the interplay between parasite and host factors in shaping outcome of infection. This model has the advantage that an identical immune challenge is given to all volunteers and furthermore transcriptional profiling can be carried out on parasites at the start and end of infection to track changes in VSA expression through time. We set out to test the specific hypotheses that <bold>a</bold>, expression of group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes would preferentially increase as the infection progressed and <bold>b</bold>, there would be a measurable relationship between inflammation and parasite VSA expression, which would shape the clinical outcome of infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immune variation in falciparum malaria</title><p>To explore host-intrinsic variation in the immune response to <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, a cohort of 14 malaria-naive volunteers were infected with an equal number of blood-stage parasites (clone 3D7) by direct intravenous inoculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This enabled the pathogenic blood cycle to be initiated in every volunteer within a 30-min window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Payne et al., 2016</xref>). Systemic changes in the host response were then captured through time by transcriptionally profiling whole blood every 48 hr from the day before infection until the day of diagnosis (the point of drug treatment). This time-point varied between volunteers, occurring 7.5–10.5 days post-infection when two out of three diagnostic criteria were met (positive thick blood smear and/or parasite density &gt;500 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup> by qPCR and/or symptoms consistent with malaria). To reveal the diversity of responses within our cohort, each volunteer's time-course was analysed independently by tracking their dynamic changes in gene expression as the infection progressed. Importantly, this approach does not assume shared features between individuals, nor does it bias against uncommon (or rare) responses.</p><p>As a first step, we measured the variance of every gene through time and visualised the 100 protein-coding genes with highest variance in each volunteer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). To control for baseline variation in gene expression, uninfected control volunteers were also analysed. We found that variance in one third of infected volunteers (4/14) was comparable to the uninfected control group, suggesting these four volunteers did not respond to infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To explore this further, we merged the top 100 gene lists from all infected volunteers to produce a single non-redundant list of the most dynamically expressed protein-coding genes across the cohort (n = 517 unique genes, henceforth called the 517-gene superset); we could then directly compare the transcriptional response between individuals. Accordingly, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) of these genes through time, and for each volunteer we determined the Euclidean distance travelled to quantify the magnitude of their response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Using the variance and distance travelled metrics, we then set two thresholds to identify volunteers that triggered a measurable response to blood challenge (see Materials and methods); four volunteers failed to cross both thresholds (v018, v012, v208, and v020) and were therefore grouped and labelled unresponsive. A pairwise comparison between the diagnosis and pre-infection samples obtained from these four volunteers confirmed that there were zero differentially expressed genes in this group (adj p&lt;0.05). Immune quiescence is therefore a common outcome of controlled human malaria infection.</p><p>In contrast, variance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) and distance travelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) both suggested that the remaining 10 volunteers made a robust response to infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). And when we clustered and visualised the 517-gene superset expression data we found that these volunteers could separate easily into two groups according to whether they up- or downregulated gene expression at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>). Based on this observation, we grouped the eight volunteers who upregulated gene clusters 2 and 4 and performed a pairwise comparison between their diagnosis and pre-infection samples; we uncovered 2028 differentially expressed genes (adj p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). To gain insight into the biological functions of this response, we used ClueGO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mlecnik et al., 2014</xref>) to first identify the significant GO terms associated with these genes and then place them into a functionally organised non-redundant gene ontology network. ClueGO uncovered 217 GO terms across 34 functional groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>); the most significant groups related to interferon signalling, activation of myeloid cells, production of inflammatory molecules, and activation of T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–b</xref>). These terms all indicate systemic interferon-stimulated inflammation (a well-described host response to malaria in mouse and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Montes de Oca et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spaulding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yu et al., 2016</xref>]) and we therefore labeled this group inflammatory. We then biologically validated ClueGO’s in silico finding by measuring the plasma concentrations of two interferon-stimulated chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10. These chemokines are primarily produced by myeloid cells and specifically function to recruit and activate T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Groom and Luster, 2011</xref>).

Whilst blood challenge uses a recently mosquito-transmitted parasite line (&lt; 3 blood cycles from liver egress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>]) this model nevertheless bypasses the skin and liver stages, which have been proposed to elicit regulatory mechanisms that could modify the subsequent immune response to blood-stage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guilbride et al., 2010</xref>). We therefore inoculated five additional malaria-naive volunteers with the same parasite genotype but this time by the natural route of infection, mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). As before, we transcriptionally profiled whole blood from the day before infection until diagnosis (day 11), including the final day of liver-stage infection (day 6). And once more, every volunteer was analysed independently this time using EdgeR to identify highly dispersed genes within each time-course (see Materials and methods). After merging these lists, we produced a single non-redundant list of the most dynamically expressed genes across the mosquito challenge cohort (n = 117 unique genes, henceforth called the 117-gene superset) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). When we clustered and visualised the expression data within this superset we found that 116 out of 117 genes were upregulated exclusively during the blood cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). And when we examined the biological functions of these genes ClueGO identified response to interferon gamma (GO: 0034341) as the most significantly enriched GO term (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>). Notably, this was also the most significant GO term in inflammatory volunteers infected by blood challenge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), indicating concordance between the two infection models. In agreement, 19 of the 21 genes that displayed the highest fold change in inflammatory volunteers (blood challenge) were also upregulated in the 117-gene superset (mosquito challenge, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>). And at protein level, high circulating levels of CXCL10 were detectable at diagnosis in four of the five volunteers infected by mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Our data therefore demonstrate that interferon-stimulated inflammation is the dominant human response to blood-stage parasites regardless of the route of infection. Furthermore, our data fail to provide compelling evidence of a systemic transcriptional response to liver-stage infection in human malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that the pre-erythrocytic-stages of infection may have a limited role in shaping the immune response during the pathogenic blood cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Systemic inflammation coincides with the onset of clinical symptoms</title><p>We therefore moved on to investigate the factors that influence human immune variation in the blood challenge model and the consequences of these divergent paths. In the first instance, we asked whether the rate of parasite replication could shape the host response to infection; after all, a simple assumption might be that inflammation is triggered by fast-growing parasites. The parasite multiplication rate (PMR, modelled from the qPCR data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Payne et al., 2016</xref>]) varied considerably between volunteers (range 6.7–12.8) despite every individual receiving an equal number of infected red cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, the parasite multiplication rate of the inflammatory group was not significantly different to that of unresponsive or suppressor hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>) and therefore appears to have little bearing on the outcome of immune decision-making. Inflammatory volunteers did, however, tend to have a longer course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) and hence the parasite burden at diagnosis was higher for the inflammatory group (median 30,309 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>, range 9133–273,247) than the rest of the cohort (median 7899 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>, range 1440–19,670) (Mann Whitney test, p=0.02). Parasite burden may therefore promote an inflammatory response in this challenge model but cannot fully explain it; for example, 2/4 unresponsive volunteers (v018 and v020) had parasite densities that were comparable to 4/8 inflammatory volunteers at diagnosis (v017, v027, v026, and v106, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our data therefore support previous observations that the parasite density threshold required to trigger inflammation is highly variable between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gatton and Cheng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Molineaux et al., 2002</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Systemic inflammation coincides with the onset of clinical symptoms.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Parasite growth curves colour-coded by host response; each line represents one volunteer.

When we then calculated a cumulative clinical score for each volunteer (by summing all adverse events throughout infection) we found a strong positive correlation between symptoms and the intensity of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In contrast, there was no correlation between clinical score and parasite multiplication rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We then measured circulating levels of Angiopoietin-2, a biomarker of endothelium dysfunction and indicator of disease severity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yeo et al., 2008</xref>); only one volunteer displayed elevated levels of Angiopoietin-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>) and this individual was the most inflammatory host in the cohort (based on upregulation of plasma CXCL10 and IFNγ). What's more, haematological analysis revealed that only inflammatory volunteers experienced acute lymphopenia, a conserved hallmark of clinical malaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c–d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hviid et al., 1997</xref>). Symptomatology is therefore not driven by the rate of parasite replication in controlled human malaria infection. Instead, clinical outcome seems to depend upon the intensity of inflammation, which varies widely between hosts.</p><p>In light of these findings, we examined the potential impact of inflammation on host metabolism to better resolve the consequences of immune variation. Here, we used an LC-MS-based metabolomics platform to measure changes in circulating metabolites during infection, and applied range-scaling to ensure all metabolites (and their temporal fluctuations) were equally weighted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van den Berg et al., 2006</xref>). When we compared the three most inflammatory and symptomatic volunteers to unresponsive and suppressor hosts we could find no metabolic signature of inflammation that was robust to multiple testing (zero metabolites with an FDR-corrected p value &lt; 0.1). On the other hand, if we simply considered all volunteers as a single group and compared their post-infection time-points (day 8 and diagnosis) against pre-infection samples we could identify a conserved and persistent signature of blood-stage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). This was characterised by increased adenosine (promotes vasodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ralevic and Dunn, 2015</xref>]), choline depletion (supports parasite membrane synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Witola and Ben Mamoun, 2007</xref>]) and reduced lysoPC (induces gametocytogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brancucci et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>]).

In the first instance, we examined the hierarchy of <italic>var</italic> gene expression in the inoculum used for blood challenge; this derived from a single malaria-infected volunteer infected by mosquito bite and was cryopreserved ex vivo (without culture) after just three cycles of asexual replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>). Although each individual blood-stage parasite will only transcribe a single <italic>var</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Freitas-Junior et al., 2005</xref>) the parasite population as a whole can express many different variants within a host.

Blood challenge provides a unique opportunity to directly test this hypothesis as it increases the number of asexual replication cycles over which variant switching and selection can take place (cf. mosquito challenge [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Draper et al., 2018</xref>)]). Parasites were therefore isolated from volunteers infected by blood challenge and processed immediately (without culture) for RNA-sequencing; after six cycles of replication, the expression hierarchy of <italic>var</italic> genes was essentially unchanged from that observed in the inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Indeed, the group B <italic>var</italic> gene PF3D7_1041300 remained the most highly expressed variant in every volunteer, and transcription of group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes remained low or undetectable at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Surprisingly, this included the virulence-associated brain endothelial cell binding variant PF3D7_0400400, which was transcribed at the start of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We could further highlight the significance of this result by looking only at intron-spanning reads, which must derive from functional <italic>var</italic> gene transcripts (rather than regulatory antisense transcripts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amit-Avraham et al., 2015</xref>). We found that PF3D7_0400400 was functionally transcribed in the inoculum but intron-spanning reads were absent in all volunteer samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis (using DESeq2) then confirmed that no <italic>var</italic> gene was more highly transcribed at the end of infection as compared to the start (adj p&lt;0.01). Evidently, there was no preferential expansion of group A or DC8 variants within the time-frame of this study.</p><p>When we expanded our analysis to include <italic>rifin</italic> genes we still could find no evidence of gene switching or selection. Indeed, the only <italic>rifin</italic> that was differentially expressed at diagnosis (PF3D7_0401600, log2 fold-change = 7.59, adj p=0.0002) was already dominantly transcribed at the start of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). It should be noted, however, that ex vivo RNA-sequencing (ideal for <italic>var</italic> gene analysis as whole blood contains mainly ring-stage parasites) is less suited to <italic>rifins</italic>, which are predominantly transcribed at later stages of the parasite life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kyes et al., 2000</xref>). We therefore moved on to directly test the relationship between inflammation and parasite VSA expression. Once again, we used DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed parasite genes but this time between inflammatory volunteers and the rest of the cohort. There were no differentially expressed <italic>var</italic> or <italic>rifin</italic> genes (adj p&lt;0.01). In fact, only one differentially expressed gene could be identified (<italic>Pfck1</italic>) - this gene encodes casein kinase one and was more highly transcribed in the inflammatory group (PF3D7_1136500, log2 fold-change = 7.32, adj p=0.002). The diverse clinical outcomes observed in this trial cannot therefore be easily explained by variation in parasite gene expression; instead, they must largely originate from host-intrinsic immune variation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we set out to map immune variation in falciparum malaria and explore the interplay between parasite and host factors in shaping outcome of infection. Of particular interest was how group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes, which are associated with severe malaria in children and adults, come to dominate infections when parasites egress from the liver expressing mainly group B and C <italic>var</italic> genes. One leading hypothesis is that group A/DC8 variants have an intrinsic growth and/or survival advantage leading to their rapid expansion in naive hosts. To directly test this hypothesis, we developed methodology that allowed us to measure <italic>var</italic> gene expression across 10 days of infection in a human blood challenge model. Surprisingly, we found no transcriptional evidence for the preferential expansion of group A or DC8 variants. These data indicate that other factors (such as inflammation, tissue damage, or endothelium activation) must be required to promote the selection of these variants in hosts that develop severe disease. We also found that the diverse outcomes of controlled human malaria infection must largely originate from host-intrinsic variation as just one differentially expressed parasite gene could be identified between volunteers that trigger systemic inflammation (leading to hallmark symptoms of clinical malaria) and those that remain asymptomatic (by preventing or delaying the acute phase response). Taken together, these data emphasise the importance of the human host in determining their own fate.</p><p>This conclusion is well supported by epidemiological studies showing that the clinical manifestations of severe malaria depend upon host age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dondorp et al., 2008</xref>) and children learn to tolerate high parasite densities, which could otherwise cause life-threatening disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ademolue et al., 2017</xref>). As such, we must understand the rules of immune decision-making if we want to uncouple mechanisms of pathology versus tolerance. In this study, we identified at least three possible early outcomes of blood-stage infection. The most likely outcome is interferon-stimulated inflammation, which is characterised by activation of myeloid cells and systemic release of inflammatory molecules. Notably, only inflammatory volunteers developed hallmark signs and symptoms of malaria (e.g. pyrexia and lymphopenia) providing further support for the idea that inflammation causes the earliest manifestations of disease. It is often assumed that the flip-side to this cost is immediate or early control of parasite burden and yet we find that the parasite multiplication rate of the inflammatory group is comparable to all other volunteers. It therefore appears that we might need to re-assess the role of innate immunity in the first hours and days of the pathogenic blood cycle – rather than serving as an early brake on parasite replication it may be that systemic inflammation primarily functions to switch bone marrow production in favour of myelopoiesis and mobilise the required effector cells to the spleen.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that blood-stage parasites first trigger interferon signalling in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spaulding et al., 2016</xref>) and the transcriptional changes we observe in whole blood are thus likely to be a signature of activated monocytes and neutrophils trafficking from bone marrow to spleen. Furthermore, the major secreted products of this emergency myeloid response (CXCL9 and CXCL10) specifically recruit T cells out of the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Groom and Luster, 2011</xref>). The innate response to malaria therefore quickly re-structures and co-localises key strands of the immune system; whether this leads to an effective response that can limit parasite burden and minimise collateral damage will depend upon the outcome of cell-cell circuits in the spleen. Measuring the activation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells – the key orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunity – would provide a downstream readout of these critical tissue-specific interactions in human volunteers. Unfortunately, we cannot begin to examine these outcomes in our current datasets because at our final time-point (diagnosis) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are still sequestered in the tissue. Nevertheless, future studies could extend sampling beyond drug treatment to analyse resolution of the acute phase response and examine the heterogeneity between volunteers in T cell profiles as they are released back into the circulation. Due to the inherent adaptive plasticity of human T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sallusto et al., 2018</xref>), this is likely to reveal much greater variation between hosts in their response to a first malaria episode.</p><p>A second common outcome of infection in this study was immune quiescence. Although the course of infection tended to be shorter in unresponsive volunteers than the others this could not fully explain their lack of response to blood challenge. After all, half of unresponsive volunteers (2/4) had parasite densities comparable to half of the inflammatory group (4/8). And furthermore, v017 triggered a measurable inflammatory response at just 157 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>, whereas v018 remained unresponsive at 20,000 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>. These observations are entirely in-line with meta-analysis of historical malariotherapy data that measured the pyrogenic threshold in falciparum malaria as spanning more than four-orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Molineaux et al., 2002</xref>). Immune variation therefore dictates how you respond and when. Pushing up the pyrogenic threshold to disarm emergency myelopoiesis is a well-recognised host adaptation that promotes immune quiescence and allows individuals to transition from clinical to asymptomatic malaria (usually in adolescence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gatton and Cheng, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Portugal et al., 2014</xref>). This is helpful if you have developed partial humoral immunity that can restrict total pathogen load but whether a pre-existing high threshold is advantageous in a naive host is unclear. This could indicate a natural tendency towards disease tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>) or it may simply delay the time until an emergency myeloid response inevitably has to be triggered. Indeed, it remains a possibility that all naive hosts (including those that initially suppress genes involved in myeloid cell activation) will eventually converge on interferon-stimulated inflammation as the infection progresses. After all, every volunteer increased their circulating levels of adenosine as part of a shared metabolic response to blood-stage infection and adenosine is a potent paracrine inhibitor of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Faas et al., 2017</xref>). This metabolic switch may therefore represent a hardwired mechanism of self-regulation because systemic inflammation is an unavoidable fate in naive hosts.</p><p>We also examined the in vivo relationship between inflammation and parasite VSA expression, asking whether this could shape the clinical outcome of controlled human malaria infection. We confirmed the previous finding that group B <italic>var</italic> genes, which encode PfEMP1 variants associated with uncomplicated malaria, are dominantly expressed in human volunteers infected by mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bachmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bachmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). The unique features of the blood challenge model then allowed us to examine the widely held belief that variants associated with severe disease rapidly and preferentially expand in naive hosts. Unexpectedly, we found no evidence to support this hypothesis. In fact, we found limited transcriptional evidence of <italic>var</italic> gene switching or selection over six cycles of replication. This is in contrast to a previous study that suggested <italic>var</italic> gene expression changes within the first few days of blood-stage infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lavstsen et al., 2005</xref>). However, in that study parasites were isolated from volunteers and then placed into culture for one month before <italic>var</italic> gene profiling – switching may therefore have occurred in vitro confounding interpretation of these data. Our study, which measured <italic>var</italic> gene expression ex vivo, avoids any bias introduced by culturing parasites but nevertheless has limitations that require careful consideration. In particular, we have studied a single parasite genotype in a small number of hosts over a short window of infection. The potential for these factors to explain the absence of <italic>var</italic> gene switching/selection are considered below.</p><p>This study (and most previous CHMI trials) used the 3D7 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> clone or its parent line NF54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stanisic et al., 2018</xref>). The 3D7 clone was cultured for many years before preparation of the inoculum used for blood challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 1997</xref>) and could have acquired mutations that affect its behaviour in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claessens et al., 2017</xref>). This could theoretically include a reduced capacity to switch <italic>var</italic> gene expression; direct experimental evidence that the 3D7 parasites used in this study have retained their ability to switch would therefore strengthen our conclusions. Nevertheless, in the absence of these data it is notable that a previous study using the same 3D7 inoculum clearly showed <italic>var</italic> gene switching when parasites recovered from volunteers were returned to culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Peters et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, in our mosquito challenge cohort there was considerable variation between volunteers in which group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes were highly transcribed, indicating that 3D7 has retained its potential to express a wide range of virulence-associated variants. Overall, we consider it possible, but unlikely, that our data can be explained by a mutation in 3D7 that affects <italic>var</italic> gene switching. A more interesting possibility is that parasite genotypes may vary in their capacity to switch towards group A or DC8 variants. Additional parasite genotypes are being developed for CHMI that would allow this hypothesis to be tested in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moser et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stanisic et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility is that 3D7 might only switch towards group A/DC8 variants in a minority of hosts. Indeed, in endemic settings the frequency of severe disease is low (around 1% of all clinical episodes) and the small number of volunteers in this study would be unlikely to capture a rare event. Nevertheless, it is clear that the incidence of severe malaria is much higher in naive hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marsh and Snow, 1997</xref>). And moreover, naive hosts in endemic areas are generally infants and young children who are much less susceptible to severe disease than naive adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baird et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baird et al., 1998</xref>). In CHMI, we are therefore recruiting those individuals who are most likely to develop life-threatening complications in the absence of drug treatment; we can therefore reasonably expect that severe disease would not have been a rare outcome of infection in our two cohorts of volunteers. As such, it is unlikely that a different pattern of <italic>var</italic> gene switching would have been observed if a larger number of volunteers were examined, but this cannot be excluded. An alternative explanation is that a parasite density threshold needs to be crossed to promote <italic>var</italic> gene switching in vivo, and this threshold is not reached in controlled human malaria infection. In support of this argument, parasite density is known to be an important factor in severe malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dondorp et al., 2005</xref>) and this effect could potentially be mediated by quorum sensing, which operates in trypanasomes to control their virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rojas et al., 2019</xref>). However, no external signals that can cause <italic>var</italic> gene switching have yet been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deitsch and Dzikowski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guizetti and Scherf, 2013</xref>).</p><p>How then do group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes become predominantly transcribed in patients with severe malaria? The most plausible explanation for our data is that the short duration of CHMI does not allow enough time for the selection of these variants, and that this would have been observed if drug treatment was withheld. However, the preferential expansion of group A/DC8 variants would need to occur rapidly because at the mean parasite multiplication rate of 10 seen in this study only 2–3 more cycles of replication would have been required for some volunteers to reach parasite burdens at which severe disease can occur (5000 parasites μl<sup>−1</sup> or 0.1% parasitaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Field, 1949</xref>]). <italic>Var</italic> gene switching rates of culture-adapted parasites are low in vitro (estimated mean on-rates of 0.025–3% per generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Horrocks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roberts et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Ye et al., 2015</xref>]) and although mathematical modelling suggests the possibility of higher switching rates in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gatton et al., 2003</xref>) experimental data are lacking. We therefore propose that rather than a sudden increase in the rate of switching an environmental change instead leads to the rapid selection of variants associated with severe disease – this could include systemic inflammation, collateral tissue damage, metabolic disturbance and/or endothelium activation. In this scenario, group A and DC8 variants have no intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, their preferential expansion in naive hosts relies upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment. The responsibility for severe malaria is therefore likely shared between parasite and host.</p><p>In theory, inflammation will lead to the selection of parasites expressing group A and DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes because of cytokine-mediated upregulation of endothelial receptors such as ICAM-1, which is upregulated in response to TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernabeu et al., 2019</xref>). This is predicted to enhance their cytoadherence and reduce mechanical clearance in the spleen, as compared to parasites expressing group B and C <italic>var</italic> genes that bind only CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). In our study, there was no evidence for increased transcription of group A or DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes in volunteers who showed clear clinical, transcriptional, and biochemical evidence of inflammation. However, circulating levels of plasma TNF had not yet increased at diagnosis and so more time is clearly required for interferon signalling to drive the cytokine cascades necessary to activate endothelial cells. One argument against an essential role for inflammation is that Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR), currently thought to be a key receptor for cytoadherence in cerebral malaria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Turner et al., 2013</xref>), is downregulated on microvascular endothelial cells exposed to inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernabeu et al., 2019</xref>). The role of EPCR as a receptor for infected red cell binding remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azasi et al., 2018</xref>) but if EPCR does prove to be a major host receptor for sequestration then selection of dual-binders that also interact with ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lennartz et al., 2017</xref>) would be expected in an inflammatory environment. One other intriguing finding that emerged from our analysis was that parasites from inflammatory volunteers express higher levels of <italic>Pfck1</italic> – a serine-threonine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cheong and Virshup, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>) that has been shown to regulate pathogen virulence in leishmaniasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dan-Goor et al., 2013</xref>) and toxoplasmosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2016</xref>), and which may be able to directly regulate type I interferon signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). If this observation could be validated in a separate study it would identify a possible mechanism through which malaria parasites may in turn attempt to influence the host response to infection. CHMI trials that follow volunteers for one or two more blood cycles would be required to explore the consequences of increased <italic>Pfck1</italic> transcription and of prolonged systemic inflammation, and consideration should be given as to whether this can be done safely.</p><p>To complement the study of <italic>var</italic> gene switching and selection in naive hosts, future work should also aim to examine the neutralisation of parasite variants associated with severe disease in semi-immune adults. Immunity to severe malaria can be acquired early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gonçalves et al., 2014</xref>) and so will require the rapid production of cross-reactive antibodies that recognise and eliminate group A and DC8 variants if these are sufficient to cause life-threatening disease. Whether antibodies can effectively neutralise these variants in vivo remains to be directly shown, but the RNA-sequencing methodology that we developed for this study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.brgjm3un">https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.brgjm3un</ext-link>) now allows transcriptional profiling of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> at ultra-low densities – indeed, we can spike just 2000 ring-stage parasites into 50 ml whole blood and map their complete VSA profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Applying this methodology to CHMI in an endemic setting would therefore allow switching and selection to be tracked under immune pressure in volunteers that can restrict and slow parasite replication.</p><p>In summary, our study failed to provide compelling transcriptional evidence that parasite variants associated with severe disease rapidly and preferentially expand in vivo. Our data do not therefore support the hypothesis that group A and DC8 variants have an intrinsic growth and/or survival advantage in naive hosts. This leaves open the question as to how these variants come to dominate severe episodes of malaria when parasites egress from the liver expressing mainly group B and C <italic>var</italic> genes. We propose that infection-induced changes in the host environment (including inflammation) can rapidly select for parasites with a higher efficiency to cytoadhere, sequester and cause severe disease. Notably, our study uncovered marked variation between volunteers in their innate response to blood-stage parasites, which might explain why not all clinical episodes lead to severe malaria.

Raw array data in the form of compressed CEL files were processed in the R environment using Bioconductor packages (oligo, pd.hta.2.0, affy) to generate an HTAFeatureSet object (gene level). After visual inspection for QC purposes, raw and normalised (using the rma() function of the affy package or normalizeQuantiles() function from the limma Bioconductor package, as appropriate) versions of the intensities were retained for subsequent analyses.

Plots of the first two dimensions were generated using the standard plot() function of the graphics package. To measure the magnitude of each volunteer's immune response we calculated the Euclidean distance travelled along principal component 1, as this accounted for almost all of the variance in every time-course.

This figure had to be at least 1.5-fold higher than the mean of the four uninfected controls (i.e. 1.5 × 0.202 = <bold>0.303</bold>). Second, the distance travelled in each volunteer's PCA plot of the 517-gene superset had to be greater than two standard deviations above the mean of the four uninfected controls (i.e. 2.67 + (2 × 1.102)=<bold>4.874</bold>). Volunteers had to pass both thresholds in order to be classified as responsive; those who failed one or both of these tests (v018, v012, v208, and v020) were classified as unresponsive. The remaining volunteers were then grouped into inflammatory (v016, v017, v013, v027, v026, v206, v106, and v024) or suppressor (v022 and v019) hosts based on their upregulation of clusters 2 and 4 or downregulation of clusters 1 and 3, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Note that globin depletion was not performed; instead, sequencing was carried out to sufficient depth that the globin reads (accounting for no more than 20% of any given sample) could simply be discarded during data processing. Read counts per gene were quantified against the Gencode human v28 basic transcript sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Frankish et al., 2019</xref>) using Kallisto v0.42.3 (92).

Next, the lists of highly dispersed genes in each of the five volunteers infected by mosquito bite were merged to create a non-redundant set of 226 unique genes, which were used for clustering with hclust in the pheatmap R package. This identified a single major cluster comprising 117 unique genes that was taken forward for downstream analyses (e.g. plotting the 117-gene superset and ClueGO). Note that to visualise and cluster the 226 unique genes and the 117-gene superset, read counts across the entire dataset were normalised using rlogs (blind=TRUE) in DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Love et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Gene ontology analysis and networks (ClueGO)</title><sec id="s4-12-1"><title>Blood challenge</title><p>The list of 2028 genes differentially expressed at diagnosis in the inflammatory group was imported into ClueGO v2.5.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bindea et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mlecnik et al., 2014</xref>).

Each of the 34 functional groups was assigned a unique colour and a network was then generated using an edge-weighted spring-embedded layout based on kappa score. To provide an overview of the inflammatory response we then labelled the leading GO term in the top 12 functional groups, as follows: groups were first ordered by adj p value; starting with the most significant group we chose the level 4 GO term with the highest significance and made this the group name; we then moved on to the next most significant group and again chose the level 4 GO term with the highest significance as group name; we repeated this process until 12 groups had been named. Note that there were two exceptions to these rules: first, if there was not a level 4 GO term within a group then this group was excluded (to avoid naming groups that were too broad or specific in ascribing function); and second, if the most significant level 4 GO term was shared with a group already named then this GO term was excluded and the group was instead named after the next most significant level 4 GO term (to avoid redundancy).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12-2"><title>Mosquito challenge</title><p>The 117-gene superset was imported into ClueGO to identify the significant GO terms associated with these genes.

All samples and standards were background-corrected by subtracting the mean OD measured in blank wells containing only assay diluent.

All samples and controls were background-corrected by subtracting the mean OD measured in substrate blank wells. Samples were scored positive if their absorbance value was &gt; 10% above the mean absorbance value of the CMV IgG cut-off control.

Samples were prepared by diluting 25 μl of plasma in 1000 μl of 4°C (HPLC-grade) chloroform/methanol/water at a 1:2:1 ratio. Samples were then vortexed for 5 min and spun at 13,000xg for 3 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and stored in cryovials at −80°C ready for downstream processing. LC-MS-based metabolomics analyses were conducted at Glasgow Polyomics. Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 RSLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) using a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm column from Merck Sequant). For each sample, a 10 μl volume was injected into the system. Samples were maintained at 5°C prior to injection. The column was kept at 30°C throughout the analysis and samples were eluted with a linear gradient (from 20% 20 mM ammonium carbonate in water (A) and 80% acetonitrile (B) to 80% A and 20% B) at a flowrate of 300 μl/min over 24 min. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed on a Thermo Orbitrap QExactive operated in polarity-switching ionisation mode with the following parameters: resolution of 70,000; automated gain control of 106; m/z range of 70–1,050; sheath gas flowrate of 40 arbitrary units (au); auxiliary gas flowrate of 5 au; sweep gas flowrate of 1 au; probe temperature of 150°C and capillary temperature of 320°C. The parameters for positive mode ionisation were as follows: source voltage +3.8 kV, S-Lens RF Level 30.00, S-Lens Voltage −25.00 V, Skimmer Voltage −15.00 V, Inject Flatapole Offset −8.00 V, Bent Flatapole DC −6.00 V. For negative mode ionisation, a source voltage of −3.8 kV was used. Volunteer samples were run alongside three mixes of authentic standards (total number: 248) involved in various metabolic pathways to facilitate metabolite identification based on exact mass and retention time. Fragmentation of the top 20 ions was performed with the following parameters: collision energy: 25%; isolation window: 1.2; dynamic exclusion after one time; exclusion duration: 6s; exclude isotopes: true; and minimum intensity: 5000. LC-MS raw data were processed with IDEOM (using default parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Creek et al., 2012</xref>]), which uses the XCMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 2006</xref>) and mzMatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Scheltema et al., 2011</xref>) software in the R environment. The levels of reliability of the spectral assignment to metabolites, as defined by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sumner et al., 2007</xref>), are as follows: 'MSI:1 (identified metabolites)' – high-resolution mass (three ppm) and retention time (5%) matched to an authentic standard and 'MSI:2 (putatively annotated compounds)' – high-resolution mass matched to a public library (three ppm). Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to generate fragmentation spectra, which were further exported into mzCloud to search for compounds in the database with matching spectra.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Metabolomics data processing and analysis</title><p>Metabolite intensities were log2 transformed and intensity ratios were calculated as the fold-change in metabolite abundance at day 8 or diagnosis relative to pre-infection. A pairwise comparison (t-test) between post- and pre-infection samples was then carried out for every metabolite and p values were adjusted for multiple testing by applying a false discovery rate (FDR). Differentially abundant metabolites were called using an FDR threshold of 0.1 and an intensity ratio equivalent to a 1.5-fold change in abundance. A volcano plot showing the intensity ratios and FDR-corrected p values of all metabolites was generated using ggplot2. Next, the differentially abundant metabolites were range-scaled according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van den Berg et al., 2006</xref> and a heatmap of range-scaled intensity values was generated using the gplots R package. Here range-scaling is used to make every metabolite equally important by scaling the intensity of each metabolite relative to its own biological range across all samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Isolation of parasites for ex vivo RNA-sequencing</title><p>A step-by-step guide to our ultra-low density RNA-sequencing methodology for human malaria parasites is available at protocols.io (dx.doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.brgjm3un).</p><sec id="s4-18-1"><title>Blood challenge</title><p>50 ml whole blood was drawn into lithium heparin vacutainers at diagnosis (immediately before drug treatment) and white cells were removed by passing the blood through a leucoflex LXT filter (Macopharma). The flow-through was collected into a 250 ml centrifuge bottle (with silicone O-ring) and the filter was washed with 200 ml PBS to maximise recovery of infected red cells. The flow-through was spun at 1000xg for 10 min at room temperature with brake off and the supernatant carefully aspirated (being careful not to disturb the pelleted red cells). The red cells were gently agitated to resuspend and then lysed by addition of 200 ml ice-cold saponin at 0.015% in PBS (w/v). The cell suspension was incubated on ice for 10 min and then spun at 15,000xg for 10 min at 4°C with brake off to pellet the free parasites. The supernatant was slowly aspirated being very careful not to disturb the pelleted parasites, which were then gently resuspended in 1 ml ice-cold PBS and transferred to a 1.5 ml tube. The parasites were pelleted by centrifugation at 16,000xg for 5 min at 4°C in a microfuge and two sequential washes were performed with 1 ml ice-cold PBS to remove free globin. After the final spin, the parasite pellet was resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol, incubated in a 37°C water bath for 5 min and snap-frozen on dry ice.

Briefly, parasites were cultured and synchronised to ring-stage using 5% sorbitol, and the first mock sample was prepared by spiking 2000 parasites into 50 ml whole blood (40 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>). The second mock sample was prepared by spiking 8000 parasites into 20 ml whole blood (400 parasites ml<sup>−1</sup>). These parasite densities were chosen to represent the likely burden in the first and second blood cycle after liver egress in volunteers infected by mosquito bite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Roestenberg et al., 2012</xref>).

RNA purification was then carried out using the RNA Clean and Concentrator kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions (Zymo Research). RNA was eluted in 14 μl DEPC-treated water and quantified by nanodrop; quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with RNA 6000 pico chips. A RIN value above 7.0 was accepted as sufficiently high-quality RNA for downstream steps. Samples were then DNase-treated and depleted of globin and ribosomal RNA with the Globin-Zero Gold kit (Illumina), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For samples with less than 1 μg RNA (the recommended starting material) reagent volumes were downscaled for low-input methodology (as described in the kit). After removal of globin and ribosomal RNA, the remaining RNA was precipitated overnight at 4°C in 600 μl absolute ethanol, 18 μl sodium acetate (3M), and 2 μl linear acrylamide (5 mg/ml). The RNA was then pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000xg for 20 min at 4°C and washed two times with 75% ethanol. Samples were air-dried for 5 min and the RNA was dissolved in 12 μl DEPC-treated water by heating to 65°C for 5 min.

The two inoculum samples (blood challenge) were not pooled and thus provide technical replicates of a single biological sample. Data from the mosquito and blood challenge studies were merged and rlog values (blind=TRUE) were calculated across the entire dataset using DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Love et al., 2014</xref>); these values were then used to generate heatmaps of expression intensity. Sub-family classifications for the 62 <italic>var</italic> genes were determined from PlasmoDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Warrenfeltz et al., 2018</xref> based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rask et al., 2010</xref>) and 158 <italic>rifin</italic> genes were identified from the same database.

To generate pie charts of <italic>var</italic> gene sub-family expression we summed FPKM-normalised (Fragments Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) read counts for each <italic>var</italic> gene sub-family for each volunteer. Genes with a summed FPKM of &lt;1 in any given sample were excluded for that sample and plots were drawn using matplotlib in Python. To examine reads mapping across <italic>var</italic> gene introns, we followed the protocol outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reid et al., 2018</xref>.

We identified reads overlapping annotated <italic>var</italic> genes using bedtools intersect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>). We then selected reads with an <italic>N</italic> in the CIGAR string, indicating a split read. We counted only those reads that were split exactly over the intron of a <italic>var</italic> gene. We called expression for a <italic>var</italic> gene where there were at least two reads mapping over the intron; read counts were then converted to logs of Counts Per Million (CPM) using the total number of reads mapping to all other features and the heatmap was drawn using pheatmap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Calling differentially expressed parasite genes</title><p>To determine whether any parasite genes were differentially expressed between volunteers with different clinical outcomes after blood challenge, we used DESeq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Love et al., 2014</xref>) to compare parasite gene expression profiles from inflammatory volunteers (n = 8) versus the rest (unresponsive and suppressor, n = 4).

By including analyses of immune signatures and transcription of the major parasite virulence gene families in a temporal fashion, their study provides novel information regarding the impact of inflammatory responses in shaping the expression of certain virulence genes that are important in determining clinical malaria outcomes. The main finding shows that host immune responses vary substantially, influencing time to onset of symptoms, while parasite factors such as replication rates (parasite density) and the absence of marked temporal changes in the expression of variant surface antigens appear not to play a significant role in the initial course of infection. This study represents a large body of carefully collected interesting data that the authors interpreted in an unbiased and well balanced manner. This topic is of importance and relevance to the field of immunoparasitology and specifically, malaria immunology.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Diverse outcomes of controlled human malaria infection originate from immune variation and not <italic>var</italic> gene switching&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Miles Davenport as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Lars Hviid (Reviewer #1); Karen Day (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors conducted analyses of host and parasite transcription signatures in controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) of naïve subjects with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> 3D7 (mainly blood stage parasites). Specifically, the approaches included analyses of immune signatures and transcription of major parasite virulence gene families (<italic>var</italic> and <italic>rif</italic>) at various time points before and after very low level infections, which allowed the authors to examine this question in unprecedented detail. The main finding shows that host immune responses vary substantially, influencing time to onset of symptoms, while parasite factors such as replication rates (parasite density) and the absence of marked temporal changes in the expression of variant surface antigens appear not to play a significant role in the initial course of infection. The authors conclude that clinical outcome of CHMI depends on the above-mentioned variation in host immune reactivity rather than transcription of particular <italic>var</italic> or <italic>rif</italic> genes.</p><p>Although this is well written manuscript describing a study that represents a large body of carefully collected and interpreted data on a topic that is of importance to the malaria community, the conclusion regarding the absence of marked changes in transcripts of <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rif</italic> genes is at variance with the current thinking about the pathogenesis of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>As concerns the current studies, the reviewers are requesting extensive revisions of the manuscript. These revisions are directed at the major aspects of the observations/findings and the authors' data interpretations.</p><p>There was a general agreement that the results concerning immune transcripts recapitulated to some extent published data. The data showing Plasmodium gene expression and specifically the absence of any changes in the expression of the <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rif</italic> genes generated quite a bit of discussion amongst the reviewers because these results seem at odds what has been reported for host with little malaria experience. In the absence of more definite evidence than what is presented, it is imperative that the authors reduced the rhetoric and entertain a hypothesis that is much better supported by current scientific evidence (i.e., that antigenic variation is very important, indeed). In general, the reviewers agreed that the authors over-interpret their findings on <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rif</italic> gene transcription, and not least their significance and therefore, please tone down your claims.</p><p>It would have been reassuring, if the authors could demonstrate that the parasites used in the CHMI were indeed capable of changing transcription pattern in response to selection for specific adhesion specificities, in particular adhesion specificities that have been associated with development of severe complications (e.g., adhesion to EPCR or ICAM-1). Without such a capacity, the analysis of parasite gene transcription loses its significance. While the data in Peters et al., 2002, support the authors' assumption that the parasites used can indeed switch, direct evidence would be preferable. Because the experiments that would be most informative are not really feasible, the authors must acknowledge this in the Discussion.</p><p>The short duration of the experiment and the relatively small number of participants may simply be insufficient to yield the transcriptomic changes one might expect on the basis of the existing literature. While the authors acknowledge these caveats, they need to consider them in their conclusions, as well as the Abstract. Another point to consider is the parasite density. If the density is the trigger to switch <italic>var</italic> gene type, then densities may not be high enough in any host. Parasite density is not adequately explored and neither is the contradiction about parasite density and immune status where the inflammatory group had longer infections.</p><p>Because the CHMI model necessitated a strict requirement for drug treatment in early infection, it did not essentially recapitulate the natural <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection. It is possible, therefore, that in this model there was a critical absence of an important positive feedback loops that would have been activated once inflammation started and which created an environment that may be critical in selection of more virulent parasite types by altering endothelial receptor expression. Again all these are crucial issues to consider, as the present story challenges the existing paradigm of the origins of severe malaria.</p><p>1) Please comment on the implications of the shortest infection in immunologically unresponsive participants.</p><p>2) Subsection “Systemic inflammation coincides with the onset of clinical symptoms”: Why were only three of eight &quot;inflammatory&quot; volunteers included in the analysis discussed? What was the result when all eight were included?</p><p>3) Please include discussion on the role of innate immunity to malaria and the impact of inflammation on the induction of adaptive immunity also should be mentioned.</p><p>4) A more expanded information and discussion on parasitological aspects are needed to strengthen the conclusion. Please include the following points in your Discussion/conclusion: parasite multiplication which was the same in the various groups, while Infections lasted longer and parasite densities were higher in the inflammatory group. There appeared to be highly variable density thresholds to induce inflammation, and therefore a possibility exists that there was a hidden or sequestered biomass in some individuals as a consequence of an inflammatory response. Please also comment on the synchronicity of infections in individuals as this will impact the density result.</p><p>5) One of the earliest reports, Lavstsen et al., 2005, on <italic>var</italic> gene transcription in experimental <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infections, reached a conclusions that transcription of group A and B <italic>var</italic> genes did increase over early days following CHM. Since these are different conclusions re NF54 parasites from which 3D7 was derived, this point requires a discussion. Bachmann et al., 2019, does not actually study naïve hosts but suggests hosts with existing immunity exert more effect on <italic>var</italic> gene profiles than non-immune hosts.</p><p>6) Subsection “Immune decision-making in falciparum malaria”, second paragraph: are these the same 4 volunteers identified earlier in the same paragraph?</p><p>7) Discussion, third paragraph: It is hard to envisage a scenario in which CHMI would be allowed to proceed further due to the inherent risks to the volunteer of rapidly-increasing parasite density.</p><p>8) Discussion, fifth paragraph: it seems that inflammation was only present at the time of treatment and one life cycle (48 h) before, based on Figure 1 – so it may be that there was not enough time for inflammation-mediated alterations in host receptor expression to feed through into the <italic>var</italic> gene profiles by providing a selective advantage to certain adhesive types.</p><p>9) &quot;as part of a custom-design multiplex assay from BioLegend&quot; – does that mean other markers were also measured and were not informative? This would be useful to know given the emphasis on an &quot;inflammatory&quot; response when there is no evidence of classic inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1 etc.).</p><p>10) Subsection “Analysis of parasite <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> expression”: were the <italic>var</italic> reads measured on each of these three days (9, 10, 11)? The Materials and methods don't seem to state which day the samples from the blood challenge were collected for <italic>var</italic> analysis, although it seems clear from results.</p><p>11) Please comment on the relevance of these finding to clinical vaccine and drug trials.</p><p>12) Please revise the title of your manuscript to reflect the changes in your revised manuscript</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Given how challenging this work has been, no additional experiments are being suggested for this study, but repeating similar studies with different parasite lines and eventually in malaria endemic areas would be important to consider for future experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62800.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Although this is well written manuscript describing a study that represents a large body of carefully collected and interpreted data on a topic that is of importance to the malaria community, the conclusion regarding the absence of marked changes in transcripts of var and rif genes is at variance with the current thinking about the pathogenesis of P. falciparum malaria.</p></disp-quote><p>The absence of marked changes in transcription of <italic>var</italic> and <italic>rifin</italic> genes was unexpected, and in our view it is the counter-intuitive nature of this result that makes it so exciting. We agree that these data do not challenge the paradigm that a subset of <italic>var</italic> genes are associated with severe malaria; instead we believe these data offer new insights into how group A/DC8 variants may come to dominate severe infections. Specifically, they indicate that group A/DC8 variants do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage (a leading hypothesis) but instead may rely upon changes in the host environment to promote their selection. We therefore anticipate that this study will stimulate much discussion and further research on the selection of pathogenic parasite variants in vivo. We also agree that CHMI undoubtedly has limitations, and we had intended to describe these fully in our original manuscript. However, we obviously failed to communicate this clearly, so we have substantially re-written parts of the manuscript in order to more clearly and carefully state our conclusions and explore the caveats relating to our data.

We hope that this title emphasises the unique nature of this study (the transcriptional analysis of both parasite and host through time) without erroneously giving the impression that we are challenging the role of <italic>var</italic> genes in malaria pathogenesis.</p><p>Abstract: We have altered the wording of the Abstract to more carefully communicate our conclusions and to explicitly acknowledge the dominant association of specific parasite variants with severe malaria. We have also made it clear that our data are based exclusively on transcriptional analysis:</p><p>“When we tracked temporal changes in parasite VSA expression to ask whether variants associated with severe disease rapidly expand in naïve hosts we found no transcriptional evidence to support this hypothesis. These data indicate that parasite variants that dominate severe malaria do not have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage; instead, they presumably rely upon infection-induced changes in their within-host environment for selection.”</p><p>Results: we have modified the text to clearly set out the hypothesis that we are testing: “Current theory predicts that group A and DC8 variants should rapidly and preferentially expand in naive hosts because of an intrinsic growth and/or survival advantage”.</p><p>And we have qualified our major conclusions:</p><p>“Evidently, there was no preferential expansion of group A or DC8 variants within the time-frame of this study” and “The diverse clinical outcomes observed in this trial cannot therefore be easily explained by variation in parasite gene expression; instead, they must largely originate from host-intrinsic immune variation”.</p><p>Discussion: we have added three new paragraphs to discuss the limitations of CHMI and to examine the possible reasons why preferential expansion of group A/DC8 variants was not observed within the time-frame of this study. Importantly, of the myriad possibilities we state our preferred hypothesis: that group A/DC8 variants would expand if CHMI were prolonged beyond 10-days and this would result from enhanced selection (due to changes in the host environment) rather than increased switching rates. We make it clear that further experiments are required.</p><p>In the Discussion we:</p><p>– summarise the limitations of CHMI;</p><p>– discuss the limitations imposed by the use of a single parasite genotype, and the possibility that different parasite isolates may vary in their capacity to switch towards group A or DC8 variants;</p><p>– discuss the limitations of small sample size, and the possibility that preferential expansion of group A/DC8 variants might be observed if more volunteers are studied;</p><p>– discuss the possibility that parasite density is not high enough in CHMI to trigger <italic>var</italic> gene switching/selection;</p><p>– discuss the relatively short duration of CHMI and ask whether the expansion of group A/DC8 variants would be observed in longer infections. We then explore in detail why a longer timeframe is likely to be required and the changes that may trigger expansion of pathogenic variants.</p><p>And finally, the summary paragraph at the end of the Discussion has been modified to qualify our conclusions and again emphasise the dominant association of specific parasite variants with severe malaria.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would have been reassuring, if the authors could demonstrate that the parasites used in the CHMI were indeed capable of changing transcription pattern in response to selection for specific adhesion specificities, in particular adhesion specificities that have been associated with development of severe complications (e.g., adhesion to EPCR or ICAM-1). Without such a capacity, the analysis of parasite gene transcription loses its significance. While the data in Peters et al., 2002, support the authors' assumption that the parasites used can indeed switch, direct evidence would be preferable. Because the experiments that would be most informative are not really feasible, the authors must acknowledge this in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that one possible explanation for our data is that the 3D7 parasites used for blood challenge could have lost their ability to switch towards group A/DC8 <italic>var</italic> genes and that this should be assessed in future trials. In the meantime, we have expanded our Discussion to explore this idea further and to state that additional direct experimental evidence are still required:</p><p>“The 3D7 clone was cultured for many years before preparation of the inoculum used for blood challenge (Cheng et al., 1997) and could have acquired mutations that affect its behaviour in vivo (Claessens et al., 2017). […] Overall, we consider it possible, but unlikely, that our data can be explained by a mutation in 3D7 that affects <italic>var</italic> gene switching.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The short duration of the experiment and the relatively small number of participants may simply be insufficient to yield the transcriptomic changes one might expect on the basis of the existing literature. While the authors acknowledge these caveats, they need to consider them in their conclusions, as well as the Abstract. Another point to consider is the parasite density. If the density is the trigger to switch var gene type, then densities may not be high enough in any host. Parasite density is not adequately explored and neither is the contradiction about parasite density and immune status where the inflammatory group had longer infections.</p></disp-quote><p>As outlined above, we have carefully re-worded our Abstract and conclusions (subsection “Parasite variants associated with severe disease do not rapidly expand in naïve hosts”) to take account of the limitations of the study. Furthermore, we now discuss in detail the possibility that the short duration of infection, the small number of volunteers or the parasite density observed in CHMI (Discussion) may explain the absence of <italic>var</italic> gene switching/selection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the CHMI model necessitated a strict requirement for drug treatment in early infection, it did not essentially recapitulate the natural P. falciparum infection. It is possible, therefore, that in this model there was a critical absence of an important positive feedback loops that would have been activated once inflammation started and which created an environment that may be critical in selection of more virulent parasite types by altering endothelial receptor expression. Again all these are crucial issues to consider, as the present story challenges the existing paradigm of the origins of severe malaria.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to re-iterate that it was not our intention to challenge the paradigm that group A/DC8 variants are associated with severe malaria, but instead to raise the question of how these variants come to dominate severe infections. Our data do not support the hypothesis that group A/DC8 variants have an intrinsic growth or survival advantage in naïve hosts; instead, our data indicate that their selection will likely require infection-induced changes in the host environment. We agree that infections were probably terminated too early to observe the effects of these changes on parasite selection and this is discussed in detail in the revised manuscript (Discussion). Furthermore, all of our conclusions have been carefully re-worded so that we don’t erroneously give the impression that we are challenging the role of <italic>var</italic> genes in malaria pathogenesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Please comment on the implications of the shortest infection in immunologically unresponsive participants.</p></disp-quote><p>We think it likely that the unresponsive volunteers would have mounted an immune response if their infections had continued for a longer time period:</p><p>“Indeed, it remains a possibility that all naive hosts (including those that initially suppress genes involved in myeloid cell activation) will eventually converge on interferon-stimulated inflammation as the infection progresses. […] This metabolic switch may therefore represent a hardwired mechanism of self-regulation because systemic inflammation is an unavoidable fate in naive hosts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Systemic inflammation coincides with the onset of clinical symptoms”: Why were only three of eight &quot;inflammatory&quot; volunteers included in the analysis discussed? What was the result when all eight were included?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, we were only able to carry out metabolomic analysis on a total of 21 samples. We therefore chose 3 time-points from 7 volunteers, and selected 3 from the inflammatory group (those with the highest CXCL10/IFNγ levels), 2 from the unresponsive group and the 2 suppressor volunteers. This has been clarified in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please include discussion on the role of innate immunity to malaria and the impact of inflammation on the induction of adaptive immunity also should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of innate immunity and inflammation (and the activation of adaptive immunity) is discussed:</p><p>“Notably, only inflammatory volunteers developed hallmark signs and symptoms of malaria (e.g. pyrexia and lymphopenia) providing further support for the idea that inflammation causes the earliest manifestations of disease. […] It therefore appears that we might need to re-assess the role of innate immunity in the first hours and days of the pathogenic blood cycle – rather than serving as an early brake on parasite replication it may be that systemic inflammation primarily functions to switch bone marrow production in favour of myelopoiesis and mobilise the required effector cells to the spleen.”</p><p>“The innate response to malaria therefore quickly re-structures and co-localises key strands of the immune system; whether this leads to an effective response that can limit parasite burden and minimise collateral damage will depend upon the outcome of cell-cell circuits in the spleen. Measuring the activation and differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells – the key orchestrators of innate and adaptive immunity – would provide a downstream readout of these critical tissue-specific interactions in human volunteers.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A more expanded information and discussion on parasitological aspects are needed to strengthen the conclusion. Please include the following points in your Discussion/conclusion: parasite multiplication which was the same in the various groups, while Infections lasted longer and parasite densities were higher in the inflammatory group. There appeared to be highly variable density thresholds to induce inflammation, and therefore a possibility exists that there was a hidden or sequestered biomass in some individuals as a consequence of an inflammatory response. Please also comment on the synchronicity of infections in individuals as this will impact the density result.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our discussion of the parasitological aspects in the revised manuscript (Discussion) and clearly highlighted the limitations of the model. Furthermore, we have qualified all of our conclusions to take account of these limitations.</p><p>The apparent contradiction that parasite multiplication rates are comparable between groups but the course of infection (and parasite density) is increased in inflammatory volunteers almost certainly arises from using microscopy for diagnosis. A positive thick blood smear was the primary end-point for drug treatment and inevitably when circulating parasite densities are around the limit of detection (approx. 5-20,000 parasites per ml) diagnosis becomes fairly stochastic. As one example, inflammatory volunteer 016 was diagnosed with a parasite density of 273,247 parasites per ml but if they had been diagnosed just 12-hours earlier their final parasite density would have been just 3,636 parasites per ml. At both time-points this volunteer was inflammatory and symptomatic. Because of the stochastic nature of microscopy we no longer use this as an endpoint in our clinical trials. Length of infection and parasite density are discussed in the Discussion.</p><p>With regards to a sequestered parasite biomass: we tried to measure PfHRP2 levels in plasma (which has been used to assess total parasite burden including sequestered parasites). However, PfHRP2 levels were below the limit of detection in all volunteers. It therefore remains possible that a hidden parasite biomass in some volunteers (but not others) explains the different outcomes of infection. However, in our view a more simple explanation is that there is between-host variation in the parasite density threshold required to trigger inflammation. This is well supported by a large body of evidence that comes from the in vitro study of human immune variation (see Bakker et al., 2018; Brodin et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016; Patin et al., 2018; Piasecka et al., 2018; Ter Horst et al., 2016). Furthermore, whilst we are unable to comment in detail on the synchronicity of these sub-patent infections, we do note that the characteristic saw-tooth pattern of parasite density (by qPCR) was observed in every volunteer in our blood challenge model (Figure 3A). This would suggest that sequestration is occurring in all volunteers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One of the earliest reports, Lavstsen et al., 2005, on var gene transcription in experimental P. falciparum infections, reached a conclusions that transcription of group A and B var genes did increase over early days following CHM. Since these are different conclusions re NF54 parasites from which 3D7 was derived, this point requires a discussion. Bachmann et al., 2019, does not actually study naïve hosts but suggests hosts with existing immunity exert more effect on var gene profiles than non-immune hosts.</p></disp-quote><p>The Lavstsen et al., 2005, is now discussed:</p><p>“This is in contrast to a previous study that suggested <italic>var</italic> gene expression changes within the first few days of blood-stage infection (Lavstsen et al., 2005). However, in that study parasites were isolated from volunteers and then placed into culture for one month before <italic>var</italic> gene profiling – switching may therefore have occurred in vitro confounding interpretation of these data. Our study, which measured <italic>var</italic> gene expression ex vivo, avoids any bias introduced by culturing parasites but nevertheless has limitations that require careful consideration.”</p><p>Regarding reference to Bachmann et al., 2019, we apologise for the mistake – the work using parasite strain 7G8 in CHMI by Bachmann et al. has been presented at meetings, but is not published yet. This has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “Immune decision-making in falciparum malaria”, second paragraph: are these the same 4 volunteers identified earlier in the same paragraph?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this is shown in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Discussion, third paragraph: It is hard to envisage a scenario in which CHMI would be allowed to proceed further due to the inherent risks to the volunteer of rapidly-increasing parasite density.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified this sentence to make it clear that it would be beneficial to prolong CHMI trials if safe to do so:</p><p>“CHMI trials that follow volunteers for one or two more blood cycles would be required to explore the consequences of increased Pfck1 transcription and of prolonged systemic inflammation, and consideration should be given as to whether this can be done safely.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Discussion, fifth paragraph: it seems that inflammation was only present at the time of treatment and one life cycle (48 h) before, based on Figure 1 – so it may be that there was not enough time for inflammation-mediated alterations in host receptor expression to feed through into the var gene profiles by providing a selective advantage to certain adhesive types.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree and discuss this possibility in depth in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) &quot;as part of a custom-design multiplex assay from BioLegend&quot; – does that mean other markers were also measured and were not informative? This would be useful to know given the emphasis on an &quot;inflammatory&quot; response when there is no evidence of classic inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL1 etc).</p></disp-quote><p>TNF and IL-1b have short half-lives in vivo and would not be expected to increase in plasma within 1-2 days of the start of an inflammatory response. These cytokines are not the triggers for inflammation (that role almost universally falls onto interferon signaling) but rather the downstream effector molecules released by activated myeloid cells. We can detect increased transcription of TNF and IL-1b in whole blood but no increase in circulating protein within the timeframe of this study. For clarity, we have now included reference to TNF in the Discussion:</p><p>“However, circulating levels of plasma TNF had not yet increased at diagnosis and so more time is clearly required for interferon signaling to drive the cytokine cascades necessary to activate endothelial cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Subsection “Analysis of parasite var and rifin expression”: were the var reads measured on each of these three days (9, 10, 11)? The Materials and methods don't seem to state which day the samples from the blood challenge were collected for var analysis, although it seems clear from results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise that we did not make this clear. We have now revised the Materials and methods to state exactly when parasites were collected during each study and the circumstances under which <italic>var</italic> reads were merged.</p><p>In the blood challenge study, parasites were collected only at diagnosis:</p><p>“Blood challenge: 50ml whole blood was drawn into lithium heparin vacutainers at diagnosis (immediately before drug treatment) and white cells were removed by passing the blood through a leucoflex LXT filter (Macopharma).”</p><p>In the mosquito challenge study, parasites were collected on days 9, 10 and 11:</p><p>“Mosquito challenge: parasites were isolated from 20ml whole blood drawn on days 9, 10 and 11 post-infection according to the blood challenge protocol, with the following modifications.”</p><p>Parasite reads were pooled for each volunteer infected by mosquito bite from the data collected on days 9, 10 and 11. This was to ensure sufficient coverage to map <italic>var</italic> gene expression at the start of the blood cycle in every volunteer: “For every volunteer infected by mosquito bite read counts were pooled from days 9, 10 &amp; 11 post-infection to generate a comprehensive parasite transcriptome 2-3 cycles after liver egress.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Please comment on the relevance of these finding to clinical vaccine and drug trials.</p></disp-quote><p>A major aim of this study was to map the variation between hosts in their response to infection. Between-host variation has been well documented in vaccine trials (especially for non-malaria infectious diseases) and our data therefore support the need to account for individual variation when calculating sample sizes for vaccine (and drug) trials. Having said that, the sample size in our study is likely not sufficient to reveal the full breadth of immune variation in falciparum malaria and we would therefore be reluctant to include a statement in the manuscript about sample sizes in vaccine or drug trials, as we would not be able to substantiate any claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Please revise the title of your manuscript to reflect the changes in your revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>The title has been changed to “Mapping immune variation and <italic>var</italic> gene switching in naïve hosts infected with <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>”. We hope that this title emphasises the unique nature of this study – the transcriptional analysis of both parasite and host through time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>Given how challenging this work has been, no additional experiments are being suggested for this study, but repeating similar studies with different parasite lines and eventually in malaria endemic areas would be important to consider for future experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have emphasised the need for further research (including different parasite lines and in endemic settings) in our revised Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
