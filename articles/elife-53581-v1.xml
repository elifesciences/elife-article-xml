In the densely colonized gut, commensal bacteria confer a prominent protective role against invading bacterial pathogens, in part by posing a competitive threshold within this ecological niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barthel et al., 2003</xref>). This biological barrier is absent in axenic mice and reduced in mice harboring a low-complexity microbiota colonized mice. Barrier function of the microbiota is consequently sensitive to antibiotics treatment in colonized conventionally housed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barthel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brugiroux et al., 2017</xref>). Skin microbiota poses a similar barrier against colonization by bacterial skin pathogens (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parlet et al., 2019</xref>). In recent years, it became evident that the lower respiratory tract (LRT), previously considered quasi-sterile, also hosts a bacterial microbiota under healthy conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dickson et al., 2015</xref>). Whether the bacterial LRT microbiota confers colonization resistance against bacterial pathogens, e.g. causing pneumonia, is unclear.</p><p>Recently, a number of groups, including ours, reported compositional changes in the intestinal and lower respiratory tract microbiota over the course of an IAV infection using a C57BL/6J mouse model housed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deriu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Planet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>). This opened a temporarily limited window for <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium infection in the intestine, similarly as in mice orally treated with antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deriu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>). We found only little qualitative or quantitative differences in respiratory microbiota of IAV infected mice by 16S rRNA gene-specific next generation sequencing and qPCR. Nevertheless, we observed enhanced secondary colonization with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> following IAV infections, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCullers and Rehg, 2002</xref>). The outcome of these super-infections is determined by host factors, viral factors and factors of the bacterial pathogen (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCullers, 2014</xref>).</p><p>IAV infections take place in the poly-microbial environment of the respiratory tract and bacterial colonization of the lung is important to prime alveolar macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abt et al., 2012</xref>). However, the immediate role of the lung microbiota composition and complexity on invading bacterial pathogens is poorly investigated. We recently discovered a high content of Lactobacillaceae in the lung microbiota of healthy SPF housed mice, which was not reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>). Here we identify these commensal bacteria as <italic>Lactobacillus murinus</italic>, most probably a strain of the altered Schaedler flora (ASF). We provide in vitro evidence that it can limit pneumococcal growth, e.g. through release of lactic acid and reduces of chain formation of pneumococcus. Importantly, therapeutic application of <italic>L. murinus</italic> after IAV infection reduced the burden of secondary pneumococcal pneumonia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>L. murinus</italic> (ASF361) could be a major constituent of mouse lung microbiota in laboratory settings</title><p>We previously demonstrated dominance of Lactobacillaceae in total lower respiratory tract (LRT) homogenates of SPF housed C57Bl/6J mice by 16S rRNA gene-specific NGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>). In order to characterize these Lactobacillaceae in greater detail, we independently isolated and characterized two clones of phenotypically dominant bacteria from LRT homogenates cultivated on Columbia agar plates. After whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly we determined the evolutionary relationships of the two isolates based on the 16S rRNA gene. The phylogeny presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> is based on the alignment of approximately 1400 nucleotides of the 16S rRNA gene. The lung-isolated strains clustered with <italic>L. murinus</italic> and were clearly separated from <italic>L. animalis</italic> and <italic>L. apodemi</italic> isolates. One likely source for <italic>L. murinus</italic> is the altered Schaedler flora (ASF), introduced in 1978 to standardize mouse model colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dewhirst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schaedler et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wymore Brand et al., 2015</xref>) (indicated as <italic>L. murinus</italic> Schaedler in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Blasting of the de novo assembled genome against available genomes revealed that indeed <italic>L. murinus</italic> ASF361 was the best match to our <italic>L. murinus</italic> strain isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, z-score = 1, PRJNA591640 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Alignment of the whole genome of our Lactobacillus isolate to the recently published reference genome of <italic>L. murinus</italic> ASF361 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wannemuehler et al., 2014</xref>) resulted in &gt;99. 5% sequence identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lactobacillaceae isolate from total lung homogenates of mice is identified to be <italic>Lactobacillus murinus</italic>, a member of altered Scheadler Flora.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of Lactobacillaceae isolate (indicated with red asterisk) to other known members of <italic>Lactobacillaceae</italic> family (<italic>L. murinus</italic> ASF361 is indicated with a red octothorpe).

The trees are not rooted but drawn to scale with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree.

Previous analyses of murine LRT microbiota by 16S rRNA gene NGS revealed a higher diversity with a balanced distribution of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barfod et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Poroyko et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yadava et al., 2016</xref>). We speculated that differences in sampling techniques (bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) <italic>vs.</italic> partial organs <italic>vs.</italic> total organs) might introduce a potential sampling bias by avoiding or limiting tissue-associated bacteria. To resolve this discrepancy, we directly compared the compositional profile of LRT microbiota from bronchoalveloar lavage fluid (BALF), total organ after bronchoalveloar lavage or total organ without manipulation from SPF (individually ventilated cage) and conventionally (open cage) housed C57Bl/6J mice (see methods section for details). As demonstrated before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>), we found predominantly Lactobacillaceae in total organ samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A/B</xref>). However, this family was poorly represented in BALF samples, indicating a tight association with lung tissue. Accordingly, alpha diversity was higher in BALF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the overall homogeneous composition of BALF microbiota confirmed previous analysis by other groups. Of note, total 16S copy numbers by qPCR on the same amount of input DNA were substantially higher in tissue-derived samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) than in BALF samples. Effectively, BALF samples were indistinguishable from blanks and background by 16S rRNA-specific qPCR.

Mechanistically, commensal bacteria control outgrowth of pathobionts or invasion of pathogenic bacteria by different mechanisms: i.e. direct competition for nutrients and space, priming of innate immune cells, which are responsible for bacterial clearance and secretion of production/secretion of antibacterial metabolites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pickard et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Members of the family Lactobacillaceae were previously shown to inhibit growth of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria in co-culture or by exposure to Lactobacillus conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Keersmaecker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). Following a similar idea, we decided to first evaluate the effect of our <italic>L. murinus</italic> isolate on a common bacterial pathogen of the respiratory tract, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, in an in vitro setting. Incompatibility of media requirements for efficient growth of these two bacteria did not allow us to perform co-culture studies.

To further rule out that the antibacterial effects could merely be a consequence of depletion/reduction of nutrients in the growth media, we used a similarly prepared medium conditioned by control bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> (<italic>Ec</italic>CM). This <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was previously isolated from the LRT of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yildiz et al., 2018</xref>) and characterized by whole genome sequencing.

Even in SPF mice, the colonization of the respiratory tract with low doses of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is quite inefficient. This natural colonization threshold can be lowered by previous, sub-lethal IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), modeling the frequently observed secondary bacterial pneumonia in human IAV patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morris et al., 2017</xref>). In order to address if <italic>L. murinus</italic> could overcome the IAV mediated sensitization toward <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonization, we established a respiratory probiotics treatment protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>, probiotics treatment indicated by black arrow). When inoculating IAV infected mice on day 7-post infection (after onset of clinical signs of IAV infection) with <italic>L. murinus</italic> via the intranasal route, we observed a significant reduction BALF pH and diminished pneumococcal colonization on day 11-post IAV infection (24 hr post secondary <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> challenge) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C/D</xref>). Lactic acid levels in BALF of these mice were not changed compared to IAV infected and mock colonized controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We can currently not rule out that lactic acid is quickly taken up by the surrounding tissue or commensal bacteria. Importantly, treatment with <italic>L. murinus</italic> did not influence the overall pathology of IAV infection as indicated by similar weight loss in both experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Lactobacilli were previously shown to modulate inflammatory signaling. An involvement of the innate host protein response was ruled out by specific qPCR for key cytokines involved in antibacterial signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). IAV infected mice showed a robust inflammatory response in their lungs on D10 post infection, which was non-significantly impacted by administration of <italic>L. murinus.</italic> Finally we tested by 16S rRNA gene-specific NGS, if <italic>L. murinus</italic> colonization of the lungs would alter the resident lung microbiota. Indeed, we found a mild increase in Bacilli in SPF mice colonized with L. murinus and a homogenous reduction of the remaining bacterial classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The overall composition of lung microbiota was however indistinguishable as indicated by largely overlapping clouds in the PCoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These data indicate that L. <italic>murinus</italic> could be a safe and directly acting antibacterial probiotic candidate for the respiratory tract.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The benefit of bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces has been the center of attention of numerous scientific studies in recent years, ranging from nutritional science, to immunology and even behavioral studies. Most studies focus on the highly colonized digestive tract, where exposure of various immune cell types results in peripheral education of adaptive immune cells and fine-tuning of immune responses. Beyond these indirect effects, bacterial microbiota is posing a direct competitive threshold to colonization or outgrowth of pathogenic bacteria on barrier tissues.</p><p>Gnotobiotic animals, with an increased resistance to bacterial colonization, were first introduced in the mid-1960s by Russel W. Schaedler. This original Schaedler flora was later revised and became the ASF. Since the 1980s, all major commercial vendors provided mice for barrier facilities by colonizing germ-free animals with this standardized mix of eight bacterial strains. There are however numerous reports on vendor-specific variations in the commensal microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ericsson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ivanov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ivanov et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, we believe our results are of importance for researchers working on lung physiology or pathology in commercially acquired mouse models.</p><p>In laboratory mice, <italic>L. murinus,</italic> as part of the ASF, was reported to colonize the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almirón et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hemme et al., 1980</xref>), the oral cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blais and Lavoie, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodrigue et al., 1993</xref>) and the vaginal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jerse et al., 2002</xref>). In the lower respiratory tract <italic>L. murinus</italic> was to our best knowledge not reported as a dominant species, however Lactobacilli were previously found in high number in lung tissue microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Singh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Our data implicate that the sampling technique is critical for the adequate quantification of this species in the lung, since they might have a tight association with the host tissue. A previous comparison of BALF (+ or - cells) with lung tissue (from the distal tips of the lung) revealed enrichment of Firmicutes in tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barfod et al., 2013</xref>), independently confirming our observation. Even within BAL samples of human patients, it was previously reported that a substantial proportion of commensal bacteria is tightly associated with cells and thus easily lost during removal of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dickson et al., 2014</xref>). From conventionally housed mice in our own facility, we know that Lactobacilli are still overall dominant in the lung tissue microbiome after two weeks of open cage housing.</p><p>Lactobacilli display a number of antimicrobial and immune modulatory activities. Depending on the ecological niche and the Lactobacillus strain investigated, diverse phenotypes have been observed: Colonization of GF mice with Lactobacillus spp. was proposed to increased alveoli numbers per µm<sup>2</sup> and to enhanced mucus production after 16 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yun et al., 2014</xref>), comparable to non-SPF mice, albeit this was not independently confirmed by others. Intranasal application of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG or <italic>L. paracasei</italic> one reduces IL-5 and eotaxin production in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pellaton et al., 2012</xref>). Intranasal application of <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic> GG was recently shown to suppress allergic responses in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Spacova et al., 2019</xref>). Colonization with <italic>L. murinus</italic> H12 was recently described to protect neonatal rats from necrotizing enterocolitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isani et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Direct antibacterial effects were also previously reported. Lactobacilli produce antimicrobial peptides such as bacteriocins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Elayaraja et al., 2014</xref>) and metabolites that are antibacterial in nature such as reactive oxygen species and lactic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nardi et al., 2005</xref>). Our data imply a direct function for lactic acid in the antagonism of pneumococcus growth. Lactic acid was shown to inhibit growth of various bacterial pathogens; <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. enterica</italic> Typhimurium serovar, <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Keersmaecker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This action is assigned to two mechanisms: (1) its capacity to penetrate cytoplasmic membranes in its non-dissociated form, which results in lowered cytoplasmic pH and disruption of the proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alakomi et al., 2000</xref>); 2) its capacity to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane, which was proposed to increase in turn the sensitivity of lactic acid exposed bacteria (mainly gram-negative) to other antimicrobial compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alakomi et al., 2000</xref>). Lactic acid levels where however not changed in vivo after exogenous application of <italic>L. murinus</italic>. We can thus not rule out that lactate independent mechanisms, e.g. the in vitro observed reduction of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> chain length, come into play in vivo. Additionally, we found a protease sensitive reduction of chain extension. It is currently unclear if both phenotypes contribute to the in vivo colonization defect of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> after probiotics treatment with <italic>L. murinus</italic>. The antibacterial activity was not limited to <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> but also affected <italic>S. aureaus</italic>. Published reports indicate a broad antibacterial activity of <italic>L. murinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilkova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perelmuter et al., 2008</xref>). In our study the repressing effects on fast growing <italic>S. aureus</italic> were mild but evident. The antimicrobial effect of <italic>L. murinus</italic> on <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth depends on low pH as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bilkova et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Notably we found that germ-free mice were more difficult to colonize with <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. This appears as a contradiction to the hypothesis that lung microbiota poses a colonization barrier toward invading bacterial pathogens. An explanation to this dilemma could be that S. pneumoniae colonization requires yet unknown anatomical conditions induced by commensal lung microbiota. Future tests in antibiotic treated mice might resolve this phenomenon.</p><p>The majority of human lung microbiota studies rely on aspirates or endoscopic brushes. In a recent tissue-biopsy based human lung microbiota study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), Firmicutes were found in all regions of the respiratory tract, albeit not to the same extend as shown here in SPF mice. We can moreover not rule out that other bacteria might produce lactic acid in the lung of humans to prevent colonization. One of the most prevalent KEGG pathways retrieved from the human tissue microbiome was carbohydrate metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2016</xref>), which includes the pathway involved in lactic acid generation. Under chronic inflammatory conditions as found in IPF patients, lactic acid levels in lungs are elevated albeit the source of this lactate could not be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kottmann et al., 2012</xref>). In cystic fibrosis patients, neutrophils were identified as a source for lactic acid in sputum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bensel et al., 2011</xref>). The contribution of commensal respiratory tract bacteria and host cells to antibacterial lactate production in healthy humans remains to be addressed.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated here that lung resident commensals might be applicable as probiotics to counteract lung colonization by pathogenic bacteria, without major effects on lung commensals. In contrast to other Lactobacillus species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ding et al., 2017</xref>) <italic>L. murinus</italic> is not immunogenic when administered orally in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Östberg et al., 2018</xref>). This was also confirmed here by overall similar levels of cytokine mRNAs involved in antibacterial signaling. However, it remains currently unclear through which mechanism IAV might weaken the commensal shield against colonization, or if the here demonstrated effect of probiotics treatment is solely based on alterations of the host immune response. Nevertheless, in the context of a lung environment prone to bacterial colonization, e.g. as we induced by IAV infection, this treatment could reduce the risk of superinfection or improve the clinical outcome. This is of special interest in elderly human patients with high susceptibility to respiratory tract infections and reduced lung microbiome complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kovacs et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Lung tissue-associated microbiota of mice differ substantially from BALF microbiota, in containing large proportions of <italic>L. murinus</italic>.

All animals were housed for 7 days to adjust to housing conditions under a strict 12 hr light/dark cycle and fed ad libitum. Conventionally housed animals were kept in open cages 14 days before experiments. germ-free animals with C57BL/6J background were generated by the Clean Mouse Facility of Department of Biomedical Research of the University of Bern. They were born and raised in flexible film isolators in the at University of Bern, transferred aseptically into sterile IVC cages provided with sterile food and water and kept in the BSL2 unit of the animal facility of the Centre Medical Universitaire, Geneva for the duration of the experiments. For inoculation with IAV, <italic>S. pneumonia</italic> or <italic>L. murinus</italic>, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a mix of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively) in 200 µl of sterile PBS.

Upon reaching experimental or humane endpoints (85% of initial body weight), animals were euthanized using controlled CO<sub>2</sub> exposure. Broncho alveolar lavages (BAL) or lungs were sampled immediately after euthanasia using sterile tools. BAL sampling was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2017</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, mice were sacrificed by controlled CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and fixed with needles to a Styrofoam panel. The skin from abdomen to neck was cut open to expose thoracic cage and neck. With a second set of sterile tools soft tissue around the neck was gently removed. Using forceps, approximately 10 cm sterile sewing thread was placed underneath the trachea. With sterile scissors the trachea was nicked and a 22G × 1’ Exel Safelet Catheter was inserted no more than 0.5 cm. The inner cannula was removed and the catheter was tied to trachea with a double knot in the sewing thread. 1 ml of PBS, or saline (0.9%) in experiments for pH or lactate measurements, was slowly introduced into the lung through the catheter with a 1 ml syringe, incubated for 10 s and aspirated back to the syringe. This procedure was repeated two more times, using a new sterile syringe in every step. Retrieved liquid was collected in a screw cap tube.

The lung microbiome is an emerging area of study with potential clinical significance.

However, such data is critical to demonstrate the difference of commensal bacteria that are reside in the airway vs. those are tissue-associated. While the authors mentioned the 16S copy is higher in tissue-derived samples than BALF samples, and the BALF samples are indistinguishable from background, it is necessary to directly show the results, with the proper normalization and control.

We used highly sensitive RNAScope technology and detected <italic>L. murinus</italic> and total eubacteria with specific probes in neighboring sections of SPF mouse lungs.

Using a standard of genomic DNA from cultured <italic>L. murinus</italic> with a defined cfu we estimated the number of <italic>L. murinus</italic> to be around 10e7/lung. This estimate is about 100fold higher than the number of total cultured bacteria determined previously [Yildiz et al., 2018], which might be due to the presence of dead bacteria or a consequence of alternative organ processing for the two techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>in vivo measurements of pH and lactic acid levels: It is not clear if the proposed mechanism is physiologically relevant.

We compared lactate levels and pH in BALF of <italic>L. murinus</italic> treated SPF mice. We chose this model, since we observed here an effect on <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonization. Lactate levels were unchanged 3 days post <italic>L. murinus</italic> inoculation in mock or influenza A virus pre-treated mice, which might be a consequence of quick absorption of lactic acid into the tissue or commensal bacteria. Nevertheless, we found a significant reduction of pH by 0.1 in BALF of mice treated with <italic>L. murinus</italic>. While this appears to be minor effect, previous publications suggest that a drop of 0.5 (assuming an overall pH of 7 in the lung), lead to 4 log10 reduction in in vitro experiments [Mazzola et al., 2003], which is clearly more dramatic than what we observed in our in vivo experiments.
