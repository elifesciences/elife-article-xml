bodies also have the capacity to accumulate them under particular conditions. We hypothesised that acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) accumulation and altered redox status during low-flow ischaemia would support ketone body production in the heart. Combining a Langendorff heart model of low-flow ischaemia/reperfusion with liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we show that β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) accumulated in the ischaemic heart to 23.9 nmol/gww and was secreted into the coronary effluent. Sodium oxamate, a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) inhibitor, increased ischaemic β-OHB levels 5.3-fold and slowed contractile recovery. Inhibition of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) with hymeglusin lowered ischaemic β-OHB accumulation by 40%, despite increased flux through succinyl-CoA-3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT), resulting in greater contractile recovery. Hymeglusin also protected cardiac mitochondrial respiratory capacity during ischaemia/reperfusion. In conclusion, net ketone generation occurs in the heart under conditions of low-flow ischaemia. The process is driven by flux through both HMGCS2 and SCOT, and impacts on cardiac functional recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Heart</kwd><kwd>Langendorff</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>Ischaemia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000274</institution-id><institution>British Heart Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FS/14/59/31282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindsay</surname><given-names>Ross T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000690</institution-id><institution>Research Councils UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/E500552/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>β-Hydroxybutyrate accumulates in the perfused rat heart during ischaemia, driven by flux through both HMGCS and SCOT, with implications for functional recovery.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatic ketogenesis plays a vital role in starvation physiology, whereby acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) derived from fatty acid oxidation (FAO) undergoes a stepwise conversion to acetoacetate (AcAc) and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB), which in turn act as fuels for the brain and other extrahepatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Puchalska and Crawford, 2017</xref>). Initially, mitochondrial thiolase activity catalyses the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA (AcAc-CoA) from two acetyl-CoA monomers, before a mitochondrial isoform of β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGCS2) catalyses the condensation of AcAc-CoA and a further acetyl-CoA to form HMG-CoA. This latter reaction is considered the rate-limiting step of ketogenesis, with the significant ketogenic capacity of liver attributed to the uniquely high activity of HMG-CoA synthase in comparison with other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McGarry and Foster, 1976</xref>). In the mitochondria, HMG-CoA lyase converts HMG-CoA to AcAc, which in turn is reversibly converted to β-OHB under reducing conditions by β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1). In extrahepatic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), BDH1 catalyses the reverse reaction converting β-OHB to AcAc, from which AcAc-CoA is obtained by the exchange of a CoA through the action of succinyl-CoA:3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT). Mitochondrial thiolase activity then yields two acetyl-CoA molecules, which enter the Krebs cycle.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>β-OHB metabolism.</title><p>Catabolism of both fatty acids and glucose yields acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), following uptake to the mitochondria via acyl-carnitines and pyruvate, respectively. In the liver, ketogenesis involves the conversion of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA, β-hydroxy-β-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA), acetoacetate, and then β-hydroxybutyrate in a series of reversible reactions. The enzymes which catalyse this are HMG-CoA synthase, HMG-CoA lyase, and β-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BDH1). In extrahepatic tissues, HMG-CoA can be bypassed through conversion of acetoacetate to acetoacetyl-CoA in conjunction with the conversion of succinyl-CoA to succinate, catalysed by succinyl-CoA-3-oxaloacid CoA transferase (SCOT). Rather than being oxidised in the mitochondria, under anaerobic conditions such as ischaemia, pyruvate can instead be converted to lactate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). For bidirectional enzymes involved in both ketolysis and ketogenesis, the direction of ketogenic flux is represented by blue arrows, while ketolytic reactions are represented in green.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71270-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The heart has a significant capacity for ketone body oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cotter et al., 2013</xref>), but any extrahepatic tissue which oxidises ketone bodies also has the capacity to generate ketone bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Puchalska and Crawford, 2017</xref>). This was shown to occur in the kidney through the reversible enzymatic activity of mitochondrial thiolase and SCOT, and the authors speculated that this may generally be the case for extrahepatic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weidemann and Krebs, 1969</xref>). In the isolated perfused rat heart, net production of AcAc and β-OHB has been observed when fatty acids are supplied via the perfusion medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comte et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Opie and Owen, 1975</xref>). Inclusion of [1-<sup>13</sup>C]octanoate in the medium and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of ketone body enrichments in the coronary effluent implicated FAO as a source of this ketone body efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comte et al., 1997</xref>), which may represent a spillover pathway when acetyl-CoA availability exceeds the capacity of the Krebs cycle. Independent of fatty acid provision, net production of AcAc from acetyl-CoA was seen in pig heart extracts but only in the presence of succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stern et al., 1953</xref>), whilst AcAc and β-OHB synthesis was seen in isolated rat heart mitochondria respiring with pyruvate and malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">LaNoue et al., 1970</xref>).</p><p>The conversion of AcAc to β-OHB by BDH1 is dependent on NADH availability, and accordingly was found to be increased in the isolated perfused rat heart under anoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Opie and Owen, 1975</xref>). Reduction of AcAc was seen in sheep heart homogenates treated with succinate and the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor amytal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Krebs et al., 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kulka et al., 1961</xref>), and complete reduction of AcAc to β-OHB was reported in isolated rat heart mitochondria respiring with succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schönfeld et al., 2010</xref>).

We found that β-OHB accumulated to 23.9 nmol per mg myocardial tissue and also appeared in the coronary effluent. Following reperfusion, β-OHB was absent from the perfusate and was greatly lowered in the myocardium, probably as a result of oxidation. This production of β-OHB was enhanced following inhibition of LDH. Whilst most myocardial β-OHB appeared to result from reverse flux through SCOT, we unexpectedly found that at least some β-OHB production occurred via the production of HMG-CoA by HMGCS2. Indeed, inhibition of HMGCS2 lowered myocardial levels of HMG-CoA and suppressed β-OHB in the ischaemic heart despite an apparent increase in reverse flux through SCOT. This was associated with enhanced functional recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion and protection of mitochondrial respiratory function in the post-ischaemic rat heart.</p><p>Our approach exploited the combination of mass spectrometry and Langendorff perfusion, which allowed a tight control of metabolic substrate supply to the heart, which is unattainable in vivo. Mass spectrometry allowed us to detect β-OHB and neighbouring metabolites, under aerobically perfused and ischaemic conditions. Use of the LDH inhibitor sodium oxamate allowed us to investigate the implications of enhanced glucose-derived acetyl-CoA upon candidate pathways. We do, however, urge caution when interpreting some of the results of our experiments with LDH inhibition, particularly regarding the functional recovery from I/R, since this is likely to be more substantially influenced by impaired lactate production than by changes in β-OHB or associated metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Griffin et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, despite the high concentration of sodium oxamate used here being in line with that used by others previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Yoshioka et al., 2012</xref>), it is such that we cannot exclude osmotic effects. The use of hymeglusin allowed us to probe the unexpected finding that flux through HMGCS2 during ischaemia supports the production of HMG-CoA and consequently of β-OHB. We cannot definitively exclude off-target effects of hymeglusin, though we are not aware of any at the concentration used here. Moreover, our data showing accumulation of acetoacetyl-CoA coupled with depletion of HMG-CoA indicates that the pathway was inhibited. Hymeglusin treatment itself appeared to increase the reverse flux through SCOT during ischaemia, as evidenced by decreased succinate and increased succinyl-CoA levels relative to untreated hearts. Whilst our results therefore suggest that both SCOT- and HMGCS2-supported pathways contribute to the ischaemic accumulation of β-OHB, they do not indicate the relative contributions of each, and flux through SCOT may be the more significant route.</p><p>Our findings add to those of others who have previously reported ketone body production by the ex vivo perfused heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Comte et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Opie and Owen, 1975</xref>), in myocardial extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Stern et al., 1953</xref>) and in isolated cardiac mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">LaNoue et al., 1970</xref>), and support the notion that ketone body production may represent a spillover pathway for excess acetyl-CoA. Whilst it has not been conclusively demonstrated, a number of studies have suggested that myocardial ketone body production may also occur under hypoxic/ischaemic conditions in vivo. In studies of dogs, hypoxaemia resulted in enhanced β-OHB:acetoacetate and net myocardial acetoacetate production in some animals, whilst this was not seen in any non-hypoxaemic dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Whereat and Chan, 1972</xref>). Notably, those animals exhibiting net acetoacetate production had arterial lactate concentrations in excess of 5 mM, suggesting a high degree of hypoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Whereat and Chan, 1972</xref>). The same investigators also reported net cardiac acetoacetate production in one dog following myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Whereat and Chan, 1972</xref>). More recently, it has been reported that serum levels of β-OHB and acetoacetate were found to increase systemically in human patients following balloon-induced coronary ischaemia during elective coronary angioplasty, which was suggested to reflect the early phase of metabolic adjustment during ischaemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Di Marino et al., 2018</xref>). Meanwhile, myocardial β-OHB utilisation was suppressed during myocardial ischaemia in patients experiencing angina-like chest pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arima et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Efflux of β-OHB is seen shortly after the onset of ischaemia, and its production is therefore likely to result from altered substrate availability and/or post-translational modifications rather than altered gene expression. Acetyl-CoA and succinate accumulate during ischaemia, while mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) are also known to be produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2003</xref>). Each of these intermediates may post-translationally modify proteins, and thereby support ketone flux. As such, this could be an interesting avenue to further elucidate mechanisms.</p><p>An unexpected finding of our study was that at least some of the β-OHB produced in the ischaemic heart occurred via HMGCS2. HMGCS2 is expressed in human heart, albeit at a lower level than in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mascaró et al., 1995</xref>), and whilst activity levels of HMGCS2 and HMG-CoA lyase are, respectively, 20-fold and 6.8-fold higher in adult rat liver than heart, activity in the myocardium exceeds that in brain or skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McGarry and Foster, 1976</xref>). Although the role of cardiac HMGCS2 is unknown, it is transiently expressed at a high level in neonatal mouse heart before declining by postnatal day 23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Talman et al., 2018</xref>) and has been shown to be upregulated in type 1 diabetes following streptozotocin (STZ) treatment in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2017</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shukla et al., 2017</xref>), as well as in mice when fasted or on a ketogenic diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wentz et al., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, a recent preliminary report suggested that heart-specific overexpression of HMGCS2 resulted in increased cardiac β-OHB, along with mitochondrial swelling and systolic impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Zenimaru et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In line with this latter report, we found that inhibition of HMGCS2 was associated with protection of mitochondrial respiratory capacity in the post-ischaemic rat heart and enhanced functional recovery from ischaemia/reperfusion. This protection is unlikely to arise as a direct result of decreased β-OHB availability; ketone body administration has been shown to be neuroprotective during ischaemic stroke injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yin et al., 2015</xref>) and during renal ischaemia/reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tajima et al., 2019</xref>). Whilst the basis for this protection remains unclear, our findings do hint at a number of possible mechanisms. The increased availability of acetyl-CoA may be protective in supporting Krebs cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation upon reperfusion. Alternatively, the inhibition of HMGCS2 supported greater reverse flux through SCOT, thereby lowering the ischaemic accumulation of succinate. Succinate accumulation during ischaemia is associated with ROS production via reverse electron transfer (RET) to complex I as the succinate becomes oxidised upon reperfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Schönfeld et al., 2010</xref>). It has also been demonstrated previously that reduction of this ischaemic succinate accumulation via dimethyl malonate administration protects against I/R injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chouchani et al., 2014</xref>). Inhibition of HMGCS2 may therefore represent a novel cardioprotective strategy, perhaps of particular relevance to the diabetic heart, where sensitivity to ischaemia/reperfusion injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Paulson, 1997</xref>) and, at least in the case of type 1 diabetes, expression of HMGCS2 are both increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cook et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Shukla et al., 2017</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Ketone body accumulation occurs in the heart under conditions of low-flow ischaemia, and this is mediated at least in part by HMG-CoA synthase. Inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase by hymeglusin reduces the accumulation of β-OHB during ischaemia, and protects both cardiac contractile function and mitochondrial respiratory capacity against damage mediated by I/R. This finding sheds new light on the role of HMG-CoA synthase in the heart, and provides context for studies reporting altered cardiac ketone body metabolism under pathological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus Norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wistar Rat</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">Strain Code 003; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_13508588">RGD_13508588</ext-link></td><td valign="top">300–350 g</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Hymeglusin</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">SML0301</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="top">Sodium Oxamate</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">O2751</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All experiments conformed to UK Home Office guidelines under the Animals in Scientific Procedures Act and were approved by the University of Cambridge Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Committee.</p><p>Power calculations were performed using a ‘known’ mean of 1, an ‘expected’ mean of 0.8, and a sigma of 0.18 for a significance of 0.05, generating a suggested sample size of 7 for the initial experiments.

Hearts were randomly assigned into the experimental groups for each experiment. A 1 ml coronary effluent sample was obtained every 4 min throughout each protocol and frozen for metabolic analysis. Two different perfusion protocols were used, which differed in the degree of ischaemic insult.</p><p>First we used a relatively mild ischaemic protocol to investigate ketone metabolism under conditions which did not induce overt functional impairment upon reperfusion. The perfusate was KH buffer containing 11 mM glucose and 0.4 mM equivalent triglyceride in the form of Intralipid. The perfusion protocol entailed a 32-min aerobic perfusion followed by 20 min of low-flow ischaemia (0.56 ml.min<sup>−1</sup>.gww<sup>−1</sup>) and 20 min of reperfusion.

Respiratory capacities were assessed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Horscroft et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, malate (2 mM) and octanoyl carnitine (0.2 mM) were added initially to stimulate LEAK respiration, followed by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (5 mM) to stimulate β-oxidation-supported OXPHOS, then pyruvate (20 mM) for a comparison of substrate preference, glutamate (10 mM) to support the N-pathway via complex I, cytochrome <italic>c</italic> (10 µM) to assess outer mitochondrial membrane integrity, succinate (10 mM) to activate the S-pathway via complex II, and rotenone (0.5 µM) to inhibit complex I.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Measured values were compared to those in pre-ischaemic or non-ischaemic control groups as appropriate using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. To assess changes in functional recovery, the average RPP across 4-min sections was compared to the same 4-min section in control hearts using a two-tailed Student’s t-test. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Supporting data</title><p>Data from this study is available at the University of Cambridge Online Data Repository <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.72871">https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.72871</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>Ross T.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Matthias Barton as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Heinrich Taegtmeyer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and this letter is to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Previous perfusion studies (Comte 1997, Opie and Owen 1975, as referred to by the author) have reported a net ketone body production in isolated perfused heats. In these experiments, both glucose and fatty acids were present as substrates. Likewise, the initial studies in the present study showed β-OHB accumulation and efflux during ischemia in heart perfused in the presence of both glucose and lipids (triglycerides). In the follow-up studies (using enzyme inhibitors) however, the heart perfusions were done with only glucose. It has been described that both during low-flow ischemia and reperfusion, the reliance on fatty acid oxidation rate are elevated in the heart. This is due to elevated circulating fatty acids and/or altered (less) inhibition of fatty acid oxidation. A brief discussion should be provided on why metabolite levels in inhibitor studies were not assessed pre-ischemia and post reperfusion. Furthermore, the graphs should display absolute metabolite concentrations. This could also be done as a separate supplementary table, depending on the editors' preference. The cartoon figures would be easier to understand if the ketogenic and ketolytic pathways were highlighted in different colours/dashed lines, and if thiolase was represented as a bidirectional flux point.</p><p>2. Although the metabolic evaluation is thorough, it should be noted that these do not necessary relate to the flux though the different pathways. Thus, it is unclear why efflux of β-OHB from the heart was not measured when inhibitors were used. Would this not have helped the interpretation of the effect of the inhibitors?</p><p>3. Figure 4 and 5 are helpful. However, is is unclear why metabolites that show similar changes (such as acetoacetate and succinyl-CoA) are not indicated by the same arrow and font size.</p><p>4. The authors highlight that &quot;urge caution&quot; should be taken when interpreting results using the LDH inhibitor (oxamate) due the use of a relatively high dose. Could you not have used a lower dose and/or an alternative intervention?</p><p>5.

Here we found that inclusion of Intralipid in the perfusion buffer did not alter cardiac β-OHB accumulation, compared with hearts perfused with glucose alone. Moreover, in the experiment using oxamate to inhibit LDH, we used glucose as the sole substrate in order to maximise glycolytic flux and enhance acetyl-CoA availability. We have clarified this decision in the revised Methods section (page 16, paragraph 3).</p><p>Pre and post ischaemic metabolite levels were not assessed in the inhibitor studies as we did not find β-OHB to be present in either pre-ischaemic or post-ischemic hearts, and as such it was not possible to normalise to this. We have clarified this decision in the revised Methods section (page 17, paragraph 3).</p><p>We agree with the Reviewers, that it would have been desirable to see absolute metabolite concentrations, however since mass spectrometry is semi-quantitative, and the relationship between peak size and concentration differs between metabolites and between sample plates, absolute quantification requires addition of standards for each metabolite. We did include a standard ladder for β-OHB in the initial experiments as detailed in the methods section, however to do this for each metabolite, each LC method and each set of experiments would have been prohibitively expensive. Moreover, for some metabolites, a lack of stability may have affected comparisons between the standard ladder and sample concentrations, as the standards would not have been processed by the same method as metabolites extracted from the LV tissue.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments on the figures and have implemented the changes suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We felt it was important to express the limitations of this particular experiment in our Discussion, particularly regarding the functional data since impaired lactate production would likely also have influenced recovery. We are grateful that the Reviewers recognised our openness in this regard. We agree that it would have been desirable to use an alternative intervention or lower dose, but with limited alternatives available we selected this approach on the basis of previously published work. Despite the limitations, however, we do feel that the results of this experiment were informative, in that the dose of oxamate used did enhance acetyl-CoA availability during ischaemia as we intended, and this resulted in enhanced downstream accumulation of β-OHB supporting this as a candidate pathway.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
